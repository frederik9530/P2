      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today. Thanks as always for following along with us and be sure to read Kevin Mitchell\u2019s full match report here. Here\u2019s a look at the final stats from today\u2019s final. In the end it was Williams\u2019 erratic first serve, which she was only able to get in 34 of 77 times (44%), which did her in. Andreescu breaks in 12th game of second set! Second set: Williams 3-6, 5-7 Andreescu Williams falls behind love-15 on another unforced error off the backhand, but pounds a forehand winner early in the next point for 15-all. Now a massive return winner by Andreescu pulls her within two points of the finish line at 15-30. Another backhand unforced error by Serena makes it 15-40 and Andreescu will have two more championship points. Williams saves the first with her ninth ace of the match, a 101mph tracer out wide. But Andreescu is able to rip a forehand return winner down the line on the second to win the match and the championship! She drops her racket at the baseline before walking to the net, shaking hands with Williams, then collapsing supine onto the service court. Second set: *Williams 3-6, 5-6 Andreescu (*denotes next server) Andreescu wins the first point early behind a big first serve, but then makes her third double-fault of the day for 15-all. Another early winner for Andreescu is punctuated with a \u201cCome on!\u201d followed by a 103mph ace down the middle. Williams pulls one back for 40-30 when Andreescu makes her 17th unforced error (compared to 17 winners), but she nets a backhand on the next point and the Canadian has managed to steady herself going into the changeover. Second set: Williams 3-6, 5-5 Andreescu* (*denotes next server) Williams serving to stay in the tournament. She opens with her seventh ace of the match, crunching an 118mph offering down the middle. But she follows with a double fault for 15-all. Now a 119mph ace for Williams, also down the middle. And now another double fault for 30-all! No points yet played in what could be the final game of the tournament for both. Now Andreescu is jammed on a second serve and frames the return, giving Serena a game point. And Williams holds when Andreescu sends a forehand return long. Bedlam inside Ashe! Four games on the trot for Williams and Andreescu needs to sort it out. Williams breaks in ninth game of second set! Second set: *Williams 3-6, 4-5 Andreescu (*denotes next server) Oh boy. Andreescu mixes in a pair of forehand unforced errors at the most inopportune time to fall behind love-30 as pandemonium breaks out between points inside Arthur Ashe Stadium. Now Williams hits a forehand volley winner down the love for love-40 and she will have three points to break and get back on serve in the second set! And she needs only one! Andreescu goes wide with a forehand down the line and we\u2019re back on level terms in the second! Second set: Williams 3-6, 3-5 Andreescu* (*denotes next server) Williams gives the crowd a thrill in racing ahead 40-love, inluding a 107mph ace down the middle. Andreescu pulls one back but Williams closes it with a 103mph service winner out wide. A massive standing ovation for Williams at Ashe ... but Andreescu will now serve again for the title. Williams breaks in eighth game of second set! Second set: *Williams 3-6, 2-5 Andreescu (*denotes next server) Andreescu falls behind love-15 but Andreescu raips a pair of winners and she\u2019s two points from the title. Williams than wins a highly entertaining 10-stroke rally to push it to 30-all, but Andreescu answers with a big serve to force a championship point. Williams saves it by forcing her opponent into an error with a big forehand then does it again for a break-point chance. But she tries a cheeky drop shot early in the rally and puts it into the net for deuce. Oracene looks stressed. An extended rally on the next point ends with Williams pounding a forehand winner into the corner and she will have another break-point chance. Strangely, the lights have just gone out over Ashe. Yet they continue and Williams is able to break with a big backhand from the baseline. Andreescu breaks in sixth game of second set! Second set: Williams 3-6, 1-5 Andreescu* (*denotes next server) As big as service game as it gets for Williams, but she falls behind love-15 and then 15-40. The Canadian teenager is five points from the championship. Williams saves one of the two break points, but is forced into an error on the second and Andreescu will serve for the championship. Second set: *Williams 3-6, 1-4 Andreescu (*denotes next server) Andreescu holds easily and it\u2019s back on Serena\u2019s racket. Andreescu breaks in fourth game of second set! Second set: *Williams 3-6, 1-3 Andreescu* (*denotes next server) Andreescu makes an unforced error on the forehand side, only her ninth of the day (compared to 13 winners), but the Canadian answers with two quick points for 15-30. Williams has missed nine first serves in a row. Williams then responds with a backhand winner, followed by a 119mph ace down the middle for game point. But now Williams makes her fifth double fault for deuce! Now another unforced error by Williams gives Andreescu a point to break right back ... and Andreescu rips a forehand into the corner that Williams can\u2019t get back in play. Oh dear. Andreescu is back ahead a break. Williams breaks in third game of second set! Second set: *Williams 3-6, 1-2 Andreescu (*denotes next server) Just when it seems Andreescu is about to race away, she double-faults at 30-all to give Williams only her second-break point chance of the afternoon. Andreescu saved the first back in the opening set with an ace; let\u2019s see what she does here. And Andreescu saves it with a backhand early in the point Williams can\u2019t return. Williams then hits a volley winner to set up another break chance but Andreescu saves that one, too. Now a third break-chance for Williams and the crowd seems like it\u2019s ready to burst. And WIlliams stops in the middle of a baseline rally to challenge an Andreescu groundstroke but it\u2019s ruled and it\u2019s a third break point saved. A big return by Williams sets up a fourth break-point opportunity ... and Williams finally breaks with a forehand netcord winner! Signs of life from the 23-time major champion! Andreescu breaks in second game of second set! Second set: Williams 3-6, 0-2 Andreescu* (*denotes next server) A big service game for Williams and she opens it with her 15th, 16th and 17th unforced errors of the afternoon, all off the forehand side. Now she double-faults. Williams didn\u2019t make a first serve in the game and now Andreescu has taken an early break lead in the second. Second set: *Williams 3-6, 0-1 Andreescu (*denotes next server) The biggest issue for Williams is a first-serve percentage that\u2019s been falling precipitously throughout the match. It was down to 21-of-42 (50%) at the end of the first set. She needs to get that number up. Andreescu is serving to open the second. She races out to 30-love, is pushed to 30-all, then pounds and overhand winner followed by an unreturnable serve for the hold, punctuated by a \u201cYes, let\u2019s go! Come on!\u201d Andreescu breaks in ninth game of first set! First set: Williams 3-6 Andreescu Andreescu pushes Williams to 30-all and then deuce, then rips a forehand winner early in the point for a set point on the American\u2019s serve. A big moment here. Williams faults ... and then hits the net for a double fault! Oh dear! Williams has been broken and has dropped the first set to the Canadian teenager! First set: *Williams 3-5 Andreescu (*denotes next server) Andreescu opens this crucial eighth game with her third of the day, a 109mph ace down the pipe. Williams rips off two quick points before Andreescu answers for 30-all. Now Williams pounces on return for her first break-point chance of the match at 30-40 ... but Andreescu coolly crunches a 103mph ace out wide to brush it aside, followed by an unreturnable serve than a forehand winner from the baseline to hold. An emphatic response by the teenager! Now Williams will serve to stay in the opening set. First set: Williams 3-4 Andreescu* (*denotes next server) Williams wins the first two points but Andreescu, who\u2019s returning beautifully and with confidence in taking the ball early, pushes it to 30-all. Now Andreescu gets the best of Williams on an eight-shot rally, pressing Williams\u2019 backhand with flat groundstrokes and the slice until Williams sends a shot wide, and the Canadian will have another break-point chance. Williams saves it with a 106mph ace down the middle but another unforced error off the backhand gives Andreescu another chance for a double-break lead. This time Williams saves it when Andreescu dumps a backhand into the net, but the teenager stakes yet another break chance when Williams misfires again off the backhand. Break point No 3 in this game and Williams saves it with a forehand winner! Now an Andreescu forehand winner sets up a fourth break point and Williams saves it with a 107mph ace down the middle. Yet another forehand winner for Andreescu stakes a fifth break point and Williams saves that one when she forces Andreescu into an error with a crisp backhand. Finally Williams earns a game point in the 15th point of this marathon and holds with a forehand winner in the 16th. Williams saved five break points in that game, but she remains a break behind her Canadian opponent. First set: *Williams 2-4 Andreescu (*denotes next server) Andreescu continues to target the backhand side and Williams continues to miss them, winning the first two points of the game. The Canadian is 9-for-11 (82%) on first-serve points won, a promising sign early and a number she\u2019ll need to keep up. Williams rips a backhand winner down the line for 30-15, then Andreescu makes her first double fault of the day for 30-all. But the teenager answers with a 111mph ace and an unreturnable serve to hold. First set: Williams 2-3 Andreescu* (*denotes next server) Williams hits an overhead winner at the net and crunches a 105mph ace down the middle on her way to another commanding hold, but she\u2019s still playing from behind here in the opener. First set: *Williams 1-3 Andreescu (*denotes next server) Andreescu falls behind love-15 on her serve, but rattles off four quick points for the comfortable hold. Williams chips in her seventh and eighth unforced errors. She looks every bit as composed before this pro-Williams crowd of more than 23,000 as she has throughout her run to today\u2019s final. First set: Williams 1-2 Andreescu* (*denotes next server) Williams gets the crowd into it with three straight winners for 40-love. Andreescu pulls one back when Williams makes another unforced error off the backhand, but the American answers with a forehand winner at the net to get on the board. First set: *Williams 0-2 Andreescu (*denotes next server) Andreescu backs up the break in convincing fashion, including a 102mph ace out wide. Williams\u2019s backhand misfiring a touch early on. Andreescu breaks in first game of first set! First set: Williams 0-1 Andreescu* (*denotes next server) Andreescu won toss and interestingly elects to receive. Williams races ahead to 40-15, but then makes unforced errors off the backhand then the forehand for deuce. Williams then double-faults ... then double-faults again to gift the Canadian the break in her opening service game! The players have emerged from the tunnel. They\u2019re going through their warm-ups and we should be under way shortly! Here\u2019s a look at how today\u2019s finalists compare. The nearly 19 years between Andreescu and Williams is the largest age difference ever in a women\u2019s grand slam final, eclipsing the previous mark set by 1991 US Open finalists Martina Navratilova and Monica Seles, who were born 17 years and 45 days apart. The pair met once before at last month\u2019s Toronto final when Williams retired with a back injury trailing 1-3 after just 19 minutes. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s US Open women\u2019s final between Serena Williams and Bianca Andreescu. It\u2019s a cracker of a championship match between the six-time US Open champion, who\u2019s bidding for a 24th major title to tie Margaret Court atop the all-time leaderboard, and the hottest young player on the WTA tour, who is aiming to become the Canadian woman to win a grand slam in the Open era and the first teenage major champion since Maria Sharapova at the 2006 US Open. We\u2019re a little more than a half hour from the start of today\u2019s match. Plenty more to come between now and then! Bryan will be here shortly. Here\u2019s some pre-game reading:",

It was her first slam final, the first time in four attempts she\u2019d gone past the second round, and she became the first Canadian to win a major when, after an hour and 40 minutes that seemed much longer, she brought the drama to a close with a forehand into empty space that validated the 6-3, 7-5 scoreline.

Now look at it. We\u2019re sitting in a room here full of journalists. It\u2019s unbelievable. \u201cI was told I would never make it into first-team football, that I\u2019d never play for England and that women\u2019s football would never be professional and now I\u2019m sitting here in St George\u2019s Park wearing a Tottenham Hotspur shirt \u2013 so happy days.\u201d Having had to travel to the United States in search of professionalism in her youth, Davison is excited by the future that exists now for young players. \u201cIt\u2019s biased isn\u2019t it, but this is probably the most exciting league in the world,\u201d she says. \u201cYou look at the players that we\u2019re bringing over, big players who are some of the best in the world. \u201cI went to America and I went and played with Marta, but now everyone wants to come here. It\u2019s setting a benchmark. America set a benchmark for us. We\u2019re now doing the same. Commercially, it\u2019s just getting bigger and bigger.\u201d Now she is a part of moulding the future. Having coached for 10 years, she runs sessions for elite kids \u2013 boys and girls \u2013 including the children of her former teammate Katie Chapman. She can see a better generation arriving. \u201cThey are training more, three or four times a week, they are doing extra. We didn\u2019t do that. They are getting more exposure, more information. The talent is already there and then you\u2019re getting the development, more touches on the ball, you\u2019re just going to get a better player.\u201d She had to stop playing with boys eventually, but kept playing \u201csecretly for a long time with my friends on the local astro. That gave me the traits of my game because you can\u2019t just sprint past a guy because he\u2019s quicker so I had to use trickery. That\u2019s moulded me as a player. That\u2019s what I\u2019m like, beating people with trickery and not just speed.\u201d",

The FA\u2019s technical director, Les Reed, has just labelled Aidy Boothroyd\u2019s players arrogant, though Maddison thinks overconfident might be a better term. \u201cWe went into the tournament trying to win it and we were out after two games,\u201d he says. \u201cLooking back we might think we were overconfident, though it didn\u2019t seem like that at the time because we worked very hard. We probably did think we were one of the best teams in the tournament and with the talent we had, I don\u2019t feel stupid saying that. But we had a player sent off in the first match then lost to Romania in a must-win game. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a worse feeling in football, to be honest, but as Gareth Southgate keeps saying, you have to learn from experiences like that. \u201cWhat did I learn? That tournament football is different. It\u2019s important to think about game management, because you don\u2019t get second chances.\u201d",

But even their finest work would have not have been able to win a match without runs.

Any player who had made 211 in the first innings might have expected to get some slack: Australia had been 28 for two when he walked out on the first morning, after which he helped add the small matter of 410.</p> <p>But like a profligate mate with a thirst, his teammates were back a couple of days later wanting another bail-out. Even 196 ahead on the first innings, trouble at 16 for two gave way to worse trouble at 44 for four. England\u2019s fast bowlers were firing, the huge temporary grandstand at Old Trafford was heaving, the atmosphere was charged, and there was the feeling that the visitors could be run through.</p> <p>Not today, said Smith, as he has every other day. Where David Warner has been pinned and helpless against Stuart Broad, Smith defused every ball with apparent ease. His simple step across and block didn\u2019t take any tweaking.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/07/david-warner-new-low-stuart-broad-england-australia-ashes-cricket\">David Warner hammered to new low thanks to Broad mind games | Ali Martin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Seen from side on, Smith leans towards the bowler as he dips his knees in his preparatory stance, as though he can\u2019t quite wait for the ball to arrive and is thinking of meeting it partway. If a spinner is bowling he often skips down to do just that. Up to the tea break he calmed the situation. After it, he started taking bowlers down.</p> <p>Writing the Guardian\u2019s live blog, a lot of readers email in theories on how to dismiss him. \u201cA bouncer or two, then reverse-swing yorkers for Smith, to get him out,\u201d was a single-line missive that I received on day one.

      "bodyText": "If Australia do what they should by retaining the Ashes, and if they go on to win the series, it will feel thoroughly disingenuous to say that \u201cAustralia\u201d did any such thing. Team sports are all about crediting the collective but in this case you can\u2019t credibly do so. Australia\u2019s captain, Tim Paine, started the series with a misfired attempt at a Winston Churchill quote; he could end it more accurately with \u201cNever was so much owed by so many to so few\u201d. In this case \u201cthe few\u201d are a party of one. Three Tests would have been lost without Steve Smith\u2019s interventions, and the Test that he missed with injury was lost. Australian teams have been well beaten in England for 20 years, and in batting terms this is by far the weakest. With one change in personnel, the players eyeing a win would probably have endured a whitewash. Of course, no Test match can be won without bowlers, and Australia\u2019s interchanging squad of quicks have been tremendous. But even their finest work would have not have been able to win a match without runs. It was proven at Headingley, bowling out England for 67 but still not batting them out of the game. On the fourth day in Manchester the lone and undying hand of Smith was at it again. Any player who had made 211 in the first innings might have expected to get some slack: Australia had been 28 for two when he walked out on the first morning, after which he helped add the small matter of 410. But like a profligate mate with a thirst, his teammates were back a couple of days later wanting another bail-out. Even 196 ahead on the first innings, trouble at 16 for two gave way to worse trouble at 44 for four. England\u2019s fast bowlers were firing, the huge temporary grandstand at Old Trafford was heaving, the atmosphere was charged, and there was the feeling that the visitors could be run through. Not today, said Smith, as he has every other day. Where David Warner has been pinned and helpless against Stuart Broad, Smith defused every ball with apparent ease. His simple step across and block didn\u2019t take any tweaking. Seen from side on, Smith leans towards the bowler as he dips his knees in his preparatory stance, as though he can\u2019t quite wait for the ball to arrive and is thinking of meeting it partway. If a spinner is bowling he often skips down to do just that. Up to the tea break he calmed the situation. After it, he started taking bowlers down. Writing the Guardian\u2019s live blog, a lot of readers email in theories on how to dismiss him. \u201cA bouncer or two, then reverse-swing yorkers for Smith, to get him out,\u201d was a single-line missive that I received on day one. Top stuff. If only teams playing against him had thought of that. Jim Maxwell on Test Match Special had a similar thought when Smith got in a tangle against a full ball from Broad, squeezing out a ricochet that rolled past his leg stump. \u201cThat\u2019s the spot to bowl to him, I suppose,\u201d said Maxwell. \u201cJust keep bowling yorkers.\u201d The next ball, Broad attempted a repeat. It was on-driven to perfection: wide of the mid-on and straight of the midwicket, trailing the fielder behind it into the fence. Just keep bowling there indeed, Smith might have muttered. Please do. Watching Smith against England now, it seems foregone. He cannot be stopped. On the fourth day at Old Trafford he knew a declaration was coming, so there was more expansiveness to his game. He swept Jack Leach hard, slapped and glided Jofra Archer, whipped and pulled Broad. The careful accumulator of the first innings rattled up 82 from 91 in the second. When time was short and he really hit out, he gave up a catch in the deep short of his hundred. But that was the only way that England could get him: when Smith decided that he was willing to risk being got. He now has 671 runs in the series from five hits; the collective of Warner, Cameron Bancroft, Marcus Harris, Usman Khawaja, Travis Head and Matthew Wade have 683 from 38. Smith has faced 998 balls. He saved a disaster and then set up the win at Edgbaston, staved off a match-losing collapse to draw at Lord\u2019s, and has set up Old Trafford in prime position.

The ugly collective picture of the techno-elites that emerges from the Epstein scandal reveals them as a bunch of morally bankrupt opportunists. To treat their ideas as genuine but wrong is too generous; the only genuine thing about them is their fakeness. Big tech and its apologists do produce the big thoughts \u2013 alas, mostly accidental byproducts of them chasing the big bucks.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t meant to be that way. Back in 1991, John Brockman \u2013 the world\u2019s most successful digital impresario, and, until recently, my literary agent \u2013 was touting the emergence of the \u201cthird culture\u201d that would finally replace the technophobic literary intellectuals with those coming from the world of science and technology. \u201cThe emergence of the third culture introduces new modes of intellectual discourse and reaffirms the pre-eminence of America in the realm of important ideas,\u201d wrote Brockman in a <a href=\"https://www.edge.org/conversation/john_brockman-the-third-culture\">much-discussed essay</a>.</p> <p>Brockman, who would later connect Epstein to dozens of world-famous scientists, most of them his clients, made it seem as if it were people like him who built this \u201cthird culture\u201d \u2013 out of their perceptive genius. The cardinal error of such analysis, however, lies in its tendency to mistake structural transformations of global capitalism for zeitgeisty trends in the history of ideas.</p> <p>Thus, Brockman\u2019s \u201cnew modes of intellectual discourse\u201d were mostly the result of technology companies moving away from large and soulless cold war military contracts and on to the world of funky personal computing. Apple, with Steve Jobs as its chief countercultural evangelist, needed the consumerist mysticism of \u201cthe third culture\u201d; IBM and Hewlett-Packard, stuck in the 1950s mentality, did not. Likewise, the \u201cpre-eminence of America in the realm of important ideas\u201d was, above all, the outcome of its dominance in the economic and military realms, weakening the efforts of other countries to create their own vibrant alternatives to Hollywood or Silicon Valley.</p> <p>There was no better original exponent of the \u201cthird culture\u201d than Nicholas Negroponte, the founder of the MIT Media Lab and a new kind of applied intellectual, full of big ideas on technical subjects. The lab was ahead of its time in understanding that the industry and the government alike needed cooler, more interactive technology that was not provided by the traditional cold war contractors.</p> <p>Everything else followed suit. Thus, Negroponte became a speaker at the very first Technology, Entertainment, Design conference (the famous Ted Talks) in 1984, which, a few decades later, emerged as the pre-eminent promoter of the \u201cthird culture\u201d: no politics, no conflict, no ideology \u2013 just science, technology, and pragmatic problem-solving.

Not surprisingly, his famed literary dinners \u2013 held during the Ted Conference, they allowed Epstein (who kept Brockman\u2019s Edge Foundation on a retainer) to mingle with scientists and fellow billionaires \u2013 were mostly empty of serious content.</p> <p>As Brockman himself put it after one such dinner in 2004, \u201clast year we tried \u2018The Science Dinner\u2019. Everyone yawned. So this year, it\u2019s back to the money-sex-power thing with \u2018The Billionaires\u2019 Dinner\u2019.\u201d Was \u201cthe money-sex-power thing\u201d that very potent \u201cnew mode of intellectual discourse\u201d promised by the \u201cthird culture\u201d? If so, we\u2019d rather pass.</p> <p>In attendance at one such dinner, in 1999, was a young Japanese American by the name of Joi Ito; also present were Richard Saul Wurman, the original founder of the Ted Conference, Jeff Bezos, and, among all the other billionaires, Jeffrey Epstein. A godson of Timothy Leary and a college drop-out, Ito would eventually lead the Media Lab, interview Obama, write a popular technology book (another Brockman client), and join 20 different boards, including those of such prestigious institutions as the New York Times, the MacArthur Foundation, and the Knight Foundation.</p> <p>Ito was to the \u201cthird culture\u201d of the 2000s what Negroponte was to its 1980s version. Whereas Negroponte has always projected an aura of aristocracy and privilege \u2013 coming from a very wealthy Greek family, he has recently prided himself on being on first-name terms with 80% of billionaires \u2013 Ito is your typical startup disruptor, a disgruntled ex-manager of a nightclub in Japan, who, somehow, reinvented himself as a \u201cthird culture\u201d intellectual.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Can we still trust what the intellectuals of the 'third culture' actually have to say, given what they have to sell?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, much like at Brockman\u2019s billionaire dinners, there\u2019s not much content to be found in Ito\u2019s work: for the most part, it\u2019s just techno-blabbery mixed with a heavy dose of futuristic jargon. But it doesn\u2019t matter. Under the \u201cthird culture\u201d, ideas serve, primarily, as door-openers. All that MIT cared about was that Ito\u2019s ideas supported his networks, his fundraising skills, and his ability to get donors like Epstein to write fat checks.</p> <p>Is it so surprising, then, that when a colleague cautioned Ito against meeting Epstein \u2013 who used to list his interests as \u201cscience and pussy\u201d \u2013 Ito described him as \u201creally fascinating\u201d? Brockman, for all his realism about low intellectual standards of the tech community, also couldn\u2019t resist Epstein\u2019s charms, describing him, in an email to me, as \u201cextremely bright and interesting\u201d.</p> <p>If the \u201cthird culture\u201d is so much more sophisticated than its predecessors, how come most of its card-carrying members \u2013 famed scientists-cum-brands, courtesy of the Brockman empire \u2013 got caught up in the Epstein mess? It\u2019s not uncommon for intellectuals to serve as useful idiots to the rich and the powerful, but, under the \u201cthird culture\u201d, this reads like a job requirement.</p> <p>Are the costs of living with this culture \u2013 eg the prostitution of intellectual activity at \u201cbillionaire dinners\u201d\u2013 worth it? And can we still trust what the leading intellectuals of the \u201cthird culture\u201d actually have to say, given, also, what they have to sell?</p> <p>The answers to these questions are self-evident. And yet, while it\u2019s easy to attack the rotten apples such as Ito or Negroponte, a more radical transformative agenda should ask for more: close the Media Lab, disband the Ted Talks, refuse the money of tech billionaires, boycott agents like Brockman. Without such drastic changes, the powerful bullshit-industrial complex that is the \u201cthird culture\u201d will continue unharmed, giving cover to the next Epstein.</p> <ul> <li><p>Evgeny Morozov is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

Brockman, for all his realism about low intellectual standards of the tech community, also couldn\u2019t resist Epstein\u2019s charms, describing him, in an email to me, as \u201cextremely bright and interesting\u201d. If the \u201cthird culture\u201d is so much more sophisticated than its predecessors, how come most of its card-carrying members \u2013 famed scientists-cum-brands, courtesy of the Brockman empire \u2013 got caught up in the Epstein mess? It\u2019s not uncommon for intellectuals to serve as useful idiots to the rich and the powerful, but, under the \u201cthird culture\u201d, this reads like a job requirement. Are the costs of living with this culture \u2013 eg the prostitution of intellectual activity at \u201cbillionaire dinners\u201d\u2013 worth it? And can we still trust what the leading intellectuals of the \u201cthird culture\u201d actually have to say, given, also, what they have to sell? The answers to these questions are self-evident. And yet, while it\u2019s easy to attack the rotten apples such as Ito or Negroponte, a more radical transformative agenda should ask for more: close the Media Lab, disband the Ted Talks, refuse the money of tech billionaires, boycott agents like Brockman. Without such drastic changes, the powerful bullshit-industrial complex that is the \u201cthird culture\u201d will continue unharmed, giving cover to the next Epstein.

Diana describes the rebels as \u201cdespicable\u201d and is happy that Sandbach, Clarke et al have been purged. \u201cThese are the people I call grey people,\u201d says Peter. \u201cI don\u2019t like them. I don\u2019t think they should be allowed back in.\u201d Most Conservative voters I speak to in Tarporley express the belief that Johnson is doing a good job in difficult circumstances. The fact that he has forced out MPs for doing the same as he did, by voting against the government, is seen not as a sign of hypocrisy but rather as a mark of strength. \u201cWhether or not one agrees with the methodology,\u201d says one, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s the way forward.\u201d Just two Tories veer from whole-hearted endorsement of Johnson. Mandy Nickson, a jewellery shop owner, says it\u2019s \u201call a mess\u201d. She is keen for the country to get out of the EU but she\u2019s ambivalent about the prime minister\u2019s strategy. Retired businesswoman Elizabeth Lindop is the sole voice of outright dissent. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that the MPs were expelled,\u201d she says. She thinks the Conservatives, as she puts it, have stabbed themselves in the foot. \u201cThey don\u2019t have enough MPs for a majority but they\u2019re getting rid of some.\u201d As a consequence, she says she will no longer vote Conservative. But the unavoidable fact remains that in places such as Tarporley there is an increasingly desperate desire among many voters to leave the EU as soon as possible. Although few can articulate the nature of their animus towards the European project, they are all eloquent in venting their frustration that the referendum has not been honoured. Among them there is a common belief that, once the UK is out of the EU, politics will return to a measure of sanity. But at the moment the rift both within the Tory party and the country at large feels too wide, and almost any resolution too divisive, for that to happen. As Lindop says: \u201cThese are strange times.\u201d And if the past week is anything to go by, they\u2019re bound to get stranger.",

      "bodyText": "So that\u2019s it for the launch, and the countdown to Christmas is ON. Thank you so much for joining in down below - I\u2019ll be back here in two weeks, gravy tanned and rested from Spain and ready to push through for the rest of the Strictly season. In the meantime you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens, so feel free to swing by and say hello. Have a good weekend! Hx I think this year is going to be notable for the absence of ringers - right now most of them look like their legs have been put on backwards. See? Be careful what you wish for. Based on this performance I\u2019ve got a good feeling about Karim with Amy, Chris and Karen and Alex and Neil \u2013 let me know what your Strictly gut is telling you in the comment box below. All that remains is the final group dance! It\u2019s time for our celebs to bust some moves for the first time, so we can if any of them have any semblance of rhythm. This is always awkward and terrible, but for me it officially marks the beginning of Strictly season so let\u2019s overcome the cringe and embrace it with hip-thrusting gusto. Apparently Jamie and Karim already have a special handshake. Knowing the outcome of this bromance makes it all the more tragic. So all our couples are now paired! Apologies for the lack of insight into this year\u2019s celebs \u2013 I don\u2019t watch soaps or football or YouTube or Breakfast TV, so I\u2019m somewhat at a loss. And finally JAMIE is partnered with OTI, which would have been epic had Jamie not knackered his leg. Very much hoping Oti gets another partner, because she is a goddess and I can\u2019t imagine this show without her. DEV is partnered with DIANNE, so he\u2019ll be roped into her and Joe Sugg\u2019s YouTube madness in no time. I have high hopes for these two \u2013 Dianne has proved she can unleash the inner dancer in the most awkward of men. WILL has been partnered with JANNETTE, who is married to Aljaz, who has free safari park tickets for life. Absolute win. MIKE is partnered with KATYA, no doubt as part of her \u2018do not give her a man under 50\u2019 Strictly redemption arc. Mike looks delighted and terrified in equal measure. And finally it\u2019s JAMIE LAING, who was in Made In Chelsea. I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s done other things too, but I have no idea what they are. Don\u2019t get too attached to Jamie - he was part of this pre-recorded launch show, but has since injured himself and won\u2019t actually take part. Hey, a week is a long time in a TV. Next is DEV GRIFFIN, who is a Radio 1 DJ. Whilst I may be somewhat outside their target market, I have been known to listen to his weekend show with Alice Levine, and he seems like a good egg. Next is WILL BAYLEY, who won Paralympic table tennis gold at Rio 2016, then jumped on the table in celebration and got told off. By his own admission he really can\u2019t dance, and his friends actively tell him to stop when he heads onto the dancefloor. For this alone I love him already. Time to pair up the final four men! First up is MIKE BUSHELL, who is this year\u2019s Obligatory BBC Breakfast Presenter. I know nothing about him other than there was a video of him hilariously falling into a swimming pool that briefly went viral. Oh, there it is. I feel like Mike deserves more on his CV, hopefully Strictly will provide. I just used that Paso as an opportunity to pop to the loo \u2013 was it any good? Time for a Stacey/Kevin dance interlude, just to remind us who won last year. They are now all loved up, because that\u2019s how Strictly rolls. Which leaves ANNEKA paired with KEVIN, which is unexpected and also good news \u2013 I think the nation fully expected Anneka to end up with Anton, but hopefully Kevin will help her shine. RHINO EMMA is partnered with ALJAZ, who celebrates like a man who has just secured himself free safari park tickets for life. \u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019s happier\u201d, says Tess, which is a massive lie. EMMA B has been partnered with ANTON, which is excellent news for Anton. And finally for the ladies it\u2019s ANNEKA RICE, who is the celeb I\u2019m most familiar with this year \u2013 I have fond 1980s memories of watching her be-jumpsuited rear end leap in and out of a helicopter. Have a bonus drink whenever anyone yells \u2018STOP THE CLOCK\u2019. Next up is OTHER EMMA WEYMOUTH, who is a model, chef, writer, philanthropist and Viscountess, which is QUITE the CV. She is married to the son of the joyfully bonkers Marquess of Bath, so is technically heiress to Longleat House, some lions, a heavy-duty title and possibly Centerparcs. Apparently she spends her day \u2018scrubbing a Rhino\u2019 which is the post-Gladiators story that needs to be told. Time to pair up the rest of the women! First up is EMMA BARTON, who is apparently in Eastenders. She is one of two Emmas this year, which is frankly inconsiderate for the beleaguered liveblogger who also has an Emma for a daughter. She will henceforth be known as Emma B, not to be confused with the Magic FM DJ or the Spice Girl. Time for a \u2018celebs and pros meeting for the first time!\u2019 VT. I\u2019m getting hungry, can we move this on a bit? What we\u2019ve learned from this segment is that whilst our pros can definitely dance, none of them can sing for toffee. Please don\u2019t give up your day job. Incidentally, the sleeves on Claud\u2019s jacket looks like the ventilation hose on the back of my tumble dryer. Time for a second musical interlude, courtesy of Mark Ronson and Yebba, who is a US singer and songwriter. Yebba is Abbey backwards, which is her actual name. She\u2019s also done some stuff with Ed Sheeran, and has a lovely voice. Here all series for your musical facts and trivia. And finally, and unfeasibly tall DAVID has been partnered with NADIYA, who has been in this show for a couple of years but I somehow always forget about. Didn\u2019t she dance with Davood a couple of years ago? That would explain why I might not have noticed Nadiya. CHRIS has been partnered with KAREN, who is great at the character stuff \u2013 a good pairing, I think. A very excitable KARIM is partnered with AMY, who looks delighted at the prospect of earning extra babysitting cash on weekdays. JAMES is partnered with LUBA, by virtue of him being extremely tall and Luba being slightly taller than all the other women. I think James might have hips even he hasn\u2019t discovered, and Luba is the woman to unleash them. And finally we meet DAVID JAMES, who is a former England footballer. This is everything I know about David James - if you any other interesting facts about David James, please add them to the comment box below. Time to meet CHRIS RAMSEY, who is a stand-up comedian. I\u2019m not familiar with his work, but he is apparently very funny and a very nice man, and there is absolutely no reason to compare him with that other one from last year. Next is KARIM ZEROUAL, who is a presenter on CBBC, apparently. It\u2019s been 10 years since I last watched CBBC so I\u2019ll have to take your word for it - I\u2019m assuming he will be relentlessly perky, which is never a bad thing. Apparently Karim is 19 and went to Sylvia Young\u2019s Theatre School. He also once worked on a TV show with the word \u2018dance\u2019 in the title, so he\u2019s perfect runner-up material. Time to pair up some men! First up is JAMES CRACKNELL, who is famous for rowing \u2013 both the Olympic kind, and *checks notes* possibly naked across the Atlantic with Ben Fogle. He also was part of the winning Cambridge team at the Boat Race earlier this year. A Samba to \u2018Rock The Boat\u2019 by Hues Corporation is crushingly inevitable. Time to find about a bit more about Motsi - essentially she has stellar dance credentials, an incredible wardrobe and a bucket full of sass; I love her. We now get to see the pros dance with the judges - Shirley still has ALL the moves. Bruno and Craig dancing to La Vida Loca by Ricky Martin is...quite something. But Motsi is incredible - LOVED that. I rather like the top half of Tess\u2019s dress, but the bottom half looks like it\u2019s been torn off in a horrible combine harvester incident. Why can\u2019t she wear a whole dress? Incidentally lovely to see a few new faces in the pro dancer lineup this year \u2013 Ginger Neil, Johannes and Luba are all in the starting 15 (hooray, about time etc.), whereas Gorka has been relegated to the bench (BOO). And finally ALEX has been partnered with NEIL, who looks delighted to have a partner who absolutely looks the part. The internet is a bit vague about Alex\u2019s relationship status, and Neil is newly single (bye Katya), so as the kids say, this whole partnership is a MOOD. MICHELLE is partnered with GIOVANNI, which is an incredible pairing. I have such high hopes for these two. SAFFRON has been partnered with AJ, which is an adorable coupling for the kids. AJ is 24, Saffron is 19, and I\u2019ve just realised I\u2019m older than both of them put together. WOE. CATHERINE has been paired with JOHANNES, which is a stellar first pairing for this year. I can\u2019t wait to see his routines, we\u2019ve seen snippets of his moves in the pro dances, but now he\u2019s finally centre stage. And finally in this section is ALEX SCOTT, who is a former England footballer. She won Comic Relief Strictly, which makes her the bookies\u2019 favourite until the public declares her a ringer and systematically crushes all her hopes and dreams. She\u2019s followed by MICHELLE VISAGE, who is this year\u2019s Random American. She\u2019s a judge on the US version of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, and will soon join the UK panel too. She was also briefly in a pop/dance band in the 1990s, which hopefully means she\u2019s got a few moves alongside being 100% fabulous. Next is SAFFRON BARKER, who is this year\u2019s YouTuber. After Joe Sugg last year, I\u2019m guessing this is now A Thing. I have no idea what Saffron vlogs about, but the blurb says \u201cin 2017 Saffron\u2019s book \u2018Saffron vs Real Life\u2019 reached number one on the Sunday Times bestsellers list, and her popularity has also gained her three successful homeware ranges with Primark\u201d. Wait, Primark do homeware? I\u2019ve never made it past the rainbow beach towels. Time to pair up some dancers! First up is CATHERINE TYLDESLEY, who apparently is/was in Corrie, which I haven\u2019t watched since Hilda Ogden died. She looks quite tall, so she could be paired with Aljaz or Johannes. Time to meet our Strictly stars! Full disclosure: I\u2019ve heard of three of them this year, which is an all-time low. However it\u2019s reasonable to assume they\u2019ll all be our best friends by Christmas, so let\u2019s go with it. Ooh I\u2019d forgotten we have new judge this year! Darcey has swanned off into the sunset with her Pat Butcher earring collection, to be replaced by professional dancer and Strictly Germany judge Motsi Mabuse. Her being Oti\u2019s sister has caused much carping about favouritism blah blah blah, which is of course nonsense because they\u2019re both professional dancers and also not 14 years old. Motsi\u2019s launch frock is an absolute winner. I already love her. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in a navy velour coffin lining, Claudia in wet-look scarlet. OKAY. Much as I love a pro dance, can we just get on with it now? If this intro goes on much longer I\u2019ll be putting the Christmas decorations up. Time for highlights from the Red Carpet launch event. Everyone\u2019s overwhelmed and very excited. Could this medley be any more camptastic? Kylie emerging from a giant glitterball, Love At First Sight, Better The Devil You Know, All The Lovers, Dancing. Kylie\u2019s singing live, everyone\u2019s dancing and having a lovely time, and I\u2019m so happy right now. Strictly\u2019s BACK! And we\u2019re off! Glitterballs are go! It\u2019s a new series, so we need a high energy opening pro dance sequence. This year it\u2019s white outfits all round, accompanied by undisputed Queen of Pop Kylie Minogue. She\u2019s singing a medley of her greatest hits, because she\u2019s Kylie and knows how to give the people what they want. Other Strictly musical acts, take note. OMG Eurovision Lyrics is a Pointless category and they HAVEN\u2019T PICKED IT. I\u2019m devastated, this was my moment to shine. Canada, Ace, George Clooney, Chancellor of Exchequer, Elf. Daughter and I are nailing Pointless. She might join the comment box later. Do we usually do a bingo for the launch show? No idea, but since I make the rules we\u2019ll have one anyway. But let\u2019s keep it simple - have a swig of whatever you fancy (me: gin) whenever a pro/celebrity pairing displays disingenuous levels of enthusiasm. Evening all, and welcome back to a brand spanking new series of Strictly Come Dancing! It seems like only a few weeks ago we were firing the glitter cannons for Christmas, but apparently nine more months have passed and we\u2019re back for a 17th series. And since the world is both literally and figuratively on fire, a bit of sparkle-tastic escapism seems like a good way to get us all through the autumn. I usually miss the launch show due to an annual tennis trip, but this year the ladies have offered to move it back a week so I can be here for tonight\u2019s launch and back for the first live show in two weeks\u2019 time. If it rains in Spain next weekend, it will be all your fault. Tonight is all about meeting this year\u2019s presenters, celebs, pro dancers and judges, pairing up all 15 couples, then waving them off to get ready for the first live show. Clearly this could be done in about 20 minutes, but that\u2019s not the Strictly way \u2013 we need montages, tension pauses, musical performances, convoluted explanations of who all these people are, weak jokes, group dances and enough superfluous padding to upholster your own sparkly sofa. The comment box is open for your wit and glitter; if you\u2019re an old comment box hand, welcome back, and if you\u2019re new to this liveblogging lark, a huge welcome. We\u2019re a friendly bunch, so say hello down below and get involved. Grab wine, snacks and your favourite sequined blanket for a 7.10pm kick off. See you then!",

New Zealanders of M\u0101ori and Pacific Island descent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/03/world/asia/new-zealand-australia-deportations.html\">are over-represented</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere is evidence that increasingly people\u2019s visas are being cancelled on suspicion of criminal activity, and there is definitely evidence that the minister is personally cancelling visas that don\u2019t allow appeals,\u201d Powell says.</p> <p>Deportations have picked up in the past month. About five arrive in New Zealand every week.</p> <p>Many of those sent back have lived and worked in Australia for decades, paid taxes, bought houses and raised families there.

They are fingerprinted, given AU$250 and taken to a motel with accommodation booked for five nights.</p> <p>After that they are pretty much on their own.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s feels very foreign for them, and very scary,\u201d says Rachael Ngatai,<strong> </strong>the reintegration manager for Pars, a charity that supports former prisoners and deportees. \u201cYou most often find people quite stressed, anxious, suspicious and distrusting of the system and the people trying to help them.

      "bodyText": "When parliament conducted an inquiry into vaping that concluded e-cigarettes should remain effectively banned in Australia, the paediatrician turned MP Mike Freelander said the lobbyists came knocking. \u201cWe were lobbied quite heavily prior to and during the inquiry by a number of agencies including those promoting the tobacco industry and some medical professionals who argued for legalisation on the basis of harm minimisation,\u201d the Labor MP says. \u201cIn the last few months there has been more activity \u2026 but I think our inquiry came out with the right result and I don\u2019t want to reopen it.\u201d The increase in lobbying \u2013 including Philip Morris engaging Capetal Advisory, revealed by Guardian Australia this week \u2013 comes as tobacco companies take a stake in vaping, the great disruptor of the traditional cigarette market. Philip Morris International has its iQOS \u2013 which stands for \u201cI quit original smoking\u201d \u2013 \u201cheat not burn\u201d smokeless cigarette device and in December 2018 Marlboro cigarette maker Altria Group announced it would pay $12.8bn to take a 35% stake in Juul Labs, the maker of one of the most popular brands of e-cigarettes. \u201cOne only needs to see the lobbying to know it has a commercial aspect,\u201d Freelander says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit sad to see in what is a public health issue.\u201d But despite most parliamentarians on the inquiry finding that e-cigarettes should continue to be controlled as a therapeutic good, several Liberal MPs including Trent Zimmerman, Tim Wilson and Andrew Laming were persuaded, forcing the health minister, Greg Hunt, to order an independent study. Alex Wodak, a physician and director of the Australian Tobacco Harm Reduction Association, said the MPs were \u201cshocked to find how strong the case is for making the easy switch from high-risk cigarettes to low-risk vaping\u201d. Wodak cites that in the UK \u2013 where vaping is 6% of the market compared with 1% in Australia \u2013 the decline in traditional smoking has accelerated, while rates remain flat in Australia. In Japan, sale of traditional cigarettes is down 31% in three years after the introduction of e-cigarettes such as iQOS, he says. The association is a charity set up by four independent Australian medical practitioners which received funding from two vaping businesses for \u201cinitial legal and website costs\u201d but now says it does not accept donations from tobacco companies, their subsidiaries or the vape industry. Wodak, who led the St Vincent\u2019s hospital alcohol and drug service for 30 years, compares the public debate on vaping with other harm reduction efforts greeted with \u201cferocious resistance\u201d, including using methadone to treat heroin addiction, condoms to prevent the spread of HIV, supervised injecting rooms, and pill-testing at music festivals. \u201cIt\u2019s always an argument between abstinence \u2013 from people who wish something would disappear from the face of the earth \u2013 and pragmatists who mightn\u2019t like it but know since it exists we\u2019ve got to deal with it,\u201d he says. The Liberal-National Coalition government has commissioned a public health assessment of electronic cigarettes from the national centre for epidemiology and population health at the Australian National University, with the first task to test the theory it helps \u201chardened smokers\u201d quit. A spokesman for Hunt said the government\u2019s position on e-cigarettes \u201cremains unchanged and the minister is firmly opposed to changing the current laws particularly in light of recent statements by the US FDA about an epidemic of addiction among teen users\u201d. In Australia there is unanimous opposition to vaping among the peak health groups, but Public Health England has declared vaping to be 95% safer than traditional smoking. Nevertheless two recent deaths \u2013 in Illinois in August and Oregon in September \u2013 have put safety back under the microscope. The US Food and Drug Administration and the Centre for Disease Control is investigating a link between e-cigarette use and severe respiratory disease. The parliamentary inquiry found that e-cigarette vapour \u201chas been found to contain dangerous substances such as heavy metals and formaldehyde\u201d. \u201cE-cigarette use also appears to have negative impacts on lung health, and potentially contributes to respiratory and cardiovascular conditions,\u201d it said, citing submissions from the Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand and Lung Foundation Australia. Chris Zappala, vice president of the Australian Medical Association and a respiratory physician, says there is \u201cno question liquid nicotine has a harmful effect on the airways\u201d, particularly of patients with asthma or other chronic diseases, and that e-cigarettes \u201ccould to lead to normalisation\u201d of smoking. Imperial Brands has said it is \u201cdeeply troubled by reports linking illnesses to the use of vaping products\u201d but noted the cases were linked to vaping liquids containing THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis\u201d, not found in its products. \u201cThe only way to safely regulate these products is to legalise them,\u201d its head of corporate and legal affairs, Kirsten Daggar-Nickson, says. In Australia the commercial sale of liquid nicotine used in vaping is banned, and can be legally obtained only with a doctor\u2019s prescription. Guardian Australia spoke to four vapers \u2013 none of whom had a prescription and all of whom found liquid nicotine could easily be purchased on the internet, particularly from the more liberal neighbouring jurisdiction of New Zealand. Melbourne vaper and IT professional Martin Kingsley says: \u201cThe idea you can\u2019t get liquid nicotine in Australia is ridiculous. It\u2019s for sale at tobacconists under-the-counter. You can buy it here if you just don\u2019t look like a narc.\u201d Tom Reed had been smoking for half his life when he quit around the time of his 40th birthday.

Thoolen says vaping \u201cdoes the job\u201d by fulfilling her nicotine craving, but her husband \u201cdoesn\u2019t believe in it [because he says] it doesn\u2019t feel the same\u201d. She suggests anti-smoking campaigners don\u2019t like vaping because it delivers nicotine with the same hand-to-mouth action and is concerned that liquid nicotine will be subject to the same \u201csin taxes\u201d as regular cigarettes. Freelander is concerned that legalisation will increase its use among non-smokers. \u201c[Vaping] probably is a little bit better for you but what about the increasing number of people addicted to nicotine? It\u2019s a pathway to cigarettes.\u201d Wodak responds that the proportion of regular vapers who have never smoked is \u201cvery small\u201d \u2013 less than 1% \u2013 and it \u201cwouldn\u2019t be possible for e-cigarettes to accelerate the declining smoking rate\u201d if it acted as a gateway to real cigarettes. Zappala says while \u201cnever-smokers\u201d might be small as a proportion of the whole vaping population, large studies in the US and UK show \u201cthe gateway effect is real\u201d, particularly in teenagers who are more likely to smoke after vaping. He also rejects e-cigarettes as a cessation aid citing the fact that between a half and two-thirds of people who quit go cold turkey. The existence of other cessation aids means \u201cit\u2019s not like there are no other options\u201d. Wodak suggests contrary figures are inflated by counting the total number of people who have ever vaped, an \u201cunrealistic\u201d estimate that counts \u201ctransient\u201d users who vape, even without nicotine, and later give it up. Thoolen\u2019s youngest son, aged 18, is one such vaper who has \u201cnever had nicotine\u201d and now appears to be \u201closing interest\u201d in e-cigarettes. And Kingsley, who took up vaping to replace infrequent binges of one pack of traditional cigarettes a month, is also looking to quit. E-cigarette use \u201ccreeps in insidiously\u201d, he says. Where previously he smoked only on social occasions to accompany alcohol or drugs, Kingsley now finds himself vaping in his lunch break or going outside to \u201cbreak up the monotony\u201d of work. He plans to quit over the summer break, citing the ability to dilute the amount of nicotine to suggest stepping down will be smooth. Freelander suggests the evidence e-cigarettes help smokers quit is largely \u201canecdotal\u201d and is disappointed Hunt has revisited the question after the \u201ccomprehensive\u201d parliamentary inquiry report. \u201cThere is no new evidence that e-cigarettes are healthy, the only new evidence is to the contrary.

Or is the problem with the standard?</p> <p>\u201cIt would certainly promote better understanding by all concerned \u2013 and, it might be hoped, higher standards of conduct \u2013 if we had a

matter of now we\u2019ve clearly got an issue,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the legislature to be clear about what they mean, and if what they mean is unfairness, which I think they do, then

in the Journal of Equity, three legal academics \u2013 Melbourne law school professors Jeannie Marie Paterson and Elise Bant, with student Matthew Clare \u2013 said the majority in Kobelt took an \u201cunduly narrow\u201d view of the law and their ruling would make it more difficult to pursue companies over business practices that hurt consumers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote

      "bodyText": "When a judge says a bank\u2019s borrowers could afford its loans if they cut down on Wagyu beef and fine shiraz, the accusation that the judiciary is out of touch is not a hard one to make. That was the case last month, when the federal court judge Nye Perram threw out a case brought by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission alleging irresponsible home lending by Westpac. Consumer groups exploded, and the ruling went down badly with a regulator that had been told by the banking royal commissioner, Kenneth Hayne \u2013 himself a former high court judge \u2013 to be quicker to resort to the courts. But it was only one of a series of cases over the past few years, dealing with everything from door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman to health insurance, in which judges have frustrated attempts by regulators to use existing laws to protect consumers. Now Australia\u2019s consumer regulator has called for the law to be changed to bar companies acting unfairly towards customers, after a series of court rulings that have raised concerns judges are out of touch with community expectations. Rod Sims, the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, told the Guardian a new \u201cunfair conduct\u201d provision should apply across the economy and replace current provisions outlawing \u201cunconscionable conduct\u201d \u2013 a phrase rooted in the ancient law of equity that has been criticised because it brings with it connotations of deliberate wrongdoing. His call adds weight to similar demands from regulators, judges and consumer groups who say the way the courts interpret the existing law is too narrow. Even when regulators do win under current laws banning unfair contracts, as the ACCC did on Wednesday in a case against the hair clinic Ashley &amp; Martin, the most that can happen is that the arrangement in question is set aside \u2013 judges cannot levy fines for breaches. The Kobelt case Frustration with judges among regulators came to a head in June, when Asic lost a high court case in which it alleged a man named Lindsay Kobelt engaged in unconscionable conduct in the way he gave credit to customers of a store he ran in an Aboriginal community in remote South Australia. The facts of the way the \u201cbook-up\u201d scheme operated, as found by the court, seem shocking: Kobelt advanced credit to his customers in return for custody of their bank keycards and their PINs. Most of the credit was advanced to buy cars that had often done more than 200,000 kilometres \u2013 vehicles for which Kobelt charged a hefty mark-up in return for the loan. When the customer\u2019s wages or Centrelink payments arrived, Kobelt or one of his employees drained the account of all or nearly all of the money. His records of who owed what were cramped, chaotic and barely legible \u2013 so badly kept that customers would have had considerable difficulty understanding the entries. The case divided the court four to three, with the majority ruling that it suited Kobelt\u2019s customers to allow him to drain their bank accounts and he did not exploit them or take advantage of their lack of financial literacy. It was as if the judges thought buying a car through book-up was \u201cthe same as buying a tub of olives at South Melbourne market\u201d, one experienced regulator told Guardian Australia. Consumer groups also heavily criticised the decision, with the Consumer Action Law Centre saying it showed the law was not working to protect customers and calling for the rules to be changed. One of Victoria\u2019s most senior judges, the president of the court of appeal, Chris Maxwell, also took aim at the decision last month, saying he would have decided the case differently. In a speech to the legal community, Maxwell traced the history of unconscionable conduct all the way back to the courts of equity set up in the 15th century and pointed out that proving it generally relied on showing \u201cthat the stronger party had knowledge, or at least exhibited wilful ignorance, of the weaker party\u2019s disability\u201d. And he drew from the dissent written by one of the three judges in the minority in the Kobelt case, James Edelman, to point out that over the past few decades parliament had repeatedly tried to expand the definition of unconscionable conduct \u201cin continued efforts to require courts to take a less restrictive approach\u201d. He asked: \u201cAre the courts still being too restrictive? Or is the problem with the standard? \u201cIt would certainly promote better understanding by all concerned \u2013 and, it might be hoped, higher standards of conduct \u2013 if we had a prohibition on conduct which was \u2018in all the circumstances unfair\u2019,\u201d he said. \u2018Change the test\u2019 Sims says Maxwell\u2019s speech and Edelman\u2019s dissent \u201chave helped clarify my personal thinking and I think the thinking of other people in the ACCC. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a matter of criticising judges at all, I think it\u2019s a matter of now we\u2019ve clearly got an issue,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the legislature to be clear about what they mean, and if what they mean is unfairness, which I think they do, then we should change the test to that.\u201d He says he has also considered the problem in light of efforts to make banks behave better following the Hayne royal commission. \u201cIf you want to make banks act fairly, why not just make that the law,\u201d he says. While Sims is careful not to criticise the judiciary, others are more forthright. In an article published this month in the Journal of Equity, three legal academics \u2013 Melbourne law school professors Jeannie Marie Paterson and Elise Bant, with student Matthew Clare \u2013 said the majority in Kobelt took an \u201cunduly narrow\u201d view of the law and their ruling would make it more difficult to pursue companies over business practices that hurt consumers. The majority failed to consider that Kobelt\u2019s book-up system broke credit laws or \u201csquarely investigate the community or cultural values that were said to justify the business model operating in a remote Indigenous community,\u201d the academics said. The former Asic deputy chairman Peter Kell, who appeared before the royal commission while at the financial regulator, supports Sims\u2019s call for a new law against unfair conduct. \u201cI think we now have enough cases on the books that we can safely say the unconscionable conduct provision sets the bar too high when it comes to bad market conduct,\u201d he says. \u201cIn particular, it sets the bar too high when it comes to conduct that harms the most vulnerable members of our community.\u201d The Consumer Action Law Centre has used its submission to a treasury review of the ACCC\u2019s digital platforms inquiry to call for an economy-wide law against unfair conduct. \u201cThe operation of the free market in Australia has failed to deliver fair outcomes,\u201d the centre said in the submission. It criticised the high court majority in Kobelt for failing to heed parliament\u2019s attempts to broaden the concept of unconscionable conduct and for focusing on the conduct of Kobelt, rather than the effect on his customers. \u201cNot only is it a problem that the courts have read the existing provision too narrowly, it is a problem of the term \u2018unconscionable\u2019 itself,\u201d the centre said. \u201cReplacing it with fairness will encourage businesses to consider the impact of their conduct on consumers and can thus play a role in contributing to cultural change in Australian industry.\u201d While it was an Asic case that has crystallised the new push for laws against unfair conduct, the current Asic commissioner responsible for enforcement, Daniel Crennan QC, will not be drawn on whether he supports the move, saying it is a matter for the government. However, he points out that the courts will have to consider the idea of fairness more often anyway because of a change to the law designed to crack down on bad behaviour in the finance sector. Courts can now fine licensed finance companies if they fail to act \u201cfairly, honestly and efficiently\u201d towards customers. \u201cFairness will be tested by us, the regulators, in the courts in coming years,\u201d he says. \u201cThat may well be helpful to the debate.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ken Clarke is more jovial than might be expected as he reflects that he first became a Conservative MP when Boris Johnson was \u201ca small toddler\u201d. Johnson had not even been born when Clarke started to become active in Tory politics. He first attended a Conservative party conference as a student in 1962, where he supported Harold Macmillan\u2019s application to join the Common Market against the fierce opposition of the imperialist wing of the Tory party. \u201cI was one of the students who was going around wearing a \u2018Yes\u2019 badge.\u201d It is a reminder that the Tories have been convulsing over Europe for more than half a century. Never before, though, have the spasms been as violently destructive as now. After 49 years of continuous service on the Conservative benches, Clarke was one of the 21 Tory MPs who were stripped of the party whip for supporting legislation blocking a no-deal Brexit. In the history of the Tory party since the second world war, there has never been such a brutal purge. The jazz-loving, cigar-puffing, Hush Puppies-wearing Clarke has always been a rumbustious combatant for the Tory cause. He held positions in the Heath, Thatcher, Major and Cameron governments, including stretches as chancellor and home secretary. It is a stark indicator of how unhinged the party has become by what he calls its \u201ccrazy nervous breakdown\u201d that he is no longer entitled to call himself a Conservative MP. Not that he has actually received any formal notification of this. \u201cNo one has officially told me that I have lost the Tory whip,\u201d he chuckles. Perhaps they didn\u2019t dare. \u201cThe fault\u2019s probably mine. I\u2019m notorious for only using my mobile phone for outgoing calls: nobody knows my London number and I certainly don\u2019t do anything online. So there may somewhere be an email or text message or something telling me, but I gather from the media that there\u2019s no doubt that I\u2019ve lost the whip. My status otherwise is completely unclear.\u201d He is unsure whether he is still a member of the party. Conservative party chairman James Cleverly, when he bumped into him, admitted that he didn\u2019t know either. Being told that he is no longer a Tory MP by the \u201csmall toddler\u201d \u2013 doesn\u2019t this make him angry? \u201cWell, mildly annoyed. I suppose I ought to be more shocked. I\u2019m just slightly bemused. Hezza [Michael Heseltine] lost the whip in the Lords. Presumably they\u2019ll remove it from John Major soon if he doesn\u2019t shut up. It\u2019s extraordinary.\u201d Johnson may have underestimated how many Tory MPs he would end up expelling when he made the threat. \u201cWhat he was doing was going in for a purge of his opponents, in a very ruthless fashion,\u201d says Clarke. \u201cWhether he realised he\u2019d have over 20 he\u2019d be expelling from the parliamentary party, I\u2019ve no idea.

But Boris has made the problem worse by seeming to encourage a huge surge to the right. He could wind up with a Conservative party looking like the Brexit party and still losing a lot of votes to Nigel Farage because real Brexiters prefer Nigel Farage.\u201d As we talk in his office in Westminster\u2019s Portcullis House, Clarke reflects on the irony that Johnson is acting like a fanatic when he is not really a politician with any deep convictions. \u201cHe\u2019s not committed very powerfully to anything. He\u2019s not frightfully interested in policy. He came to see me in this room and tried to persuade me to vote for him in the leadership election. We had quite a cheery conversation, and his main point to me was that he was a one-nation Conservative. He never was a hardline Brexiter. That was a last-minute decision he made to join that side. Unfortunately, he\u2019s now surrounded himself with hardcore, ultra-rightwing, zany people.\u201d If Johnson has any sense, the Tory leader will listen to those who are urging him to find a way to bring the expelled MPs back into the fold. \u201cHe makes it up as he goes along and his original tactics have now collapsed. I would strongly advise him to reverse this. Old-stagers like me are going anyway. But Philip Hammond, David Gauke and so on \u2026 it\u2019s absurd to throw them out.\u201d He continues: \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget, the vast majority of Conservative MPs have, like me, already voted for a soft Brexit, most of them three times.

What has parliament done, why has it done it and is it democratic? What happens next? These are the questions all MPs have been asked everywhere since the bill that prevents a no-deal exit from the EU cleared the Commons on Wednesday.</p> <p>Since the arrival of Boris Johnson in Downing Street, it has become clear that a no-deal Brexit, of the utmost danger to our country\u2019s economic life and wellbeing, was no longer simply an empty piece of political rhetoric. Threatening the country and the EU with no deal has become government policy. It was therefore absolutely necessary for parliament to exercise its right and duty to act in the national interest and stop it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There will not be the parliament v the people election the prime minister seems so desperately to want</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Commons has been accused of denying the will of the people and somehow acting unconstitutionally in doing this. We have done no such thing. All of us were elected on manifestos that either promised \u201ca smooth, orderly Brexit\u201d (the Conservative manifesto); or promised to block no deal (Labour manifesto); or promised \u201cto get the best deal for Northern Ireland, recognising that we share a land frontier with the Republic\u201d (the DUP); or supported the UK\u2019s continued membership of the EU. Any MP who facilitated a no-deal exit would have been tearing up their manifesto promises.</p> <p>In deciding to \u200bpursue a ruthless policy of trying to shut down all debate about the future of our country and its wellbeing, it was the government and the government alone that has been acting with reckless disregard for our constitution.</p> <p>Fortunately, our constitution is adaptable and it is adapting to the reality that the government does not have a majority and cannot act as if it does. Throughout our history, when ministers have sought to abuse their power, MPs have been required to find ways to protect and defend the sovereignty of parliament. So a cross-party group of MPs has come together to act. We have stopped one unnecessary general election that was deliberately designed by the PM to facilitate a no-deal crash-out in October and on Monday we will, if necessary, stop another. There can be no election while the country is still teetering on the edge of an abyss and it would be an abdication of our responsibility at a time of crisis to allow this to happen.</p> <p>There will not be the parliament v the people election the prime minister seems so desperately to want, despite the highly irresponsible nature of such framing. When one does come, it needs to be focused on sensible options as to how we get ourselves out of the mess and division that Brexit is creating for us all.</p> <p>It is noteworthy that my mailbag suggests the public understands the issues very well. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/18/number-10-furious-leak-document-predicting-no-deal-brexit-shortages\" title=\"\">Yellowhammer revelations</a> of the consequences of no deal cannot be ignored. The realisation has also come that a no-deal Brexit is the start of a long and wearying journey to find a new trade deal with the EU from a position of maximum disadvantage and not some glorious moment of national self-assertion.</p> <p>I start the new week therefore with quiet optimism. We have at last a powerful coalition for moderation. The prime minister and his advisers are going to find it rather difficult to knock it down. They would do better to focus on finding a way of going back to the public and asking them what they now want and uniting parliament to deliver it. This would be a genuine exercise in democracy. Seeking to impose their own minority views on our country in the way they are is not acceptable and must be resisted.</p> <p><em>Dominic Grieve is the</em><em> MP for Beaconsfield</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 September 2019 because an earlier version described Grieve as \u201cthe Conservative MP for Beaconsfield\u201d whereas he has lost the Conservative \u201cwhip\u201d requiring him to sit as an independent.</p>",

We need to stand back a moment and make a calm assessment of what happened last week. What has parliament done, why has it done it and is it democratic? What happens next? These are the questions all MPs have been asked everywhere since the bill that prevents a no-deal exit from the EU cleared the Commons on Wednesday. Since the arrival of Boris Johnson in Downing Street, it has become clear that a no-deal Brexit, of the utmost danger to our country\u2019s economic life and wellbeing, was no longer simply an empty piece of political rhetoric. Threatening the country and the EU with no deal has become government policy. It was therefore absolutely necessary for parliament to exercise its right and duty to act in the national interest and stop it. The Commons has been accused of denying the will of the people and somehow acting unconstitutionally in doing this. We have done no such thing. All of us were elected on manifestos that either promised \u201ca smooth, orderly Brexit\u201d (the Conservative manifesto); or promised to block no deal (Labour manifesto); or promised \u201cto get the best deal for Northern Ireland, recognising that we share a land frontier with the Republic\u201d (the DUP); or supported the UK\u2019s continued membership of the EU. Any MP who facilitated a no-deal exit would have been tearing up their manifesto promises. In deciding to pursue a ruthless policy of trying to shut down all debate about the future of our country and its wellbeing, it was the government and the government alone that has been acting with reckless disregard for our constitution. Fortunately, our constitution is adaptable and it is adapting to the reality that the government does not have a majority and cannot act as if it does. Throughout our history, when ministers have sought to abuse their power, MPs have been required to find ways to protect and defend the sovereignty of parliament. So a cross-party group of MPs has come together to act. We have stopped one unnecessary general election that was deliberately designed by the PM to facilitate a no-deal crash-out in October and on Monday we will, if necessary, stop another. There can be no election while the country is still teetering on the edge of an abyss and it would be an abdication of our responsibility at a time of crisis to allow this to happen. There will not be the parliament v the people election the prime minister seems so desperately to want, despite the highly irresponsible nature of such framing. When one does come, it needs to be focused on sensible options as to how we get ourselves out of the mess and division that Brexit is creating for us all. It is noteworthy that my mailbag suggests the public understands the issues very well. The Yellowhammer revelations of the consequences of no deal cannot be ignored. The realisation has also come that a no-deal Brexit is the start of a long and wearying journey to find a new trade deal with the EU from a position of maximum disadvantage and not some glorious moment of national self-assertion. I start the new week therefore with quiet optimism. We have at last a powerful coalition for moderation. The prime minister and his advisers are going to find it rather difficult to knock it down. They would do better to focus on finding a way of going back to the public and asking them what they now want and uniting parliament to deliver it. This would be a genuine exercise in democracy. Seeking to impose their own minority views on our country in the way they are is not acceptable and must be resisted.

The public report detailed a list of the key military, political participants in the conflict.

And the continued supply of weapons will perpetuate the conflict and prolong the suffering of the people of Yemen. It\u2019s our strong belief that weapons provided to the parties will be used in the conflict: that\u2019s why we have asked all states to prohibit the authorisation of arms transfers and refrain from providing arms.</p> <p>\u201cThe international community has to act.

      "bodyText": "A former secretary of the Australian defence department says the country cannot justify selling weapons to militaries involved in the five-year war in Yemen, which now stand \u201caccused of gross violations of human rights and likely war crimes by the UN\u201d. And the Australian co-author of the just-released United Nations report into human rights atrocities in Yemen has said governments that sell weapons to belligerent countries are responsible for prolonging the conflict and contributing to immense humanitarian suffering. The report found that the conflict had been plagued by human rights abuses, including hospitals being bombed, civilians being deliberately targeted by shelling and sniper fire, civilian populations being deliberately starved, medical supplies being blocked, rape, murder, enforced disappearances, torture, and children being forced to fight. Australia is one of several countries that sell weapons to those that are part of the Saudi-led Coalition in conflict with the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The Australian government says it imposes strict controls on exports to ensure they are not used in the Yemeni conflict. But the former secretary of the department of defence Paul Barratt told Guardian Australia that regardless of whether Australian-made weapons were crossing the border into Yemen, \u201cthe fact remains that Australia now has a national policy which seeks and facilitates weapons sales with countries that stand accused of gross violations of human rights and likely war crimes\u201d. \u201cWhen did this particular trade in arms become official Australian policy? Even if we are successfully legally tiptoeing around the Arms Trade Treaty, such deals surely cannot be acceptable on moral or ethical grounds,\u201d Barratt said. \u201cAs a country that routinely asks other countries to abide by the rules-based international order, it would seem hypocritical, at best, that Australia is now willing to \u2026 make a profit from, weapons sales to nations that are openly flouting this international order.\u201d Melissa Parke, the former federal MP for Fremantle, was one of three UN-appointed experts to compile its report on Yemen. The report said hospitals had been bombed, civilians attacked and starvation used as a tactic of war, and alleged that there had been a \u201ccollective failure\u201d from the international community to intervene in the five-year war to reduce the suffering of civilians; rather, support from international actors had prolonged the conflict. The public report detailed a list of the key military, political participants in the conflict. A confidential list of those most likely to be complicit in war crimes has been sent to the UN. Parke said Yemeni civilians had \u201cborne the brunt\u201d of a brutal conflict that was being exacerbated by international indifference, and material support from some governments. \u201cGiven the number of reports establishing the abuses being committed, no state can claim not to be aware of the violence being perpetrated. And the continued supply of weapons will perpetuate the conflict and prolong the suffering of the people of Yemen. It\u2019s our strong belief that weapons provided to the parties will be used in the conflict: that\u2019s why we have asked all states to prohibit the authorisation of arms transfers and refrain from providing arms. \u201cThe international community has to act. There is absolutely no regard for the lives and the dignity of fellow human beings by parties, it has to be the international community that steps in and acts accordingly.\u201d The UN report names France, Iran, the UK and the US \u201camong other states\u201d as potentially complicit in war crimes. Parke said there remained a lack of transparency around arms transfers. \u201cWhere the provisions of arms leads to the commission of crimes under international humanitarian law, that state could also be responsible for those violations, and individuals in those countries could be exposed to charges of war crimes. \u201cIt\u2019s very serious \u2026 every nation needs to play its part to bring this war to an end.\u201d In July, photographs were published that showed Australian-built remote weapons systems being shipped from Sydney airport to the general department of arms and explosives of Saudi Arabia\u2019s ministry of interior. The manufacturer, Electro Optic Systems (EOS), said none of its weapons systems had been used in Yemen, and were used only for interior ministry border operations. The Australian defence department maintains that it provides export permits only if it is satisfied the weapons will not be used in breach of international law. \u201cAny military goods proposed for export by Australian companies are subject to a rigorous assessment process that takes into account Australia\u2019s international obligations, including the Arms Trade Treaty, and the impact the export could have on foreign policy, human rights, national security and regional security,\u201d a spokeswoman said. Guardian Australia asked the defence department whether it had requested EOS to obtain an \u201cend-use and non-transfer certificate\u201d from Saudi-Arabia \u2013 a document detailing where and how the equipment would be used and a guarantee it would not be on-sold. A spokeswoman for the department declined to answer, saying \u201cdefence does not comment on the details of specific export applications\u201d. Yemen has been at war since 2015, when president Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi and his cabinet were forced to flee the capital Sanaa by Houthi rebel forces. Saudi Arabia backs Hadi, and has led a coalition of regional countries in air strikes against the Iran-backed Houthis.

It spent the entire election campaign telling us the economy was strong despite clear evidence that was not the case, and now in the light of some of the worst economic growth figures this century it would have us believe all is going to plan. If that is so, what the heck does that say about their plan? At the Liberal party election campaign launch in May, Scott Morrison told the audience: \u201cYou know, it all begins with keeping our economy strong.\u201d It was a rather interesting use of the present tense \u201ckeeping\u201d, as this week\u2019s GDP figures have made abundantly clear the economy was not strong at the time of his speech, and has not been so for a year now (even worse, this was obvious even before Morrison gave his speech in May). The 2018-19 financial year had the lowest growth since 2000-01, and it was the eighth worst year out of the 60 since 1960. In the past 35 financial years only five have seen worse per-capita growth, and in the past 40 only four have seen lower productivity growth. And yet we have the treasurer telling us that \u201cthe fundamentals of the Australian economy are strong\u201d. Good luck working out what they are, because if productivity is not a fundamental aspect of the economy then nothing is. Perhaps those fundamentals are the government spending on the NDIS, aged care and flood relief? Because if you took those away, the economy would have shrunk in the June quarter.

Not exactly a sign of things going to plan. And the plan is the big issue, because right now the government is trying very hard to do two things \u2013 convince you they have a plan, and that what they had planned previously has worked. In effect they want you to both forget and remember that they have been in power for the past six years. They want to respond to these awful economic figures (the first time since 1991 that we have seen four consecutive quarters of trend growth below 0.5%) as though they have been elected to fix the problem, while also saying that the plan they had put in place before the election doesn\u2019t need any tinkering.

The England head coach said: \u201cI\u2019d have liked to have seen a bit more green grass on all of the wickets this year. We certainly had that four years ago. \u201cWhat has got to happen here is, we either play on wickets that have some green grass on, like in county cricket, or we play county cricket on flatter wickets with not a lot of grass so we actually learn how to bat and bowl on flatter wickets.\u201d",

The film, which stars Joaquin Phoenix as a would-be standup comic, was ecstatically received at its premiere on the Lido last weekend, with critics immediately tipping it to be the first superhero film to take the best picture Oscar. Recent Golden Lion recipients include Roma and The Shape of Water, both of which went on to triumph at the Academy Awards. In his speech on Saturday, Phillips, whose previous films include the Hangover trilogy, thanked Warner Bros for entrusting him with the DC property. A sequel is rumoured to be in the works, as well as a film in which Phoenix\u2019s Joker encounters Robert Pattinson, who was recently chosen to replace Ben Affleck as Batman. Although Joker was a hit with reviewers and Phoenix is something of a festival darling, the result was nonetheless perceived to be an unusually mainstream choice for Lucrecia Martel\u2019s jury. Yet more surprising, given Martel\u2019s disparaging remarks about its director at the opening press conference, was the awarding of the grand jury prize to Roman Polanski\u2019s An Officer and a Spy. The film, which stars Jean Dujardin and Louis Garrel, is based on Robert Harris\u2019s novel about the Dreyfus affair in 1895 France. Yet despite the continued controversy surrounding its director, that film also met with highly positive reviews.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson would trigger a legal and constitutional crisis that would force his resignation as prime minister if he failed to obey a law mandating him to seek another extension to Brexit, according to high-level legal advice obtained by Labour. The conclusions of a team of leading QCs, which have been sent to the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, make clear that the prime minister would be declared in contempt of court if he tried to remain in No 10 while refusing to obey legislation to prevent the UK leaving the EU without a deal on 31 October. The new law is expected to gain royal assent from the Queen early next week. The legal advice, from lawyers at Matrix Chambers, says: \u201cIf the prime minister refused to comply with this order, then, while we would be in historically uncharted political territory, the legal position would remain clear \u2013 the prime minister would be in contempt of an order of the court and would be exposed to a full range of sanctions.\u201d One of the QCs who provided the unequivocal advice, Philippe Sands, told the Observer: \u201cIf the prime minister chooses not to comply with EU (Withdrawal) No 6 Act, he will be subject to an action for contempt which could, logically and as a matter of last resort, lead to imprisonment, but that has never happened and will not happen; Britain is a rule of law country, so he will comply or leave office. All other talk is bluster, as attorney general Geoffrey Cox will already have advised him.\u201d But Lord Macdonald, the former director of public prosecutions, warned Johnson that he could end up in prison. \u201cIt is convention that if you are found guilty of defying a court order, then you are jailed,\u201d he said. On Saturday, as violence over Brexit broke out near parliament, Downing Street said Johnson remained defiant and would neither resign, nor comply with the law to delay Brexit. Drawn up by a cross-party group of MPs vehemently against a no-deal outcome, the legislation mandates the prime minister to seek a further extension to Brexit beyond the current date of 31 October to 31 January next year \u2013 unless Johnson has either secured a deal with the EU that is acceptable to parliament, or MPs have voted for no deal before 19 October. Johnson and his advisers are this weekend exploring further legislative possibilities, including the \u201cnuclear\u201d option of tabling a no-confidence motion in the government and ordering Tory MPs to vote for it, in order to trigger an election. Such a motion would require only a simple majority of MPs to pass, but may not be allowed by the Speaker, John Bercow. Downing Street sources also said No 10 was examining ways of pushing the EU into expelling the UK by refusing to nominate a new British commissioner. No 10 advisers believe this would mean the European Commission would not be legally constituted as from 1 November. But Jean-Claude Piris, a former head of the EU council legal service, said Britain\u2019s lack of a commissioner would not pose a major problem. \u201cThe commission will be legally able to function and take legal decisions with a member less,\u201d he said. The crisis engulfing Johnson and his government, which saw the prime minister\u2019s brother Jo resign from the cabinet on Thursday after 21 Tory MPs were stripped of the whip, deepened further last night when the most senior MP, Kenneth Clarke, said he was thinking about voting for the Liberal Democrats at the next election and regarded a Jeremy Corbyn government as less damaging to the UK than a no-deal Brexit. In his first newspaper interview since being stripped of the whip after almost 60 years in the Conservative party, the father of the house told the Observer that if he were starting out on his political career now, he would not choose the Tories. \u201cIf I was 20 years old and thinking which political party I was going to join \u2026 I would not join the Conservative party. I would not follow Boris Johnson in this wild, rightwing nationalist stuff,\u201d he said. Asked if he would vote Conservative at the next election, Clarke said he had not decided, but could choose the Lib Dems: \u201cIf I was going to cast a protest vote, I would follow the Conservative tradition of voting Lib Dem.\u201d Both a no-deal Brexit and a Corbyn government were \u201cawful prospects\u201d, but \u201ca no-deal Brexit could cause far more damage to our future economic success than a Corbyn government\u201d. Sources within government said Johnson\u2019s senior aide, Dominic Cummings, told fellow advisers on Friday that last week\u2019s purge of rebel MPs such as Clarke was \u201conly the beginning\u201d of a ruthless strategy to push Brexit through. It is understood he told advisers: \u201cBy the time we get to the end of this, [those opposing Johnson\u2019s plans] are going to melt.\u201d The legal advice obtained by Labour warns that if Johnson defies the law, the civil service will be placed in an \u201cinvidious position in so far as they may be asked to take steps that are either contrary to the law or seek improperly to circumvent the law\u201d. Starmer said: \u201cIf the government does anything other than follow the letter of the law, then this political crisis will very quickly also become a legal one.

      "body": "<p>Another miracle is required here for England to keep the pursuit of the Ashes alive. They began their second innings half an hour before the close and the ball was tossed to Pat Cummins, rather than Mitchell Starc, who had had that privilege in the first innings. This proved a good option that may well have decided the destination of the Ashes.</p> <p>Cummins\u2019s third ball, delivered from around the wicket, was not his best. It was too much to the leg side yet somehow via a leading edge Rory Burns skewed the ball gently into the hands of Travis Head. The fourth ball from Cummins was of higher quality. It was propelled at Joe Root. It was full of length and drifted into the right-hander before kissing the turf and moving away to clip the top of off stump.</p> <p>Thus Root became the first England captain to register three ducks in a series; Cummins was on a hat-trick and England\u2019s chances of saving this game had plummeted. Jason Roy, peculiarly required to face before Joe Denly, his replacement at the top of the order, had taken guard, defended the next delivery successfully.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/sep/07/ashes-2019-england-v-australia-fourth-test-day-four-live\">Ashes 2019: England chase 383 runs to beat Australia in fourth Test, day four \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Serious damage had been done. Burns and Root had provided the only serious obstacles to the bowlers in England\u2019s first innings. Now both were gone. Roy and Denly have career-enhancing chances to prolong their Test futures on the final day of yet another engrossing Test match.</p> <p>Until that over by Cummins, the headline news concerned Steve Smith. He failed. He was out for 82, his lowest score of the series. In the process he ensured that his captain could declare with a lead of 382. There had been the odd moment when Australia were 44 for four in their second innings when a declaration may not have been necessary. As ever, Smith took control.</p> <p>It was a busy day, encompassing three innings. In the morning England added 101 runs, which meant that they just passed the follow-on target, a landmark of sorts but not one of great significance since it is highly unlikely that Australia would have enforced given the chance. This was less than they wanted, more than they feared.</p> <p>All three of their remaining batsmen threatened \u2013 and Jos Buttler did manage his highest score of the series, 41, before becoming the last man out \u2013 but none of them could do any serious damage to the Australian gameplan.</p> <p>Starc, armed with the second new ball, imposed himself for the first time in the series. Against Jonny Bairstow he found extra swing and he induced a leg-side drive, which never made contact with the ball. Bairstow gets bowled far more frequently than specialist batsmen. In his last 37 innings this has been his mode of dismissal 15 times, evidence that he might reproduce as justification for maintaining his wicketkeeping duties. Next Starc dispatched Ben Stokes when Smith took a regulation catch at second slip with absolute certainty. Mortality returned for Stokes with the bat and he was still suffering from a sore shoulder.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/07/david-warner-new-low-stuart-broad-england-australia-ashes-cricket\">David Warner hammered to new low thanks to Broad mind games | Ali Martin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For much of this game Archer has appeared off the pace \u2013 an impression consolidated when he ambled a single from his first delivery, which dribbled away on the leg side. If the throw had hit the stumps at the non-striker\u2019s end, Archer would have been out by an embarrassing distance. Soon afterwards he swished at a short ball from Cummins and was caught behind.</p> <p>Buttler struck some crisp boundaries before and after Stuart Broad\u2019s dismissal to Starc, which took England past 300, whereupon he was bowled attempting a big drive against Cummins. So the speculation about the timing of Tim Paine\u2019s declaration commenced. And then stalled.</p> <p>Yet again Australia\u2019s left-handed opening batsmen were tormented by Broad. Warner suffered the humiliation of his first Test pair when he was palpably lbw to his sixth delivery. Then Marcus Harris departed in identical fashion to the first innings, lbw. He became the 14th left-handed victim for Broad out of the 19 wickets he has taken in this series.</p> <p>Then Archer intervened as Marnus Labuschagne experienced failure for the first time in the series when lbw to a brisk full-length delivery. Head signalled his belligerent intentions but soon lost his middle stump to Archer in spectacular fashion. England had snaffled four wickets rapidly but they did not include Smith, who inevitably and idiosyncratically came to the rescue of his side.</p> <p>There were a few moments of uncertainty at the start against Broad but soon he was past 600 runs in this series, an achievement matched only by Don Bradman (twice), Arthur Morris and Mark Taylor. Then he posted his ninth consecutive fifty in Ashes cricket, a feat that no one else can equal. Towards the end he was batting in a manner rarely seen in Test cricket even in the 21st century. He moved around the crease like a glorified mystic Meg since he seemed to have advance knowledge of where the ball was going to land.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/07/trevor-bayliss-stokes-hero-ashes-england\">Trevor Bayliss left hoping for another Stokes-like hero to save Ashes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Smith may have produced one brand new shot to add to our cricketing lexicon: the periscope block played with a vertical bat above his head from a slow bouncer from Archer. He was certainly not batting for a red inker. Eventually when Jack Leach was reintroduced he was caught at long-off by Stokes but do not regard this as confirmation of the much-mentioned \u201cweakness\u201d against left-arm spin.</p> <p>Graham Gooch memorably described a Test match against the Kiwis as playing against the World XI at one end, where Richard Hadlee was bowling, and Ilford 2nds at the other. A similar comparison could be made when bowling against Australia. Smith is on a plane of his own, an executive jet that skims effortlessly through the air; most of the rest are more reminiscent of the contraptions recreated in <em>Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Another miracle is required here for England to keep the pursuit of the Ashes alive. They began their second innings half an hour before the close and the ball was tossed to Pat Cummins, rather than Mitchell Starc, who had had that privilege in the first innings. This proved a good option that may well have decided the destination of the Ashes. Cummins\u2019s third ball, delivered from around the wicket, was not his best. It was too much to the leg side yet somehow via a leading edge Rory Burns skewed the ball gently into the hands of Travis Head. The fourth ball from Cummins was of higher quality. It was propelled at Joe Root. It was full of length and drifted into the right-hander before kissing the turf and moving away to clip the top of off stump. Thus Root became the first England captain to register three ducks in a series; Cummins was on a hat-trick and England\u2019s chances of saving this game had plummeted. Jason Roy, peculiarly required to face before Joe Denly, his replacement at the top of the order, had taken guard, defended the next delivery successfully. Serious damage had been done. Burns and Root had provided the only serious obstacles to the bowlers in England\u2019s first innings. Now both were gone. Roy and Denly have career-enhancing chances to prolong their Test futures on the final day of yet another engrossing Test match. Until that over by Cummins, the headline news concerned Steve Smith. He failed. He was out for 82, his lowest score of the series. In the process he ensured that his captain could declare with a lead of 382. There had been the odd moment when Australia were 44 for four in their second innings when a declaration may not have been necessary. As ever, Smith took control. It was a busy day, encompassing three innings. In the morning England added 101 runs, which meant that they just passed the follow-on target, a landmark of sorts but not one of great significance since it is highly unlikely that Australia would have enforced given the chance. This was less than they wanted, more than they feared. All three of their remaining batsmen threatened \u2013 and Jos Buttler did manage his highest score of the series, 41, before becoming the last man out \u2013 but none of them could do any serious damage to the Australian gameplan. Starc, armed with the second new ball, imposed himself for the first time in the series. Against Jonny Bairstow he found extra swing and he induced a leg-side drive, which never made contact with the ball. Bairstow gets bowled far more frequently than specialist batsmen. In his last 37 innings this has been his mode of dismissal 15 times, evidence that he might reproduce as justification for maintaining his wicketkeeping duties. Next Starc dispatched Ben Stokes when Smith took a regulation catch at second slip with absolute certainty. Mortality returned for Stokes with the bat and he was still suffering from a sore shoulder. For much of this game Archer has appeared off the pace \u2013 an impression consolidated when he ambled a single from his first delivery, which dribbled away on the leg side. If the throw had hit the stumps at the non-striker\u2019s end, Archer would have been out by an embarrassing distance. Soon afterwards he swished at a short ball from Cummins and was caught behind. Buttler struck some crisp boundaries before and after Stuart Broad\u2019s dismissal to Starc, which took England past 300, whereupon he was bowled attempting a big drive against Cummins. So the speculation about the timing of Tim Paine\u2019s declaration commenced. And then stalled. Yet again Australia\u2019s left-handed opening batsmen were tormented by Broad. Warner suffered the humiliation of his first Test pair when he was palpably lbw to his sixth delivery. Then Marcus Harris departed in identical fashion to the first innings, lbw. He became the 14th left-handed victim for Broad out of the 19 wickets he has taken in this series. Then Archer intervened as Marnus Labuschagne experienced failure for the first time in the series when lbw to a brisk full-length delivery. Head signalled his belligerent intentions but soon lost his middle stump to Archer in spectacular fashion. England had snaffled four wickets rapidly but they did not include Smith, who inevitably and idiosyncratically came to the rescue of his side. There were a few moments of uncertainty at the start against Broad but soon he was past 600 runs in this series, an achievement matched only by Don Bradman (twice), Arthur Morris and Mark Taylor. Then he posted his ninth consecutive fifty in Ashes cricket, a feat that no one else can equal. Towards the end he was batting in a manner rarely seen in Test cricket even in the 21st century. He moved around the crease like a glorified mystic Meg since he seemed to have advance knowledge of where the ball was going to land. Smith may have produced one brand new shot to add to our cricketing lexicon: the periscope block played with a vertical bat above his head from a slow bouncer from Archer. He was certainly not batting for a red inker. Eventually when Jack Leach was reintroduced he was caught at long-off by Stokes but do not regard this as confirmation of the much-mentioned \u201cweakness\u201d against left-arm spin. Graham Gooch memorably described a Test match against the Kiwis as playing against the World XI at one end, where Richard Hadlee was bowling, and Ilford 2nds at the other. A similar comparison could be made when bowling against Australia. Smith is on a plane of his own, an executive jet that skims effortlessly through the air; most of the rest are more reminiscent of the contraptions recreated in Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines.",

Selection is a tricky balance between the short, medium and long-term. You can\u2019t just drop everyone who\u2019s out of form, but equally there comes a point when bad form can no longer be ignored, especially if you look like a walking wicket against a particular bowler.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-07T14:33:56.711Z\">at 3.33pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d73bda38f08143ee1ae1f3e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-07T14:28:08.812Z\">3.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>12th over: Australia 35-3 (Smith 6, Head 7) </strong>Head gets off the mark with a lofted square drive to the boundary off Archer, who moves back over the wicket in response.

Four runs to Smith. But he\u2019s having a really tough time against Broad, who beat him twice outside off stump during another brilliant over.

He is of course the sort of bowler who can suddenly have a great day in the space of five or six balls. His first is on target, just outside Bairstow\u2019s off stump. His next two are beauties! Swing, from a fuller length, on the line of the off stump. One Bairstow allows to go just over his bails, the next he manages to get bat behind, just. He\u2019s teased by the fourth, leaving as it bends back towards him. Serious movement. Another, into the pads, but Bairstow is playing this tough over really well, hanging back and anticipating the swing and this time even scrambling a single as he deflects to leg. Starc with one ball at the lefty bowls a good fuller ball that starts on middle and swings to off, but Stokes reads it. Great start for the bowler. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/06/mitchell-starc-australia-third-ashes-test\">Mitchell Starc: an ODI genius but Ashes return highlights red-ball fragility | Geoff Lemon</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d7384868f082514879efa18\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-07T10:24:12.826Z\">11.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>80th over: England 212-5 (Stokes 13, Bairstow 8) </strong>The last over before the new ball becomes available.

After three rain-interrupted days the match is delicately poised. Australia are the only combatant with a chance of winning but to do so they must engineer 15 English wickets on a surface containing few demons; not to mention find enough time to plunder enough second-innings runs of their own to bolt the backdoor behind them. </p> <p>It\u2019s a well-worn cliche this series but the opening hour, and opening session, will be crucial. Should England survive the remaining six overs with the old ball and progress through the early stages of the second new Dukes without much alarm, Australia\u2019s task will grow in difficulty by the minute. A rapid collapse and England will be staring at an almighty rearguard action this evening and throughout tomorrow. </p> <p>Once again England turn to Ben Stokes for protection. He has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/01/mastodon-appear-on-game-of-thrones-and-get-killed\">the complexion of a Wildling </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/15/game-of-thrones-season-six-biggest-mysteries-solved\">the glacial melt eyes of a White Walker</a> but with Stokes on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/08/ive-spent-3091580-24-hours-in-game-of-thrones-merchandise\">night\u2019s watch</a> his teammates could sleep soundly knowing the best-equipped batsman in the team will be at the crease for potentially the most significant passage of play in the Test. Around him Jonny Bairstow, and in particular Jos Buttler - when he strides out as a specialist No.8 - must prove their worth. The latter is a luxury England can ill-afford in recent form, unless he switches codes and transforms into Steven Gerrard or Frank Lampard; but not both, never both, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/may/31/fabio-capello-gerrard-lampard-england\">we don\u2019t want to open that can of worms again</a>. </p> <p>Australia\u2019s day will be determined in two phases. In the morning session with the new ball the relentlessly impressive Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins will hope to recapture the venom that threatened to rip the match decisively their way late yesterday. After lunch all eyes turn to Nathan Lyon to exploit a surface that is increasingly receptive to spin. </p> <p>It all amounts to what should be an engrossing day of Test match cricket.</p> <p>If you want to be a part of it you can drop me a line on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JPHowcroft\">Twitter</a> or you can <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com\">send me an email</a>. </p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Pat Cummins \u201cIt\u2019s coming out nicely at the moment. It was always the plan to have a few overs at them tonight, and it was good to get a couple of wickets. It feels like there\u2019s enough in the wicket if you get nice and full. We want to hit the stumps as much as we can. None of us expected that innings from Smithy \u2013 he was unbelievable.\u201d 7th over: England 18-2 (Denly 10, Roy 8) Mitchell Starc gets the last over of the day. Denly digs out a superb yorker before driving three off the penultimate delivery. Roy has one ball to survive, which he does. Australia will arrive at Old Trafford tomorrow needing eight wickets to retain the Ashes. Spoiler alert: they get them. 6th over: England 15-2 (Denly 7, Roy 8) Denly cracks a slog-sweep for four off Lyon. He tries it again two balls later, misses completely and is lucky that the ball doesn\u2019t turn enough to hit off stump. 5th over: England 10-2 (Denly 2, Roy 8) Roy, who has started quite confidently in the circumstances, pushes Cummins into the leg side for a couple more. Nathan Lyon is coming on, which means we should have time for two overs before the close. 4th over: England 8-2 (Denly 2, Roy 6) A quiet over from Hazlewood to Denly. England have two more overs to survive tonight. 3rd over: England 6-2 (Denly 0, Roy 6) Roy gets England off the mark, turning Cummins off the pads for two. It was in the air but flew past Wade at short leg. He times a nice boundary off the last ball of the over as well. 2nd over: England 0-2 (Denly 0, Roy 0) That was Root\u2019s third duck of the series, and his second golden duck. It felt like a symbolic dismissal. Denly, meanwhile, is hit on the elbow by a nasty lifter from Hazlewood, who beats the outside edge next ball. Insert your own extra-half-hour joke here. 1st over: England 0-2 (Denly 0, Roy 0) A double-wicket maiden from the truly magnificent Pat Cummins. We can moan all we like about England - and we will - but this attack, particularly Cummins and Hazlewood, is devastatingly good. Roy defends the hat-trick ball, and the crowd cheer wildly. That it\u2019s come to this. Jason Roy comes to the crease at No4, after four balls. Cummins is on a hat-trick. This is an awesome piece of bowling. It might even have got Steve Smith out. The ball was angled in from wider on the crease before snapping off the seam to beat Root\u2019s defensive stroke and crash into the top of off stump. That\u2019s the ball of the series. Pat Cummins has bowled Root first ball with a monstrous delivery. Rory Burns falls for a duck. He tried to turn Cummins to leg and got a leading edge that looped straight to Travis Head at short mid-off. Three balls it took. Rory Burns and Joe Denly walk to the crease. The light is not great. The pitch is tricky, the bowlers brilliant, the situation forlorn. Godspeed, lads. \u201cRob,\u201d says Romeo. \u201cIs George Davis still guilty?\u201d He is now! \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says John Bowker. \u201cSurely England\u2019s last couple of batting efforts have not been so bad that we can write off the draw (as you seem to be doing). I reckon there\u2019s about a 30% chance.\u201d I\u2019d give them about 10 per cent. The pitch is offering plenty \u2013 spin, uneven bounce with the new ball and a bit of reverse swing. But if they do survive, we\u2019ll have the first Ashes decider since 2009, and all bets will be off. Except the one about Steve Smith making a half-century. \u201cThe TMS vultures are tearing into England\u2019s post-tea tactics,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cNo mention directly of blaming our capt\u2019n but I guess Yorkshire types have a code of honour.\u201d I don\u2019t think Root is a good captain, but some of this team\u2019s performances would have reduced Mike Brearley to wibble. When they\u2019re good, they\u2019re very, very good... 42.5 overs: Australia 186-6 declared (Paine 23, Starc 3) Craig Overton returns to the a- oh for the love of God, the utter state of this. Paine misses an attempted hook, but Bairstow is so convinced of a top edge that he persuades Joe Root to go for a review. Replays show Paine\u2019s bat in a different postcode to the ball. England have lost their last review. Now Australia have declared, which means England have an ugly half an hour to survive tonight. Or score the 383 runs they need to win. 42nd over: Australia 177-6 (Paine 18, Starc 2) The weather forecast for tomorrow is fine, so there will be no favours from above for England. If they are to save the game, somebody will have to play an innings like Ricky Ponting\u2019s on this ground in 2005. Me neither. 41st over: Australia 172-6 (Paine 14, Starc 1) Paine wallops Leach for consecutive boundaries, down the ground and then through extra cover. This time tomorrow, he should be the first Australian captain in 18 years to retain the Ashes in England. It\u2019s quite a story. 40th over: Australia 159-6 (lead by 355; Paine 2, Starc 1) England\u2019s over-rate, incidentally, has been pathetic since tea. Trinidad 1990 stuff. They bowled six overs in 40 minutes at one stage. Steve Smith wasn\u2019t the only one taking the piss. Wade has a flash at Archer, and Bairstow flies to his left to take a brilliant one-handed catch. There were no slips so he had to go for it. 39th over: Australia 157-5 (Wade 34, Paine 1) England will, give or take, need to survive 98 overs tomorrow to keep the Ashes alive. Smith was out for 82. It\u2019s his lowest score of the series. How\u2019s this for a statgasm: Smith\u2019s lowest score of this Ashes is greater than everyone else\u2019s highest score, with the exception of Wade, Stokes and Burns. The man\u2019s an animal, barely legal. Steve Smith sacrifices himself for the team again. He drove Leach miles in the air towards wide long-off, where Stokes took a calm catch. 38th over: Australia 149-4 (Smith 82, Wade 27) Nobody, not even Donald, has scored a double hundred and a hundred in the same Ashes Test. Archer tries to keep it that way, sitting Smith on his backside with a legside bouncer. Smith shaped for the uppercut before deciding against it. I thought play could go on until 7.30pm; turns out it\u2019s 7pm, so Australia might just bat on until the close and grind England\u2019s morale into the earth. \u201cI\u2019m moving to Brooklyn NY in three weeks and hoping to join a local team,\u201d says Paul Harrison. \u201cAs the most metropolitan of readerships, I wonder if you could do a shout out to any OBOers playing there?\u201d Anyone? 37th over: Australia 147-4 (Smith 81, Wade 26) Smith makes room, Broad follows him, Smith drags it through midwicket for four anyway. First he broke England\u2019s will, then he crushed their soul, and now he\u2019s taking a urine sample. Broad, in attempting to second-guess Smith, spears a delivery miles down the leg side for five wides, then has the effrontery to complain to the umpire about the decision. Smith ends the over by smearing four more to bring up the hundred partnership. England, so hopeful a couple of hours ago, are being humliated. \u201cYou and Steve Smith,\u201d says Tom Callaghan. \u201c\u201cCalm down old boy, calm down.\u201d You weren\u2019t there. You don\u2019t know the horrors I\u2019ve seen. 36th over: Australia 132-4 (Smith 72, Wade 25) The scary thing is that, while Steve Smith is averaging 165 this summer, he has generally thrown his wicket away in pursuit of quick runs. If he was more selfish, he\u2019d be averaging 661 in this series. That\u2019s if he had an average at all. 35th over: Australia 131-4 (Smith 71, Wade 25) Younger readers won\u2019t know this. But a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, England won an Ashes Test in which Steve Smith was playing. Eight of them, in fact, from 2010-2015. That was then and this is now. I\u2019ve never seen a cricketer dominate one opponent like this. Never. Smith launches Broad over mid-on for four more to move into the serene seventies. His speed of scoring - 71 from 79 balls, including 52 from 41 since tea - means Australia should be able to declare tonight. He\u2019s not just a run-machine, he\u2019s a bloody selfless, adaptable run-machine. \u201cGiven that England can\u2019t get Smith out anyway, is it even worth trying?\u201d says Matt Fordham. \u201cWhy not just put all six fielders on the boundary and bowl five balls an over at the other 10 batsmen? He\u2019d be slightly less annoying from the non-striker\u2019s end if that\u2019s any consolation.\u201d Doesn\u2019t matter. They could have 44 fielders and bowl with perfect discipline, miles outside off stump to a tight 43-1 field, and he\u2019d still pick off boundaries through square leg. 34th over: Australia 123-4 (Smith 66, Wade 22) Jofra Archer returns to the attack, just in time to receive the good news that the horse has arrived at its destination 475 miles away. Smith pulls his first ball for four, a shot of stunning disdain, and steers the next to third man for another boundary. This is staggering batting. The immovable object has become the irresistible force, hurrying Australia towards a declaration with a flurry of boundaries. 33rd over: Australia 118-4 (Smith 57, Wade 22) It feels like Joe Root, having been criticised for overbowling Jofra Archer, has overcompensated in this match. Not that it makes much difference, because Steve Smith is batting gnittab si htimS evetS gnittab si htimS evetS Steve Smith is batting. Everyone\u2019s favourite fidgety deity moves to 57 with a glorious extra cover drive to the boundary off Broad. 32nd over: Australia 109-4 (Smith 53, Wade 21) England are unhappy because they thought the ball came off Wade\u2019s bat handle. There was a spike, but that was a fraction before the ball went past the bat handle. Who knows. After that Headingley DRS mess, I don\u2019t know how much we should trust technology. Either way, the third umpire couldn\u2019t have given it out. Wade is not out! He missed a sweep and was hit on the arm. England lose a review. England review! Has Wade been caught at slip off the glove? England think so; Kumar Dharmasena doesn\u2019t. 31st over: Australia 105-4 (Smith 50, Wade 20) Broad, Smith, single, fifty. That\u2019s his ninth in a row against England. His Ashes series averages are a neat demonstration of his progression from laughing stock to ridiculous genius: 32, 38, 41, 56, 137 and now 160. 30th over: Australia 104-4 (Smith 49, Wade 20) Leach bowls into the rough outside the leg stump of Smith, who drags a sweep past short fine leg for four. Doesn\u2019t he ever get bored? The man\u2019s an animal. He almost falls to an extraordinary catch from Stokes later in the over. As Smith shaped to reverse sweep, Stokes charged to his right from slip. He stretched and got both hands on the ball, but he couldn\u2019t hold on. It would have been an outrageous catch because Smith nailed the stroke. 29th over: Australia 97-4 (Smith 43, Wade 19) Stuart Broad comes on for Craig Overton, just in time to see the horse disappear over the horizon. His first ball is a yorker that Smith jams onto his boot, from where it deflects just wide of leg stump. Later in the over he plays a remarkable stroke, whipping Broad through midwicket for four with the kind of wristy flourish last seen in Kill Bill. He is quite astonishing. 28th over: Australia 92-4 (Smith 38, Wade 19) In his last 50 Tests \u2013 that\u2019s 50 Tests, over a five-year period \u2013 Steve Smith averages 76.44. Funny how? I wonder whether, a bit like Shane Warne in 2003, the ban has been a blessing in a very good disguise. He was mentally shattered, which is why he made such a costly mistake in the first place, whereas now he looks completely fresh. Gideon Haigh called Warne\u2019s suspension a year of \u201cperformance-enhancing rest\u201d, and Smith\u2019s Ashes performances have been enhanced. He is averaging 156.75 in this series; in 2017-18 he averaged 137.40. 27th over: Australia 91-4 (Smith 37, Wade 19) Wade forces a short ball from Overton through point for four, an excellent stroke. All the English aggression and optimism of the afternoon session has dissipated, and I\u2019m afraid there is blood on Joe Root\u2019s hands. 26th over: Australia 86-4 (Smith 36, Wade 15) Smith sweeps Leach for four. England are letting the tortoise get away from them, and Nasser in the commentary box is very unimpressed with the field placings, particularly the lack of a short leg for Wade when Leach is bowling. \u201cI have believed for some time now that the current Brexit horrorshow is in fact the product of us living in some parallel world created by a Pam-type dream,\u201d says Iain Noble. \u201cIf this is the case we are well past the time when someone should go and bang on the shower room door and ask Bobby just when the hell he is getting out of there.\u201d That stupid vote was so long ago that Jofra Archer hadn\u2019t even made his first-class debut when it happened. And Tom Banton wasn\u2019t even born. 25th over: Australia 81-4 (Smith 31, Wade 15) Any declaration will probably be on the cautious side, because Australia only need to draw this series to retain the Ashes. Ideally they would like to have 10 overs at England tonight, but I can\u2019t see that happening unless they flog the bowling everywhere in the next hour and a half. 24th over: Australia 77-4 (Smith 30, Wade 12) Smith is going after Leach, trying to hit him out of the attack before he settles into a rhythm. Four singles from that over, which means Leach has gone for 20 from three. 23rd over: Australia 73-4 (Smith 28, Wade 10) Craig Overton continues, to the surprise of those in the commentary box who expected another burst from Broad or Archer. He beats Wade from a good delivery that pops from a length. This has become a tricky pitch to bat on, at least for those who were not born Steven Peter Devereux Smith. \u201cPoint of order re: Paul Griffin\u2019s email in the 20th over,\u201d says Damian Clarke, the world\u2019s foremost Dallas pedant. \u201cIf we are assuming that Root is the Victoria Principal character, then he would be waking up in bed. Cook would be the one in the shower. I know, I know. But these details are important.\u201d 22nd over: Australia 73-4 (Smith 28, Wade 10) Leach starts after tea to Smith, who scorches the second ball down the ground for four. Shot! But he gets away with one later in the over when he mistimes a drive that teases Root, running back from mid off, before landing safely. \u201cI reckon being bowled out for about 130-40 might be the best thing that could happen to Australia here,\u201d says Phil Harrison. \u201cRealistically, 300 will be far too many for England to chase on this pitch, the way they\u2019re batting at the moment. But Stokes might have spooked the Aussies and it\u2019s not impossible to imagine them wanting to completely bat England out of it. Which might take them into tomorrow and give England a sniff of hanging on. England should hide the ball; get Leach to lob it into the rough. Not pretty but there you go.\u201d I think Australia will win regardless, but I know what you mean. In fact, Gary Naylor emailed during the afternoon session to point out that their Winviz percentage went up after that top-order collapses. 21st over: Australia 63-4 (Smith 19, Wade 10) Overton bowls an accurate over, the last of the session. That was a thrilling new-ball spell from Broad and Archer, though it hasn\u2019t really changed much. The best-case scenario for England is probably the apocalypse that they delay an Australian declaration until tomorrow morning, then produce a Cardiff 2009 homage keep the Ashes alive. I\u2019m not sure; I think it will be really hard for them to survive much more than 70-75 overs tomorrow. See you in 20 minutes for an extended evening session - three hours, light permitting. 20th over: Australia 62-4 (Smith 18, Wade 10) Jack Leach replaces Jofra Archer (9-2-27-2). I\u2019d have been tempted to give Archer one more over, especially with Wade on strike. Mind you, Leach dismissed both these batsmen in the first innings, sort of, and there\u2019s plenty of rough to work with. Smith runs down the track to clip his second ball from Leach through midwicket for three; that was a majestic stroke. Some skilful nurdling makes it a good over for Australia - eight from it. \u201cThis is like some terrible schlocky TV series,\u201d says Paul Griffin. \u201cNot great quality - with one Special Guest Star exception - but ridiculous, implausible cliffhangers every episode. I\u2019m assuming Root will wake up in the shower tomorrow and discover Cook is still batting, and KP is in the mood.\u201d 19th over: Australia 54-4 (Smith 14, Wade 6) Overton replaces Broad (9-4-19-2). Smith and Wade exchange singles before Smith steals a second run. After a scruffy start, he is starting to look immoveable once more. 18th over: Australia 50-4 (Smith 11, Wade 5) If England are to have any chance of back-to-back miracles, they need to get Smith in the half-hour before tea. He works Archer off the pads for a single, his 600th run of another astonishing series. He missed out on three innings as well. Wade, who has started very confidently, scrunches Archer through the covers for a couple. \u201cStuart Broad was the gent who waved him off after Labuschagne seemed upset about something,\u201d says Ben O\u2019Connell. \u201cDid so with the usual grin on the face of \u2018the English fast bowler\u2019.\u201d 17th over: Australia 47-4 (Smith 10, Wade 3) Broad beats Wade outside off stump. He\u2019s another batsman in need of a score. Most of them are, on both sides. 16th over: Australia 45-4 (Smith 10, Wade 1) Archer rips a bouncer past Wade, walks down the pitch and makes a few observations regarding Wade\u2019s technique. When Wade turns for a second later in the over, Archer stands right in his way, forcing Wade to settle for a single. This is great stuff. \u201cBritish television commentary waaaay too jingoistic,\u201d says Kylie. \u201cConsiderable difference to the commentary of the Australian matches, where there is always a real appreciation for talent, no matter the cap colour.\u201d 15th over: Australia 44-4 (Smith 10, Wade 0) And all the while, Steve Smith bats on. Broad is targeting his stumps, knowing that one bit of uneven bounce could do the job. Smith is so good that he probably has a way of controlling consistency of bounce as well. A maiden from Broad, and now it\u2019s Jofra Archer to Matthew Wade, who was particularly vocal when Archer was batting earlier today. \u201cRob,\u201d says Kim Thonger, \u201cif David Warner gets concussed in the next Test will his like for like replacement be an actual real live quacking feathered duck? #askingforafriend\u201d 14th over: Australia 44-4 (Smith 10, Wade 0) This is getting a bit lively. There was a full and frank exchange of views between Labuschagne and the England fielders when he left the field. One of the England team, I\u2019m not sure who, waved him off; Labuschagne kept snapping his head round to have his say. And now the ever popular Matthew Wade is walking to the crease. There were words between Head and Archer during that over, before Archer settled matters with a sizzling 92mph delivery that nipped back through the gate to send the middle stump flying. Jofra Archer has cleaned Travis Head up with a jaffa! 13th over: Australia 40-3 (Smith 10, Head 8) Head survives an optimistic LBW appeal from Broad. It was easily missing leg. An otherwise good over ends with a rank bad ball - short, wide and belaboured through extra cover for four by Smith. \u201cWarner has a Test match average of 46, Khawaja 40,\u201d says Jon McKinley. \u201cIt\u2019s debatable whether one is \u2018vastly superior\u2019 to the other. But it\u2019s not debatable that Warner is having a wretched Ashes, averaging less than 10 in 8 innings. When current form is so awful, is sticking to the line that \u2018he\u2019s had a great career\u2019 the best basis for selection?\u201d Well, a great career buys you more time when you hit a rough patch, and that\u2019s surely correct. Selection is a tricky balance between the short, medium and long-term. You can\u2019t just drop everyone who\u2019s out of form, but equally there comes a point when bad form can no longer be ignored, especially if you look like a walking wicket against a particular bowler. 12th over: Australia 35-3 (Smith 6, Head 7) Head gets off the mark with a lofted square drive to the boundary off Archer, who moves back over the wicket in response. He is consistently over 90mph now, and an edge from Head falls just short of Stokes in the slips. The resulting single means he has one delivery at Steve Smith, the first in this innings. Smith defends it nicely. \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Kim Thonger. \u201cI incorrectly indicated to Geoff Lemon earlier that nobody in Madrid has heard of Steve Smith. We have now encountered two very nice Australians who of course HAVE heard of Steve Smith but we struck a bargain with them. We kept supplying them with red wine and didn\u2019t talk about Brexit and in return they didn\u2019t gloat about his batting average. Storm warning. Brace yourself Barcelona, Jimmy and Donna Dean from Perth, Western Australia are heading your way in mid-season form off their long run up!\u201d 11th over: Australia 28-3 (Smith 6, Head 0) A short ball from Broad follows Smith and hits him on the glove. It deflects towards backward short leg, so Head sets off looking for a run. Smith sends him back, and the throw whistles past Archer, who had backed up at the bowler\u2019s end, to the boundary. Four runs to Smith. But he\u2019s having a really tough time against Broad, who beat him twice outside off stump during another brilliant over. He has quietly had a superb series. \u201cJoe Burns,\u201d says Pete Salmon. \u201cSixteen Tests, four 100s, four 50s, average 40.10 (Bancroft 26.23, Harris 29.50), last Test 180 v Sri Lanka. Presumably on his couch in Queensland knocking off a last beer before bedtime... Ridiculous before the first Test, ridiculouser now, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Perhaps. But if Burns is recalled in the next few months, he might reflect that this was a very good series to miss. 10th over: Australia 24-3 (Smith 2, Head 0) Head plays a vile shot to his first ball, a loose drive that meets only fresh air. Archer, who is really in the mood, rams an excellent bouncer past Head\u2019s, erm, noggin. England could run through Australia here, but I fear all roads lead to defeat. Marnus Labuschagne fails for the first time in the series. He pushed around a lovely nipbacker from Archer which hit him on the flap of the pad. It was straight enough, but Labuschagne thought it might have been bouncing over the stumps. In fact it was umpire\u2019s call, so the original decision stood. But Australia do keep their last review. He\u2019s gone! Australia review! Labuschagne has been given out LBW to Archer. It looked good to me, but Labuschagne has gambled the last review. 9th over: Australia 24-2 (Labuschagne 11, Smith 2) It\u2019s usually a lamentable idea to bowl straight to Smith, but the uneven bounce might tempt England to do so, especially early in his innings. Broad cuts him in half with a lovely nipbacker that has Smith staring, open-mouthed, at the pitch. I suspect that was for the benefit of England\u2019s batsmen; Labuschagne did something similar a few minutes ago. The pitch isn\u2019t that bad. But it is doing a bit, and Smith ends an excellent over from Broad by leaving a ball that just misses the off stump. 8th over: Australia 24-2 (Labuschagne 11, Smith 2) Archer has been much sharper than in the first innings, and he beats Labuschagne with a gorgeous legcutter. Labuschagne nods respectfully down the pitch and then fends the next ball wide of gully for four. \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cAustralia 162 all out. England set 359 to win. What are the chances ...\u201d 500-1, surely. Thanks Geoff, hello everyone. This is stirring stuff from England, even if it all feels a bit too late. The uneven bounce is particularly ominous for England\u2019s survival prospects. 7th over: Australia 18-2 (Labuschagne 5, Smith 2) Right then. England have to get Smith. They haven\u2019t found a way yet this summer but they need one now. The lead is already 212. They have to get him cheaply, with some pressure in the match and the crowd on his back. Broad has one keep low and almost burrow into the pads, but Smith gets bat to it. Steps across to blunt the next couple. He already looks so much more in control. But the erratic bounce of this pitch could be the thing to do him in. He reaches for a very wide ball to end the over, driving it out through cover for two. Game on! And plenty to come. That\u2019s it for me, Rob Smyth will take you through the rest of the day. The decision is reviewed after a long chat between Harris and Marnus. This is identical to the Warner ball really, wide from around the wicket from a right-armer to a left-hander. Coming in with the angle and beating the shot to take the batsman\u2019s pad. No reason to review that really, it was never likely to be doing too much. And Australia\u2019s openers once again make nothing to speak of between them. It will be Smith and Labuschagne once again... 6th over: Australia 16-1 (Harris 6, Labuschagne 5) A maiden for Archer... 5th over: Australia 16-1 (Harris 6, Labuschagne 5) Broad has done the early damage, but loses his control in this one. Starts by flinging a ball down the leg side for four byes. Not wides. Then overpitches to Labuschagne, who drives him through cover for four! Off the mark with a belting shot. Scott Lowe writes in. \u201cHow do you think the selectors are going to justify keeping Warner after dropping Khawaja? They have not been the most consistent bunch, but surely on the same criteria Warner cannot play in the fifth Test.\u201d Again, one\u2019s career is vastly superior to the other. Apples and oranges. 4th over: Australia 6-1 (Harris 4, Labuschagne 0) Runs off the bat at last, as Harris drives Archer down the ground for four. Archer is cranking up past 90 miles per hour by now. \u201cAll set up for a Broad Special,\u201d writes George Humphreys. \u201cYou know he will have been fuming that Stokes and Archer have had all the attention...\u201d 3rd over: Australia 1-1 (Harris 0, Labuschagne 0) Another test for Marnus L, who could match Mike Hussey with 50+ scores in his first five Ashes innings. Almost runs himself out for a duck though, pushing to point and setting off before turning back. David Warner had never made a pair in a Test match before today. About fifty emails already calling for him to be dropped. People forget 21 Test centuries pretty quickly. 2nd over: Australia 1-1 (Harris 0, Labuschagne 0) Jofra Archer to bowl, and he\u2019s nudging up towards 88 miles per hour in hsi first over. Bowls a mix of excellence and rubbish, including a no-ball and a bouncer way too high, and a wide ball that Harris carves away but straight at cover and can\u2019t get a run. \u201cRight England, no more wickets please!\u201d emails Grif. \u201cBest way of getting Smith out is to not let him in!\u201d 1st over: Australia 0-1 (Harris 0) Well, Warner took the first ball. This is interesting, he usually goes second. Warner chose to confront his problem and take Broad on. Stabs down at a ball and keeps it out of his pads. Gets an absolute snorter that explodes off the pitch and up past the outside edge. Then the last ball sears in from a middling length from around the wicket, keeps a bit low, and has Warner hopping but beaten by the angle and elevation, smashing into his pad in front of middle. Broad doesn\u2019t even turn around to appeal, and Warner walks straight off. Eight balls for three ducks against Broad in Warner\u2019s last three innings. Warner is gone! Six times in the series for Broad, and six balls faced today by Warner. The dominance continues. Robbie Chedburn emailed a little while ago. \u201cAs we are approaching the Aussie second innings what do you think of setting David Warner back in the order a bit? He\u2019s such an attacking batsman and arguably Australia want to accumulate quickly today if he can be protected from the new ball he could really add runs quickly.\u201d It\u2019s not crazy, but I think he\u2019s so firmly a career opener that there would have been no consideration of that. It would have looked like hiding, even if it was tactically sound, and it might have thrown off his concentration. Things to watch in this innings: Is Ben Stokes fit? He had a side problem in the first innings. England\u2019s camp said he \u201cwill bowl if required,\u201d whatever that means. Of course he\u2019ll be required. Will Jofra Archer get his mojo back? Struggled in the first dig, is needed here. Can David Warner make any runs? Or will Stuart Broad keep monstering him? Can Steve Smith get another hit and rack up another ton? He has 589 in four innings, meaning it\u2019s not completely impossible that he could chase Bradman\u2019s unchaseable 974 in seven innings in the 1930 Ashes. Given the clatter of wickets in the first session, England did pretty well to get beyond lunch. We\u2019ve got rid of 33 overs today, plus a couple for the change of innings. That still leaves something like 60 more today and another 98 tomorrow, which should still be more than enough for Australia to rack up a lead and bowl England out, but we\u2019ve all seen that cricket isn\u2019t always that simple. What happens next? 107 overs: England 301-10 (Leach 4) Bowled! It\u2019s all over. Last ball of the over. Pat Cummins returns for Lyon, who hasn\u2019t been able to do any damage in this innings. The field has come back to a regulation setting. Rather than trying to work a single from the last ball he tries to hit it into the media centre, misses some deck off the seam, and loses off stump. 106th over: England 301-9 (Buttler 41, Leach 4) Buttler decides that it\u2019s time to go. He drags a drive off the inside half past mid-on and gets back for two. Tries to wallop over cover and skews a lobbed shot that plugs in the deep for two more. Then gets a full ball and creams it through cover! England go past the follow-on mark and reach 300, then Buttler takes a single to farm strike. Every run and every over is a little extra help to England. 105th over: England 292-9 (Buttler 32, Leach 4) Buttler takes a single from the fifth ball of Lyon\u2019s over. Keeps strike. 104th over: England 291-9 (Buttler 31, Leach 4) Leach with Starc to deal with. Hops across to block one, ducks a bouncer. Then he drives Mitchell Starc for four! Wasn\u2019t intending to, it was just a straight push, but he times it nicely, beats mid-off, and rolls down the ground. Matthew Wade belts after it, dives, scoops back... but his elbow is touching the rope. The crowd go up! Just as well for Leach, because he\u2019d stopped in the middle of the pitch to chat with Buttler and might have been run out. Last ball of the over, and... hit on the pad! Appeal! Not out! And that was hitting leg stump, says HawkEye. Starc just laughs in disbelief, he was sure it was plumb. Australia have no reviews left,once again. It had some angle on it, looked halfway like it might be sliding down, but HawkEye says smashing leg stump. Brace yourself for the response. 103rd over: England 287-9 (Buttler 31, Leach 0) Buttler is in two minds about what to do here. He plays a big swat at Lyon, along the ground to mid-off for none. Then prods and gets an inside edge past his stumps for none. Then tries to cut a single but hits it too well and gets four! With the leg-side field packed and close, he can\u2019t turn a single from the last ball. 102nd over: England 283-9 (Buttler 27, Leach 0) Big cheers as Jack Leach comes to the crease. What can he do with the bat this time, in a summer of big innings for him. He defends Starc\u2019s sixth ball and survives. Bowled him! Straight through, and Starc\u2019s record of hitting timber continues. The over starts with swing and difficulty, Broad somehow getting a bit of bat on it. Then hops across his stumps and tries to glance, but misses. The same again. But eventually a length ball seams back into the left-hander a bit, beats his prod, and takes his off stump out of the ground. 101st over: England 283-8 (Buttler 27, Broad 5) Lyon again to Broad, who manages to squeeze a single after a few balls. You keep thinking that Buttler will tee off against Lyon, but he plays circumspectly with the ball still spinning big, and only keeps out the last ball rather than trying to work the strike. Broad will have to face Starc for up to a whole over. 100th over: England 282-8 (Buttler 27, Broad 4) Starc to continue after his one over before the break, and Buttler is willing to take the single from the second ball. I\u2019m not sure about that, Starc could run through Broad more easily than most. Not this time though, as Starc bowls too much on leg stump and it thuds away for a leg bye. Buttler aims a big drive but straight to mid-off. Misses the next down leg side. Then hit on the pad from an inside edge. 16 to avoid the follow-on. 99th over: England 280-8 (Buttler 26, Broad 4) Back from the buffet and ready to rumble. Lyon has changed ends, given that Starc changed ends before the break. Lyon is now bowling from the Statham end of the ground, facing the Pavilion. Broad is facing, adding a couple of runs on the sweep before carefully extending his long limbs to block out the rest. That\u2019s a definite concern. We saw how it ruined Aaron Finch for a good six months or so. He finally got his mojo back for the World Cup, but playing Test cricket didn\u2019t help him beyond being something he had wanted to achieve. Roy looks pretty miserable out there for the most part, and that\u2019s reflected in the poor fielding too. A tiny victory for England, at least making sure that they\u2019ll take two more overs out of the game for the innings changeover, whenever that may be. Every additional over that they can take out by batting could be vital, and a double whammy: not just the overs that England bat, but each run they score is a run that Australia have to take the time to score back. England are 20 short of avoiding the follow-on, but after bowling 98 overs there is no chance that Australia will enforce it. They will bat again, add to their lead which is currently 219, then declare when they feel very, very safe. Or Jos Buttler will make a freakish hundred with the tail and Australia will bat for a draw, or Australia will be rissoled in the third innings and England will have a decent target to chase. Or it will rain. Some of those are less likely than others. It\u2019s lunch time! Grab a sandwich, and I\u2019ll be back in a bit. 98th over: England 278-8 (Buttler 26, Broad 2) Bowling change, Starc with the last over before lunch. Buttler\u2019s tactics have changed, as he glides the second ball to third man but doesn\u2019t take a single. No interest in giving Starc a look at Broad. Nearly bowled third ball, left alone near off stump! Nearly bowled fourth ball, by one that shapes into the right-hander, beats his inside edge and misses his off stump. Starc errs too wide with the fifth, and as the field creeps in, the sixth is just wide enough to leave. Buttler survives! England get to lunch! 97th over: England 278-8 (Buttler 26, Broad 2) Half the field is on the fence, half is up. Two slips, cover, mid-on, mid-off. Then in the deep, third man, point, square leg and long leg. Buttler chooses the third ball to work a single square of the wicket. Broad with a short leg, leg gully, and a point quite close. Only long leg is deep. Short balls coming. Ducked. The next hits him, on the shoulder as he turns away. It\u2019s a no-ball. Broad won\u2019t like that because now he has to face another. I wonder if that was deliberate, just to have another couple of balls at him. Broad blocks out the rest of the over though. Buttler needs to find 20 more runs to avoid the follow-on. (Not that Australia will enforce it. But it\u2019s nice to do.) 96th over: England 276-8 (Buttler 25, Broad 2) Lyon to the left-handed Broad, with two slips in place, but Broad eases it wide of the second and gets through for a single. The field spreads for Buttler, so he takes advantage of that by driving another run. Happy for Broad to face up. Lyon shreds a ball away from the bat, but Broad leaves. A straight one from around the wicket could do him. The next beats the edge and Paine takes the bails. Another over done. Eight minutes until the scheduled lunch, but the umpires might extend the session at eight wickets down. The follow-on is 22 away. \u201cIs every second email complaining about lack of discipline?\u201d asks Andrew Hammet. In short, yes. But go on. \u201cEnglish batsmen like impatient kids, not able to just stick at something for a while \u2013 like defending? I am puzzled as to how they just fall regularly for the offer to swing at one. Like everybody else?\u201d Like everybody else. 95th over: England 274-8 (Buttler 24, Broad 1) Cummins to Stuart Broad then, who is no longer the most confident against fast bowling. He plays a couple of false shots, bouncing the ball near the keeper, then near the bowler. Cummins tries a bouncer but gets too carried away. It flies! Huge bounce, over the stepladder dweller in Broad, over Paine, and deemed five wides. Broad punches the fifth ball to point for a single, then Buttler flays a square drive for four! England are 24 away from avoiding the follow-on. 94th over: England 264-8 (Buttler 20, Broad 0) Lyon getting plenty of stick from the crowd, and Buttler drives him firmly through the covers for four! Top shot. Big appeal to follow though, as Buttler steps outside off to play, then decides to pad the ball away, but turns his body and lets it hit him. The Australians appeal, and it\u2019s an arse-before-wicket decision that they\u2019re asking for. Buttler has been hit on the butt(ler) in front of off stump. Paine reviews! I think they just want this comical moment immortalised in a dismissal. And it\u2019s not a bad shout, but HawkEye says the ball is just creeping over the off bail. Lyon finishes the over on leg stump, and Buttler glances another four! 93rd over: England 256-8 (Buttler 12) Very little left for Buttler then, with Broad coming down the staircase and Leach to come. Buttler has no interest in protecting Archer. Takes a single off his pads first ball, a no-ball, and leaves his teammate to the bowling. Most of the over is short balls for Archer to duck, but he has a big slash at a wide ball that misses, then a dabble at a ball closer to his body that produces an edge. Short and cramping him for room, and the last ball of the over brings his wicket. A simple take for Paine. 92nd over: England 254-7 (Buttler 11, Archer 1) Lyon on to bowl to Archer, in the hope that the tailender will play another daft slog like the one he tried at Headingley that could have cost them the run chase. Boundary riders to the leg side. The ball spinning into the pads, short leg interested. Archer restrains himself, keeps the bowler out. 91st over: England 254-7 (Buttler 11, Archer 1) Mitchell Starc can be so off, and then so on. He\u2019s barely playable at the moment, hooping another ball straight through Buttler that somehow misses his stumps. Then gets one that straightens and takes the outside edge, parried by Smith at slip for two. A third ball is well outside the off stump, bounces in front of the keeper, hits a rough spot of turf, and nearly whacks Paine in the face as it shoots up and over the keeper for four byes. How are batsmen supposed to anticipate anything? 90th over: England 248-7 (Buttler 9, Archer 1) Hazlewood to Archer, who does the right thing and doesn\u2019t try to swing anything to the fence. A lot of short balls, and he just gets out of the way. A maiden. Marie Meyer wants to know what the follow-on mark is: 297 is indeed the number. David Seare is arguing that Tim Paine should pop England back in and have Sunday off. That\u2019s great if it works, but if doesn\u2019t you have a cooked set of bowlers with three days until their next outing. 89th over: England 248-7 (Buttler 9, Archer 1) The new ball has done it for Starc, and Starc has done it for Australia. Both overnight batsmen removed by the left-armer without much scoreboard damage. Jofra Archer is next to the crease, and he strolls a single that should have seen him run out by yards. Buttler has little choice but to get things moving, surely? He gets an overpitched delivery from Starc and drives it gorgeously for four. All power. Before Stokes was out, Buttler had already driven the first ball of the over in the air for another four. That\u2019s the big one! Stokes caught at second slip. Starc is the bowler who has made the left-hander uncomfortable \u2013 he did in the World Cup and he has again this morning. And in the end he gets his man. Pace, a decent length, no appreciable swing, and it just had Stokes pushing down the line of his off stump but not quite covering the line of the ball, which takes the outside edge for a comfortable catch. England in real trouble now, still 50-odd runs short of the follow on. 88th over: England 238-6 (Stokes 26, Buttler 0) Back from the hydration interval, Hazlewood bowls short and he\u2019s hooked for four! Off the top edge, all streak, but it soars high and long! Mitch Marsh is standing in uffish mood in his orange vest outside the boundary behind the keeper and for a minute it looks like the ball will clobber him on the scone, but it bounces in front and he takes it calmly in one hand and lobs it back to Paine. How\u2019s this: Paine, having chased all the way back towards the rope by this point, takes the throw, throws it up in the air, hops over the rope, hops back in, and takes the rebound. Wicketkeepers don\u2019t get many chances for the boundary-line glory catch, so he practises when he can. Next ball Paine is in action again, diving and trying to stop a short ball that diverts from Stokes\u2019 hip, but it goes wide for four leg byes! \u201cDid anyone else spot a peculiar moment yesterday?\u201d asks David Brown. \u201cLyon removed and then swapped the bails at his bowling end. I believe this is a superstition of his. As soon as Lyon returned to walk back to his mark, Root,the non facing batsman, cheekily reversed the process.\u201d 87th over: England 230-6 (Stokes 22, Buttler 0) Starc looks a decent show against Stokes, who has taken Australia\u2019s right-armers apart with such composure in his last two Tests. A few hopping shots before the batsman gets one full enough to drive, though Cummins keeps the scoring to one from mid-on. Drinks. 86th over: England 229-6 (Stokes 21, Buttler 0) Just to the crease and Hazlewod is already giving Jos Buttler a working over. Past the outside edge. Into the body. \u201cCan you here the ridiculous noise from the microlites?\u201d asks Stephen Morley about the camera drones over the ground. \u201cAre the commentators not hearing this?Why is no one saying anything about it. It must surely be distracting for the players.\u201d I\u2019ve seen some suggestions that certain commentators may be the ones creating the drone. I can\u2019t hear it because I\u2019m inside, but I\u2019ll duck out later and investigate. 85th over: England 228-6 (Stokes 20, Buttler 0) Well. No mattter how loose Starc can be, there\u2019s always that chance of threat. A couple of balls after a short wide plonk that Bairstow clobbered through cover for four, there\u2019s the ball that Bairstow is expecting just outside off stump but that hits middle instead. It still was nowhere near the length to drive. A real mistake from Bairstow to be thinking anything but getting through the first few overs of the new ball. Here comes Mitchell Starc at last! Gets him this time, with another fast and swinging delivery. There was that sense of threat immediately with him bending the ball. But where Bairstow played the first over of that sensibly, this time he decides to play a big drive at the ball on his pads. Bad idea, as it curves in the air to beat his straight whack and take middle stump. 84th over: England 224-5 (Stokes 20, Bairstow 13) Hazlewood torches Stokes! Beaten all over. The ball cuts back into the left-hander off the seam, beats his inside edge and somehow creeps over middle stump! More close shaves than intake day for the Marines. Maiden. Alex emails from Whittington Hospital. \u201cLong time reader, first time emailer here. I\u2019m currently at A&amp;E after a fall this morning out running. Really enjoying focusing on the precarious nature of England\u2019s position to detract from my ailments. Keep up the great work!\u201d I was in St Vincent\u2019s when they brought Joe Root to emergency in 2018. Exclusive access. You might seem him come in to get his tackle repacked after that crotch shot he took yesterday from Starc. Get better soon Alex. I\u2019ve often said that running takes more lives than it saves. 83rd over: England 224-5 (Stokes 20, Bairstow 13) Stokes is looking ominous again. Gets a short ball from Starc that\u2019s an in-between length, so he plays a whip-wristed swat shot, like a tennis cross-court volley, out in front of square towards the boundary for two runs. Deep square leg is back for the bouncer. Starc combs back beautifully with a curling ball that takes the inside edge and... beats leg stump! For four runs! No control there, it should have bowled him but he\u2019s got away with it. Next ball, Stokes drives and he\u2019s dropped! Dropped by Starc in his follow-through! That went back fairly fast, a bit to Starc\u2019s right but he got both hands to it. We\u2019ve seen him take some unbelievable catches off his own bowling, one-handed and all. That was relatively simple in comparison, but it\u2019s gone down, and Stokes gets another run. You don\u2019t give Steve Smith chances, and you don\u2019t give Ben Stokes them either... (Well, obviously that\u2019s a meaningless statement because people do, and have, which is why I\u2019m saying it, and the fact that you shouldn\u2019t is an inherent precondition of the idea of a contest itself. But you know. There are things we have to say in reporting on sport, or the Guild writes a stern letter.) 82nd over: England 217-5 (Stokes 13, Bairstow 13) Hazlewood has the shiny new toy from the Anderson End, and immediately has the ball cutting back in as he did yesterday, up in an appeal but it was hitting Bairstow high on the thigh pad and slightly too close to leg stump. He overpitches next ball though, and Bairstow drives back past the bowler\u2019s dive and too straight for mid-off! Wade ends up on the turf as well. Four runs. Hazlewood comes back with another corker, decking back to miss the off stump by a fraction as Bairstow leaves. 81st over: England 213-5 (Stokes 13, Bairstow 9) New ball. New bowler. Mitchell Starc had a fairly dirty day yesterday, as you can read about in my piece below. He is of course the sort of bowler who can suddenly have a great day in the space of five or six balls. His first is on target, just outside Bairstow\u2019s off stump. His next two are beauties! Swing, from a fuller length, on the line of the off stump. One Bairstow allows to go just over his bails, the next he manages to get bat behind, just. He\u2019s teased by the fourth, leaving as it bends back towards him. Serious movement. Another, into the pads, but Bairstow is playing this tough over really well, hanging back and anticipating the swing and this time even scrambling a single as he deflects to leg. Starc with one ball at the lefty bowls a good fuller ball that starts on middle and swings to off, but Stokes reads it. Great start for the bowler. 80th over: England 212-5 (Stokes 13, Bairstow 8) The last over before the new ball becomes available. Bairstow drives a full ball back underneath Lyon for a single. Stokes clips cleanly square but straight to Warner at square leg. Steve Smith is back at first slip for the spinner, and there\u2019s a second slip in the form of Marnus Labuschagne. Stokes sees out the over. Kim Thonger emails from Madrid to say that nobody has heard of Steve Smith there. I\u2019d also guess that The Bull might have met a nastier end than he did in South Africa. 79th over: England 211-5 (Stokes 13, Bairstow 7) Lovely ball from Cummins! Across Stokes, then it decks off the seam away from the bat and just beats the edge. He was nowhere against that from over the wicket. Cummins too full the next ball though, and flicked fine for a run. Three slips for YJB who leaves the ball alone so as not to give any of them any work. Backward point for a big shot, no gully in the conventional sense. Short-ish cover, mid-off, mid-on, midwicket, but he splits the last two off his pads and Hazlewood fumbles as he dives to give away two extra runs, having to track back towards the boundary. Then nearly adds an overthrow but Wade at mid-off backs him up. 78th over: England 207-5 (Stokes 12, Bairstow 4) Big appeal against Bairstow who doesn\u2019t offer a shot! He was hit miles outside off stump but the ball is spinning miles. It could easily have turned enough, but there\u2019s no way an umpire can be sure of that, it would be guessing. HawkEye reckons it was missing off stump by a sliver. In the old days batsmen could pad up to those all day. Now you have to be careful. If the computer says yes... 77th over: England 206-5 (Stokes 11, Bairstow 4) Young Jonny Bairstow has a job to do, and so far he\u2019s being a good boy. Not trying anything expansive as he blocks and leaves a Cummins over. There\u2019s still a bit of conventional swing with the old ball, even at this stage of decrepitude. It\u2019s sprightly. 76th over: England 206-5 (Stokes 11, Bairstow 4) Nathan Lyon will start from the Jimmy Anderson End. Old mates, those two. Starc and Hazlewood to take the new ball in a few overs, presumably. Lyon gives it good flight and drop immediately, he doesn\u2019t need to warm up. The right-handed Bairstow has a look at him. There\u2019s big turn immediately for Lyon, one ball going all the way across Bairstow and past his legs from well outside off. He plays a similar ball off his pads but the backward square is in the right spot. Finally there\u2019s a single to end the over, tapped to midwicket. 75th over: England 205-5 (Stokes 11, Bairstow 3) Cummins may be feeling a bit stiff and sore after yesterday. He bowls a relatively gentle couple of first balls, then on the pads of Bairstow for a single. Drops too short to Stokes, who swivels and pulls in a contained fashion along the ground to deep backward for four. Cummins is on the money by the end of the over, just outside the left-hander\u2019s off stump at 87 miles per hour. Hello all, thanks JP. Pat Cummins will start the day after his marathon spell yesterday. Bairstow to face, Stokes at the far end, England 297 behind. Great mood in the ground already, it\u2019s still grey but not nearly as cold or windy today. Should be an excellent day of cricket ahead (here\u2019s hoping, anyway). Here\u2019s the TMS overseas link. Listen and watch, folks. There\u2019s a Geoff Lemon heading your way shortly to take you through the opening session of play. If you want to let him know your thoughts you can find him on Twitter or send him an email. I\u2019ll see you again tomorrow (presuming England don\u2019t do something utterly horrendous over the next few hours). \u201cWhat\u2019s all this \u2018only Australia can win\u2019 stuff?\u201d emails Andrew Cosgrove. \u201cI seem to remember England once played in a match where they were bowled out for 67, conceding a first innings deficit of plenty. I\u2019m pretty sure people were saying then, only one team could win that.\u201d That first-innings deficit was only 112, and time was not a factor. England are still 300 from a lead before they even have to contend with taking ten Australian wickets. So, yeah, I\u2019m comfortable tempting fate. Scott Blair wants to nominate another sunshine song to brighten your morning. \u201cIf we\u2019re looking for songs that contain encouraging thoughts about today\u2019s weather, the legendary Nazareth have it nailed. May the Sun Shine...\u201d Worth it for the braces alone. I like this image. Something a bit LS Lowry Going To The Match (2019) about it. All those people milling about on the oval, the grey sky, and the Manchester cityscape in the distance. Mitchell Starc seemed to be blossoming into the most feared bowler in cricket a couple of years ago but now he finds himself on the fringes of Australia\u2019s attack. Geoff Lemon put his considerable intellect towards figuring out why. Starc is the best white-ball bowler in the world. He can be unstoppable in a format where batsmen have to attack him and where the approach for his 10 overs is known ahead of time. One-day bowling is a sonnet, Test matches are a verse novel. The tyranny of the white page applies to the white clothes. Simon McMahon is joining in with the Brexit bantz. \u201cI think I might have heard this somewhere else this week, but let\u2019s just get this done, eh? If Stokes goes first ball we can all then get on with the rest of our day. It\u2019d be nice if the series went to the Oval, but that\u2019s just more delay. Get it done now. I\u2019d rather be ... well, you get the point.\u201d Rory Burns has been one of England\u2019s few bright spots this series so far and he showed again yesterday he has the temperament to open the batting for his countries for many years to come. Barney Ronay sings his praises here. Burns has been a little frantic against the short ball. Understandably so. County cricket does not provide regular 90mph pace trios to help groove your method. But something has changed here. Burns is a problem-solver, a man constantly refining his technique, an example what the tracksuited gurus on the A team tours he was never asked to attend would probably call a Growth Mindset. And after his heroics with the bat Burns did his best with the chat, speaking to an assembled press gallery containing Ali Martin. We\u2019re in a fight and it\u2019s very obvious what we need to do. A couple of good partnerships and then we are up close to them, and we\u2019re asking them to make a play. We have got to look at from a positive aspect. The way Headingley went, anything is possible. The pitch: Still looks full of runs to me. Those footmarks will encourage Nathan Lyon bowling to England\u2019s left-handers, but apart from that no obvious demons. \u201cGood morning,\u201d howdy John Starbuck. \u201cHow does this Fourth Day compare with other Fourth Days in the Ashes (apart from Headingley)?\u201d Presuming this is a literal question and I\u2019m not missing some subtext, Steve Smith was batting at the start of the fourth day in the opening two Tests. Although, there\u2019s a good chance if you picked any slice of time during this series the answer would be the same. Slap on the factor 50, knot your hankie, and make sure that portable hand-held plastic fan thingy has a brand new battery in it, today is going to be a belter. Well, comparatively. In the way that The Wiggles occupying the front bench of the House of Commons would be an upgrade on the current state of parliament. For the first time this Test the Met Office reckons there is practically no chance of rain falling on Old Trafford, and we may even see prolonged spells of sunshine. The scheduled 98 overs will be bowled with a gentle northerly, as opposed to the biting westerley that has turned a few fielders into Michelin men. The top, wait for it, could get as high as 17 (seventeen) degrees! Unfurl the bunting and pre-pour the pints, for today is a day to celebrate. Day three was nip and tuck Test cricket of the old fashioned variety and Vic Marks has written all about it right here. Three late-evening wickets from Josh Hazlewood have left England with a mighty struggle to save this game and keep the pursuit of the Ashes alive. In a six-over spell just before the intervention of bad light Hazlewood dispatched two of England\u2019s most adhesive batsmen, Rory Burns and Joe Root, who had assembled a dutiful partnership of 141. Then he clean bowled Jason Roy, who attracts many adjectives which do not, however, include \u201cadhesive\u201d, whether batting or fielding. Hello everybody and welcome to live OBO coverage of the fourth day of the fourth Test of the Ashes from Old Trafford. And what a day we have in store. After three rain-interrupted days the match is delicately poised. Australia are the only combatant with a chance of winning but to do so they must engineer 15 English wickets on a surface containing few demons; not to mention find enough time to plunder enough second-innings runs of their own to bolt the backdoor behind them. It\u2019s a well-worn cliche this series but the opening hour, and opening session, will be crucial. Should England survive the remaining six overs with the old ball and progress through the early stages of the second new Dukes without much alarm, Australia\u2019s task will grow in difficulty by the minute. A rapid collapse and England will be staring at an almighty rearguard action this evening and throughout tomorrow. Once again England turn to Ben Stokes for protection. He has the complexion of a Wildling and the glacial melt eyes of a White Walker but with Stokes on night\u2019s watch his teammates could sleep soundly knowing the best-equipped batsman in the team will be at the crease for potentially the most significant passage of play in the Test. Around him Jonny Bairstow, and in particular Jos Buttler - when he strides out as a specialist No.8 - must prove their worth. The latter is a luxury England can ill-afford in recent form, unless he switches codes and transforms into Steven Gerrard or Frank Lampard; but not both, never both, we don\u2019t want to open that can of worms again. Australia\u2019s day will be determined in two phases. In the morning session with the new ball the relentlessly impressive Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins will hope to recapture the venom that threatened to rip the match decisively their way late yesterday. After lunch all eyes turn to Nathan Lyon to exploit a surface that is increasingly receptive to spin. It all amounts to what should be an engrossing day of Test match cricket. If you want to be a part of it you can drop me a line on Twitter or you can send me an email.",

There has been a string of recycled jokes about Warner falling out of Broad\u2019s pockets at the end of the day, along with the car keys and the wallet and more references to bunnies than a copy of Watership Down.</p> <p>But beyond all this twaddle, how has it been achieved? How has Broad left Warner, the first opener on the teamsheet when drawing up a composite side before the series, fretting over his spot before Thursday\u2019s fifth Test at the Oval?</p> <p>The chat before this match was that Smith is one of cricket\u2019s best problem-solvers but the same also applies to Broad. Before the first Test he sat down to ponder where he had previously been falling short against Warner; why, in 18 previous encounters, he had removed him five times at 65 runs apiece. The conclusion? The left-hander\u2019s outside edge had become too great an obsession.</p> <p>By solely trying to bring the slips into play, Broad realised he had been feeding Warner\u2019s strengths, such that any width or drop in length was allowing those Popeye forearms to crash the ball through the covers or cleave it through midwicket. On Australian pitches in particular, where the bounce is true and the sideways movement fleeting, it was one-way traffic.</p> <p>But with the Duke ball in England he deduced that if he could target the stumps more from around the wicket and looked to bring the ball back into off stump off the seam from a fuller length, he would increase the possible modes of dismissal and reduce the scoring options. If it jags in, lbw and bowled are on; hold its line and the catchers behind the wicket would still be in the game.</p> <p>The former has mainly been at play. Of the six times Broad has dismissed Warner, three have been leg-before and one bowled (that bail-trimming beauty at Lord\u2019s). The other two show the funk he has been experiencing, with feathered edges behind from a dangled bat while trying to leave.</p> <p>It means Warner has drawn level with his old captain Michael Clarke as the batsman Broad has removed most times in Test cricket. Eleven is the magic number and it could well lead to Warner finishing the series as Australia\u2019s 12th man.</p>",

There has been a string of recycled jokes about Warner falling out of Broad\u2019s pockets at the end of the day, along with the car keys and the wallet and more references to bunnies than a copy of Watership Down. But beyond all this twaddle, how has it been achieved? How has Broad left Warner, the first opener on the teamsheet when drawing up a composite side before the series, fretting over his spot before Thursday\u2019s fifth Test at the Oval? The chat before this match was that Smith is one of cricket\u2019s best problem-solvers but the same also applies to Broad. Before the first Test he sat down to ponder where he had previously been falling short against Warner; why, in 18 previous encounters, he had removed him five times at 65 runs apiece. The conclusion? The left-hander\u2019s outside edge had become too great an obsession. By solely trying to bring the slips into play, Broad realised he had been feeding Warner\u2019s strengths, such that any width or drop in length was allowing those Popeye forearms to crash the ball through the covers or cleave it through midwicket. On Australian pitches in particular, where the bounce is true and the sideways movement fleeting, it was one-way traffic. But with the Duke ball in England he deduced that if he could target the stumps more from around the wicket and looked to bring the ball back into off stump off the seam from a fuller length, he would increase the possible modes of dismissal and reduce the scoring options. If it jags in, lbw and bowled are on; hold its line and the catchers behind the wicket would still be in the game. The former has mainly been at play. Of the six times Broad has dismissed Warner, three have been leg-before and one bowled (that bail-trimming beauty at Lord\u2019s). The other two show the funk he has been experiencing, with feathered edges behind from a dangled bat while trying to leave. It means Warner has drawn level with his old captain Michael Clarke as the batsman Broad has removed most times in Test cricket. Eleven is the magic number and it could well lead to Warner finishing the series as Australia\u2019s 12th man.",

Their formation caused us a few issues when we were out of possession, but it was a comprehensive victory in the end.\u201d Asked if there was any complacency on the part of England\u2019s players: \u201cWe can improve on what we did,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was no attitude or complacency ... every [opposition] team is going to have moments. I\u2019m generally pleased, some of our attacking play is very exciting.\u201d Daniel Taylor was at Wembley to see Harry Kane score a hat-trick as England swept Bulgaria aside. Next up for England: They face Kosovo, who are unbeaten in 15 matches, in Southampton on Tuesday. They\u2019re top of Group A, a point clear of the Kosovars as things stand and will hope to increase their lead. Meanwhile at Watford: Having announced the departure of Javier Gracia during the first half of England\u2019s match, Watford have announced the return of Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores to the helm during the second. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeeep!!! England canter to victory and go top of Group A following a fairly straightforward victory over a Bulgaria side that are a mere shadow of the great side that reached the World Cup semi-final at USA 94. Harry Kane scored two penalties on his way to a hat-trick, while Raheem Sterling was also on the scoresheet on a night Mason Mount came on as a substitute to make his debut. 90+2 min: Danny Rose picks up a needless booking for a late challenge on Anton Nedyalkov. 90+1 min: We\u2019re into added time of what\u2019s turned into a routine victory for England. They went in just one goal up at half-time, but subsequently put plenty of daylight between themselves and Bulgaria in the second half. 88 min: Rashford plays a magnificently deft one-two with Ross Barkley and finds himself through on goal when picking up the return pass. He attempts to lift the ball over Plaman Iliev, but the goalkeeper does brilliantly to save with his face. 87 min: Sarmov is fit to continue and on ITV commentary, Clive Tyldesley points out that it\u2019s the midfielder\u2019s 34th birthday today. That was a present from Rashford he could have done without. 85 min: A bad day gets considerably worse for Georgi Sarmov, who half turns to block a shot from Marcus Rashford and goes to ground in agony after taking it full force in the plums. 84 min: A soft-shoe shuffle from Danny Rose in the Bulgaria penalty area and he suddenly finds himself in a yard of space. He shoots from about seven or eight yards out, but his effort is blocked by Ivelin Popov. 82 min: Bulgarian left-back Anton Nedyalkov points into the middle distance for no apparent reason. There\u2019s nothing much else going on, so why shouldn\u2019t the man? 78 min: England substitution: Harry Kane off, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on. Despite scoring a hat-trick, Kane doesn\u2019t take the match-ball with him as he leaves the pitch ... which is probably a good thing, as there\u2019s still over 10 minutes to go. 76 min: From the free-kick, a little to the right of the D, Ivelin Popov aims for the top right-hand corner and Jordan Pickford touches it over the bar. From the ensuing corner, Bulgaria are denied a penalty when the ref fails to spot Ross Barkley shoving Kiril Despodov in the small of the back. The substitute made a meal of going to ground, but there was no doubt he deserved a spot-kick. 74 min: Harry Maguire is forced to concede a free-kick on the edge of his own penalty area after being played into a spot of bother by a rogue pass from Jordan Pickford. Kane scores his hat-trick! Harry Kane scores with ease, despite the goalkeeper guessing the right way this time. He fires to Iliev\u2019s right and the ball fizzes into the back of the net. Harry Kane is brought down by the substitute Dimitrov, who takes his standing leg from underneath him. 70 min: England substitute: Raheem Sterling off, Jadon Sancho on. Sterling has been outstanding for England tonight and is applauded off. 69 min: Mason Mount takes his first shot in anger as a senior England international. Hopefully his next one will be more accurate. 67 min: Bulgaria substitution: Marcelinho off, Kiril Despodov on. 65 min: Bulgaria substitution: central defender Nikolay Bodurov is replaced by Kristian Dimitrov. England substitute: Jordan Henderson makes way for Mason Mount, who comes on for his debut after just four Premier League appearances. 64 min: Vasil Bozhikov clears acrobatically to prevent another delivery getting to Kane. 63 min: Kieran Trippier sends a cross into the Bulgaria penalty area from the right, which is headed clear. 61 min: England attack on the counter, with Henderson on the ball. Barkley, Rice and Rose get involved as Bulgaria pour back in numbers. 57 min: Kane was put in behind down the inside left and looked up to see Sterling making a run into the penalty area. He did well to stay Kane-side of his marker and was able to direct the squared ball into the net with his knee or upper thigh from a matter of inches. It was unselfish play from Kane, who is on a hat-trick and would probably have fancied his chances of scoring himself. Sterling!!! The winger knees the ball home from all of one yard out, making no mistake as he got on the end of a Harry Kane dink from the left side of the six-yard box. 54 min: Strahil Popov passes to Ivelin Popov (still no relation), who is promptly dispossessed by Marcus Rashford in midfield. The Bulgarian is nothing if not dogged, however and quickly wins the ball back. 52 min: Going back to the penalty incident, Marcus Rashford did well to win the penalty. He\u2019d got past Bodurov and was trying to jink back inside. The Bulgarian tripped him with an outstretched leg and was penalised, but got away without being shown a second yellow card. 50 min: Harry Maguire leaps unchallenged to get on the end of a Ross Barkley corner-kick, but sends his effort wide from the edge of the penalty area. England double their lead. Harry Kane scores from the penalty spot after Marcus Rashford had been brought down in the Bulgaria penalty area by Nikolay Bodurov. 48 min: Wanderson blasts the ball straight at Pickford from a tight angle after getting in behind the England defence. 47 min: Wanderson plays the ball up the left flank for Bulgaria left-back Anton Nedyalkov to chase. His cross into the England penalty area is cleared by Harry Maguire. 46 min: Galin Ivanov gets the ball rolling for the second half, with his side a goal down. They immediately advance up the field, but Jordan Pickford is quick off his line to intercept a weighted pass in behind the English defence from deep. England lead at the break: It\u2019s been a fairly dreadful game in which Bulgaria defended reasonably stoutly before gifting England the lead while trying to be a little bit too clever. Harry Kane scored to put the home side ahead, but Bulgaria have squandered two good scoring chances of their own. 44 min: England lay siege to the Bulgaria penalty area. Georgi Sarmov clearly blocks a Marcus Rashford cross heading for Harry Kane with his arm, then laughs and pats his own shoulder when the England striker enquires if he\u2019d handled the ball. To repeat: VAR is not in use tonight. 43 min: Ross Barkley wins a corner for England. It\u2019s played short and an angle is created for Kieran Trippier to curl a cross into the penalty area. Harry Kane holds off Bodurov as he leaps to meet the ball with his head, but his effort is weak and straight at Iliev in the Bulgaria goal. 41 min: Harry Kane is flagged for offside as he receives a pass and prepares to swivel and put Raheem Sterling in behind. As games go, this is a very dull match and the atmosphere is predictably flat ... but England are doing enough to get the job done. 39 min: One presumes Watford hoped that by announcing the sacking of Javier Gracia during an England game on a Saturday afternoon, they hoped nobody would notice. That\u2019s worked well for them. Anyway, it\u2019s not as if we wouldn\u2019t all notice eventually ... not least when they walk out at Vicarage Road to play Arsenal next weekend and he\u2019s not there because he\u2019s been replaced by somebody else. 37 min: Bulgaria central defender Nikolay Bodourov is beaten for pace by Marcus Rashford and grabs a handful of the Englishman\u2019s shirt to prevent him from getting away. Yellow card! 36 min: Danny Rose arrows a cross into the Bulgaria penalty, but it\u2019s a little behind Harry Kane and a little too far ahead of Raheem Sterling. Bulgaria clear. 34 min: In the absence of anything much going on at Wembley, Watford have decided to liven up the evening by sacking their manager Javier Gracia. 30 min: On another Bulgarian counter-attack, Galin Popov crosses from the right to his namesake Ivelin Popov (no relation). It\u2019s on a plate for the midfielder, but his header is weak and doesn\u2019t trouble Jordan Pickford. 29 min: Bulgaria win a free-kick for a Keane foul on Marcelinho in the centre-circle. The England defender gets a yellow card for his troubles and can have few complaints. 28 min: Raheem Sterling sends another cross towards Kane, but his delivery is cut out by Georgi Sarmov, who makes a crucial interception. 25 min: Dearie me. Trying to play the ball out for from the back, Bulgaria goalkeeper Plaman Iliev tries to ping a pass towards Vasil Bozhikov on the edge of the penalty area. His delivery is wayward and goes straight to Raheem Sterling instead. Advancing towards the byline, he pulls a diagonal ball into the path of Harry Kane who slots home from six yards out. England lead. Slapstick stuff from Bulgaria allows them to go ahead. 20 min: Assorted England players pass the ball amongst themselves in the area between the halfway line and the edge of the centre-circle, keeping possession but making no progress up the pitch. It\u2019s dreary stuff. 19 min: Harry Kane strays offside before firing a cross from Raheem Sterling past Bulgaria goalkeeper Plaman Iliev at the end of a counter-attack. Close, but no cigar. 15 min: From the left flank, Danny Rose pulls an airborne cross towards Jordan Henderson, standing a couple of yards outside the bulgaria penalty area. He makes contact with a sweet volley, but sends the ball fizzing well wide of the goal. 13 min: England continue to press and dominate, but Bulgaria have had the only chance of note so far. Trippier tries to play Sterling in behind, but Anton Nedyalkov is quick to react and intercepts his delivery. 11 min: Raheem Sterling skips past Ivelin Popov and trys a shot from inside the Bulgaria penalty area. It\u2019s put out for a corner off Nikolay Bodurov but again, nothing comes from the set piece. 9 min: Barkley plays the ball wide to Danny Rose, who had cantered up the left flank towards the byline. He pulls the ball back into the Bulgaria penalty area and it\u2019s cleared. 7 min: Another feeble Wanderson shot goes out for a corner off the hand of Michael Keane. Nothing comes from the set piece. FYI: there\u2019s no VAR in use tonight, a state of affairs for which we should all be grateful. 5 min: CHANCE!!! Wanderson shoots tamely at Jordan Pickford from just inside the England penalty area after being teed up by Marcelinho, as Bulgaria galloped downfield on the counterattack. He should have done a lot better than that. 4 min: Assorted England players ping the ball around, halfway inside the Bulgaria half, trying to find a way through the 11 Bulgarian players in front of them. 3 min: Nothing comes of the corner, which was swung into the penalty area by Ross Barkley. Bulgaria half-cleared and that man Bozhikov was on hand to block a snap-shot from Raheem Sterling. 2 min: Bulgaria line up with a back five, setting out a rather defensive stall early doors. I\u2019m not sure any of their players have touched the ball yet. Vasil Bozhikov rectifies that situation, sliding in to dispossess Raheem Sterling and concede a corner. 1 min: England get the ball rolling, playing in white shirts, navy shorts and white socks. The players of Bulgaria wear red shirts, white shorts and red socks. Not long now: Despite somehow managing to clash heads in the warm-up, Harry Maguire and Declan Rice are both fit to start and take their places as the teams line-up and march out on to the Wembley sward and line up either side of the three match officials. Two Brazilians in the Bulgaria line-up: As you may have guessed from the line-ups, England\u2019s opponents are fielding two naturalised Brazilians tonight. Striker Marcelinho plays for Ludogorets, as does debutant winger Wanderson. Gareth Southgate speaks: He tells ITV that Jesse Lingard has been sent home with some manner of illness and will not be considered for Tuesday\u2019s game against Kosovo. He is then asked about his decision to opt for experience over youth. \u201cWe\u2019re always looking at training and at the opposition, to see what\u2019s going to be needed for the game,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to win football matches, it\u2019s not a case of just giving people caps. If we can blood young players as well, we\u2019ve always tried to do that.\u201d No real surprises in the England team: It\u2019s quite a \u201csafe\u201d selection and much as expected, with Michael Keane, rather than Joe Gomez, lining up beside Harry Maguire in the centre of defence. Jesse Lingard misses out after suffering from illness over the past couple of days ... although amore cynical observer than me might suggest he would have missed out anyway. On recent form he\u2019s not worthy of a place in the squad, let alone a place in the starting XI. Elsewhere, the inclusion of Marcus Rashford ahead of Jadon Sancho is bound to raise a few eyebrows, while Kieran Trippier and Ross Barkley get the nod ahead of Trent Alexander-Arnold and James Maddison. England: Pickford, Trippier, Keane, Maguire, Rose, Henderson, Rice, Barkley, Sterling, Kane, Rashford. Subs: Heaton, Pope, Gomez, Mount, Wilson, Mings, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Chilwell, Maddison, Winks, Sancho, Alexander-Arnold. Bulgaria: Iliev, Strahil Popov, Bodurov, Bozhikov, Nedyalkov, Sarmov, Galin Ivanov, Ivelin Popov, Malinov, Wanderson, Marcelinho. Subs: Slavchev, Pashov, Goranov, Daniel Mladenov, Terziev, Lukov, Kristian Dimitrov, Nikolay Dimitrov, Hristo Ivanov, Milanov, Despodov, Kraev. Elsewhere in Group A: Kosovo and the Czech Republic played in Pristina earlier this afternoon, where the hosts emerged as surprise 2-1 winners. Kosovo are now top of the group, two points clear of England in second place, but have played two games more. Early team news: Manchester United right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka got his first England call-up last week, but was forced to stand down with a back injury, so will have to wait for his chance. Gareth Southgate is expected to go with experience, which means Mason Mount, Tyrone Mings and James Maddison will probably start this game on the bench. While Jadon Sancho and Michael Keane could start for England, early speculation suggests Southgate will pick the following XI: Pickford; Trippier, Gomez, Maguire, Rose; Henderson, Rice, Barkley; Sterling, Rashford, Kane. For Bulgaria, midfielders Todor Nedelev and Georgi Kostadinov, along with centre-back Bozhidar Chorbadzhiyski are all unavailable. Wembley is the venue for what should \u2013 repeat, should \u2013 be a fairly routine victory for England on their way to qualification for Euro 2020. In Bulgaria, they face opponents who are 56 places below them in the Fifa rankings and currently bottom of the Group. This is the teams\u2019 first meeting since a qualifier for Euro 2012. On that occasion England ran out easy 3-0 winners, courtesy of a goal for Gary Cahill followed by a Wayne Rooney brace. Kick-off at Wembley is at 5pm, but stay tuned for team news and build-up in the meantime.",

The nation\u2019s failure to adapt to changing conditions was underlined this summer when severe flooding crippled train schedules, temperatures reached record levels and residents of Whaley Bridge, in Derbyshire, were evacuated after heavy rain damaged a dam on a nearby reservoir. Much worse is predicted for the next few decades but little is being done to protect the nation\u2019s infrastructure - such as adapting care homes and hospitals so residents and patients do not suffer as temperatures soar or protecting coastal towns against rising sea levels. \u201cYet we also possess powerful agencies like the Met Office,\u201d said Brown. \u201cIt is developing detailed climate predictions for regions with an accuracy of a few kilometres. But we are not making use of these capabilities.\u201d In fact, the priority given to adaptation to these threats has been eroded over the past 10 years. \u201cWe have been distracted by Brexit,\u201d Brown added. She pointed to pressures on the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which is in charge of ensuring Britain adapts to the climate crisis but has been concentrating on finding replacements for the EU common agricultural policy and dealing with other Brexit-related issues. In July, the CCC warned that the country was not prepared for even a 2C rise in temperatures, let alone more extreme warming. \u201cMany policies still lack a basic acknowledgement of climate change, while others make a passing mention but have no associated actions to reduce risk.\u201d",

Campaigners have criticised the approach as \u201ccompletely incoherent\u201d.</p> <p>Since Yemen\u2019s civil war escalated in 2015, the economy has collapsed, hunger has become so widespread that the UN has warned <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/03/1035501\" title=\"\">10 million people are on the brink of famine</a> and there have been devastating outbreaks of infectious diseases including cholera.</p> <p>Britain has given \u00a3770m in food, medicines and other assistance to civilians in Yemen over the past half decade, the report by Oxfam found, making the country the sixth largest recipient of British aid. But over the same period it has made \u00a36.2bn of arms sales to members of the coalition fighting there, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK government\u2019s approach to Yemen is completely incoherent \u2013 on the one hand offering lifesaving aid to people devastated by the conflict, and on the other, helping to fuel that conflict by arming those involved,\u201d said Danny Sriskandarajah, Oxfam chief executive. The other members of the coalition fighting in Yemen who have bought UK arms since 2015 are Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Senegal and Sudan, the report said.</p> <p>The international alliance first intervened in Yemen\u2019s civil war in 2015 to try to restore the Yemeni government ousted from power by the Houthis, a rebel group backed by Iran. Thousands of civilians have been killed since then, with indiscriminate bombing by the Saudi-led coalition accused of being responsible for about two-thirds of the 11,700 killed in direct attacks.

      "bodyText": "Britain has earned eight times more from arms sales to Saudi Arabia and other members of the coalition fighting in Yemen than it has spent on aid to help civilians caught up in the conflict, a report has found. Campaigners have criticised the approach as \u201ccompletely incoherent\u201d. Since Yemen\u2019s civil war escalated in 2015, the economy has collapsed, hunger has become so widespread that the UN has warned 10 million people are on the brink of famine and there have been devastating outbreaks of infectious diseases including cholera. Britain has given \u00a3770m in food, medicines and other assistance to civilians in Yemen over the past half decade, the report by Oxfam found, making the country the sixth largest recipient of British aid. But over the same period it has made \u00a36.2bn of arms sales to members of the coalition fighting there, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. \u201cThe UK government\u2019s approach to Yemen is completely incoherent \u2013 on the one hand offering lifesaving aid to people devastated by the conflict, and on the other, helping to fuel that conflict by arming those involved,\u201d said Danny Sriskandarajah, Oxfam chief executive. The other members of the coalition fighting in Yemen who have bought UK arms since 2015 are Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Senegal and Sudan, the report said. The international alliance first intervened in Yemen\u2019s civil war in 2015 to try to restore the Yemeni government ousted from power by the Houthis, a rebel group backed by Iran. Thousands of civilians have been killed since then, with indiscriminate bombing by the Saudi-led coalition accused of being responsible for about two-thirds of the 11,700 killed in direct attacks. The court of appeal in June ruled that arms sales to Saudi Arabia \u2013 which account for the vast majority of the total \u2013 were unlawful. The judgment also accused ministers of ignoring the question of whether airstrikes that killed civilians in Yemen broke international law. Liam Fox, then international trade secretary, responded by suspending new arms sales to Saudi Arabia while promising to appeal against the verdict. Oxfam called on the government to respect the court judgment, halt arms sales indefinitely, and focus its efforts on halting the conflict and getting more donations for emergency relief. The UN fund for Yemen has received only a third of the funds needed; most vaccination programmes have already stopped as a result. \u201cWhat the UK has given in aid to hungry, homeless Yemenis is dwarfed by what it has gained in arms sales to Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe UK should be doing everything it can to end the war.\u201d It also emerged recently that prime minister Boris Johnson, while foreign secretary in 2016, recommended that the UK allow Saudi Arabia to buy British bomb parts expected to be deployed in Yemen, days after an airstrike on a potato factory in the country had killed 14 people. A day after the sale was recommended for approval, a village school in Yemen was hit by another deadly airstrike, part of a pattern of recurrent strikes on civilian infrastructure including hospitals. Oxfam\u2019s report detailed multiple water treatment projects, a warehouse and a cholera treatment centre that were hit and damaged or destroyed by airstrikes between 2015 and 2018. Despite repeated requests, the charity has not been interviewed by the British Ministry of Defence or Saudi Joint Incidents Assessment Team about these attacks, it said. \u201cThe Saudi-led coalition are paying only a fraction of the true price of these arms sales,\u201d Sriskandarajah said. \u201cThe real cost is being borne by millions of Yemenis who have had to flee their homes, go without food and clean water, and endure outbreaks of disease.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Officials and family members are arguing over the arrangements for the burial of Robert Mugabe, the former Zimbabwean president who died in Singapore last week aged 95. High-ranking members of the ruling Zanu-PF party are understood to have told Mugabe\u2019s close family that his remains should be interred at a hilltop monument outside Harare, the capital, following a ceremony at the nearby national stadium, where dozens of prominent African leaders would be present. However friends and allies of Mugabe\u2019s second wife, Grace, have said that the late dictator made it clear he would prefer to be buried at his home town of Zvimba, about 60 miles from Harare, with only close relatives in attendance. They said that Mugabe, who was ousted in a military takeover in November 2017, did not want his death exploited for political gain by his successors. Mugabe\u2019s remains have yet to be repatriated from Singapore, where he died in a private clinic. Many of his close family members are there, including his widow, along with a team of senior officials. Last Friday evening, Emmerson Mnangagwa, president of Zimbabwe, declared Mugabe a \u201cnational hero\u201d and ordered days of mourning before the burial. He did not give any details of funeral arrangements, but his choice of words suggested he wanted to see Mugabe buried in the National Heroes Acre, a monument to the heroes of the war that overturned the white supremacist regime in the former British colony. Designed by Zimbabwean and North Korean architects, the plot has a commanding view of Harare and features a huge bronze statue of three guerrilla fighters and an eternal flame on a 40-metre tower. Though much of Mugabe\u2019s 37 years in power was marked by violence, economic mismanagement and corruption, the former guerrilla fighter is still revered as a liberation leader. Many in Zimbabwe see him as a national hero, remembering his role in the war against white rule. Flags flew at half-mast yesterday, but there were no public activities to mark the death of a man whose legacy includes a shattered economy, pariah status on the international stage and a repressive political system dominated by the ruling party. The state-run Herald newspaper, which vilified Mugabe when he was forced to resign and when he subsequently voiced support for the opposition, carried glowing tributes. In a \u201ccommemorative edition\u201d the newspaper, which often acts as a mouthpiece of the government, praised Mugabe for \u201chis uncompromising stance when it came to the rights of Africans\u201d. A major ceremony and burial at the National Heroes Acre would allow the new rulers of Zimbabwe to showcase their respect for the man they ousted after nearly 40 years in power. \u201cIt would be very awkward for Mnangagwa and others if the funeral is in Zvimba and a family affair \u2026 They have always justified their actions as targeting those around [Mugabe], not him, and made a point of treating him well. This is the last act and they need to get it right,\u201d said Blessing-Miles Tendi, an associate professor of African politics at Oxford University and author. Officials said they were surprised at the apparent bitterness that had caused the former dictator to shun a state funeral. A senior party official told the Observer: \u201cThe family is being engaged intensely. The funeral is state funded, all expenses paid to Singapore and back, so that should aid the process. \u201cThere have been discussions before on this matter \u2026 It has been going on for months now. Before such news gets to the public, a long process of engagement takes place. \u201cThe five family members who went to Singapore have yet to come back, and those who are here are also engaging in discussions among themselves.\u201d Mugabe\u2019s relatives are themselves also divided over the location and nature of the funeral. The late president\u2019s nephew, Leo Mugabe, said a decision had yet to be taken but denied that his uncle had given explicit instructions about his final resting place. \u201cWe are just waiting for the repatriation of the body before the full programme is known. We also had never discussed with my uncle before he died where he wanted to be buried so it\u2019s still unclear,\u201d he said. A spokesman for Zanu-PF, Simon Khaya Moyo, said a Heroes Acre burial was inevitable for Mugabe unless his family decided otherwise. \u201cThe body is not yet here so we cannot be certain on the burial arrangements,\u201d Moyo said. \u201cThe family is already discussing among themselves. He was declared a national hero and ordinarily he should be buried at the National Heroes Acre but it\u2019s up to the family and up to what he wanted himself, which we will only know when the body arrives.\u201d Mugabe was the most prominent surviving member of the generation who fought to free their countries from European colonial rule in Africa. \u201cThe death of Mugabe signals that the era of the 1960s liberation movement leadership is drawing to a close,\u201d said Piers Pigou, an expert on Zimbabwe with the International Crisis Group. Millions of Zimbabweans now face malnutrition, soaring inflation, up to 80% unemployment and a crumbling infrastructure. Medicines are in short supply and power cuts are common. \u201cEnd of an era as Mugabe dies, leaves Zim poor, divided,\u201d read the front-page headline of a privately owned newspaper in Zimbabwe, the Daily News. Tendai Biti, a former finance minister and opposition politician who was tortured by Mugabe\u2019s henchmen, said the dictator was a product of an era of struggle. \u201cHe was a victim of the system he created. The revolution ate its own children and he was the first-born child of that revolution,\u201d said Biti, who is an MP and vice-president of the Movement for Democratic Change.",

You just needed the will to do what the other guy wouldn\u2019t.\u201d If they broke even gangsters\u2019 lax conventions \u2013 not just kill a rival but his wife and kids \u2013 they would dominate.</p> <p>Johnson is showing a ruthlessness no one has seen in British politics. \u201cWhen are you fucking MPs going to realise we are leaving on 31 October? We are going to purge you,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-ie/news/brexit/conservatives-rising-anger-at-cummings-role-in-purge-of-brexit-rebels/ar-AAGQsqq\" title=\"\">the <em>Mail</em> reported</a> Dominic Cummings screaming at Greg Clark. Cummings and Johnson duly purged not just the former business secretary but two former chancellors of the exchequer, Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson and 18 other \u201cfucking MPs\u201d who refused to do as they were told.</p> <p>You don\u2019t give men like this the benefit of the doubt or pretend that nothing has changed. Harold Macmillan\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18722428\" title=\"\">Night of the Long Knives</a>\u201d in 1962 destroyed his reputation for calm confidence. But there\u2019s no comparison. Macmillan merely sacked seven colleagues from his cabinet. He did not destroy them as Johnson and Cummings have done: strip them of the Conservative whip and end their careers by making it impossible for them to return to parliament.</p> <p>We are in a new world and as opposition parties confronted with political gangsters from Trump\u2019s America to Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary have learned, you must believe them capable of anything and act accordingly. The British opposition should not think of trusting Johnson to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d. It should ask how it can stop him and, once it has an answer, find the determination to act. Not trusting Johnson means there cannot be an election before late November, because parliament must be sitting in the days after Saturday 19 October when Johnson will be mandated by act of law to seek an article 50 extension from the EU.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The opposition should wait until it is sure he has no tricks to pull, which\u2026 means no election before 21 November</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If you treat the Johnson administration as a crime gang, you will understand why. Parliament is dissolved for a general election and does not meet again for five weeks. What happens if Johnson takes the chance to refuse to ask for an extension to article 50? That, apparently, is his intention. He\u2019d \u201crather be dead in a ditch\u201d than obey the law, <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/conservative-party/boris-johnson/news/106326/boris-johnson-i-would-rather\" title=\"\">he said on Thursday</a>. As the pressure built and he started to crack, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/boris-johnson-will-use-powers-persuasion-win-new-brexit-deal\" title=\"\">he stammered on Friday</a>: \u201cI will not ex\u2026 I don\u2019t want a delay.\u201d </p> <p>Constitutional lawyers and opposition MPs believe that, though he might have trashed parliament and the Conservative party, Johnson cannot trash the rule of law. He would be taken to court and found in contempt. Rather, that is what they assume, because there are no precedents.</p> <p>The only case law comes from 1994 when the court of appeal ruled that the home secretary <a href=\"https://www.lawteacher.net/cases/m-v-home-office.php\" title=\"\">could be held in contempt</a> after his officials unlawfully deported a Congolese asylum seeker. In truth, the case offers little help. The asylum seeker was deported by mistake \u2013 this is the Home Office we are talking about. It was an accident, a blunder that is not comparable with the supreme court ordering Johnson to go to Brussels to demand an extension or be confined in solitary in the nonces\u2019 wing at Belmarsh to protect him from attacks from prisoners who do not appreciate his hard line on law and order, delightful though that prospect is.</p> <p>Lawyers prepared to imagine such a future are certain that judges would want parliament to depose Johnson with a vote of no confidence and save them from jailing a prime minister. But parliament cannot intervene if it is not sitting.</p> <p>Too fanciful? Try a second scenario. Constitutional lawyers purr with admiration when they contemplate the drafting of Hilary Benn and Alistair Burt\u2019s bill forcing Johnson to seek an extension if his phantom negotiations fail. They are particularly struck by the beauty of <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/brexit/negotiations/the-benn-burt-bill-another-article-50-extension/\" title=\"\">subsection 3</a>, which seems to cover all bases. If the EU offers an extension date other than 31 January 2020, Johnson will either have to accept it or return to the Commons to ask its opinion. It appears to be foolproof or Johnson-proof, which amounts to the same thing. But no one should be surprised if government and Vote Leave lawyers are busy looking for reasons to challenge it in court.

      "bodyText": "In The Usual Suspects, Kevin Spacey has a line for all Remainers laughing at the sight of Boris Johnson striding to power and then tripping over his shoelaces and falling flat on his face. He tells of a \u201cgang of Hungarians that wanted their own mob. They realised that to be in power, you didn\u2019t need guns or money or even numbers. You just needed the will to do what the other guy wouldn\u2019t.\u201d If they broke even gangsters\u2019 lax conventions \u2013 not just kill a rival but his wife and kids \u2013 they would dominate. Johnson is showing a ruthlessness no one has seen in British politics. \u201cWhen are you fucking MPs going to realise we are leaving on 31 October? We are going to purge you,\u201d the Mail reported Dominic Cummings screaming at Greg Clark. Cummings and Johnson duly purged not just the former business secretary but two former chancellors of the exchequer, Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson and 18 other \u201cfucking MPs\u201d who refused to do as they were told. You don\u2019t give men like this the benefit of the doubt or pretend that nothing has changed. Harold Macmillan\u2019s \u201cNight of the Long Knives\u201d in 1962 destroyed his reputation for calm confidence. But there\u2019s no comparison. Macmillan merely sacked seven colleagues from his cabinet. He did not destroy them as Johnson and Cummings have done: strip them of the Conservative whip and end their careers by making it impossible for them to return to parliament. We are in a new world and as opposition parties confronted with political gangsters from Trump\u2019s America to Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary have learned, you must believe them capable of anything and act accordingly. The British opposition should not think of trusting Johnson to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d. It should ask how it can stop him and, once it has an answer, find the determination to act. Not trusting Johnson means there cannot be an election before late November, because parliament must be sitting in the days after Saturday 19 October when Johnson will be mandated by act of law to seek an article 50 extension from the EU. If you treat the Johnson administration as a crime gang, you will understand why. Parliament is dissolved for a general election and does not meet again for five weeks. What happens if Johnson takes the chance to refuse to ask for an extension to article 50? That, apparently, is his intention. He\u2019d \u201crather be dead in a ditch\u201d than obey the law, he said on Thursday. As the pressure built and he started to crack, he stammered on Friday: \u201cI will not ex\u2026 I don\u2019t want a delay.\u201d Constitutional lawyers and opposition MPs believe that, though he might have trashed parliament and the Conservative party, Johnson cannot trash the rule of law. He would be taken to court and found in contempt. Rather, that is what they assume, because there are no precedents. The only case law comes from 1994 when the court of appeal ruled that the home secretary could be held in contempt after his officials unlawfully deported a Congolese asylum seeker. In truth, the case offers little help. The asylum seeker was deported by mistake \u2013 this is the Home Office we are talking about. It was an accident, a blunder that is not comparable with the supreme court ordering Johnson to go to Brussels to demand an extension or be confined in solitary in the nonces\u2019 wing at Belmarsh to protect him from attacks from prisoners who do not appreciate his hard line on law and order, delightful though that prospect is. Lawyers prepared to imagine such a future are certain that judges would want parliament to depose Johnson with a vote of no confidence and save them from jailing a prime minister. But parliament cannot intervene if it is not sitting. Too fanciful? Try a second scenario. Constitutional lawyers purr with admiration when they contemplate the drafting of Hilary Benn and Alistair Burt\u2019s bill forcing Johnson to seek an extension if his phantom negotiations fail. They are particularly struck by the beauty of subsection 3, which seems to cover all bases. If the EU offers an extension date other than 31 January 2020, Johnson will either have to accept it or return to the Commons to ask its opinion. It appears to be foolproof or Johnson-proof, which amounts to the same thing. But no one should be surprised if government and Vote Leave lawyers are busy looking for reasons to challenge it in court. Once again, parliament cannot plug loopholes if it is off on a five-week election campaign. Alternatively, as many people are speculating this weekend, Johnson could resign and force Jeremy Corbyn to go to Brussels in his place. Who knows what he will do? I doubt he does. But if there is to be a new PM, would not MPs want to be in Westminster to have a say on the matter? The historian Peter Hennessy authored the \u201cgood chap\u201d theory of British government.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.atticalocke.com/\" title=\"\">Attica Locke</a> was born in Houston, Texas, in 1974, now lives in Los Angeles and is the author of five novels including <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/bluebird-bluebird-558435.html\" title=\"\"><em>Bluebird, Bluebird</em></a><em>,</em> a thriller that won both the Edgar and the Anthony award in 2018. Her new novel, <em>Heaven, My </em><em>Home</em>, is the sequel to <em>Bluebird, Bluebird</em> and part of her Highway 59 series exploring race, power and freedom and featuring the black Texas ranger Darren Mathews; in the new novel, he is searching for missing nine-year-old Levi, who comes from a family of white supremacists. Locke is also a screenwriter and producer, including for <em>Empire</em>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/02/when-they-see-us-planets-what-we-do-in-shadows-chernobyl-review\" title=\"\"><em>When They See Us</em></a> and <em>Little Fires Everywhere</em>.</p> <p><strong>What inspired you to write </strong><strong>about a Texas ranger?</strong><br>I\u2019d been working in television and got to know how much fun it could be hanging out with a character over a series. I came up with this idea that it would be a Texas ranger. I like underdogs and outsiders and I found a way he could be both and that is his fundamental contradiction: Darren is an authoritarian figure, but at the same time he\u2019s conflicted about it. When I ended <em>Bluebird, Bluebird</em> on a cliffhanger, I knew I had to come back and finish the story.</p> <p><strong>The novel explores </strong><strong>anxieties ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration...</strong><br>When I look back I will say they are a Trump-era series. I wrote <em>Bluebird, Bluebird</em> before Trump was elected \u2013 white-supremacist thought was present during his campaign, but I didn\u2019t believe he\u2019d ever be elected. I made the decision to set <em>Heaven, My Home</em> right before Trump was inaugurated as so many people felt anxiety in that window between election and inauguration. This book is more personal; I was wrestling with the concept of forgiveness. There was this incident at my daughter\u2019s school: a white kid called a black kid the N-word and I was shocked and filled with rage. My daughter had a willingness to forgive him. She\u2019s 12 now. I looked at the mother of the black child and started weeping and saw the child who said that word and I felt sick inside; that\u2019s where the character of Levi came from, trying to work out why I couldn\u2019t forgive a child. I\u2019m working from my own pain.</p> <p><strong>And did your feelings about forgiveness change?</strong><br>No. I still sit at a crossroads not knowing how I feel. Do black people always have to be the ones doing the forgiving? Do we go on being the bigger person into perpetuity, or is there a limit to forgiveness?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As a child I did a lot of looking out the window at creeks and people boiling peanuts from their pick-up trucks</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>You movingly explore the theme of home...</strong><br>The title <em>Heaven, My </em><em>Home</em> is from a blues song. A lot of black roots music can never quite pen a permanent location for home, and I think that speaks to the black American experience: when they came here not having a home that was theirs \u2013 they could be moved anywhere. For me, that music has served a real purpose. When I\u2019ve had struggles in my life where I felt racial pain, I play blues songs.</p> <p><strong>Where do you feel at home?</strong><br>I live in LA now, but Texas is my home in a way that will never be displaced in my heart and soul. It\u2019s the lens through which I see the world. I don\u2019t mean its current state or politics. I mean I come from rural, agrarian people. There\u2019s a fortitude I draw on when I struggle: a practicality of life that comes from my Texas upbringing, particularly my agrarian upbringing. Texas is very deeply my home.</p> <p><strong>A lot of your family come from towns along Highway 59. How did that spark your imagination?</strong><br>As a child we were always driving up and down 59 to see relatives. I didn\u2019t have an iPod or iPad back in the day, so I did a lot of looking out the window at creeks and pine trees and people selling fresh fruit and boiling peanuts out of their pick-up trucks. These are some of my earliest childhood memories. That\u2019s where the impulse to write about that came from.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/15/attica-locke-when-trump-was-elected-overnight-my-book-changed\">Attica Locke: \u2018When Trump was elected, overnight my book changed.

      "bodyText": "Attica Locke was born in Houston, Texas, in 1974, now lives in Los Angeles and is the author of five novels including Bluebird, Bluebird, a thriller that won both the Edgar and the Anthony award in 2018. Her new novel, Heaven, My Home, is the sequel to Bluebird, Bluebird and part of her Highway 59 series exploring race, power and freedom and featuring the black Texas ranger Darren Mathews; in the new novel, he is searching for missing nine-year-old Levi, who comes from a family of white supremacists. Locke is also a screenwriter and producer, including for Empire, When They See Us and Little Fires Everywhere. What inspired you to write about a Texas ranger? I\u2019d been working in television and got to know how much fun it could be hanging out with a character over a series. I came up with this idea that it would be a Texas ranger. I like underdogs and outsiders and I found a way he could be both and that is his fundamental contradiction: Darren is an authoritarian figure, but at the same time he\u2019s conflicted about it. When I ended Bluebird, Bluebird on a cliffhanger, I knew I had to come back and finish the story. The novel explores anxieties ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration... When I look back I will say they are a Trump-era series. I wrote Bluebird, Bluebird before Trump was elected \u2013 white-supremacist thought was present during his campaign, but I didn\u2019t believe he\u2019d ever be elected. I made the decision to set Heaven, My Home right before Trump was inaugurated as so many people felt anxiety in that window between election and inauguration. This book is more personal; I was wrestling with the concept of forgiveness. There was this incident at my daughter\u2019s school: a white kid called a black kid the N-word and I was shocked and filled with rage. My daughter had a willingness to forgive him. She\u2019s 12 now. I looked at the mother of the black child and started weeping and saw the child who said that word and I felt sick inside; that\u2019s where the character of Levi came from, trying to work out why I couldn\u2019t forgive a child. I\u2019m working from my own pain. And did your feelings about forgiveness change? No. I still sit at a crossroads not knowing how I feel. Do black people always have to be the ones doing the forgiving? Do we go on being the bigger person into perpetuity, or is there a limit to forgiveness? You movingly explore the theme of home... The title Heaven, My Home is from a blues song. A lot of black roots music can never quite pen a permanent location for home, and I think that speaks to the black American experience: when they came here not having a home that was theirs \u2013 they could be moved anywhere. For me, that music has served a real purpose. When I\u2019ve had struggles in my life where I felt racial pain, I play blues songs. Where do you feel at home? I live in LA now, but Texas is my home in a way that will never be displaced in my heart and soul. It\u2019s the lens through which I see the world. I don\u2019t mean its current state or politics. I mean I come from rural, agrarian people. There\u2019s a fortitude I draw on when I struggle: a practicality of life that comes from my Texas upbringing, particularly my agrarian upbringing. Texas is very deeply my home. A lot of your family come from towns along Highway 59. How did that spark your imagination? As a child we were always driving up and down 59 to see relatives. I didn\u2019t have an iPod or iPad back in the day, so I did a lot of looking out the window at creeks and pine trees and people selling fresh fruit and boiling peanuts out of their pick-up trucks. These are some of my earliest childhood memories. That\u2019s where the impulse to write about that came from. What appeals to you about crime fiction? The thing that fascinates me about crime fiction is that it gets to the heart of human nature in a visceral way. I\u2019m fascinated by what makes people behave the way they behave. What kind of reader were you as a child? Sporadic. I wasn\u2019t one of these kids who always had a book with them like I do now: I take a book everywhere, including the grocery store. I loved To Kill a Mockingbird. What books are on your bedside table? I\u2019m reading Fleishman Is in Trouble [by Taffy Brodesser-Akner]. I love it a lot. What current writers do you admire? So many. Megan Abbott. Kate Atkinson \u2013 Life After Life is my favourite. Laura Lippman. Jesmyn Ward and Tayari Jones. Did you always want to be a writer? I wrote as a child and adolescent. Then I fell in love with movies and for a long time wanted to be a movie director. I moved to LA, but it all fell apart, and one day I said I don\u2019t want to do it any more, so I decided to write a book. Having given myself the gift of time, I found my voice. What books have influenced your writing? Jane Smiley\u2019s 13 Ways of Looking at the Novel was super-helpful to me when I wrote my first book. The book is a hybrid memoir and love letter to the novel. Its gift to me was expressing what was possible and deconstructing a lot of myth around writing. There\u2019s a quote in it which I\u2019ll paraphrase: \u201cThe only way you can fail at a first draft is not to finish it.\u201d As a new writer I needed to hear that. \u2022 Heaven, My Home by Attica Locke is published by Serpent\u2019s Tail (\u00a314.99).

      "bodyText": "Watford have sacked Javi Gracia after four games of the Premier League season and rehired Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores as his replacement. The club decided to act during the international break having collected just one point so far, scoring twice. They have not won in eight league matches \u2013 scoring five goals in that period \u2013 stretching back to April. There were only 30 minutes between the announcement of Gracia\u2019s exit and the appointment of Flores, who previously held the role of head coach in the 2015-16 season. It is a dramatic downfall for Gracia, who led the club to 11th in the Premier League last season, as well as to the FA Cup final. The Spaniard replaced Marco Silva at Vicarage Road at the start of 2018, originally signing an 18-month contract. Early success, though, led to an improved four-and-a-half-year contract, which would have taken him to the summer of 2023. Last month\u2019s draw against Newcastle was their first and only point of the season, having lost the previous three games against Brighton, Everton and West Ham \u2013 a disappointing return after some significant summer spending, which included a club record \u00a327m deal for the Rennes winger Isma\u00efla Sarr. Watford\u2019s chief executive, Scott Duxbury, said: \u201cJavi has represented Watford with great dignity and will always be deserving of our fullest respect for his achievements.\u201d Speaking before Watford\u2019s 1-1 draw with Newcastle on 30 August, Gracia had backed himself to turn the side\u2019s form around, having overcome a similar situation with M\u00e1laga four years ago. \u201cI think we went six games at M\u00e1laga without scoring. But we improved and finished in eighth. If you are winning, you only need time to see when you are going to lose \u2013 and when you are losing, you only need time to see when you win. We want to win as soon as possible, and we need to. I did it in the past, and now I want to do the same again.\u201d When Watford let Flores go in May 2016 after a season in which they finished a creditable 13th and reached an FA Cup semi-final, the club faced a backlash from fans and pundits. Slaven Bilic slammed the move as \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d, \u201csick\u201d and \u201cnonsense\u201d, while Ray Wilkins described Watford\u2019s season as \u201ca remarkable achievement \u2026 What more do people want? He\u2019s been a breath of fresh air.\u201d Flores also suggested at the time that he was confused by the decision, saying: \u201cThe club and me don\u2019t have the same point of view about the season. We don\u2019t have the necessary conditions to activate the clause to renew my contract so I will leave Watford as a consequence. But I felt completely happy with this year. I have enjoyed this experience.\u201d The 54-year-old has coached across the world, including spells in Portugal and Saudi Arabia, and led Atl\u00e9tico Madrid to Europa League success in 2009-10. His most recent role was with China\u2019s Shanghai Shenhua, who he joined on Christmas Day 2018, but left after six months with the club one point above the relegation zone. Gracia\u2019s backroom staff will also be leaving the club, it was confirmed, with S\u00e1nchez Flores expected to bring in his own coaching team. The move is Watford\u2019s 11th managerial change in just over eight years. Since the departure of Sean Dyche in July 2012 they have gone through Gianfranco Zola, Giuseppe Sannino, Oscar Garcia, Billy McKinlay (on a caretaker basis), Slavisa Jokanovic, S\u00e1nchez Flores, Walter Mazzarri, Marco Silva and now Gracia.",

People gather data and they make the best decisions they can make form that data.\u201d Sobien\u2019s union represents about 4,000 employees of the NWS, including meteorologists, flight engineers, technicians and others. \u201cThe NWS\u2019s job is to save people\u2019s lives, and if you undermine that authority, you\u2019re going to cost people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t believe hurricane warnings or tornado warnings, it will cost lives. That\u2019s what Noaa\u2019s doing. It\u2019s irresponsible, managerial malpractice, and frankly someone should look into them. They have no right to be running an organization if that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d He said NWS employees were expressing displeasure on social media. \u201cI\u2019ve seen from our own members that they\u2019re up in arms. People are asking us to do something and I don\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s just disgusting. The whole thing is just ridiculous.\u201d Other meteorologists also voiced concerns about Noaa\u2019s actions on Friday. \u201cI am very disappointed to see this statement come out from Noaa,\u201d the Oklahoma University meteorology professor Jason Furtado told the Associated Press. \u201cI am thankful for the folks at NWS Birmingham for their work in keeping the citizens of Alabama informed and up to date on weather hazards.\u201d Julia Carrie Wong contributed reporting",

      "bodyText": "And do read our guest columnist: Do join Barry Glendenning for the England game: Casey Stoney, the Manchester United manager, says she was encouraged by her side\u2019s performance. \u201cWe started 14 months ago and to be able to come here, in front of a crowd like that with players that have never played at this level, I cannot be any more proud of my players. They left everything out on the pitch, they did everything I asked [of them]. We just came up a little bit short.\u201d Nick Cushing, the Manchester City manager, adds: \u201cI thought our standard of play in the first half was not at the level. I thought their goal was coming. It was unlike us to be so sloppy and so loose. You cannot win trophies with a performance like we did in the first half. In the second half, we started to move the ball quicker and showed more intent. We need to get back on the training pitch to improve because the games are coming thick and fast.\u201d Some Manchester City reaction to that Caroline Weir winner. \u201cCaz does that in training every week against me, so I knew it was going in as soon as it left her left foot,\u201d says Ellie Roebuck, the City goalkeeper. \u201cIt was quite a big occasion at the Etihad \u2013 we had unbelievable support and we thank the supporters for that.\u201d Returning the compliment, Weir says: \u201cI\u2019m delighted we got the result, Manchester United played really well in the first half and Ellie had to pull off a couple of saves.\u201d Down at Ashton Gate, it\u2019s a point apiece for Bristol City and Brighton, who had a first-half penalty kept out by Sophie Baggaley. The city is blue? Nick Cushing\u2019s side prosper in front of a record crowd of 31,213 at the Etihad Stadium, with a corking Caroline Weir strike ultimately the difference. United spurned several golden first-half chances but Ellie Roebuck, the City goalkeeper, frustrated and, in the end, Casey Stoney\u2019s side appeared to run out of puff as City edged over the line to take victory in an entertaining derby. 90+2 min: United get the chance to run at tired City legs but Lauren James gets the ball caught up in her feet and the move collapses. The City captain Steph Houghton breathes an audible sigh of relief. They\u2019re almost over the line. 90+1 min: A cute bit of a keep-ball by Weir ensures City do not do anything silly. Weir and Lee Geum-min will attempt to shut the game down. 90 min: There will be at least four added minutes. 89 min: Caroline Weir is given the player of the match award. Her stunning goal remains the difference as stoppage-time looms. 87 min: Groenen is trying to up the ante as United search for an equaliser at the Etihad. They are finishing strongly if nothing else. Also in the WSL, Bristol City and Brighton, who had a penalty saved, are still goalless down at Ashton Gate. 83 min: Jackie Groenen comes within inches of a comical equaliser! It turned from the sublime into the ridiculous for the Manchester United midfielder, who did magnificently to nab the ball away before driving at goal. As she did, Groenen got her feet in a muddle, into a tangle as the chance appeared to vanish. But then Mannion\u2019s clearance ends up cannoning off the shins of the Dutch midfielder, and it very nearly squeezed inside a post and into a corner of the goal. In the end, it bounces off the woodwork and City survive. Nick Cushing attempts to rally the troops as City seek to close the game out. City get away with it. It would have been an odd leveller. 81 min: Georgia Stanway almost doubles City\u2019s lead! A neat triangle on the edge of the area releases Stanway, who sends a piercing shot towards goal but it flies into the side netting. Wullaert is replaced by the South Korea captain, Lee Geum-min. 80 min: Jane Ross is withdrawn. The 17-year-old Lauren James, who scored 14 goals last season, including four against Crystal Palace, is also on for her WSL debut. Can United fashion an equaliser at the Etihad? They\u2019re pushing. 77 min: ... Houghton makes a rare error and Hanson happily seizes on it on the edge of the 18-yard box. She attempts to curl the ball beyond Ellie Roebuck but does not master the execution. Meanwhile, Stoney is readying another change. 76 min: Casey Stoney opts to make another change as Kirsty Hanson replaces Leah Galton, who was United\u2019s shining light in the first half. For Hanson, the Scotland forward, this is her first taste of the WSL. Her first touch is rusty but ... 74 min: A record WSL attendance of 31,213. As confirmation of the crowd is read out aloud, there are great cheers inside the Etihad. Great news, which dwarfs the previous record of 5,265 that witnessed Brighton v Arsenal last season. 72 min: The game has died a death. The intensity has plummeted, which semi-suits City \u2013 they are far better when they are fizzing the ball around \u2013 and makes it harder for United to find a route back in. 68 min: Weir bends a free-kick towards goal \u2013 but it lacks venom and Mary Earps comfortably gathers in the United goal. The risk for City, who are knocking the ball about for fun and increasingly finding pockets of space, is that they switch off and get a little lax. There are no signs of that happening anytime soon, though. 65 min: Janine Beckie shows a turn of pace and eventually takes aim just inside the box after charging forward, carrying the ball around 45 yards. Amy Turner stands off the City forward, with the defender grateful her effort is wayward. 64 min: City have lost just twice in their last 37 matches \u2013 and United frankly need to ask more questions of Nick Cushing\u2019s side. Right on cue, the impressive Leah Galton stings the palms of Ellie Roebuck and United need more of that pace and power to hurt the hosts. Back come City on the counter ... 60 min: City are cruising. That goal has sapped all of the life out of a United side that had shown glimpses of real quality. 59 min: Beckie skews an effort over after more positive buildup play courtesy of Caroline Weir and Georgia Stanway, whose influence is growing. 56 min: Amy Turner replaces Okvist. Earps remains on \u2013 for now. 55 min: Ah, Mary Earps is down injured once more. She is shaking her head and puffing her cheeks. She looks thoroughly fed up. 53 min: Whatever Nick Cushing said at the interval, it has worked. Just as City begin to purr, with Weir skirting her way beyond not one but three United defenders, the move breaks down with Stanway not quite on the same page. United just need to re-gain the kind of composure they showed in the first half. 50 min: United finished the first half convincingly but they have been all at sea in the early stages of the second. A sloppiness in defence led to that wondrous Weir strike, with Abbie McManus among those that struggled to clear United\u2019s lines. That goal, as you\u2019d expect, has settled City. They\u2019re striding around the field with much more conviction and confidence now. A 25-yard peach by Caroline Weir to open the scoring. United make a mess of things, failing to truly clear the ball and when it drops to Weir way out, the winger nudges the ball on to her left foot, steadies herself and thumps an arrowed effort into the top corner beyond Mary Earps. That was a beautiful hit. 46 min: Georgia Stanway gets the second half under way. The teams are back out on the pitch at the Etihad. It\u2019s also half-time at Ashton Gate, where Bristol City and Brighton head down the tunnel level-pegging at 0-0. The visitors squandered the best chance from 12 yards, when Sophie Baggaley brilliantly saved Victoria Williams\u2019 penalty. Millie Turner nods wide right on the brink of the interval and, in truth, United have enjoyed much the better of the first half. Casey Stoney\u2019s side have carved out a couple of glorious chances without finding a way past Ellie Roebuck. 45 min: There will be three added minutes. 43 min: Beckie almost profits in the box for City! But the forward tries to hook the ball goalwards with her preferred right foot and the chance is gone. It stemmed from a Weir free-kick, which United inadvertently cleared into the path of Beckie, with a header landing within Beckie\u2019s radius. Earps is wrong-footed but Beckie makes the wrong choice and the ball bobbles away from danger. 42 min: City really have struggled to give United any kind of fright. Casey Stoney\u2019s side started on the back foot but have really grown into the game. 39 min: City pour forward through Keira Walsh but Caroline Weir cannot steer her effort into the corners either side of Mary Earps\u2019s goal. Weir has been lively for City \u2013 but not as influential as Cushing would like. Earps seems to be OK after being hampered by an ankle injury early on at the Etihad. 37 min: City have their own sniff of goal, with Hayley Ladd caught cold at full-back and Janine Beckie fools Abbie McManus before lashing a low ball into the box. City have come alive once or twice but Nick Cushing needs to coax that kind of intensity out of his side more often. United have been knocking on the door \u2013 but have nothing to show for it. Still, Stoney will be the happier manager. 35 min: United are piling on the pressure \u2013 and Galton passes up another chance! A wonderful ball is flighted in from the right towards the back post and the forward rises highest to meet it. But her header drops off target. After a quiet and fairly meek start, Casey Stoney\u2019s side are really in the mood. 33 min: Groenen makes a crucial interception on halfway to prevent City flying forward on the counterattack. With regard to that chance a moment ago, there were only half-hearted appeals but Bonner flew in on Groenen, wiping the Dutch forward out at the front post. The referee Rebecca Welch was unmoved. 30 min: City survive another United attack! It\u2019s a great move, with Leah Galton again at the heart of it. It was Jane Ross that was the catalyst once more, too. United release Galton free wide on the left, who fires the ball in towards the front post. There is Sigsworth ready to prod home but she has Demi Stokes for company and Bonner also makes life difficult for the United front line, flying in on Jackie Groenen and Roebuck gratefully gobbles the ball up. 29 min: City take a bit of a breather, with the skipper Steph Houghton calming things down, putting her foot on the ball to take the sting out of United\u2019s buzz. \u201cI bet that Houghton\u2019s ability to pick a pass is causing Casey Stoney some headaches,\u201d emails Adam Kline-Schoder. \u201cThe entire United forward line and midfield is being taken out of the game by her passing, with Scott and Stanway routinely finding space to receive them between the midfield and the back line. If City could just get a few more women in the box after bypassing the press, they clearly have the tools to hurt United. United look like they need time to gel, but there\u2019s clearly potential for them to be highly watchable as well.\u201d 25 min: Sigsworth looks for Ross at the front post \u2013 but Steph Houghton goes to ground to clear the ball away. United look really revved up, with Ross causing problems inside the channels, particularly against Demi Stokes. 22 min: What. A. Save! A wondrous right-handed stop by Ellie Roebuck to prevent Manchester United from taking the lead at the Etihad. The ball sprung down the left flank, with an exquisite pass by Zelem supplying Leah Galton, who then spread play across the box for Jane Ross. The striker does everything right, stabbing a right leg at the ball to prod home \u2013 but Roebuck is equal to it. 18 min: City continue to probe but as Weir and Stanway attempt to combine on the edge of the area, there is Abbie McManus to intervene once more. She\u2019s been a rock in these early stages. 15 min: City fail to make the most of a corner and then, after regurgitating the ball, they try to slide in Caroline Weir but the forward is flagged offside. Smart work by Abbie McManus, who knew exactly where she her marker was. As the move breaks down, Weir tries to kickstart foray upfield but she is guilty of being a little overzealous in the challenge on Hayley Ladd. 13 min: United piece a few passes together and suddenly look a whole lot more comfortable. They knock the ball around in defence between Ladd and McManus before Ross flights a wonderful pass over the top for Sigsworth, who had raced in behind a static City defence. The hosts smother the ball but that was a promising move by Casey Stoney\u2019s side. And now City come back at them ... 12 min: Earps is back up on her feet and promptly wellies the ball downfield. Ross seizes possession and slings in a cross from the right but City hack it away. 8 min: Earps is not moving too freely. Manchester United have an early goalkeeping concern to address. The stopper goes to ground to seek treatment on a pesky ankle problem. United\u2019s backup goalkeeper is Aurora Mikalsen, a Norway Under-23 international who only joined the club 24 hours ago. 6 min: Leah Galton takes aim from distance! It\u2019s always rising but the Manchester United midfielder, formerly of Bayern Munich, does well to cling on to possession on the edge of the box before drifting inside. Given encouragement to shoot, with City standing off, Galton lets fly. It zooms over but that\u2019s something for Casey Stoney\u2019s side to build on after a fairly passive start at the Etihad. 4 min: City have started far brighter. They look much more comfortable in possession, with the captain Steph Houghton simply rolling a pass into midfield and, down the other end, Mary Earps, the United goalkeeper, almost plays herself into trouble after failing to shuffle the ball out of her feet. 2 min: Caroline Weir releases Janine Beckie into the channel but Abbie McManus, the former City defender, stands firm to turnover possession. City recycle the ball, with Scott driving forward and Georgia Stanway takes aim from distance but it zooms over. United get things started at the Etihad. Moonchester, the Manchester City mascot, welcomes the teams on to the pitch. There is a charged atmosphere building at the Etihad, with Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r among those taking the game in from the stands. Kick-off is imminent. Here we go ... The voices inside the dressing room speak. \u201cWe\u2019re super excited to play here at the Etihad and to play a derby against Manchester United,\u201d says Nick Cushing. \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant for women\u2019s football, Manchester City but it\u2019s also an opportunity to get the 30,000 that come today to come to the academy stadium week in, week out. We would love to have 7,000 fans there week in, week out, but we know we have to put in a performance in to make them come back.\u201d Casey Stoney says: \u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity for us as a football club, for the players, but most importantly for the women\u2019s game. We\u2019re new to the league, we\u2019ve just been promoted but we are going to go out there and give it a real go.\u201d Five minutes until kick-off. Abbie McManus spent 12 years at Manchester City across two spells but lines up for United at the Etihad this afternoon. The defender was part of the England squad in France over the summer. \u201cFive years ago, I was training in a park in Wythenshawe and my dad would give me a Mars and Snickers bar and a bottle of Lucozade before a game,\u201d she said in April, before crossing the divide to join Casey Stoney\u2019s squad. \u201cVersatility is a good thing to have but right now, with my age, I\u2019m 26 and I want to cement my role at centre-half. That was a big reason why I chose to move from City to United.\u201d More from Neville, who refuses to rule out jumping ship for the vacant USA gig. Asked if England can rest assured he\u2019s going nowhere, he gloriously swerves the question: \u201cI think the challenge for me personally is to win something with England. You go to a World Cup, you come back and you\u2019ve inspired a nation \u2013 you\u2019ve got to climb that mountain again. That is what we have to see from the England players and the WSL players, we have to continue the growth and get better and better.\u201d Some pre-match soundbites to get the juices flowing. The England manager Phil Neville has his say on almost 30,000 fans heading to the Etihad Stadium for the maiden WSL Manchester derby. \u201cIt\u2019s continuing the momentum that we built up in the summer,\u201d says Neville, who\u2019s wearing a mammoth black coat straight out of a headteacher\u2019s wardrobe. \u201cSo many people were inspired by the performances of the players, so many people watched and I think they loved what they saw on the field. Today is another good example. We are all so excited.\u201d Get the lowdown on each and every WSL side: There is another 3pm kick-off, which has also been upgraded to a bigger stadium with Bristol City playing Brighton &amp; Hove Albion at Ashton Gate. A lot of the discourse is inevitably around attendances, with City\u2019s Demi Stokes keen for playing in bigger arenas to become the norm. \u201cPlaying in a packed stadium, it is hard to explain,\u201d Stokes says. \u201cIt is the best feeling to look up in the stand and see family and friends, it is surreal and such a nice moment. To be able to do that every week would be really good and I do think we will get there.\u201d Not one or two \u2013 but 10 things to look out for in the WSL: Essential pre-match reading, via Suzy Wrack and Louise Taylor: Manchester City (4-4-2): Roebuck; Mannion, Houghton, Bonner, Stokes; Scott, Walsh, Wullaert, Weir; Beckie, Stanway Subs: Benameur, Coombs, Bremer, Toland, Park, Geum-Min, Fidalgo Manchester United (4-3-3): Earps; McManus, Ladd, M Turner, Okvist; Groenen, Toone Zelem; Sigsworth, Ross, Galton Subs: Mikalsen, A Turner, Harris, James, Arnot, Hanson, Smith Referee: Rebecca Welch This is it, then. The big kick-off at the Etihad Stadium, where more than 20,000 supporters are expected to pour in to watch the Women\u2019s Super League curtain-raiser between Manchester rivals. It is a much-anticipated maiden top-flight meeting between City and United, with the latter having cruised to promotion from the second tier under Casey Stoney last season. It is a showpiece match, one of three fixtures this weekend that have been moved to bigger stadiums and the mooted attendance has already ripped up the record books \u2013 the biggest crowd to attend a WSL match stands at 5,265 for Arsenal\u2019s title-clinching win at Brighton in April. And on Sunday Chelsea host Tottenham at Stamford Bridge with an even bigger crowd expected at the 41,000-capacity venue. On the field, there is no end of exciting players to keep an eye on but Ellen White, City\u2019s headline arrival following the departure of last season\u2019s top scorer, Nikita Parris, is sidelined through injury, so the onus is on others to impress, namely another summer recruit, the South Korea captain, Lee Geum-min, who has further bolstered Nick Cushing\u2019s forward line. Across town, United made a coup of their own, with the Netherlands midfielder Jackie Groenen \u2013 a World Cup finalist \u2013 joining Stoney\u2019s ranks from Frankfurt. Hopefully we will have a game to match the occasion. Kick-off: 3pm (BST)",

The protest, organised by the campaign groups Extinction Rebellion and Stop Killing Cyclists, drew attention to statistics showing that more than 100 cyclists were killed and 3,400 seriously injured in 2016, the most recent year for which figures were available.

      "body": "<p>Born in Maine in 1947, Stephen King wrote his first published novel, <em>Carrie</em>, in 1974 and has spent the subsequent half-century documenting the monsters and heroes of small-town America. His rogues\u2019 gallery of characters runs the gamut from killer clowns and demonic cars to psychotic fans and unhinged populist politicians.</p> <p>His best-loved books include <em>The Stand</em>, <em>It</em>, <em>The Dead Zone</em> and <em>Pet Sematary</em>. King\u2019s latest novel, <em>The Institute</em>, revolves around a totalitarian boot camp for telekinetic children. The kids check in \u2013 but don\u2019t check out.</p> <p><em><strong>Carrie</strong></em><strong> was published </strong><strong>against the backdrop of Watergate, Vietnam and the </strong><strong>Patty Hearst</strong><strong> kidnapping. Is America a more or less scary place to write about now?</strong><br>The world is a scary place, not just America. We\u2019re in the spooky house \u2013 on the ghost train, if you prefer \u2013 for life. The scares come and go, but everyone likes make-believe monsters to stand in for the real ones.</p> <p><em><strong>The Institute</strong></em><strong> is about a concentration camp for children, staffed by implacable factotums. To what extent did Trump\u2019s immigration policies </strong><strong>affect the book?</strong><br>Trump\u2019s immigration policies didn\u2019t impact the book, because it was written before that incompetent dumbbell became president. Children are imprisoned and enslaved all over the world. Hopefully, people who read <em>The Institute </em>will find a resonant chord with this administration\u2019s cruel and racial policies.</p> <p><strong>You were raised in a working-class Republican household. What would your mother make of today\u2019s GOP?</strong><br>My mother bolted the GOP the last time she voted and cast a ballot for George McGovern. She hated the Vietnam war. I was sworn to secrecy, but feel the statute of limitations on that has run out. In Maine, lots of Republicans are more purple than red. It\u2019s how Senator Susan Collins keeps sliding by.</p> <p><strong>For all the terrors in your work, there\u2019s an underlying faith in basic human decency. This suggests you think most people are basically good.</strong><br>Yes, most people are good. More people are anxious to stop a terrorist attack than to start one. They just don\u2019t make the news.</p> <p><strong>You started out being dismissed by the literary establishment as a lowly peddler of cheap horror. You\u2019re now a lauded national treasure. How does it feel to be respectable?</strong><br>It feels good to be at least semi-respectable. I have outlived most of my most virulent critics. It gives me great pleasure to say that. Does that make me a bad person?</p> <p><strong>Isn\u2019t it also partly because the boundary between </strong><strong>literary fiction and </strong><strong>genre fiction has become more porous? The old high/low distinction doesn\u2019t exist in the same way</strong><strong>.</strong><br>Well, there\u2019s still a strange \u2013 to me, anyway \u2013 and totally subjective line between high culture and low. An aria from <em>Rigoletto,</em> La donna \u00e8 mobile, for instance \u2013 is high culture. Sympathy for the Devil by the Stones is low. They\u2019re both cool, so go figure.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019ve heard that you like to write to loud music. Isn\u2019t that really distracting?</strong><br>I\u2019m listening to Fine Young Cannibals [right now]. Soon to be followed by Danny and the Juniors and the Animals. I love rock \u2013 the louder the better.</p> <p><strong>But does the music leave an imprint on a book\u2019s tone or pace? Would a chapter written while listening to the Animals, say, differ from a chapter written under the influence of the Ramones?</strong><br>The music I happen to be listening to can sometimes affect word choice, or cause a new line, but never affects style.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re astoundingly prolific. What\u2019s your feeling about those novelists who spend years </strong><strong>crafting and rewriting a novel? Envy at their rigour? Exasperation</strong><strong>?</strong><br>Some writers take years; James Patterson takes a weekend. Every writer is different. I feel that a first draft should take about four months, but that\u2019s me. And I go over my work obsessively. Here\u2019s another thing \u2013 creative life is absurdly short. I want to cram in as much as I can.</p> <p><strong>Have you ever </strong><strong>forced yourself to go slower?</strong><br>Deliberately go slower? No, never. I\u2019ve written longhand [<em>Dreamcatcher</em>], but poke along and obsessively polish? No. You keep picking a scab, you\u2019re gonna make it bleed instead of heal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0284e35e35c49a201767aef444d919c47c755389\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0284e35e35c49a201767aef444d919c47c755389/192_72_2267_1360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"King with his son Owen King, also an author, as is his wife, Tabitha King, and their other son, Joe Hill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">King with his son Owen King, also an author, as is his wife, Tabitha King, and their other son, Joe Hill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You\u2019ve said your characters sometimes speak in your head to the point where they blot out the real world. That makes writing fiction sound like a close cousin to mental illness...</strong><br>I don\u2019t think writing is a mental illness, but when I\u2019m working and it\u2019s going really well, time and the real world kind of disappear.</p> <p><strong>If that\u2019s the ideal state of grace, is it sometimes hard to let go? Do you ever find yourself haunted by books or characters you\u2019ve ostensibly laid to rest?</strong><br>Sometimes characters, like Holly Gibney from the <em>Mr Mercedes</em> books and <em>The Outsider</em>, cry to come back \u2013 or Roland of Gilead \u2013 but they are the exceptions.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve collaborated with the writer Peter Straub (on the novels </strong><em><strong>The Talisman</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em><strong>Black House</strong></em><strong>) and your sons Owen and Joe</strong><strong>. Is there another you\u2019d love to write a novel with?</strong><br>I loved collaborating with my boys, and with Peter Straub, and will hopefully do it again. I\u2019d love to collaborate with Colson Whitehead, Michael Robotham, Linwood Barclay, Alex Marwood, Tana French. No time, I guess, but those would be cool mixes. The ideal is to groove with someone so completely you make a third voice.</p> <p><strong>The president </strong><strong>orders every book in America to be burned. You</strong><strong> have time to save three of your own novels</strong><strong>. Which three</strong><strong>?</strong><br>Which books of mine would I save? Dumb question, but I\u2019ll play. <em>Lisey\u2019s Story</em>, <em>The Stand</em> and <em>Misery</em>.<br></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/institute-9781529355390.html\">The Institute</a> by Stephen King is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton (\u00a320) To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846 Free UK p&amp;p over \u00a315, online orders only.

      "bodyText": "Born in Maine in 1947, Stephen King wrote his first published novel, Carrie, in 1974 and has spent the subsequent half-century documenting the monsters and heroes of small-town America. His rogues\u2019 gallery of characters runs the gamut from killer clowns and demonic cars to psychotic fans and unhinged populist politicians. His best-loved books include The Stand, It, The Dead Zone and Pet Sematary. King\u2019s latest novel, The Institute, revolves around a totalitarian boot camp for telekinetic children. The kids check in \u2013 but don\u2019t check out. Carrie was published against the backdrop of Watergate, Vietnam and the Patty Hearst kidnapping. Is America a more or less scary place to write about now? The world is a scary place, not just America. We\u2019re in the spooky house \u2013 on the ghost train, if you prefer \u2013 for life. The scares come and go, but everyone likes make-believe monsters to stand in for the real ones. The Institute is about a concentration camp for children, staffed by implacable factotums. To what extent did Trump\u2019s immigration policies affect the book? Trump\u2019s immigration policies didn\u2019t impact the book, because it was written before that incompetent dumbbell became president. Children are imprisoned and enslaved all over the world. Hopefully, people who read The Institute will find a resonant chord with this administration\u2019s cruel and racial policies. You were raised in a working-class Republican household. What would your mother make of today\u2019s GOP? My mother bolted the GOP the last time she voted and cast a ballot for George McGovern. She hated the Vietnam war. I was sworn to secrecy, but feel the statute of limitations on that has run out. In Maine, lots of Republicans are more purple than red. It\u2019s how Senator Susan Collins keeps sliding by. For all the terrors in your work, there\u2019s an underlying faith in basic human decency. This suggests you think most people are basically good. Yes, most people are good. More people are anxious to stop a terrorist attack than to start one. They just don\u2019t make the news. You started out being dismissed by the literary establishment as a lowly peddler of cheap horror. You\u2019re now a lauded national treasure. How does it feel to be respectable? It feels good to be at least semi-respectable. I have outlived most of my most virulent critics. It gives me great pleasure to say that. Does that make me a bad person? Isn\u2019t it also partly because the boundary between literary fiction and genre fiction has become more porous? The old high/low distinction doesn\u2019t exist in the same way. Well, there\u2019s still a strange \u2013 to me, anyway \u2013 and totally subjective line between high culture and low. An aria from Rigoletto, La donna \u00e8 mobile, for instance \u2013 is high culture. Sympathy for the Devil by the Stones is low. They\u2019re both cool, so go figure. I\u2019ve heard that you like to write to loud music. Isn\u2019t that really distracting? I\u2019m listening to Fine Young Cannibals [right now]. Soon to be followed by Danny and the Juniors and the Animals. I love rock \u2013 the louder the better. But does the music leave an imprint on a book\u2019s tone or pace? Would a chapter written while listening to the Animals, say, differ from a chapter written under the influence of the Ramones? The music I happen to be listening to can sometimes affect word choice, or cause a new line, but never affects style. You\u2019re astoundingly prolific. What\u2019s your feeling about those novelists who spend years crafting and rewriting a novel? Envy at their rigour? Exasperation? Some writers take years; James Patterson takes a weekend. Every writer is different. I feel that a first draft should take about four months, but that\u2019s me. And I go over my work obsessively. Here\u2019s another thing \u2013 creative life is absurdly short. I want to cram in as much as I can. Have you ever forced yourself to go slower? Deliberately go slower? No, never. I\u2019ve written longhand [Dreamcatcher], but poke along and obsessively polish? No. You keep picking a scab, you\u2019re gonna make it bleed instead of heal. You\u2019ve said your characters sometimes speak in your head to the point where they blot out the real world. That makes writing fiction sound like a close cousin to mental illness... I don\u2019t think writing is a mental illness, but when I\u2019m working and it\u2019s going really well, time and the real world kind of disappear. If that\u2019s the ideal state of grace, is it sometimes hard to let go? Do you ever find yourself haunted by books or characters you\u2019ve ostensibly laid to rest? Sometimes characters, like Holly Gibney from the Mr Mercedes books and The Outsider, cry to come back \u2013 or Roland of Gilead \u2013 but they are the exceptions. You\u2019ve collaborated with the writer Peter Straub (on the novels The Talisman and Black House) and your sons Owen and Joe. Is there another you\u2019d love to write a novel with? I loved collaborating with my boys, and with Peter Straub, and will hopefully do it again. I\u2019d love to collaborate with Colson Whitehead, Michael Robotham, Linwood Barclay, Alex Marwood, Tana French. No time, I guess, but those would be cool mixes. The ideal is to groove with someone so completely you make a third voice. The president orders every book in America to be burned. You have time to save three of your own novels. Which three? Which books of mine would I save? Dumb question, but I\u2019ll play. Lisey\u2019s Story, The Stand and Misery.

      "body": "<p>Fifty years ago on Saturday, Jackie Stewart claimed the first of his three Formula One world championships, at the Italian Grand Prix. Now Sir Jackie, he does not rush to answer when asked about his achievement, instead there is a pause as the 80 year old remembers Monza in 1969. His answer, when it comes, is considered but delivered with conviction. \u201cI never felt at any time that I was better than anybody else,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I knew I had a fantastic team of people around me.\u201d</p> <p>On Sunday, Monza will host the 90th Italian Grand Prix. In 1969, Stewart was driving here for Ken Tyrrell\u2019s team, running Matra cars. His affection for Tyrrell and his squad is well known but Stewart explains how he owed them much more than just the title. \u201cRoger Hill, Roy Topp and Roland Law were the three mechanics,\u201d he says. \u201cI recently spoke at the Royal Automobile Club and they and the Queen were there. I had them stand up and said: \u2018I am here today because of those three men.\u2019 My wife, Helen, counted 57 people had died in my career. I didn\u2019t lose wheels or aerofoils. When everybody else was crashing, my car did not.\u201d</p> <p>The passage of time has clearly not dampened the affection with which he holds the team for whom he took all three of his titles. Nor has it dimmed the vivacity of his memories of Monza. The race was a thriller on a track where passing at high speed was the norm. There were no chicanes and the cars slipstreamed one another with repeated overtaking throughout a lap. It was also run at a breakneck pace, the average speed moving from 143mph to 146mph across the 68 laps. The lead and places were exchanged with almost bewildering frequency, Stewart explains, in what was for the most part a six-way fight at the front between Stewart, Graham Hill, Piers Courage, Bruce McLaren, Jochen Rindt and Jean\u2011Pierre Beltoise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7abe4044dd130008d44968bf1b48876ee6bde2fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7abe4044dd130008d44968bf1b48876ee6bde2fe/68_87_3848_2310/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jackie Stewart remains a keen observer of the F1 circuit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jackie Stewart remains a keen observer of the F1 circuit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beno\u00eet Tessier/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The climax was an F1 spectacle for the ages. Late on, Courage\u2019s Brabham had fallen back with a fuel problem and on lap 64 a broken drive shaft took Hill\u2019s Lotus out. With the remaining four contenders nose to tail as they entered the final lap, Stewart\u2019s great friend Rindt took the lead through the Lesmos, but Stewart had claimed it back as they entered the back straight.</p> <p>Only Parabolica remained. Beltoise braked late and went wide, Stewart swept up the inside and led heading for the line. Stewart and Tyrrell\u2019s decision to put in a higher gear ratio made the difference when he did not have to change gear on the run to the flag.</p> <p>The protagonists crossed it almost as one: Stewart, Rindt, Beltoise and McLaren. Nineteen-hundredths of a second separated them \u2013 what was then the closest finish in F1.</p> <p>Just as they will be passionate on Sunday, the Italian fans erupted at what had been a magnificent race. Ferrari may not have won but they knew they had seen a worthy world champion claim his crown in the most glorious fashion.</p> <p><em>Motorsport</em> magazine wrote: \u201cThe huge crowd poured on to the track and the presentation of the victors laurels disappeared under a seething mob of wildly enthusiastic spectators.\u201d</p> <p>Stewart remembers with a smile being at the heart of their celebratory maelstrom. \u201cThe crowds at Monza were as big as they are today,\u201d he says. \u201cI came down from the podium and the crowd broke though the barriers. In those days the wives came up on the podium, so Helen was with me.</p> <p>\u201cThe crowd completely engulfed us, the police had no chance. We then went into an administration office and they broke through there. Then Helen and I went into a toilet with the laurel wreath still on and they were banging on the door of the toilet, so we had to climb out of the window and run down to the paddock.</p> <p>\u201cI have never seen anything like it. I jumped into the back of a Dunlop van, but somebody saw me going in so they pushed the van. Fortunately, a friend of mine, Philip Martyn, a world champion backgammon player, had a big Merc so he brought it into the paddock and Helen and I ran into it and he drove it away.\u201d</p> <p>Stewart has been married to Helen since 1962. His relationship with his long-term sponsor, Rolex, on whose behalf he is recalling the events at Monza, is six years shorter.</p> <p>When he won his first world championship he had been with them a year; now Stewart is one of their \u201ctestimonees\u201d, a role given to those who have achieved extraordinary feats, such as Sir Malcolm Campbell, Sir Edmund Hillary, and in the modern era, Roger Federer and Tiger Woods.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jun/08/jackie-stewart-made-f1-safer-sport\">Jackie Stewart and his struggle to make F1 a safer sport for all | Giles Richards</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He has long taken all such commitments seriously, believes in making them last and that where he can, he should also try and make a difference. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jun/08/jackie-stewart-made-f1-safer-sport\" title=\"\">His tireless work in making racing safer </a>is well documented and vital.

His answer, when it comes, is considered but delivered with conviction. \u201cI never felt at any time that I was better than anybody else,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I knew I had a fantastic team of people around me.\u201d On Sunday, Monza will host the 90th Italian Grand Prix. In 1969, Stewart was driving here for Ken Tyrrell\u2019s team, running Matra cars. His affection for Tyrrell and his squad is well known but Stewart explains how he owed them much more than just the title. \u201cRoger Hill, Roy Topp and Roland Law were the three mechanics,\u201d he says. \u201cI recently spoke at the Royal Automobile Club and they and the Queen were there. I had them stand up and said: \u2018I am here today because of those three men.\u2019 My wife, Helen, counted 57 people had died in my career. I didn\u2019t lose wheels or aerofoils. When everybody else was crashing, my car did not.\u201d The passage of time has clearly not dampened the affection with which he holds the team for whom he took all three of his titles. Nor has it dimmed the vivacity of his memories of Monza. The race was a thriller on a track where passing at high speed was the norm. There were no chicanes and the cars slipstreamed one another with repeated overtaking throughout a lap. It was also run at a breakneck pace, the average speed moving from 143mph to 146mph across the 68 laps. The lead and places were exchanged with almost bewildering frequency, Stewart explains, in what was for the most part a six-way fight at the front between Stewart, Graham Hill, Piers Courage, Bruce McLaren, Jochen Rindt and Jean\u2011Pierre Beltoise. The climax was an F1 spectacle for the ages. Late on, Courage\u2019s Brabham had fallen back with a fuel problem and on lap 64 a broken drive shaft took Hill\u2019s Lotus out. With the remaining four contenders nose to tail as they entered the final lap, Stewart\u2019s great friend Rindt took the lead through the Lesmos, but Stewart had claimed it back as they entered the back straight. Only Parabolica remained. Beltoise braked late and went wide, Stewart swept up the inside and led heading for the line. Stewart and Tyrrell\u2019s decision to put in a higher gear ratio made the difference when he did not have to change gear on the run to the flag. The protagonists crossed it almost as one: Stewart, Rindt, Beltoise and McLaren. Nineteen-hundredths of a second separated them \u2013 what was then the closest finish in F1. Just as they will be passionate on Sunday, the Italian fans erupted at what had been a magnificent race. Ferrari may not have won but they knew they had seen a worthy world champion claim his crown in the most glorious fashion. Motorsport magazine wrote: \u201cThe huge crowd poured on to the track and the presentation of the victors laurels disappeared under a seething mob of wildly enthusiastic spectators.\u201d Stewart remembers with a smile being at the heart of their celebratory maelstrom. \u201cThe crowds at Monza were as big as they are today,\u201d he says. \u201cI came down from the podium and the crowd broke though the barriers. In those days the wives came up on the podium, so Helen was with me. \u201cThe crowd completely engulfed us, the police had no chance. We then went into an administration office and they broke through there. Then Helen and I went into a toilet with the laurel wreath still on and they were banging on the door of the toilet, so we had to climb out of the window and run down to the paddock. \u201cI have never seen anything like it. I jumped into the back of a Dunlop van, but somebody saw me going in so they pushed the van. Fortunately, a friend of mine, Philip Martyn, a world champion backgammon player, had a big Merc so he brought it into the paddock and Helen and I ran into it and he drove it away.\u201d Stewart has been married to Helen since 1962. His relationship with his long-term sponsor, Rolex, on whose behalf he is recalling the events at Monza, is six years shorter. When he won his first world championship he had been with them a year; now Stewart is one of their \u201ctestimonees\u201d, a role given to those who have achieved extraordinary feats, such as Sir Malcolm Campbell, Sir Edmund Hillary, and in the modern era, Roger Federer and Tiger Woods. He has long taken all such commitments seriously, believes in making them last and that where he can, he should also try and make a difference. His tireless work in making racing safer is well documented and vital. Of late, he has thrown himself into defeating dementia, to which his wife has succumbed. His charity, Race Against Dementia, has raised $3.5m for research into the disease. Perhaps less well known is that his commitment to those who had been so vital in his success 50 years ago was never forgotten. In 1987, he founded the Grand Prix Mechanics Trust, now the Grand Prix Trust, of which he is still chairman, to provide support and welfare to any former F1 team members that require it. Stewart has been able to contribute so much thanks in part to the success he enjoyed in 1969. That year, he was in complete control. He won six of the first eight races to take the title and remains the only driver to have a led on at least one lap of every grand prix in a season. Monza was its peak but one that, despite the glory, he kept very much in perspective. \u201cIf you start thinking you are king of the castle, you usually have a fall,\u201d he says of that remarkable year. \u201cAnd I had a great fear of falling.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u2018In the darkness, you move towards the light,\u201d says Catherine Reynolds. We\u2019re eating pastries in her front room and talking about how she came to paint imperfect stripes and dots on vintage furniture and fabric. \u201cWhen things shine brighter you instinctively move towards them,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd because you\u2019re in such a dark place, you don\u2019t really think about what the light is. You just go towards it. That\u2019s how I ended up in Rye and that\u2019s how <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/polka_up/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Polka</a> started: it was a light and I just loved doing it.\u201d</p> <p>A couple of years ago, Reynolds was not in a good place. Recently divorced, she wound down her successful PR company and moved from a large London flat to a tiny, historic cottage in Rye. She is originally from Merseyside and her accent remains strong. Her friend, Marcus Crane \u2013 co-founder of the local art and interior store, <a href=\"https://mccullyandcrane.com/\" title=\"\">McCully &amp; Crane</a> \u2013 found her this cottage.</p> <p>\u201cI took it on without even seeing it,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI thought: if Marcus likes it, I\u2019ll like it.\u201d She only planned to stay for six months, then, at the start of 2018, she decided it was time to \u201clay down some roots\u201d. She asked the landlord to sell her the cottage and he agreed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e36ea42afd8cba72ff16bf0ecd339939c6233a7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e36ea42afd8cba72ff16bf0ecd339939c6233a7f/0_346_5430_3258/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chartreuse velvet sofa with floral cushions and vintage prints and original artworks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chintz up: chartreuse velvet sofa with floral cushions and vintage prints and original artworks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo Bridges/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Designing, sourcing and customising homeware \u2013 which she now sells under the brand name Polka \u2013 helped Reynolds find new focus. When she first moved to Rye, she staged a Polka pop-up in McCully &amp; Crane, where her hand-painted upholstered pieces are currently stocked. Now she works to commission, sourcing vintage pieces for interior designers and individuals and customising them if they need it. \u201cSometimes they benefit from a little bit of a polka dot,\u201d she says. \u201c \u2013 they cheer things up.\u201d Her striped fabric \u2013 which is hand-painted here on her diminutive front-room floor \u2013 is available in any colour and any thickness of stripe. \u201cThere\u2019s something about sitting and painting straight lines on fabric that is quite therapeutic for me,\u201d she reflects.</p> <p>Dot Cottage, as it is now known, is in a row of four terraced Grade II-listed dwellings, in the medieval centre of Rye. As a tenant, Reynolds had painted the front room pink and stared to slowly dismantle the fitted kitchen. As the owner, she quickly made it her own.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve dressed the house how I dress myself \u2013 and change it often,\u201d she says. \u201cI like stripes, pattern, colour, bows, polka dots \u2013 and I don\u2019t buy anything new. Apart from my mattress and duvet, everything is old. I love things that have a story.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8903017a91409b11259c604e7a89d9196e1b8fef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8903017a91409b11259c604e7a89d9196e1b8fef/0_180_5386_3232/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The miniscule, custom-made kitchen with an ancient and formerly hidden door.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">History house: the miniscule, custom-made kitchen with an ancient and formerly hidden door.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo Bridges/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The whole effect is unmistakably British \u2013 and when Reynolds is abroad, the cottage is available to rent.

A green glass chandelier hangs in the bay window above a squishy, floral armchair found at an auction. The second-hand sofa has been reupholstered in chartreuse velvet and stacked with floral cushions. Vintage prints and original artworks hang on the walls. The two small tables have been customised with black dots big and small, the bamboo dining chairs sprayed pillarbox red.</p> <p>Connected to the front room is a miniscule, custom-made kitchen.

      "bodyText": "\u2018In the darkness, you move towards the light,\u201d says Catherine Reynolds. We\u2019re eating pastries in her front room and talking about how she came to paint imperfect stripes and dots on vintage furniture and fabric. \u201cWhen things shine brighter you instinctively move towards them,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd because you\u2019re in such a dark place, you don\u2019t really think about what the light is. You just go towards it. That\u2019s how I ended up in Rye and that\u2019s how Polka started: it was a light and I just loved doing it.\u201d A couple of years ago, Reynolds was not in a good place. Recently divorced, she wound down her successful PR company and moved from a large London flat to a tiny, historic cottage in Rye. She is originally from Merseyside and her accent remains strong. Her friend, Marcus Crane \u2013 co-founder of the local art and interior store, McCully &amp; Crane \u2013 found her this cottage. \u201cI took it on without even seeing it,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI thought: if Marcus likes it, I\u2019ll like it.\u201d She only planned to stay for six months, then, at the start of 2018, she decided it was time to \u201clay down some roots\u201d. She asked the landlord to sell her the cottage and he agreed. Designing, sourcing and customising homeware \u2013 which she now sells under the brand name Polka \u2013 helped Reynolds find new focus. When she first moved to Rye, she staged a Polka pop-up in McCully &amp; Crane, where her hand-painted upholstered pieces are currently stocked. Now she works to commission, sourcing vintage pieces for interior designers and individuals and customising them if they need it. \u201cSometimes they benefit from a little bit of a polka dot,\u201d she says. \u201c \u2013 they cheer things up.\u201d Her striped fabric \u2013 which is hand-painted here on her diminutive front-room floor \u2013 is available in any colour and any thickness of stripe. \u201cThere\u2019s something about sitting and painting straight lines on fabric that is quite therapeutic for me,\u201d she reflects. Dot Cottage, as it is now known, is in a row of four terraced Grade II-listed dwellings, in the medieval centre of Rye. As a tenant, Reynolds had painted the front room pink and stared to slowly dismantle the fitted kitchen. As the owner, she quickly made it her own. \u201cI\u2019ve dressed the house how I dress myself \u2013 and change it often,\u201d she says. \u201cI like stripes, pattern, colour, bows, polka dots \u2013 and I don\u2019t buy anything new. Apart from my mattress and duvet, everything is old. I love things that have a story.\u201d The whole effect is unmistakably British \u2013 and when Reynolds is abroad, the cottage is available to rent. On the day I visit, a German couple has just vacated, having spent the week immersed in her joyful, nostalgic aesthetic. The front room, which you step into directly off the narrow street, is now a deep, mossy green (Bancha from Farrow &amp; Ball). A green glass chandelier hangs in the bay window above a squishy, floral armchair found at an auction. The second-hand sofa has been reupholstered in chartreuse velvet and stacked with floral cushions. Vintage prints and original artworks hang on the walls. The two small tables have been customised with black dots big and small, the bamboo dining chairs sprayed pillarbox red. Connected to the front room is a miniscule, custom-made kitchen. The starting point for her design was a dilapidated wooden cabinet she found at Ardingly antiques fair. A local carpenter removed the top and transformed it into hidden drawers. The splashback and shelf behind the work surface were made from the sides of an old billiards table. \u201cI can get my hands on so much old wood, why would I need any new stuff?\u201d Behind the shelf is a beautiful brick wall and ancient connecting door that Reynolds found behind plasterboard when removing the old kitchen cabinets. Upstairs, there is one bedroom and a bathroom, both with wide, wonky floorboards and whitewashed walls. Colour comes in candy-striped fabrics in the bedroom, a pair of chintzy bedside lights and faux-rococo gilt mirrors. A collection of straw boaters, cherubs and kitsch ceramics adorns the walls and surfaces. \u201cThe stripes and chintz are a family aesthetic,\u201d says Reynolds. \u201cSometimes I\u2019ll buy something and then go to my granny\u2019s old house and find I\u2019ve bought something that is in that house.\u201d I ask what\u2019s next for Polka. \u201cI didn\u2019t go into it thinking where it would go,\u201d she admits. \u201cThat\u2019s the story of my life, really.

      "body": "<p>European politics isn\u2019t predictable, so why should the film festival circuit be? This time last year, Venice pulled out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/08/venice-film-festival-2018-round-up-alfonso-cuaron-roma\" title=\"\">a corker of a programme</a> \u2013 <em>Roma</em>, <em>The Favourite</em>, <em>Sunset</em>, a posthumous Orson Welles feature \u2013 and we all said that Cannes would have to raise its game accordingly. Well, this year Cannes did raise its game, while Venice discreetly returned to being solid but less than indispensable. The 76th festival had its gems, but was short on real excitement \u2013 although, as befits our age, the real buzz came less from the films than from the social media that amassed around them.</p> <p>Arguably the biggest controversy this year, providing ripples that extended beyond the Lido, came from a mainstream Hollywood production, but an unusually dark one \u2013 Todd Phillips\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5oZx61dRZw\" title=\"\"><strong>Joker</strong></a>, a sombre, arguably nihilistic spin on the Batman villain. It was a tour de force for Joaquin Phoenix, and a flamboyantly knowing tip of the hat to certain Martin Scorsese movies. The film itself was all but eclipsed by the Twitter storm it provoked \u2013 was it really a message of empowerment to incels and other embittered social outsiders? \u2013 but it is certainly one of the boldest Hollywood productions for some time.</p> <p>Among the dominant flavours of Venice 2019 were despair and damnation, making this year at times quite indigestibly apocalyptic. If <em>Joker</em>\u2019s unalloyed bleakness was the very antithesis of superhero escapism, it was easily outdone for sheer moral and visual horror by Czech director V\u00e1clav Marhoul\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH5YKki0KBs\" title=\"\"><strong>The Painted Bird</strong></a>, a near three-hour adaptation of Jerzy Kosi\u0144ski\u2019s now largely forgotten 1965 bestseller, which followed a young boy on his travels through a second world war landscape resembling a medieval hell. From the word go, there was no imaginable atrocity that was not inflicted on the boy, assorted other adults and animals and, indeed, the audience (and that includes the dubbing of Harvey Keitel and Julian Sands). The film is painstakingly executed, magnificently photographed in black and white, and was much admired by some; for me, it was a grisly parody of the more authentic darkness of the Hungarian director B\u00e9la Tarr, to whom its aesthetic owes a lot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4324d9eae40814751e457f20daf4c73e85b7f8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4324d9eae40814751e457f20daf4c73e85b7f8e/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joaquin Phoenix in Joker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joaquin Phoenix in Joker: \u2018one of the boldest Hollywood productions for some time\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niko Tavernise</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Differently ordeal-like was Oliver Hermanus\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0j15XpRmHI\" title=\"\"><strong>Moffie</strong></a>, which evoked the brutality faced by white South African army conscripts in the 1980s, especially if they were gay (the title is an Afrikaans homophobic slur). A sort of sub-equatorial <em>Full Metal Jacket</em>, this was in no way pleasurable, but it had the ring of brutal authenticity and some terrific performances from a young cast who boldly submit to its boot camp rigours.</p> <p>But for bleakness with a leavening touch of gallows humour, there was respite in <strong>About Endlessness</strong> from Roy Andersson, the Swedish auteur who won Venice\u2019s top prize, the Golden Lion, in 2014 with his snappily titled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/26/pigeon-sat-bench-reflecting-existence-review-swede-dreams\" title=\"\"><em>A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence</em></a>. Andersson is the most deadpan and consistent of jokers. <em>About Endlessness</em> is his fourth film in which the human condition is enacted in a series of elaborately staged vignettes, acted out by performers made up to resemble whey-faced extras in a zombie movie.</p> <p>Largely set in Andersson\u2019s own version of Stockholm, it also features a Chagall-like couple flying over a ruined city, a defeated army marching off to Siberia, and a glimpse of Hitler\u2019s bunker, where his weary generals can barely muster a \u201cSieg Heil!\u201d. If you\u2019re willing to tune in to Andersson\u2019s unique, visionary brand of anti-cinema, it\u2019s one of the best things here, albeit no departure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8e66f22121029117dc8f30c04902e3d5f349c057\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e66f22121029117dc8f30c04902e3d5f349c057/534_540_5971_3963/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from The Painted Bird.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">V\u00e1clav Marhoul\u2019s gruelling second world war epic The Painted Bird, \u2018in which no imaginable atrocity was not inflicted on the boy\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jan Dobrovsk\u00fd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There were some significant big-name disappointments in and out of competition, and the true-life dramas weren\u2019t remotely as incisive as Venice\u2019s best documentaries \u2013 notably Lauren Greenfield\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL-H0TastSE\" title=\"\"><strong>The Kingmaker</strong></a>, a terrifying portrait of Imelda Marcos and the legacy of a power broker who simply will not let go of dynastic influence. In the docudrama realm, Olivier Assayas offered a sprawling story of Cuban-American espionage, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrP03bUjAYI\" title=\"\"><strong>Wasp Network</strong></a>, with a cast including Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, but without the nail-biting focus of the director\u2019s previous true-espionage epic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/24/carlos-review-philip-french\" title=\"\"><em>Carlos</em></a>.</p> <p>Then there was Benedict Andrews\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfR-P_q9Ioo\" title=\"\"><strong>Seberg</strong></a>, about the latter days of film star Jean Seberg, persecuted by the CIA for her involvement with black power activists; a lifeless dud, it featured that barely imaginable rarity, a listless Kristen Stewart performance. Steven Soderbergh\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO3ueSK6upU\" title=\"\"><strong>The Laundromat</strong></a> was an episodic, smart-arsed account of international financial chicanery, as exposed in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\" title=\"\">the Panama Papers</a>, with Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas as J\u00fcrgen Mossack and Ram\u00f3n Fonseca, winking to camera in the finance for dummies style of <em>The Big Short</em>. It\u2019s a horribly self-satisfied film, the absolute tooth-grater of the festival.</p> <p><em>The Laundromat</em> was one of three Netflix films here; the others were Noah Baumbach\u2019s <em>Marriage Story</em> (see below) and a laborious, revisionist take on the Henry V story, David Mich\u00f4d\u2019s <strong>The King</strong>, with a solemn Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as Hal, rising to the challenge of wearing the crown. The battle scenes, when they came, were great \u2013 hardly the glorious Agincourt of the Laurence Olivier version \u2013 but the film is distinguished mainly by a nicely downbeat turn from Joel Edgerton, who co-wrote a verbally rich script and plays Falstaff as a canny, no-nonsense military strategist, rather like a pragmatic second-division football manager.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9f2ac32f199c1b27750dba3626db5977837efc1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f2ac32f199c1b27750dba3626db5977837efc1d/130_0_3793_3793/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brad Pitt in Ad Astra.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brad Pitt in Ad Astra.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fran\u00e7ois Duhamel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other established names did better at the start of the week. James Gray offered an enjoyable, all-out loopy space adventure, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8lVYSSPQpU\" title=\"\"><strong>Ad Astra</strong></a>, with Brad Pitt heading to the ends of the universe in search of the meaning of it all, and in search of his dad (an inimitably grouchy Tommy Lee Jones). Roman Polanski, whose personal reputation meant that many were unhappy about him being in competition at all, actually came up trumps with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjunBp9YqP4\" title=\"\"><strong>An Officer and a Spy</strong></a>, about the 1890s Dreyfus case. For some, Polanski making a film about a case of unjust accusation was downright cheek, but this was a more than solid historical drama \u2013 a little academic, but gripping and cogent, with sometime joker Jean Dujardin (<em>The Artist</em>) excelling in all seriousness as the intelligence officer who unravels the true facts.</p> <p>And then, triumphantly, there was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfBSbgaqPr8\" title=\"\"><strong>Marriage Story</strong></a>, Noah Baumbach\u2019s acidic dramedy about a theatrical couple (Scarlett Johansson, Adam Driver) splitting up, the divide between LA and New York cultures paralleling their emotional schism. Both leads are dazzling, as are Laura Dern, Alan Alda and Ray Liotta as their attorneys; by the time Driver sings a solo version of Sondheim\u2019s Being Alive, this profound, pitiless film hadn\u2019t left a dry eye in the house.</p> <p>Another Venice controversy came before the festival when the programme was announced, and it was revealed that there were only two films by women in competition \u2013 scant improvement on last year\u2019s meagre one. One of the two felt like a good-intentions inclusion: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4WdvsZLDtg\" title=\"\"><strong>The Perfect Candidate</strong></a>, by Saudi director Haifaa al-Mansour. About a young woman doctor attempting to buck the Saudi patriarchy by standing as a local councillor, it was a passionate and very necessary drama, but lukewarm as cinema. But something else again was Australian first feature <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I990jE6MY9g\" title=\"\"><strong>Babyteeth</strong></a> by Shannon Murphy, who immediately put her wayward stamp on this tragicomedy adapted by Rita Kalnejais from her own play. It\u2019s about a suburban teenager with cancer (Eliza Scanlen), who takes up with a local bad boy, to the horror of her very dysfunctional parents (Ben Mendelsohn; <em>The Babadook\u2019</em>s superb Essie Davis). With dazzling colour choices, off-key wit and a wild sense of mischief, this was the freshest discovery here.</p> <h2>The best of Venice</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"885c116e54e857daec0f5d8ebaaa0aa2f00c8b6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/885c116e54e857daec0f5d8ebaaa0aa2f00c8b6a/0_318_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roy Andersson\u2019s About Endlessness.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anders Hellstr\u00f6m and Tatiana Delaunay in Roy Andersson\u2019s About Endlessness.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong> Best films</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n59tgVPvhW4\" title=\"\"><em>Marriage Story</em></a>, directed by Noah Baumbach; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5oZx61dRZw\" title=\"\"><em>Joker</em></a> (Todd Phillips); <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vikznX0uHgw\" title=\"\"><em>About Endlessness</em></a> (Roy Andersson), above.</p> <p><strong>Best documentaries</strong><br><em>The Kingmaker</em> (Lauren Greenfield); <em>Collective</em> (Alexander Nanau), a gripping account of how a nightclub fire led to a scandalous revelations about Romania\u2019s health service; <em>State Funeral</em>, Sergei Loznitsa\u2019s archive assemblage of the vast ceremonial spectacle that surrounded the death of Stalin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf60f232b9ed5e48acbe3e5633fc141da90ad833\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf60f232b9ed5e48acbe3e5633fc141da90ad833/0_118_1772_1063/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eliza Scanlen in Babyteeth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eliza Scanlen in Babyteeth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lisa Tomasetti</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Best performers</strong><br>Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver (<em>Marriage Story</em>); the sad-sack ensemble cast of <em>About Endlessness</em>; Essie Davis and Ben Mendelsohn as neurotic parents in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I990jE6MY9g&amp;t=14s\" title=\"\"><em>Babyteeth</em></a>.</p> <p><strong>Best supporting actors</strong><br>Laura Dern as a touchy-feely but sabre-toothed attorney in <em>Marriage Story</em>; South African actor Hilton Pelser as a coldly brutalising army sergeant in <em>Moffie</em>.</p> <p><strong>Most welcome return in a lead role</strong><br>David Thewlis as a food inspector in Atom Egoyan\u2019s twisty drama <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKl-3F2PJnc\" title=\"\"><em>Guest of Honour</em></a>.</p> <p><strong>Best new- and up-and\u2011comers</strong><br>Eliza Scanlen, previously in TV\u2019s <em>Sharp Objects</em>, as the lead in <em>Babyteeth</em>; Kai Luke Brummer in <em>Moffie</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f63a2b23adbc8329b07effd2089e3c38fb66f81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f63a2b23adbc8329b07effd2089e3c38fb66f81/0_27_2550_1530/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas in The Laundromat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas in The Laundromat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lifestyle pictures/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Best cinematography</strong><br>Sergio Armstrong for the dazzling colour schemes of Pablo Larra\u00edn\u2019s Chilean drama <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVGjzPaV6s\" title=\"\"><em>Ema</em></a>.</p> <p><strong>Snazziest dance sequences</strong><br>The reggaeton routines in <em>Ema</em>.</p> <p><strong>Best rant</strong><br>Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal in <em>Ema</em>, explaining why he can\u2019t stand reggaeton.</p> <p><strong>Most egregiously awful foreign accents</strong><br> Gary Oldman as German-Panamian banker J\u00fcrgen Mossack in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO3ueSK6upU\" title=\"\"><em>The Laundromat</em></a>; Robert Pattinson as the dauphin in <em>The King</em>, the full 15th-century Inspector Clouseau.</p>",

      "bodyText": "European politics isn\u2019t predictable, so why should the film festival circuit be? This time last year, Venice pulled out a corker of a programme \u2013 Roma, The Favourite, Sunset, a posthumous Orson Welles feature \u2013 and we all said that Cannes would have to raise its game accordingly. Well, this year Cannes did raise its game, while Venice discreetly returned to being solid but less than indispensable. The 76th festival had its gems, but was short on real excitement \u2013 although, as befits our age, the real buzz came less from the films than from the social media that amassed around them. Arguably the biggest controversy this year, providing ripples that extended beyond the Lido, came from a mainstream Hollywood production, but an unusually dark one \u2013 Todd Phillips\u2019s Joker, a sombre, arguably nihilistic spin on the Batman villain. It was a tour de force for Joaquin Phoenix, and a flamboyantly knowing tip of the hat to certain Martin Scorsese movies. The film itself was all but eclipsed by the Twitter storm it provoked \u2013 was it really a message of empowerment to incels and other embittered social outsiders? \u2013 but it is certainly one of the boldest Hollywood productions for some time. Among the dominant flavours of Venice 2019 were despair and damnation, making this year at times quite indigestibly apocalyptic. If Joker\u2019s unalloyed bleakness was the very antithesis of superhero escapism, it was easily outdone for sheer moral and visual horror by Czech director V\u00e1clav Marhoul\u2019s The Painted Bird, a near three-hour adaptation of Jerzy Kosi\u0144ski\u2019s now largely forgotten 1965 bestseller, which followed a young boy on his travels through a second world war landscape resembling a medieval hell. From the word go, there was no imaginable atrocity that was not inflicted on the boy, assorted other adults and animals and, indeed, the audience (and that includes the dubbing of Harvey Keitel and Julian Sands). The film is painstakingly executed, magnificently photographed in black and white, and was much admired by some; for me, it was a grisly parody of the more authentic darkness of the Hungarian director B\u00e9la Tarr, to whom its aesthetic owes a lot. Differently ordeal-like was Oliver Hermanus\u2019s Moffie, which evoked the brutality faced by white South African army conscripts in the 1980s, especially if they were gay (the title is an Afrikaans homophobic slur). A sort of sub-equatorial Full Metal Jacket, this was in no way pleasurable, but it had the ring of brutal authenticity and some terrific performances from a young cast who boldly submit to its boot camp rigours. But for bleakness with a leavening touch of gallows humour, there was respite in About Endlessness from Roy Andersson, the Swedish auteur who won Venice\u2019s top prize, the Golden Lion, in 2014 with his snappily titled A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence. Andersson is the most deadpan and consistent of jokers. About Endlessness is his fourth film in which the human condition is enacted in a series of elaborately staged vignettes, acted out by performers made up to resemble whey-faced extras in a zombie movie. Largely set in Andersson\u2019s own version of Stockholm, it also features a Chagall-like couple flying over a ruined city, a defeated army marching off to Siberia, and a glimpse of Hitler\u2019s bunker, where his weary generals can barely muster a \u201cSieg Heil!\u201d. If you\u2019re willing to tune in to Andersson\u2019s unique, visionary brand of anti-cinema, it\u2019s one of the best things here, albeit no departure. There were some significant big-name disappointments in and out of competition, and the true-life dramas weren\u2019t remotely as incisive as Venice\u2019s best documentaries \u2013 notably Lauren Greenfield\u2019s The Kingmaker, a terrifying portrait of Imelda Marcos and the legacy of a power broker who simply will not let go of dynastic influence. In the docudrama realm, Olivier Assayas offered a sprawling story of Cuban-American espionage, Wasp Network, with a cast including Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, but without the nail-biting focus of the director\u2019s previous true-espionage epic Carlos. Then there was Benedict Andrews\u2019s Seberg, about the latter days of film star Jean Seberg, persecuted by the CIA for her involvement with black power activists; a lifeless dud, it featured that barely imaginable rarity, a listless Kristen Stewart performance. Steven Soderbergh\u2019s The Laundromat was an episodic, smart-arsed account of international financial chicanery, as exposed in the Panama Papers, with Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas as J\u00fcrgen Mossack and Ram\u00f3n Fonseca, winking to camera in the finance for dummies style of The Big Short. It\u2019s a horribly self-satisfied film, the absolute tooth-grater of the festival. The Laundromat was one of three Netflix films here; the others were Noah Baumbach\u2019s Marriage Story (see below) and a laborious, revisionist take on the Henry V story, David Mich\u00f4d\u2019s The King, with a solemn Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as Hal, rising to the challenge of wearing the crown. The battle scenes, when they came, were great \u2013 hardly the glorious Agincourt of the Laurence Olivier version \u2013 but the film is distinguished mainly by a nicely downbeat turn from Joel Edgerton, who co-wrote a verbally rich script and plays Falstaff as a canny, no-nonsense military strategist, rather like a pragmatic second-division football manager. Other established names did better at the start of the week. James Gray offered an enjoyable, all-out loopy space adventure, Ad Astra, with Brad Pitt heading to the ends of the universe in search of the meaning of it all, and in search of his dad (an inimitably grouchy Tommy Lee Jones). Roman Polanski, whose personal reputation meant that many were unhappy about him being in competition at all, actually came up trumps with An Officer and a Spy, about the 1890s Dreyfus case. For some, Polanski making a film about a case of unjust accusation was downright cheek, but this was a more than solid historical drama \u2013 a little academic, but gripping and cogent, with sometime joker Jean Dujardin (The Artist) excelling in all seriousness as the intelligence officer who unravels the true facts. And then, triumphantly, there was Marriage Story, Noah Baumbach\u2019s acidic dramedy about a theatrical couple (Scarlett Johansson, Adam Driver) splitting up, the divide between LA and New York cultures paralleling their emotional schism. Both leads are dazzling, as are Laura Dern, Alan Alda and Ray Liotta as their attorneys; by the time Driver sings a solo version of Sondheim\u2019s Being Alive, this profound, pitiless film hadn\u2019t left a dry eye in the house. Another Venice controversy came before the festival when the programme was announced, and it was revealed that there were only two films by women in competition \u2013 scant improvement on last year\u2019s meagre one. One of the two felt like a good-intentions inclusion: The Perfect Candidate, by Saudi director Haifaa al-Mansour. About a young woman doctor attempting to buck the Saudi patriarchy by standing as a local councillor, it was a passionate and very necessary drama, but lukewarm as cinema. But something else again was Australian first feature Babyteeth by Shannon Murphy, who immediately put her wayward stamp on this tragicomedy adapted by Rita Kalnejais from her own play. It\u2019s about a suburban teenager with cancer (Eliza Scanlen), who takes up with a local bad boy, to the horror of her very dysfunctional parents (Ben Mendelsohn; The Babadook\u2019s superb Essie Davis). With dazzling colour choices, off-key wit and a wild sense of mischief, this was the freshest discovery here. The best of Venice Best films Marriage Story, directed by Noah Baumbach; Joker (Todd Phillips); About Endlessness (Roy Andersson), above. Best documentaries The Kingmaker (Lauren Greenfield); Collective (Alexander Nanau), a gripping account of how a nightclub fire led to a scandalous revelations about Romania\u2019s health service; State Funeral, Sergei Loznitsa\u2019s archive assemblage of the vast ceremonial spectacle that surrounded the death of Stalin. Best performers Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver (Marriage Story); the sad-sack ensemble cast of About Endlessness; Essie Davis and Ben Mendelsohn as neurotic parents in Babyteeth. Best supporting actors Laura Dern as a touchy-feely but sabre-toothed attorney in Marriage Story; South African actor Hilton Pelser as a coldly brutalising army sergeant in Moffie. Most welcome return in a lead role David Thewlis as a food inspector in Atom Egoyan\u2019s twisty drama Guest of Honour. Best new- and up-and\u2011comers Eliza Scanlen, previously in TV\u2019s Sharp Objects, as the lead in Babyteeth; Kai Luke Brummer in Moffie. Best cinematography Sergio Armstrong for the dazzling colour schemes of Pablo Larra\u00edn\u2019s Chilean drama Ema. Snazziest dance sequences The reggaeton routines in Ema. Best rant Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal in Ema, explaining why he can\u2019t stand reggaeton. Most egregiously awful foreign accents Gary Oldman as German-Panamian banker J\u00fcrgen Mossack in The Laundromat; Robert Pattinson as the dauphin in The King, the full 15th-century Inspector Clouseau.",

Denied access to running water, the Batek\u2019s only water supply is from a mountain stream that is collected in a small pond and then piped into the village.

Things felt safer in here, he said, but it was not feasible long term as \u201cour old way of life has gone\u201d. \u201cOutside it is hard but at least we have houses, people bring us food and maybe things will get better,\u201d said Jamal. \u201cThis jungle used to be our home but not any more.\u201d The jungle now lies in logged ruins. Three years ago the state government handed over land designated to the tribe to another palm oil company, who ripped up all the tribe\u2019s planted trees and tore down a camp they had constructed. The company promised the village 10,000 ringgit (\u00a32,000) in compensation, but the money has yet to materialise. Then in 2015, the clearance of more than 1,000 acres for the manganese mine began. Sitting in a rickety bamboo shelter, Uncle Johan Tahun\u2019s mottled skin, deep wrinkles and hunched frame make him look decades older than his 60 years. \u201cAfter they started clearing the jungle, one by one, people here got sick. Our bodies are always hot and our skin burns from the sun,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the jungle was intact, people in the tribe were living to 70, 80. Now not even our children are surviving.\u201d Pulling a pandan leaf cigarette from behind his ear, he shook his head. \u201cWe feel lost. We have lost our identity, our way of life. Everything gone too fast.\u201d How Malaysia\u2019s rainforests were laid waste Malaysia has paid a high price for being one of the world\u2019s largest producers of palm oil, which over the past decade has become one of the most in-demand oils, used in products from biofuels to processed food and beauty products. In the 1980s, the clearing of huge areas of jungle in the Malaysian state of Sabah for oil palm cultivation led to the proportion of forest coverage declining from 51% to 15%. A 2013 study estimated that between 1990 and 2008, 1.4 million hectares of forest in Malaysia were lost to palm oil plantations, wreaking environmental havoc and devastating the habitats of critically endangered animals, including orangutans and tigers. Yet, while Malaysia has come under fire from environmental bodies and the EU over deforestation for palm oil plantations, its government has staunchly defended the trade. To worsen the situation, it has also focused on attempting to make Malaysia the Asian centre for the lucrative mining and production of manganese - to meet growing demand from China but resulting in further deforestation. It has actively encouraged foreign investment in the manganese industry through tax incentives and increased the numbers of licenses for manganese mines. Over the past decade, Malaysia has gone from producing almost no manganese ore to annual output in excess of a million tonnes.",

Earlier in the day, protests broke out in several areas of Hong Kong as security measures tightened at the airport in an attempt to stop protesters\u2019 plans to paralyse the travel hub. The confrontations came as anti-government demonstrations, aimed at drawing global attention to the semi-autonomous Chinese city\u2019s political crisis, came to the end of their 13th week.

The police attack fuelled rumours of deaths and a large number of flowers have been left outside the entrance of the metro station. A small group tried to submit a petition to urge the MTR metro company to release CCTV footage of the police on Saturday afternoon at the station, shortly before staff announced its closure. A similar protest took place outside the Mong Kok police station late on Friday, prompting riot police to fire teargas and bean bag rounds as some had built barricades on streets and set fire to them. Hong Kong\u2019s government said on Saturday that reports of people dying as a result of the police action were \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cmalicious\u201d rumours. Saturday\u2019s demonstrations across Hong Kong were mostly aimed at voicing anger over the police\u2019s use of force, which has escalated as tension reached boiling point during the past three months. Many protesters have insisted the Hong Kong government meet their political demands, including setting up an independent body to investigate the police\u2019s alleged excessive use of force since the protests started in June. Earlier in the week, Hong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, withdrew a controversial extradition bill, which originally ignited the protests. But protesters remain angry about alleged police brutality and have vowed to continue demonstrations. In a front-page editorial on Saturday, the overseas edition of the Communist party\u2019s mouthpiece People\u2019s Daily said \u201ca small bunch of extremely violent elements have become the vanguards of foreign and anti-China forces\u201d and were trying to \u201cdisrupt Hong Kong and paralyse the government to make it into an independent or semi-independent political entity\u201d.

When the Juventus striker Moise Kean was abused in April, a teammate and his manager <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/sports/juventus-racism-moise-kean.html\" title=\"\">accused him of provoking the abuse</a>. This is the footballing equivalent of saying a rape victim asked for it. Fare has warned that the Italian game might have to be put into \u201cspecial measures\u201d. Under pressure, Serie A has announced yet another anti-racism initiative.</p> <p>In England, the Manchester United star Marcus Rashford was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/06/marcus-rashford-football-going-backwards-in-fight-against-racism\" title=\"\">recently subjected</a> to foul abuse on social media, and Manchester City player Raheem Sterling, who spoke out against racism last year, is a frequent target.

In the World Cup and other prestige competitions, politicians queue up to be pictured with winning teams and their stars. In France, the multi-ethnic makeup of the national team is presented as proof of a successful, integrated society.</p> <p>That\u2019s a highly contentious claim. But at least Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s president, is trying. In July, he called for an end to the \u201cculture of hate\u201d and said matches should be halted when abuse occurred. \u201cWe cannot become accustomed to homophobia and racism on the pretext that we are in a football stadium.\u201d Macron also said that pay discrimination against women footballers should cease.</p> <p>Yet, by and large, national politicians say the right things about discrimination in sport when required but do little. Worse still, rightwing populist leaders in Italy, Germany, eastern Europe and Russia actively celebrate intolerance. The next time a black player is abused, Italians in particular should look for a connection with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/05/italys-coalition-enemies-open-way-matteo-salvini-return\" title=\"\">the rise of Matteo Salvini</a> and like-minded xenophobes.

Worse still, Inter supporters known as ultras defended the Cagliari fans, saying they were just trying to put Lukaku off his game. \u201cWe are really sorry you thought that what happened in Cagliari was racist,\u201d a Curva Nord Facebook post said. \u201cYou have to understand that Italy is not like many other north European countries where racism is a REAL problem.\u201d Delusional excuses aside, it is certainly true that the disease is Europe-wide \u2013 but Italy seems particularly sick. When the Juventus striker Moise Kean was abused in April, a teammate and his manager accused him of provoking the abuse. This is the footballing equivalent of saying a rape victim asked for it. Fare has warned that the Italian game might have to be put into \u201cspecial measures\u201d. Under pressure, Serie A has announced yet another anti-racism initiative. In England, the Manchester United star Marcus Rashford was recently subjected to foul abuse on social media, and Manchester City player Raheem Sterling, who spoke out against racism last year, is a frequent target. Both men are black. Last month, a French Ligue 1 match between Nice and Marseille was halted after fans waved homophobic banners \u2013 a reminder that discrimination has many faces. An Observer survey last season found that racism in football is on the rise across Europe, in line with the concurrent rise in antisemitic incidents, hostility towards migrants, gender-related discrimination and a gloomy, overall picture of increasing intolerance. The increase extends from Sunday-morning park football up to international competitions. In April, Montenegro and Hungary were fined for their fans\u2019 racist behaviour during games with England and Slovakia respectively. Vincent Kompany, former Manchester City captain and Lukaku\u2019s Belgian teammate, said football\u2019s escalating racism crisis was due to national federations and international governing bodies such as Uefa and Fifa lacking diversity among top administrators. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have diversity in places of power like boardrooms, you can\u2019t have the right decisions in terms of sanctions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe real racism lies in the fact that none of these institutions has representatives that can actually understand what Romelu is going through.\u201d Perhaps the most extraordinary aspect of this pan-European crisis of intolerance is the distance maintained by most political leaders. In the World Cup and other prestige competitions, politicians queue up to be pictured with winning teams and their stars. In France, the multi-ethnic makeup of the national team is presented as proof of a successful, integrated society. That\u2019s a highly contentious claim. But at least Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s president, is trying. In July, he called for an end to the \u201cculture of hate\u201d and said matches should be halted when abuse occurred. \u201cWe cannot become accustomed to homophobia and racism on the pretext that we are in a football stadium.\u201d Macron also said that pay discrimination against women footballers should cease. Yet, by and large, national politicians say the right things about discrimination in sport when required but do little. Worse still, rightwing populist leaders in Italy, Germany, eastern Europe and Russia actively celebrate intolerance. The next time a black player is abused, Italians in particular should look for a connection with the rise of Matteo Salvini and like-minded xenophobes. Fittingly perhaps, his party is called the League.",

      "body": "<p>It takes a lot for me to muster up enthusiasm for a Middleton, but last week, James brought a noteworthy date to the <em>GQ</em> awards: his cocker spaniel Ella. I\u2019m not sure if anyone on the red carpet took the opportunity to shout: \u201cWho are you wearing?\u201d at the dog, but allow me: she sported a flattering black jacket with a fetching tartan sort-of kilt, with Pets as Therapy in a blocky white print on the back. In January, Middleton <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6583137/With-devastating-honesty-courage-JAMES-MIDDLETON-reveals-private-battle-depression.html\" title=\"\">wrote eloquently </a>and at length about his experience of depression; in the piece, he explained how vital his dogs, and particularly Ella, had been for his recovery.</p> <p>Middleton volunteers for Pets as Therapy and Ella is a fully fledged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/12/doctors-note-dog-on-plane-emotional-support-animals\" title=\"\">therapy dog</a>. Whenever I hear about support animals, I think of an unforgettable <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/20/pets-allowed\" title=\"\"><em>New Yorker</em> feature from 2014, in which writer Patricia Marx </a>explored the growing numbers of officially sanctioned \u201cemotional support animals\u201d by trying to take a snake, a turkey and an alpaca with her into restaurants, museums and shops (not at the same time). It is a brilliant, witty piece and one of my all-time favourites. It revelled in the absurdity of the ease with which a psychologist could deem a peacock, for example \u2013 banned from a United Airlines flight in 2018 \u2013 necessary for emotional support.</p> <p>But that\u2019s the silly side. A charity such as Pets as Therapy recognises that animals can be used to improve the moods of people in care homes, in schools and hospitals. Pets can be so calming that robotic animals have been used to comfort patients with dementia. They can bring shy children out of their shells. They can be a balm for loneliness. I keep reading new studies that suggest people with dogs are healthier and happier. It makes sense: I walk every single day, in all weathers. When I walk, I chat to strangers about our dogs. It\u2019s small talk, but it\u2019s a connection.</p> <p>In difficult times, my dog is a constant. She can be a reason to get up in the morning and a reason to go outside. I understand that not everyone likes dogs and that not everyone can have a dog. As a lifelong renter, I count myself extremely lucky to have an understanding landlord, because having her in my life has improved the quality of it beyond what I could have ever imagined.</p> <p>With the comfort and calm that she brings, she is worth the embarrassment of every picnic she ever crashed (as a puppy \u2013 she\u2019s a good girl now). Ella, then, certainly deserved her big night out. Let\u2019s hope she didn\u2019t feel too, er, ruff in the morning.</p> <h2>Barbie Ferreira: Euphoria\u2019s star happy at last</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31e53dbcdaa67c7efbd0f4346fecd1208879a779\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31e53dbcdaa67c7efbd0f4346fecd1208879a779/181_0_3398_2039/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barbie Ferreira\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barbie Ferreira: \u2018I was like OK, \u201cThe cat\u2019s out of the bag.

In a new cover feature for <em>Garage</em> magazine, she has worked with the photographer Ryan McGinley and the artist Simone Leigh to create \u201ca new vision of black womanhood\u201d, by reimagining Leigh\u2019s work. In conversation with Leigh, Zendaya also talks about her aunties in Oakland being Black Panthers.</p> <p>In the <em>New York Times</em>, another of <em>Euphoria</em>\u2019s stars, Barbie Ferreira, who portrays the One Direction fan-fiction writer turned cam-girl Kat, discusses her close friendship with Hunter Schafer, who plays Jules, and what she has in common with her character. She explains that wearing latex and leather made her feel comfortable in a body she had struggled to accept: \u201cI was like OK, \u2018The cat\u2019s out of the bag. I\u2019m fat,\u2019\u201d she said. Both interviews seemed an intellectual world away from the traditional \u201cI\u2019m so grateful\u201d platitudes of young-star profiles, in which a newish actor is scared to say anything at all.

      "bodyText": "It takes a lot for me to muster up enthusiasm for a Middleton, but last week, James brought a noteworthy date to the GQ awards: his cocker spaniel Ella. I\u2019m not sure if anyone on the red carpet took the opportunity to shout: \u201cWho are you wearing?\u201d at the dog, but allow me: she sported a flattering black jacket with a fetching tartan sort-of kilt, with Pets as Therapy in a blocky white print on the back. In January, Middleton wrote eloquently and at length about his experience of depression; in the piece, he explained how vital his dogs, and particularly Ella, had been for his recovery. Middleton volunteers for Pets as Therapy and Ella is a fully fledged therapy dog. Whenever I hear about support animals, I think of an unforgettable New Yorker feature from 2014, in which writer Patricia Marx explored the growing numbers of officially sanctioned \u201cemotional support animals\u201d by trying to take a snake, a turkey and an alpaca with her into restaurants, museums and shops (not at the same time). It is a brilliant, witty piece and one of my all-time favourites. It revelled in the absurdity of the ease with which a psychologist could deem a peacock, for example \u2013 banned from a United Airlines flight in 2018 \u2013 necessary for emotional support. But that\u2019s the silly side. A charity such as Pets as Therapy recognises that animals can be used to improve the moods of people in care homes, in schools and hospitals. Pets can be so calming that robotic animals have been used to comfort patients with dementia. They can bring shy children out of their shells. They can be a balm for loneliness. I keep reading new studies that suggest people with dogs are healthier and happier. It makes sense: I walk every single day, in all weathers. When I walk, I chat to strangers about our dogs. It\u2019s small talk, but it\u2019s a connection. In difficult times, my dog is a constant. She can be a reason to get up in the morning and a reason to go outside. I understand that not everyone likes dogs and that not everyone can have a dog. As a lifelong renter, I count myself extremely lucky to have an understanding landlord, because having her in my life has improved the quality of it beyond what I could have ever imagined. With the comfort and calm that she brings, she is worth the embarrassment of every picnic she ever crashed (as a puppy \u2013 she\u2019s a good girl now). Ella, then, certainly deserved her big night out. Let\u2019s hope she didn\u2019t feel too, er, ruff in the morning. Barbie Ferreira: Euphoria\u2019s star happy at last I devoured all of the wonderful HBO drama Euphoria greedily, both aghast at the horrors of its teenage cruelties and charmed by its sweet naivety. As the troubled Rue, former Disney star Zendaya has pulled off an astonishing career transformation. In a new cover feature for Garage magazine, she has worked with the photographer Ryan McGinley and the artist Simone Leigh to create \u201ca new vision of black womanhood\u201d, by reimagining Leigh\u2019s work. In conversation with Leigh, Zendaya also talks about her aunties in Oakland being Black Panthers. In the New York Times, another of Euphoria\u2019s stars, Barbie Ferreira, who portrays the One Direction fan-fiction writer turned cam-girl Kat, discusses her close friendship with Hunter Schafer, who plays Jules, and what she has in common with her character. She explains that wearing latex and leather made her feel comfortable in a body she had struggled to accept: \u201cI was like OK, \u2018The cat\u2019s out of the bag. I\u2019m fat,\u2019\u201d she said. Both interviews seemed an intellectual world away from the traditional \u201cI\u2019m so grateful\u201d platitudes of young-star profiles, in which a newish actor is scared to say anything at all. It feels like a shift is happening and what a refreshing shift it is. Kaia Gerber: the games supermodels really play The model Kaia Gerber landed her first British Vogue cover last week, at the age of 18. In the gorgeous Steven Meisel shoot that accompanies it, she bears more than a passing resemblance to her mother. To paraphrase the great Mrs Merton, I wonder what first attracted the fashion world to the daughter of supermodel Cindy Crawford.

Who wouldn\u2019t want to live the life of a 70-year-old woman, who got to retire at a reasonable age and probably owns her own house?

      "body": "<p>When I started researching my mother\u2019s family, I had no idea what I would find, or how the process would affect me. Would I meet interesting relatives? Would I discover unpleasant secrets? Above all, would answering the question \u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d be a positive experience? Growing up, I was told a lot about my father\u2019s side, the Alexanders, who in the 1930s escaped Nazi Germany and came to England. Their stories have always stayed with me and inspired me to write two books: <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/aug/31/german-jewish-nazi-hunter-auschwitz\" title=\"\">Hanns and Rudolf</a></em> about my uncle Hanns who tracked down and captured the commandant of Auschwitz, Rudolf H\u00f6ss, and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/19/saving-house-lost-to-nazis-berlin-wall\" title=\"\">The House by the Lake</a></em> about my great-grandfather\u2019s weekend house outside Berlin, which bore witness to the 20th century.</p> <p>History, and my personal connection to it, has always been important to me. I am strangely motivated to explore what happened before my time. When I hold artefacts from the past \u2013 whether it\u2019s a crinkled birth certificate, a chipped but much-used cup or some well-thumbed love letter \u2013 I\u2019m deeply moved. And so I return to my family\u2019s stories, time and again.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Grandad took me out to lunch at the Carvery. He owned the place</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>All I knew about my mother\u2019s family, the Salmons and Glucksteins, was that they were, it was said, the force behind J Lyons, which at one time was the largest catering company in the world. J Lyons as in Lyons Teashops, Lyons Corner Houses, Lyons Maid, Lyons Tea, the Nippy waitresses, Lyons Cakes, the Trocadero and the Wimpy hamburger chain. I grew up in the 1970s, just as the Lyons food empire was being broken up so, frustratingly, my own experience of the company is limited, but to many people in Britain and around the world the name still carries weight.</p> <p>I do have one memory, though. When I was nine, my mother\u2019s father Sam, or Popop as we called him, took me out for lunch at the Carvery in Marble Arch. I remember being awed by the plush red-velvet chairs, the perfect white linen and the sparkling chandeliers. Around us men in pleated chef\u2019s hats and starched white jackets pushed carts piled high with food: oval platters of roast lamb, chicken and beef and, later, chocolate g\u00e2teaux, cheesecake, apple strudel and pear flan. \u201cYou can eat as much as you want,\u201d my grandfather told me. He owned the restaurant, after all.</p> <p>I began my research at the National Archives in Kew. There I discovered a customs record from August 1843, which was titled List of Aliens. This was evidence of my family\u2019s arrival in London after fleeing antisemitic persecution in Prussia and the Netherlands. Next, I wrote to the General Register Office to obtain birth and death certificates. Through these documents I learned that one of my relatives died of a carbuncle. Another was illiterate and could not sign her marriage certificate. And then there was Lena and Barnett Salmon \u2013 my grandfather\u2019s grandparents \u2013 who endured the death of six of their children. In one week they lost three kids to scarlet fever.</p> <p>Some of the things I learned made me feel proud. In 1934, for instance, my great-grandfather, Isidore Salmon, told the owner of the <em>Daily Mail</em> and <em>Daily Mirror</em>, Viscount Rothermere, that if he did not withdraw support for the fascist leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/02/sir-oswald-mosley-and-free-speech-dilemma-archive-1962\" title=\"\">Oswald </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/02/sir-oswald-mosley-and-free-speech-dilemma-archive-1962\" title=\"\">Mosley</a>, then J Lyons would stop advertising in his papers. For Isidore, this was not without risk. Ever since they had escaped Prussia, the family had kept their heads below the parapet. By taking a stand against Mosley, Isidore could be cast as unpatriotic. According to Mosley, Rothermere immediately withdrew his support. Starved of the oxygen of press publicity, support for the fascist movement dwindled.</p> <p>There was also plenty for me to feel guilty about. My mother\u2019s family\u2019s wealth came originally from Salmon &amp; Gluckstein Ltd, a tobacco business that they built in the mid-19th century. This meant that not only did they make money from selling cigarettes and cigars, but the tobacco they used came from Virginia, on land cultivated by slaves. This raised questions in my mind about responsibility and reparations. As it happens, I am familiar with the process of restitution and the challenges of intergenerational reconciliation. My father\u2019s family owned a house by a lake near Berlin that was stolen from them when the Nazis came to power and which has only now, some 80 years later, been restored. This time the shoe was firmly on the other foot and it did not feel quite as comfortable.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They were pioneers, globalising taste and spreading luxury\u2026</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To truly understand my mother\u2019s family, I knew I had to get beyond the public archives. I had to gain access to their private letters, unpublished memoirs and photographs. But to see these precious artefacts, I had to convince my distant relatives to hand them over, people who I wouldn\u2019t have recognised in the street.</p> <p>I started making phone calls.

      "bodyText": "When I started researching my mother\u2019s family, I had no idea what I would find, or how the process would affect me. Would I meet interesting relatives? Would I discover unpleasant secrets? Above all, would answering the question \u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d be a positive experience? Growing up, I was told a lot about my father\u2019s side, the Alexanders, who in the 1930s escaped Nazi Germany and came to England. Their stories have always stayed with me and inspired me to write two books: Hanns and Rudolf about my uncle Hanns who tracked down and captured the commandant of Auschwitz, Rudolf H\u00f6ss, and The House by the Lake about my great-grandfather\u2019s weekend house outside Berlin, which bore witness to the 20th century. History, and my personal connection to it, has always been important to me. I am strangely motivated to explore what happened before my time. When I hold artefacts from the past \u2013 whether it\u2019s a crinkled birth certificate, a chipped but much-used cup or some well-thumbed love letter \u2013 I\u2019m deeply moved. And so I return to my family\u2019s stories, time and again. All I knew about my mother\u2019s family, the Salmons and Glucksteins, was that they were, it was said, the force behind J Lyons, which at one time was the largest catering company in the world. J Lyons as in Lyons Teashops, Lyons Corner Houses, Lyons Maid, Lyons Tea, the Nippy waitresses, Lyons Cakes, the Trocadero and the Wimpy hamburger chain. I grew up in the 1970s, just as the Lyons food empire was being broken up so, frustratingly, my own experience of the company is limited, but to many people in Britain and around the world the name still carries weight. I do have one memory, though. When I was nine, my mother\u2019s father Sam, or Popop as we called him, took me out for lunch at the Carvery in Marble Arch. I remember being awed by the plush red-velvet chairs, the perfect white linen and the sparkling chandeliers. Around us men in pleated chef\u2019s hats and starched white jackets pushed carts piled high with food: oval platters of roast lamb, chicken and beef and, later, chocolate g\u00e2teaux, cheesecake, apple strudel and pear flan. \u201cYou can eat as much as you want,\u201d my grandfather told me. He owned the restaurant, after all. I began my research at the National Archives in Kew. There I discovered a customs record from August 1843, which was titled List of Aliens. This was evidence of my family\u2019s arrival in London after fleeing antisemitic persecution in Prussia and the Netherlands.

Each hair follicle on our scalp is a miniature organ, which follows its own rhythmic cycle of growth, regression and rest throughout our lifetimes. With age, some of them become sensitive to hormones on the scalp, most notably dihydrotestosterone or DHT, which binds to the follicles and miniaturises them until they no longer produce visible hair. However, we know hardly anything about how this miniaturisation process happens, or how to prevent it.</p> <p>According to Prof Ralf Paus, a dermatologist at the University of Manchester, this is because hair loss is still viewed largely as a cosmetic problem, rather than a disease. Because of this, in the western world, neither industry nor academic funding bodies have been willing to spend substantial sums of money on hair research. Despite the scale of patient demand, they have been dissuaded by the knowledge that any drug that hits the market is unlikely to be covered by the NHS or insurance companies.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at the sums pharma companies have spent on coming up with new cancer or heart disease drugs, this is in the billions,\u201d Paus says. \u201cThese investments have just not been made into serious hair research.\u201d</p> <p>Though hair loss may have an undoubtable psychological impact on sufferers, it can\u2019t be compared with chronic life-threatening diseases, many of which are incurable.</p> <p>But there is increasing hope for those experiencing hair loss, as while we\u2019re no closer to finding a way to prevent balding happening in the first place, scientists are developing increasingly novel and ingenuous ways to either replace or regenerate the lost hair.</p> <h2><strong>The next generation of transplants</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0deabb4e24677cb0d0449adba183e1ffed3391be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0deabb4e24677cb0d0449adba183e1ffed3391be/0_1014_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A hair transplant operation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A hair transplant operation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 1905HKN/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With no drug to prevent your hair from falling out, cosmetic surgery has looked to fill the void. Over the past two decades hair transplants \u2013 which take hair follicles from DHT-resistant \u201cdonor areas\u201d at the back and sides of the scalp and relocate them to cover up bald patches \u2013 have offered new hope for hair loss sufferers.</p> <p>Such is the demand that market analysts have predicted the value of the global hair transplant industry will exceed $24.8bn (\u00a320.3bn) by 2024, and the techniques are becoming increasingly advanced. Gho has pioneered a method called <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26370653\" title=\"\">partial </a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26370653\" title=\"\">longitudinal </a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26370653\" title=\"\">follicular </a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26370653\" title=\"\">unit </a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26370653\" title=\"\">extraction</a>, which extracts only a small portion of each hair follicle. This means that the patient isn\u2019t left with scarring on the back and sides of their head, a serious risk with some traditional transplant procedures, which remove strips of skin and graft them into the bald area.</p> <p>\u201cWe discovered that you don\u2019t need the whole follicle, only a very small part, to produce a new hair to be transplanted into the recipient area,\u201d he explains. \u201cThis means that after the treatment, the hairs in the donor area can be cut short, without any, or with minimal, visible density loss.\u201d</p> <p>Despite such advances, one of the current limitations of hair transplants is that many patients tend to require more than one procedure if they continue to lose their hair. Patients who are completely bald may also lack sufficient follicles on the back and sides to cover the bald areas on top.</p> <h2><strong>Generating new hair from scratch</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7bd8af6d5f22c289641c1a132ee4f0dfe6f040c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7bd8af6d5f22c289641c1a132ee4f0dfe6f040c/11_0_2170_1302/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A 3D-printed dish that mimics hair follicles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 3D-printed dish that mimics hair follicles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christiano Lab/Columbia University Irving Medical Center</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead of relying on donor hair, the way forward could be to use patient stem cells to grow whole hair follicles completely from scratch in the lab. These follicles could then be grown in unlimited quantities, and grafted on to the scalp. Many of these initiatives are taking place in Japan and South Korea, where such research is being bankrolled by either the government or private companies.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s more investment in hair research in Korea and Japan, I think due to cultural differences,\u201d explains Ohsang Kwon, a dermatologist at Seoul National University hospital. \u201cIn the western world, a lot of men will shave their head when they lose their hair. It is awkward to do this in our culture because it looks like a sign of a criminal or gangster.\u201d</p> <p>In the past year, a number of Japanese research groups have published reports that hint tantalisingly at a major breakthrough. At Yokohama National University, scientists led by Junji Fukuda have <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961219302674?via%3Dihub\" title=\"\">developed an experimental method</a> for generating new hair follicles from stem cells in far higher quantities than ever before, while later this year, scientists at the <a href=\"http://www.cdb.riken.jp/org/en/research/organ/hair.html\" title=\"\">R</a><a href=\"http://www.cdb.riken.jp/org/en/research/organ/hair.html\" title=\"\">iken Centre for Developmental Biology</a> will launch one of the first ever clinical trials with hair follicles grown entirely from stem cells.</p> <p>\u201cWe definitely hope that stem cell approaches will be a better option for severe hair loss patients who do not have sufficient hairs for hair transplantation,\u201d says Fukuda. \u201cTraditional hair transplantation doesn\u2019t increase hair numbers in the scalp, but hair-regenerative medicine can do in principle, by growing stem cells outside the body.\u201d</p> <p>In the future, 3D printing could even help do this on a large scale. At Columbia University in New York, Angela Christiano is working on creating \u201chair farms\u201d using a grid of 3D-printed plastic moulds which mimic the exact shape of hair follicles. One of the major challenges faced when using stem cells to grow new hairs in a dish is that without the natural cues provided by the scalp, the cells don\u2019t initially realise what they\u2019re meant to do. Growing them in an artificial, hair-like environment helps stimulate them to make a hair, but scientists still have to solve some aesthetic challenges.</p> <p>\u201cWe now need to tackle some key questions, such as: what colour will the hair be?\u201d she says. \u201cHow do we make it pigmented? Is the patient\u2019s hair straight or curly, and how do we create that texture when growing them in a grid? We need to solve these questions before we can think about injecting them into patients\u2019 scalps.\u201d</p> <p>It all offers the potential to eliminate baldness for good. But Paus cautions that we still don\u2019t know whether such methods would be safe, or end up being cosmetically pleasing. And even if they are, the cost will probably mean that they\u2019re only accessible to the very rich.</p> <p>\u201cIn reality there are many, many problems which mean I don\u2019t see it working quite yet,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you create a new mini-organ from scratch, you need to be extra careful that this organ doesn\u2019t grow out of control and become a tumour. It also needs to grow in a way that looks natural.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Reviving existing follicles</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2750cf3ef341491a1d76e98649258766dbe6309a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2750cf3ef341491a1d76e98649258766dbe6309a/0_116_4835_2902/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A light micrograph of hair follicles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A light micrograph of hair follicles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Science Photo Library/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rather than trying to grow completely new follicles, Paus thinks we should focus our efforts on trying to revive the ones we already have. He points out that even completely bald individuals still have 100,000 hair follicles all over their scalp. You just can\u2019t see them.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re miniaturised, so instead of making a normal long hair shaft, they only make a tiny, microscopically visible one,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the organ is still there. So in order to solve the balding problem, we don\u2019t need a single new hair follicle, we just need to get the ones already there to do their job properly again. If we could retransform these miniaturised follicles into big ones, we wouldn\u2019t need a single hair transplant.\u201d</p> <p>Over the last four years, Paus has been exploring one particularly innovative way of doing this. There are a small handful of drugs, such as the immunosuppressant cyclosporine, which cause unwanted hair growth as a side-effect. By studying this, Paus\u2019s research group has identified a completely new pathway for stimulating hair follicles.</p> <p>\u201cThis [has] allowed us to discover some basic hair-growth control principles which could be used to find a completely new class of hair drugs,\u201d he says.</p> <p>They have since found a series of compounds that appear to be highly effective at stimulating this pathway and inducing hair growth when tested on human hair follicle cells in the lab.

Over the course of an hour or so, she delivers a set of songs that, you suspect, comes closer than ever before to replicating her own extraordinary internal coordinates.

On a song called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLZQjkOg3QI\" title=\"\">He Loves Me</a>, which comes early in the set, Howard is unequivocally upbeat. She doesn\u2019t go to church any more, but God surely doesn\u2019t mind her living her life, her way. \u201cI know he still loves me when I\u2019m smoking blunts,\u201d she sings. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t judge me.\u201d</p> <p>Last week in London, the band were dressed in red and black; but tonight, their all-white colour scheme combines with the old-church feel of the Paradiso \u2013 and Howard\u2019s own evangelising stage presence \u2013 to amplify the impression that we\u2019re being taken to church. 13th Century Metal finds Howard going totally pulpit, declaiming like a preacher: \u201cWe are all brothers and sisters!\u201d</p> <p>This is all largely unknown territory for listeners who have yet to hear the record. Only two tracks have come out thus far, and there are, pointedly, no Alabama Shakes songs to hold on to tonight. But Howard has the Paradiso rapt and whooping in short order as one of the album\u2019s loveliest moments, the previously released Stay High, melts everyone\u2019s reserve early on. Naturally, sentiments such as \u201cI just want to stay high with you\u201d play well in the city where cannabinoids have long been part of the fabric of life, even though Howard says elsewhere that it\u2019s about positivity, not the other kind of high.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfizQsGWOxI\" title=\"\">video for the song</a> stars a lip-synching Terry Crews, of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/11/brooklyn-nine-nine-box-set-review\" title=\"\">Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a></em> and <em>The </em><em>Expendables</em> fame, coming home after work to his wife and young daughters, a tribute from Howard to her dad that has racked up more than 6m plays.

Short and Sweet is a forlorn lament that finds Howard accompanying herself on acoustic guitar, her voice spanning a whispered falsetto and a guttural husk, the tune itself alternating between timeless balladeering and an almost avant-garde use of pace and silence. \u201cI just want the beginning,\u201d she howls, of a love affair whose conclusion is unknowable.

Short and Sweet is a forlorn lament that finds Howard accompanying herself on acoustic guitar, her voice spanning a whispered falsetto and a guttural husk, the tune itself alternating between timeless balladeering and an almost avant-garde use of pace and silence. \u201cI just want the beginning,\u201d she howls, of a love affair whose conclusion is unknowable. You can\u2019t help but feel, though, that this new, solo Brittany Howard is a keeper.",

As it turned out, however, most of the men were desperate to meet her after the graphic introduction.</p> <p>Unsolicited dick pics have become a ubiquitous part of modern life. A <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/07/14/men-women-experience-and-view-online-harassment-differ\">2017 Pew Research poll</a>, for example, found that 53% of young women say they\u2019ve been sent unwanted explicit images and 70% of women consider online harassment to be a \u201cmajor problem\u201d. Despite this, however, dick pics are often treated as an amusing cultural phenomenon rather than a serious issue. \u201cLately, it feels like men and women are being told that this increasingly common problem is really no big deal,\u201d Wolfe Herd noted to Texas lawmakers <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2019/08/14/Texas-new-law-sending-unwanted-nudes-dating-apps-texts/\">during hearings about the bill</a>. \u201cWomen in particular are expected to laugh this sort of thing off. But there\u2019s nothing funny about it.\u201d</p> <p>Wolfe Herde is right: the extent to which women are sexually harassed online is no joke. While experts agree that the new Texas law will be hard to enforce, the simple act of passing a law like this sends an important message; it\u2019s a reminder that unsolicited dick pics should not be considered normal or acceptable. Encouragingly, the UK is also taking steps to <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/tech/2019/03/07/uk-government-looking-to-criminalize-unsolicited-dick-pics/\">criminalize \u201conline flashing</a><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/tech/2019/03/07/uk-government-looking-to-criminalize-unsolicited-dick-pics/\">\u201d</a>.

While Lim was going to make around $110,000 another writer, Peter Chiarelli, stood to get between $800,000 to $1m. Chiarelli reportedly offered to split his fee, but Lim insisted she \u201cshouldn\u2019t be dependent on the generosity of the white guy writer\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>South African women say #EnoughisEnough</strong></h2> <p>Thousands of South African women have spent the last few days <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/05/thousands-protest-in-south-africa-over-rising-violence-against-women\">marching against gender-based violence</a>, demanding that the country\u2019s president declare a state of emergency.

Rather than ignoring those signs, Carucci\u2019s photos, which have names like \u201cLipstick and facial hair\u201d, zoom in on them. \u201cTo treat signs of impending middle age with such gravity and drama is both absurd and \u2026 deeply honest about the kind of intense, exhausting self-monitoring that can feel like an inescapable part of owning a female body.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Scarlett Johansson defends Woody Allen</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI love Woody.

Users looking for abortion clinics are often referred to pro-life clinics or, in one instance, a memorial to \u201cunborn\u201d children. Pain and Prejudice \u201cWomen wait longer for pain medication than men, wait longer to be diagnosed with cancer, are more likely to have their physical symptoms ascribed to mental health issues,\u201d writes the Guardian\u2019s Gabrielle Jackson in a piece about her new book, Pain and Prejudice. \u201cMost shockingly of all many women are living in constant pain and don\u2019t know that it\u2019s not normal.\u201d Siri, I\u2019ve got a question about feminism Sorry, the engineers at Apple don\u2019t want to engage with sensitive things like that. A close look at middle age \u201cSigns of aging in women are treated as though they ought to be invisible,\u201d notes an excerpt from Midlife, photographer Elinor Carucci\u2019s book of intimate self-portraits. Rather than ignoring those signs, Carucci\u2019s photos, which have names like \u201cLipstick and facial hair\u201d, zoom in on them. \u201cTo treat signs of impending middle age with such gravity and drama is both absurd and \u2026 deeply honest about the kind of intense, exhausting self-monitoring that can feel like an inescapable part of owning a female body.\u201d Scarlett Johansson defends Woody Allen \u201cI love Woody. I believe him, and I would work with him any time,\u201d Johansson said in a recent interview with the Hollywood Reporter. No doubt it won\u2019t be long before we hear that Johansson is taking the role of Soon-Yi Previn in a future movie. Or maybe she\u2019ll branch out and play a tree.",

But there was so much more than that. The Boomers are now 4-0 at the Basketball World Cup and in sniffing distance of their first quarter-final appearance in 37 years. The Wallabies tuned up for the Rugby World Cup with a routine win over Samoa. The Dragons sent Gareth Widdop on his way a winner in the NRL.

      "bodyText": "A big, big win for Richmond and a big, big win for Greater Western Sydney highlighted a, um, big day of AFL and a big day of sport. But there was so much more than that. The Boomers are now 4-0 at the Basketball World Cup and in sniffing distance of their first quarter-final appearance in 37 years. The Wallabies tuned up for the Rugby World Cup with a routine win over Samoa. The Dragons sent Gareth Widdop on his way a winner in the NRL. Oh, and those crazy cricketers are still at it at Old Trafford. You\u2019ve been splendid but you\u2019ve worn me out. Thanks for your company. Now off to our Ashes liveblog you go! Six goals to Dustin Martin, the second-most accurate return for a team in a VFL/AFL final and 15 goals to four in the final three quarters amounts to an utterly comprehensive win for Richmond. It\u2019s hard to believe, but the Lions had more scoring shots than their conquerors. It was all Richmond after quarter time and Brisbane must now lick their wounds before facing Greater Western Sydney next week. The Tigers, conversely, have a week off and look primed to make it two flags in three years. A bottom-of-the-table clash but a satisfying win for the Dragons all the same. The visitors scored four tries to end a wretched year on a positive note and send out skipper Gareth Widdop with a smile on his face. The end of the season is now here for the Titans and it couldn\u2019t come soon enough. In the words of Richard Parkin, \u201cIt\u2019s a scoreline that flatters the Wallabies in fairness, as they fight back to level the second half 12-12 after an impressive first half\u201d. Relive this Rugby World Cup warm-up courtesy of other such musings from said blogger. AFL: 3QT: Brisbane Lions 6-14 (50) vs Richmond 14.4 (88) \u2013 a swashbuckling third quarter from Dustin Martin and Richmond has all but put this game to bed. Dusty has banked five goals and is looking almost unplayable at times. The Lions have done themselves no favours with poor kicking, but all the same they\u2019ve fallen off the cliff in terms of energy, structure and penetration. They simply do not look to have the answers to Richmond\u2019s pressure and ball movement. Looks like Brett Deledio\u2019s career is done after the injury he suffered in the Giants\u2019 win over the Bulldogs. That move from Richmond to Greater Western Sydney didn\u2019t really work out for him, no? Still, congrats on a good career. AFL: Q3: 6 mins remaining: Brisbane Lions 5-11 (41) vs Richmond 12.4 (76) \u2013 Hugh McCluggage finally breaks the drought, kicking Brisbane\u2019s first goal since the first quarter. In between times, Richmond booted nine straight in a burst that turned this match on its head. Dustin Martin is at his unstoppable best and has kicked four majors to this point. The swagger of Brisbane\u2019s early salvo is now nowhere to be seen, the match now a grind which suits the visitors nicely. And we have a wicket at Old Trafford. Starc castles Bairstow to make England six down. It\u2019s half-time in the footy, so why not pop over to our Ashes blog and see what Geoff Lemon is up to. Rugby union: HT: Australia 22-3 Samoa \u2013 don\u2019t take my word for it. Richard Parkin is your man watching the Wallabies. AFL: HT: Brisbane Lions 4-10 (34) vs Richmond 7.3 (45) \u2013 a big shift in that quarter, partly due to Brisbane\u2019s profligacy but also owing to Richmond\u2019s fighting spirit. This was a four-goal turnaround and now the pressure is on the hosts to respond to the Tigers\u2019 heat. Both Dustin Martin and Tom Lynch look threatening in the forward-50, while Dylan Grimes is doing a good job peeling off Charlie Cameron. The Twittersphere is melting down over the umpiring. An absorbing second half awaits. NRL: HT: Titans 6-6 Dragons - it\u2019s six of one, half a dozen of the other on the Gold Coast in a match that, frankly, is of no interest to anyone who doesn\u2019t support either club. Actually, Titans and Dragons fans, hands up if you could care less about this one. That said, this is definitely worth a second look: AFL: Q2: 4 mins remaining: Brisbane Lions 4-8 (32) vs Richmond 5.3 (33) \u2013 the Lions haven\u2019t taken their chances in the second term but the Tigers have. A great response from Richmond. Hard to see this one not going to the wire. It wasn\u2019t particularly pretty, apparently, but the Boomers are now 4-0 in the tournament and, if Lithuania lose to France later on in Nanjing, will be granted early confirmation of their first Fiba Basketball World Cup quarter-final in 37 years. Regardless, Australia can guarantee their place in the final eight with a win on Monday against France. That\u2019s some achievement and hopefully won\u2019t get lost among all else that\u2019s demanding our attention. Wire reports have described the Dominicans as \u201cswarming\u201d, which, unless they are bees, is completely lost on me. The brilliance of Patty Mills, however, is not. AFL: QT: Brisbane Lions 4-6 (30) vs Richmond 3.0 (18) \u2013 seriously entertaining stuff at the Gabba. Richmond burst out of the blocks with two early goals but it was mostly the Lions after that. I would call their style of play irrepressible. It\u2019s so fast, fluid and aggressive. X-factors and inside-50 entries all over the place. The Tigers haven\u2019t been bad and are only two goals off the pace, but 10 scoring shots to three tells the story of the first quarter. Oops. That wasn\u2019t in the script. Brisbane really needed to win this one to lock in a finals spot. But this result means the Broncos can still miss out if the Tigers and Cronulla play a 90-minute draw on Sunday, a result that would see both Sydney sides qualify. You wouldn\u2019t read about it. Never one to say no to a multiple choice question, DrRudi has sent his pigeon packing with a postcard marked urgent: DrRudi said: Thankyou Scott. Answers on a postcard. e) All of the above. I say: Afraid not, DrRudi, the answer is c). I have an ageing staffy called Ted who never was particularly fussy but in his advancing years is so desperate on the tooth that he thinks nothing of eating a laptop if he even suspects it has been touched by organic matter. The term \u2018Smorgasbord of Sport\u2019 is one bandied around a little too liberally in my humble opinion. I remember, some time ago, berating an aunt for welcoming me to a family dinner with such an alluring utterance as she ushered me into the dining room. Turns out she actually said \u2018Smorgasbord of Pork\u2019, leaving me feeling a tad embarrassed and her a tad confused. Anyway, I digress. The point I\u2019m trying to make is there is plenty going on if you\u2019re hankering for a fill-up of sport. As well as this questionable offering, we also have these morsels to satisfy your hunger: Well, that was rather comprehensive. Not entirely sure what to take out of that, though. Yes, the Bulldogs had been in good form. But what will a home win over them count for when the Giants hit the road to face a better opponent? Evening, sports fans. Apologies for the late start to today\u2019s Sportwatch, but the good folk at Guardian Towers were unable to commence the world\u2019s favourite liveblog in its customary afternoon time slot because: a) Nobody was available; b) Nobody was interested; c) My dog ate it; d) We are almost in a recession and this is the cutback we had to have. Answers on a postcard. First to guess correctly wins a Saturday night reading my drivel. Actually, that\u2019s a fate to which I sentence each of you. C\u2019mon, it\u2019ll be fun. Not only will you be keeping me company but you\u2019ll also be gifting me a fuzzy feeling of reassurance that I\u2019m not the only one spending Saturday night in front of a screen or two. Anyway, here\u2019s what\u2019s happened: All Blacks thumped Tonga, the Pumas had some fun in the sun with a 74-0 win over Randwick, the Warriors beat the Raiders 24-20, the Bulldogs are engaged in a torrid NRL tussle with the Broncos, and the Giants did a job on Western Bulldogs to advance to the second week of the AFL finals. And here\u2019s what\u2019s happening: Brisbane Lions and Richmond will face off for an AFL preliminary final berth (this blog), the Wallabies will rub shoulders with Samoa (different blog), the fourth Ashes Test enters its fourth day (different blog), plus the Boomers play Dominican Republic and the Titans go toe-to-toe with the Dragons in the NRL (this blog).

Northern Ireland has been without a devolved assembly since January 2017 after a serious erosion of trust between the two main parties Sinn F\u00e9in and the Democratic Unionist party. Lidington, who was Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy prime minister when she was in No 10, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThere will have to be some kind of direct rule and, I think, it\u2019s important that the government gets that sorted and in place, before the end of October.\u201d \u201cAt the moment, the Northern Ireland civil service has no power to do things like give emergency support to farmers or food producers whose supply chains into the Irish Republic could be completely killed by a no-deal exit. \u201cThe civil service of Northern Ireland does not have any power to help in those circumstances or to take other emergency measures that would be needed in the event of no deal. \u201cI think it would be unconscionable to leave any part of the United Kingdom without proper governance in the circumstances of that kind of crisis and for Northern Ireland, in particular, where the politics is fragile, the case is stronger than anywhere else to get this sorted in advance.\u201d The Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, hinted this week that the government would move to impose direct rule in the coming weeks if the parties did not agree to start up the executive body again. \u201cIf we cannot secure the restoration of an executive we will pursue the decision-making powers that are needed at the earliest opportunity.\u201d The government has expressed concern that civil servants are not best-placed to run the region and cannot make the political decisions needed in relation to the disbursement of public funds to the NHS, police or education. But civil servants\u2019 powers are limited as officials are mandated to advise politicians, not make policy. Northern Ireland has not been ruled by Westminster for more than a decade, but the collapse of power-sharing and the Brexit crisis has heightened the threat of direct rule. A no-deal Brexit makes it more likely as key decisions would have to be taken over mitigating the consequences, especially if new laws were needed.

      "body": "<p>Minsmere and I go back a long way. I can still remember the thrill of my first visit, in 1973, when I was just 13 years old. Later, I made my very first wildlife programme there, with Bill Oddie. And most recently, I presented live programmes from the reserve on the BBC\u2019s red button for <em>Springwatch</em>.</p> <p>So naturally I am worried that this unique place could be ruined by the proposed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/17/edf-build-second-nuclear-plant-sizemore-cheaper-hinkley-point\" title=\"\">building of Sizewell C nuclear power station</a>, a few hundred metres down the coast. And I\u2019m not the only one. My colleague Chris Packham, who like me first went there as a teenager, has called on EDF Energy to ensure that it safeguards Minsmere and its wildlife, now and in the future.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/our-work/our-positions-and-casework/casework/cases/sizewell-c/\" title=\"\">More than 20,000 people </a>have already written to EDF to raise their concerns, and the RSPB \u2013 which is firmly against the plans \u2013 is holding a Love Minsmere festival at the reserve on 15 September.</p> <p>There are more than 200 RSPB reserves in the UK \u2013 so what makes Minsmere special? The main reason is the incredible range of species found in such a small area \u2013 just 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres).</p> <p>The reserve\u2019s bird list currently stands at nearly 350 species, of which more than 100 have bred; while more than 1,000 types of butterfly and moth have been recorded, including the eponymous <a href=\"https://community.rspb.org.uk/placestovisit/minsmere/b/minsmere-blog/posts/more-minsmere-moths\" title=\"\">Minsmere crimson underwing</a>, recorded just once in the UK, here at Minsmere.</p> <p>This is all thanks to a complex mosaic of habitats, including woodland, scrub, meadow, heath, freshwater wetland and coastal marsh.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e66e8d725447d6a8b5151479c301097a5a214efb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e66e8d725447d6a8b5151479c301097a5a214efb/0_180_4743_2846/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A wading avocet at Minsmere.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A wading avocet at Minsmere.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Elsby/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the name Minsmere might have remained obscure were it not for a quirk of military history. During the second world war, there were very real fears of a Nazi invasion across the North Sea. To create a barrier against a seaborne attack, farmland along the Suffolk coast was deliberately flooded and this accidentally created an ideal home for wetland birds.</p> <p>Two years after the end of the conflict, <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/natures-home-magazine/birds-and-wildlife-articles/features/avocets-reach-record-numbers/\" title=\"\">in 1947, avocets returned to breed in the UK</a> after an absence of more than a century. They did so at Minsmere, and this led the RSPB to lease (and eventually buy) the land from local owners and turn it into a nature reserve.</p> <p>As a teenager, I remember hearing about this famous place, with its impossibly exotic birds, including avocets, bitterns and marsh harriers. I nagged my mother to take me there until finally she gave in. So, in April 1973, we drove up the A12 from our suburban London home to Suffolk, intending to spend as much time as possible at Minsmere. That was not as easy as it sounds: in those days, the reserve was open only four days a week, and you had to apply in advance, by post, for one of a limited number of permits.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I hope and pray that, whatever happens with the nuclear power station next door, this unique place continues to thrive</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On the day of our first visit, I could hardly contain my excitement. I can still remember seeing my very first avocet: that striking piebald plumage, distinctive upturned bill, and best of all, the bright blue legs. But I was even more thrilled when I saw the celebrated warden of Minsmere \u2013 Bert Axell \u2013 walking along with a group of people. We followed them discreetly into a hide, where we scanned the horizon for marsh harriers.</p> <p>At the time, Minsmere was home to the only breeding trio of this <a href=\"http://raptormonitoring.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Raptors-2014-Marsh-Harrier.pdf\" title=\"\">polygynous (one male mating with several females) raptor</a> in Britain, but sightings were few and far between. My mother didn\u2019t have a great interest in birdwatching and never used binoculars, so when a large brown bird flew up to the hide, unseen by the rest of us, she casually drew our attention to its presence.</p> <p>\u201cMy goodness, a marsh harrier,\u201d boomed Bert. \u201cWell done, madam!\u201d</p> <p>Axell was not the first warden of Minsmere, but he was largely responsible for turning it into what it is today. He was both a visionary and a zealot, who kept up a running battle with his superiors at RSPB HQ in Sandy, Bedfordshire. In his view, they were deskbound bureaucrats, intent on stifling his ideas for improving the reserve for birds.</p> <p>True to character, Axell simply ignored them, and pressed ahead with what at the time seemed a harebrained plan. He decided to create an artificial wetland, known as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/naturescalendar/spring/wetlands/minsmere/minsmere.shtml\" title=\"\">the Scrape</a>, with individually numbered islands on which avocets and other waterbirds could nest, and shallow areas of brackish water where they could feed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f0da46461a5b7b3d618bf9f72a76aaad386eb463\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0da46461a5b7b3d618bf9f72a76aaad386eb463/0_223_4137_2483/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A female marsh harrier hovering over prey on a Suffolk reedbed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A female marsh harrier hovering over prey on a Suffolk reedbed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jerome Murray/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not only did the Scrape become one of the best-known birding hotspots in the UK, but Axell later took his idea all around the world, creating wetland reserves on the same model.</p> <p>More than 20 years after my first visit, Oddie and I met to discuss the location for the opening episode of our TV series <em>Birding with Bill Oddie</em>.

      "bodyText": "Minsmere and I go back a long way. I can still remember the thrill of my first visit, in 1973, when I was just 13 years old. Later, I made my very first wildlife programme there, with Bill Oddie. And most recently, I presented live programmes from the reserve on the BBC\u2019s red button for Springwatch. So naturally I am worried that this unique place could be ruined by the proposed building of Sizewell C nuclear power station, a few hundred metres down the coast. And I\u2019m not the only one. My colleague Chris Packham, who like me first went there as a teenager, has called on EDF Energy to ensure that it safeguards Minsmere and its wildlife, now and in the future. More than 20,000 people have already written to EDF to raise their concerns, and the RSPB \u2013 which is firmly against the plans \u2013 is holding a Love Minsmere festival at the reserve on 15 September. There are more than 200 RSPB reserves in the UK \u2013 so what makes Minsmere special? The main reason is the incredible range of species found in such a small area \u2013 just 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres). The reserve\u2019s bird list currently stands at nearly 350 species, of which more than 100 have bred; while more than 1,000 types of butterfly and moth have been recorded, including the eponymous Minsmere crimson underwing, recorded just once in the UK, here at Minsmere. This is all thanks to a complex mosaic of habitats, including woodland, scrub, meadow, heath, freshwater wetland and coastal marsh. Yet the name Minsmere might have remained obscure were it not for a quirk of military history. During the second world war, there were very real fears of a Nazi invasion across the North Sea. To create a barrier against a seaborne attack, farmland along the Suffolk coast was deliberately flooded and this accidentally created an ideal home for wetland birds. Two years after the end of the conflict, in 1947, avocets returned to breed in the UK after an absence of more than a century. They did so at Minsmere, and this led the RSPB to lease (and eventually buy) the land from local owners and turn it into a nature reserve. As a teenager, I remember hearing about this famous place, with its impossibly exotic birds, including avocets, bitterns and marsh harriers. I nagged my mother to take me there until finally she gave in. So, in April 1973, we drove up the A12 from our suburban London home to Suffolk, intending to spend as much time as possible at Minsmere. That was not as easy as it sounds: in those days, the reserve was open only four days a week, and you had to apply in advance, by post, for one of a limited number of permits. On the day of our first visit, I could hardly contain my excitement. I can still remember seeing my very first avocet: that striking piebald plumage, distinctive upturned bill, and best of all, the bright blue legs. But I was even more thrilled when I saw the celebrated warden of Minsmere \u2013 Bert Axell \u2013 walking along with a group of people. We followed them discreetly into a hide, where we scanned the horizon for marsh harriers. At the time, Minsmere was home to the only breeding trio of this polygynous (one male mating with several females) raptor in Britain, but sightings were few and far between. My mother didn\u2019t have a great interest in birdwatching and never used binoculars, so when a large brown bird flew up to the hide, unseen by the rest of us, she casually drew our attention to its presence. \u201cMy goodness, a marsh harrier,\u201d boomed Bert. \u201cWell done, madam!\u201d Axell was not the first warden of Minsmere, but he was largely responsible for turning it into what it is today. He was both a visionary and a zealot, who kept up a running battle with his superiors at RSPB HQ in Sandy, Bedfordshire. In his view, they were deskbound bureaucrats, intent on stifling his ideas for improving the reserve for birds. True to character, Axell simply ignored them, and pressed ahead with what at the time seemed a harebrained plan. He decided to create an artificial wetland, known as the Scrape, with individually numbered islands on which avocets and other waterbirds could nest, and shallow areas of brackish water where they could feed. Not only did the Scrape become one of the best-known birding hotspots in the UK, but Axell later took his idea all around the world, creating wetland reserves on the same model. More than 20 years after my first visit, Oddie and I met to discuss the location for the opening episode of our TV series Birding with Bill Oddie. He suggested the idea of spending a single day, in early May, exploring one very special place for birds. I asked him where he would suggest and, in perfect unison, we both uttered a single word: \u201cMinsmere!\u201d We began filming before sunrise, listening to a spectacular dawn chorus in the woods. Afterwards, while we were enjoying breakfast in the recently built visitor centre and cafe, Oddie suddenly dropped his knife and fork, grabbed his binoculars, and ran outside. The camera crew and I emerged moments later, to find him happily watching sand martins, just back from Africa, swooping in and out of their nest-holes in a sandbank. After that excellent beginning, we enjoyed an action-packed day. Oddie showed us how to tell reed and sedge warblers apart by their song; we came across three baby tawny owls, looking like huge balls of fluff as they sat on a branch in broad daylight; and, as dusk fell, we enjoyed the special sight of cranes flying in to roost. It all made for a delightful programme, which helped launch our careers in wildlife television. That was almost a quarter of a century ago.

It was once possible to see or hear 100 different species before breakfast, but with the loss of birds such as the lesser spotted woodpecker, tree sparrow and corn bunting, that sadly no longer happens. On the credit side, new species have colonised the reserve, including the Cetti\u2019s warbler and Mediterranean gull. And rarities such as Britain\u2019s first western swamphen (which looks like a giant purple moorhen), and an all-too-brief visit in 2015 from a black-browed albatross, have attracted hordes of twitchers. The sheer variety of birds in such a small area made Minsmere the ideal destination for Springwatch, which was based on the reserve for three years, from 2014 to 2016. In what would be my final job in wildlife television, I spent a fortnight broadcasting live on the red button. The assignment brought back many happy memories of Minsmere and its birds. Among many memorable moments, highlights included Arctic waders dropping in on the Scrape on their long journey south to Africa; a determined stoat climbing several metres up a tree to slaughter a brood of green woodpeckers; and, best of all, a sparrowhawk chick hatching out of its egg, right in front of our eyes.

      "bodyText": "Michael Cheika was asked at half-time what he thought of the performance, and he cut a pretty contented figure. On the basis of the first 40 minutes, you\u2019d say he had every right to. A less than glowing second forty from Australia perhaps - a lot of replacements, a lot of tired bodies with a very heavy workload going into this game, but they did enough in the end, and the late lift to score the closing try would have pleased the Australian camp. Most importantly, they\u2019ve come through unscathed, the players from a tough, bruising encounter. It sets Australia up nicely for the World Cup. Plenty of landmarks for individual players - legends of the game like Sekope Kepu and Tatafu Polota-Nau saying goodbye to the gold jersey. Samoa for their part were hugely impressive in patches, but will need to address their lineout ahead of the World Cup. But it\u2019s all eyes to the future, now: Bring. On. Japan. So - much in the entrails of that one to examine? Full credit to Manu Samoa who really gave as good as they got in that second half. The expectation was that the Pasifika nation might fade around the 60-70 minute mark given the relative lack of international rugby they\u2019ve played (comparative to Australia) but if anything they lifted - and but for a disappointing lineout could have really made the last 20 minutes very interesting. It\u2019s a slightly flat David Pocock who speaks on behalf of the Wallabies post-game. Is he just shattered or does he not rate Rod Kafer? Terse, one-line answers from the stand-in captain. Will Genia is more effusive: \u201cBody\u2019s a bit sore - some tough hits out there.\u201d \u201cReally excited for the World Cup. The first game is important for how we want to set the tone - it\u2019s going to be similar to this game, physical and plenty of flair\u201d. And that\u2019s all she wrote! It\u2019s a scoreline that flatters the Wallabies in fairness, as they fight back to level the second half 12-12 after an impressive first half. They head off to Japan with no key injuries (Adam Coleman\u2019s finger the only \u201cwatch\u201d). Not so Samoa who will rue that potentially serious injury to halfback Scott Malolua. 80 min: Australia run it wide as the hooter sounds. Phipps puts Banks through a hole before quick ball again creates the chance. It\u2019s another with Samoan heritage that rubs salt in the wounds right at the death. Foley takes his time once again with the kick, but shanks it to finish with 2/6. 78 min: Smiles on the bench for Genia and Pocock. They\u2019ve come through big shifts tonight and many in gold will be relieved just to have come through this tough physical examination unscathed with the Japan World Cup just around the corner. 77 min: Big hit from Tupou! He\u2019s come in for plenty and you just sensed he was ready to hand some back out, and he earns the turnover for Australia, inside their own 10m. Terrific hands from James O\u2019Connor to send Banks away, before Phipps is clattered in the tackle and it\u2019s ball to ground. We\u2019ve another break as a Samoan front-rower receives some medical attention. 75 min: They\u2019re back under the sticks - but once again, there\u2019s a forward pass and no try! We come back for a late tackle on Pisi. They kick for touch and go again, Samoa. 74 min: They hold their own lineout - gee it\u2019s come under pressure tonight - but it\u2019s forced backwards and Samoa have to work hard to try and get some forward momentum. 72 min: A debut for Rob Valetini, the rising 21-year-old talent, as Australia empty their bench completely. Another injury break but the Samoan replacement forward seems okay. 70 min: They\u2019re desperate for some points, Australia - they haven\u2019t got any since the major break, and eventually, it\u2019s Haylett-Petty who crashes over. Too strong one-on-one. Some patient phases with quick ball - a nice little burst from Polota-Nau and they rode the momentum home. Foley slots the conversion. He took his time, and that one looked a lot better. 68 min: Haylett-Petty with a good break, but Blue bodies prevent the ball inside to a support runner. There\u2019s a knock on, as Will Genia also leaves the pitch for the last time on Australian soil and it\u2019s Nick Phipps he enters the fray. 66 min: Samoa on the attack - their tails are up - but would you believe it: Simmons has spoiled the lineout! They\u2019re literally throwing this one away, Samoa. We spoke about the memorable 2011 upset, but if they could land their set-pieces tonight, they\u2019d be right in with a sniff of another memorable performance. 64 min: So. Time for the older heads to calm some frustrations in Australia. The veteran Polota-Nau enters the fray in his final Test match - can he help calm the front row? Since the man they call \u201cTongan Thor\u201d entered the play for Australia he\u2019s copped some absolute attention (unsurprisingly given the rivalry between those two Pasifika nations). They need to refocus, the men in gold &amp; green. 62 min: HELLO. It\u2019s a flowing backline move - some suspicion of an obstruction to take Dempsey out of the line - but they work it through the hands and it\u2019s the replacement halfback, Polataivao, who ends up with it under the sticks! It was a huge misfortune that saw him enter the contest, but hasn\u2019t he made the most of his opportunity with a brace. The kick is successful - and suddenly, we\u2019re game on again! 60 min: Penalty against Simmons for not rolling away and Samoa look to build some momentum. Yikes. They\u2019ve pinched FIVE of Samoa\u2019s thirteen lineouts, Australia. If they could iron that out, Manu Samoa, they\u2019d really be starting to put themselves back in this game. 58 min: Luke Jones this time with the lineout steal! They pinched another one, Australia. But they don\u2019t capitalise as a loose carry - Genia tries the clever inside ball, but this time Jones isn\u2019t on the same wavelength and it\u2019s ball to ground. Shame, a try begging for the fringe Wallaby. 57 min: Genia with a terrific one-minute cameo. It\u2019s a clever dart and flicked inside ball, before on his next collect he drops it on the toe and rolls a smart kick for the corner. Can Australia pressure the Samoan lineout again? 56 min: Adam Coleman leaves the field with a suspected hand/thumb injury. Let\u2019s hope that doesn\u2019t have World Cup ramifications. He was collected in a huge tackle - it was halfback on second-rower, but the hunger more than made up for the size mismatch! Gregan-esque hit. 54 min: And Australia look to shuffle their front row and inject some fresh bodies. Let\u2019s see if that will arrest the scrum superiority that Samoa have suddenly found. Australia stung into action and back on the attack, but they\u2019ve earned the penalty, Samoa as the Wallaby runner gets isolated and doesn\u2019t release. And finally! It\u2019s a strong Samoan scrum, and they\u2019ve got the forward momentum once again. Amosa peels off the back and it\u2019s the replacement half who picks up the easiest of scampers to the line. Just desserts - especially for their scrum dominance over the last five-ten minutes. Unsuccessful with the conversion attempt. It was a tricky one. 51 min: A great push from the Samoan pack and they win another penalty. But once again they can\u2019t win their own attacking line out! It\u2019s been one area that would frustrate the Manu Samoan coaching staff - on two or three occasions they\u2019ve done the hard work to create chances, but they\u2019ve failed to close them out. 49 min: A well-worked lineout from Manu Samoa but they turnover possession. Australia from just inside their half, but it\u2019s a loose carry in return from the men in gold, Kepu at fault. It\u2019s been, as you\u2019d expect pretty physical out there, so a few tired bodies. Kepu leaves the pitch - not the immediate sendoff he\u2019d have wanted on his final game on Australian soil, but he receives a tremendous send off, and applauds the crowd in turn. 47 min: Huge defence! It was Koroibete again proving the danger man as Australia looked to burst through. They swing wide and it\u2019s Toomua who\u2019s bundled into touch. Two Wallabies appeared to get in each others\u2019 way and the Samoan defence was unforgiving. Great work. 45 min: They pinch the throw! Coleman with a great leap, but Uelese puts it down. Chance bombed - that\u2019s all come from that impressive Haylett-Petty clearance kick. Samoa go to the bench, and the men in Blue take the breather before setting down for a scrum feed. And they\u2019ve earned a scrum penalty. 44 min: It\u2019s a deep passing line they\u2019re working with tonight, Samoa, and they\u2019re ceding a lot of territory ball-in-hand. Australia looking well-organised in defence - there haven\u2019t been a lot of line breaches tonight. Dane Haylett-Petty with a brilliant kick from inside his half, and he rolls a ball a few metres inside the far post. Lovely stuff. 42 min: Tom Banks flies bravely into a wall of bodies in Blue from a bombed kick, but he doesn\u2019t hang onto it. Samoa now with the field position, but Australia look to boom clear from their own line. Samoa on the attack from just inside their half. Second half! And we\u2019re back underway, with Australia kicking off. They go short but Samoa are alive to the danger and eventually boom a clearing kick before Australia look to attack ball-in-hand from around halfway. So - your impressions on that opening stanza? More impressive than England v Italy, but not quite New Zealand v Tonga, from the Wallabies? They\u2019ve not been poor, Samoa, and went close to getting a try of their own, only for Michael Alaalatoa\u2019s effort to be denied by an illegal clearout in the lead up. There could be a case to argue that they\u2019re a little unlucky to go in by this margin - but it\u2019s definitely been a disciplined, solid performance from Australia. Disagree with any of that? Drop us an email or tweet to join the conversation. Let us know too who\u2019s impressed you, and who\u2019s stated a case to be considered a starter against Fiji in a fortnight\u2019s time. 40 min: Nanai-Williams with a terrific try-saving tackle on Haylett-Petty. Wonderful desperation from the fullback and he prevents further damage on the scoreboard. And there, finally, is the whistle for half-time. It\u2019s a comfortable lead for the home side, who have in large measure been good value for their lead. 40 min: Samoa look to burst away! But there\u2019s an infringement in the scrum in the lead up. We reset again. The fans are getting their full money\u2019s worth of this opening \u201cforty\u201d minutes. What can Australia make from this set piece? 40 min: So we\u2019re back with a scrum feed after that lengthy injury break, and the Samoan No 9 leaves the field on a motorised stretcher. Devastating. 40 min: An injury concern for the Samoan half-back. Ouch. That\u2019s not pretty - it could be a dislocated shoulder; not the debut he\u2019d have dreamed of, Scott Malolua. Let\u2019s hope this doesn\u2019t put his World Cup hopes in jeopardy. A big blow for Manu Samoa, just seconds from the break. 40 min: There\u2019s a weight of bodies near the line - has Australia got over? We got upstairs to double check, but it\u2019s an on-field decision of \u201cno try\u201d from the referees. It\u2019s Adam Coleman looking to force over for a brace just before the break. Vision is inconclusive - so we come back for a penalty for Australia. 39 min: Clever work from Genia, but Nanai-Williams anticipates the grubber kick to the corner and sweeps across to collect ahead of the on-rushing Koroibete. He has to go into touch though and Australia set up for an attacking lineout 1m out. 37 min: There are a few Australians of Samoan heritage out there and Salakaia-Loto is just one of them. You wonder if that adds a bit of salt in the wounds when a player like that scores against the country of his parents. He was born in New Zealand and raised from an early age in Australia though, the flanker. 35 min: It\u2019s quick hands from the green &amp; gold - Pocock takes a big hit but moves the ball quickly and they swing from side to side, and the men in blue don\u2019t have the numbers to stretch both ways. The big back rower shows huge strength out wide, and he bursts over! And finally Foley hits one sweetly - possibly the hardest one of the night and he\u2019s put it right over the black dot. Good to see. 33 min: Some good backline work from Australia who are back on the attack. Good hands from Koroibete who claims a wild pass, but it\u2019s some resolute defence from Samoa, and they eventually earn the turn over. 30 min: Eep. That didn\u2019t last! They\u2019ve fumbled the restart, Samoa, and Australia have spread it wide quickly. Toomua puts it on the toe and it\u2019s the veteran who\u2019s helped himself to Australia\u2019s third try of the night. It was a favourable bounce, and he says, yes please. Ach. 0/3 from Foley. That\u2019s hooked away as well. You don\u2019t want to ride a bloke, but if this is an audition tonight, he\u2019s hitting the wrong notes - at least from the boot. 29 min: They settle for the consolation of coming back for an advantage penalty though, and finally they\u2019re on the board, Samoa. 27 min: Nanai-Williams joins the line and almost creates the overlap, but Australia\u2019s defensive line holds strong. It\u2019s Michael Alaalatoa - the brother of Wallabies front rower Allan - who dives under the posts to the delight of some in the crowd - but it\u2019s pulled back! No try - David Pocock was taken out illegally in the lead up. What a disappointment for Manu Samoa. 25 min: Hello! Great strength from Afaesetiti Amosa who bursts out from the back of the scrum. He\u2019s pulled down after a good 15-20m burst. And there\u2019s a bit of niggle creeping into this one. Genia and Ed Fidow with a bit of push and shove, and it\u2019s a penalty against Australia, and Samoa set up 22m out. What can they fashion? 23 min: Australia look to burst down the flanks, and again it\u2019s Koroibete who poses the danger. He runs out of real estate and flings a ball back inside, but it\u2019s knocked on by Genia. Chance missed! 20 min: Adam Coleman handing out a bit of big-hit medicine of his own! You know what\u2019s coming, especially in the first 20 minuted, against Pasifika rugby teams, and the big Tasmanian doesn\u2019t fancy taking a backward step. Good to see a bit of heat out there. 18 min: Samoa with a chance to get on the board, but the penalty attempt is missed! They can\u2019t afford to give up chances like that, the visitors. 15 min: Almost a two-on-one out wide for a moment, but the Wallabies wide defenders do well to snuff out the move. Foley and Genia both looking to move with ball in hand, and it\u2019s the earlier who starts a fine move. But it\u2019s virtuoso stuff from the former Melbourne Storm winger! Koroibete jinks one, steps inside another, evades a big tackle and skips inside. Champagne stuff from the winger, great try! Ach. It\u2019s a tougher chance from the boot, and he\u2019s struck the post! Won\u2019t do much for his confidence, Foley, but he\u2019ll have more chances you\u2019d imagine at this rate. 13 min: Ooph. Big hit on Genia! He\u2019s picked up and dumped unceremoniously like a sack of spuds. But they\u2019ve defended their line, Samoa, and they win the scrum feed after Koroibete is held up and Australia infringe. 12 min: That\u2019s a better lineout, and the men in blue charge forward - but it\u2019s a steal from Jack Dempsey! They kick quickly upfield, and who else - it\u2019s Pocock - who bundles the Samoan winger into touch to win the offensive lineout! Good opportunity here again for Australia. 10 min: Australia are playing with intent here - they seem to suspect that another quick try here could really sap the visitors\u2019 morale. Kepu is pinged for offside though and it\u2019s a breather for Samoa who take the chance to settle their early nerves. 8 min: Samoa with the defensive lineout, but they\u2019ve missed their jumpers! It\u2019s gratefully accepted by Pocock, before Genia swings wide and it\u2019s the big second rower lurking out wide for a gimme. He slides over near the corner flag - first blood! Not a great start with the boot from Foley - he looks to catch the tee with his conversion attempt, and it fades left. 7 min: Toomua with a wild cutout pass, but it sails past Dane Haylett-Petty and into touch! Was their a try there if the winger had been hugging the line? Chance squandered. 5 min: They\u2019re absolutely flying out of the line, the Samoan defenders, and they\u2019ve forced the Wallabies back 20m or so. That\u2019s flatter from Toomua out of the halves and Australia start to gain some metres after 10 phases. 4 min: Australia with a strong scrum, but the Samoan backs rush up and pin back the Wallabies outside backs. Advantage is played from the scrum, and Australia kick to touch, and win their line out 10m inside Samoa\u2019s half. 3 min: Ach. They win the scrum, Samoa, but its a wobbly old pass out and the first handle goes to ground! Big early chance bombed by the visitors. 1 min: And it\u2019s Manu Samoa who get us underway! Australia receive and look to bring out from around their 22m before Foley looks to bomb towards the sideline. It\u2019s put down and we pack down for a Samoan scrum. And Matt Toomua (of Samoan heritage) hands over an Indigenous Wallabies jersey to Manu captain, Jack Lam - as the men in blue line up to issue the Sipi Tau (the Samoan haka-equivalent). Spine-tingling. A sombre prelude with a moment\u2019s silence for Wallabies that have passed away over the past 12 months. Quite a few names, including the unforgettable Lloyd McDermott. A welcome to country from Sydney\u2019s west and then anthems. One of the more stirring numbers, the Manu Samoa track. An anthem banger, you could say. How could you not get up for that? And it\u2019s sung with great gusto as you\u2019d expect from fans and players. And there\u2019s Australia. Belted out by Will Genia - who like Pocock is playing in his last Test on home soil. As you can see, still a host of talent and experience on show for the Wallabies. A fair few in Manu Samoa blue in the crowd - expect them to be vocal in their support as former Australian schoolboy Jack Lam leads out Samoa - before a huge roar as David Pocock leads out the men in green &amp; gold. We line up for anthems, kick off not too far away. But without ado, to teams: Australia: 15 Tom Banks, 14 Dane Haylett-Petty, 13 Adam Ashley-Cooper, 12 Matt To\u2019omua, 11 Marika Koroibete, 10 Bernard Foley, 9 Will Genia, 8 Jack Dempsey, 7 David Pocock (captain), 6 Lukhan Salakaia-Loto, 5 Adam Coleman, 4 Rob Simmons, 3 Sekope Kepu, 2 Jordan Uelese, 1 James Slipper. Bench: 16 Tatafu Polota-Nau, 17 Scott Sio, 18 Taniela Tupou, 19 Luke Jones, 20 Liam Wright, 21 Rob Valetini, 22 Nick Phipps, 23 James O\u2019Connor Manu Samoa: 15 Tim Nanai-Williams, 14 Belgium Tuatagaloa, 13 Alapati Leiua, 12 Reynold Lee-Lo, 11 Ed Fidow, 10 Tusi Pisi, 9 Scott Malolua, 8 Afaesetiti Amosa, 7 Jack Lam (captain), 6 Thomas Ioane, 5 Kane Leaupepe, 4 Teofilo Paulo, 3 Michael Alaalatoa, 2 Ray Niuia, 1 Jordan Lay. Bench: 16 Motu Matu\u2019u, 17 Paul Alo-Emile, 18 Logovi\u2019i Mulipola, 19 Josh Tyrell, 20 Seilala Lam, 21 Dwayne Polataivao, 22 AJ Alatimu, 23 Ah See Tuala. Some big news ahead of the night - long-term Wallabies talisman David Pocock has announced his retirement: The 77-cap flanker dropped the news in a low-key manner during the build up to this clash, and fittingly Michael Cheika has handed Pocock the captain\u2019s armband in his final game on Australian soil. They\u2019ll want to send him out a winner, the Wallabies. What a player he\u2019s been for Australia over the years. Hi all! Felicitations to thee and thine, from wherever you\u2019re following our coverage today. There\u2019s been a stack of rugby union over the weekend with plenty of nations opting for one last tune up before Japan. One side in pretty ominous form was New Zealand (shock surprise), while England took a while to get going against Italy. While we wait for this one to get underway, here\u2019s a more detailed look at how two of the key World Cup contenders have fared: And here\u2019s Robert Kitson\u2019s report: Fourteen more sleeps. They sneak up quickly don\u2019t they, World Cups? That\u2019s the wait until Australia opens its Pool D campaign against island nation Fiji, so perhaps a final warm up Test against the hard-hitting Manu Samoa is a pretty useful fixture. It\u2019s the stunning new Bankwest Stadium in Parramatta that plays host, giving NSW-based home fans a chance to farewell their chargers before they head to Japan. The 2011 shock defeat to Samoa looms over this fixture, but in reality lightning in unlikely to strike twice. The visitors had an indifferent qualifying campaign, but are coming off a win over Tonga as they prepare for their own World Cup campaign. It\u2019s a second-string Wallabies team, but there will still be plenty to play for as outside options press their claims, and some, like Bernard Foley earn a chance to catch Michael Cheika\u2019s eye after becoming a forgotten man in recent time.",

As performance, and as momentous occasion, it exceeded expectation. That long-ago debut Prom \u2013 in the midst of the swinging 60s \u2013 triggered a new interest in the Austrian composer, always central to Haitink\u2019s musical preoccupations. He calls Bruckner\u2019s music \u201ca mountain\u2026 a steady ascent\u201d. Now 90, Haitink has climbed this particular peak all his professional life. The prospect of never again having this quiet, modest Dutchman on the podium leaves us bereft.</p> <p>His manner may be restrained \u2013 incisive baton beat with his right hand, small indications of expression with his left \u2013 but his music-making has rare freedom, transparency and amplitude. Minimal signals achieve maximum effect. He demonstrated that at the start on Tuesday, by making a simple, dampening gesture to the excited audience, cheering wildly before a note had been played. The silence was instant. For so many present, this musician\u2019s performances will have been at the heart of their listening lives: aside from the huge catalogue of recordings, as chief conductor of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, Amsterdam; music director of Glyndebourne, and the Royal Opera House; principal conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Staatskapelle Dresden. He conducted one of the first Proms I attended while still at school. A pivotal event, it changed my comprehension of music for ever.</p> <p>This UK farewell concert, which Haitink had already conducted in Salzburg, and was due to repeat, finally, in Lucerne on Friday, was with the <strong>Vienna Philharmonic</strong>, an ensemble he knows well, and of which he is an honorary member. It opened with Beethoven\u2019s Fourth Piano Concerto with <a href=\"https://emanuelax.com/\" title=\"\">E</a><a href=\"https://emanuelax.com/\" title=\"\">manuel Ax</a> as soloist. Supple and subtle, Ax\u2019s playing in some ways mirrors the Viennese sound, effort scarcely visible, drama imaginatively blended and shaped, never exaggerated. The first-movement cadenza, almost a sonata in itself, captured a sense of improvisation, with the VPO accompanying like chamber musicians.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"72cd843e7159123483401942637fc3c332038c78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72cd843e7159123483401942637fc3c332038c78/0_0_1920_1280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emanuel Ax performs Beethoven\u2019s Piano Concerto No 4 with the Vienna Philharmonic conducted by Bernard Haitink at Prom 60\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emanuel Ax performs Beethoven\u2019s Piano Concerto No 4 with the Vienna Philharmonic conducted by Bernard Haitink at Prom 60.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Christodoulou</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the Vienna Philharmonic, above all other orchestras, tradition and collective memory are of the essence.

Certain moments stood out: the oboe and clarinet theme early on, the optional cymbals and triangle at the climax of the Adagio, purposeful rather than hysterical; the primal energy of the Scherzo and that abrupt, perfectly placed conclusion to the finale. Yet Haitink\u2019s singular gift is to balance detail, contour, entity. He has always said he prefers to use a score, since anyone is capable of mistakes.

Behind its beautiful brick walls, its creators would like you to immerse yourself in the sound of insects, to wander along paths as perennials tower above you, and glimpse, over hedges, other corners that burnish with late-summer colours, or tumble with vegetables. Then there\u2019s a slice of cake and a cup of tea at a table tucked among the flowers.</p> <p>Laura and Jack Willgoss represent a new breed of growers who are turning their nurseries into destinations, with plot-to\u2011plate cafes, courses and workshops, inspirational test gardens and a selection of plants to go home with. Twenty minutes outside Ludlow, the nursery is hidden within a beautiful walled garden on the <a href=\"https://www.historichouses.org/houses/house-listing/millichope-park.html\" title=\"\">Millichope Park</a> estate. When the couple first arrived, the walled garden hadn\u2019t been in productive use since the 1960s. It was home to the huge <a href=\"http://www.wildegoosenursery.co.uk/violas/\" title=\"\">Bouts viola</a> collection \u2013 hardy and scented violas, many varieties spanning back to Victorian times \u2013 which they inherited when they bought the nursery. A 19th-century, curvilinear glasshouse was just a metal framework with trees growing through it; and as for the rest of the garden, there was none of the original layout left, just two acres of wilderness. Laura and Jack, who met as horticultural students at <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/gardens/wisley\" title=\"\">RHS Wisley</a>, had long held a dream of restoring a walled garden, and here it was: a blank canvas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c124d61c40622c050d1afb65e1b3e5fcae73350\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c124d61c40622c050d1afb65e1b3e5fcae73350/0_2012_4016_3557/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swiss chard \u2018Charlotte\u2019 with tagetes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"886\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swiss chard \u2018Charlotte\u2019 with tagetes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zara Napier/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The glasshouse has been restored to its full glory and now grows fruit and vegetables for the cafe \u2013 from tomatoes and chillies to cucumbers and other fruits \u2013 as well as acting as a workshop space for courses. But the pair decided against a traditional restoration for the rest of the garden. \u201cAt the beginning we could see all four corners and we knew we needed to break up the design,\u201d says Laura. The space is now a series of interlocking \u201crooms\u201d divided by hedges. \u201cThere are intentional glimpses here and there into the next area to entice you, while also truly surrounding you by plants.\u201d The result is a garden in which you feel utterly immersed, protected by high walls but with tantalising glimpses of the Shropshire countryside beyond.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dcdc99d31181f372365e740daee45aed10f9dab3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dcdc99d31181f372365e740daee45aed10f9dab3/0_547_4016_4463/900.jpg\" alt=\"Wildegoose\u2019s owners Laura and Jack Willgoss.\" width=\"900\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wildegoose\u2019s owners Laura and Jack Willgoss.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zara Napier/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a wild floral meadow, a jungle of tall perennials \u2013 including the North American sunflower relative, <em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/17358/i-Silphium-perfoliatum-i/Details\" title=\"\">Silphium perfoliat</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/17358/i-Silphium-perfoliatum-i/Details\" title=\"\">um</a></em> \u2013 and narrow winding paths that weave you down into the hot garden, full of fantastic scarlets, tawny oranges and searing yellows. \u201cIt\u2019s wild, full of all those hot late-summer colours we love so much,\u201d says Laura.</p> <p>From here you enter into the central circle, which \u2013 instead of a traditional walled-garden design, with a dipping pond at its centre \u2013 has a circular space enclosed by a hedge, with a giant metal sculpture of an eryngium surrounded by the acid yellow umbels of <em><a href=\"https://www.bethchatto.co.uk/plants-for-dry-conditions/bupleurum-falcatum.htm\" title=\"\">Bupleurum falcatum</a></em> and the purple spikes of <em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/317500/Verbena-officinalis-var-grandiflora-Bampton/Details\" title=\"\">Verbena officinalis</a></em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/317500/Verbena-officinalis-var-grandiflora-Bampton/Details\" title=\"\"> var. </a><em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/317500/Verbena-officinalis-var-grandiflora-Bampton/Details\" title=\"\">grandiflora</a></em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/317500/Verbena-officinalis-var-grandiflora-Bampton/Details\" title=\"\"> \u2018Bampton\u2019</a>.

      "bodyText": "Wildegoose Nursery would like you to get lost. Behind its beautiful brick walls, its creators would like you to immerse yourself in the sound of insects, to wander along paths as perennials tower above you, and glimpse, over hedges, other corners that burnish with late-summer colours, or tumble with vegetables. Then there\u2019s a slice of cake and a cup of tea at a table tucked among the flowers. Laura and Jack Willgoss represent a new breed of growers who are turning their nurseries into destinations, with plot-to\u2011plate cafes, courses and workshops, inspirational test gardens and a selection of plants to go home with. Twenty minutes outside Ludlow, the nursery is hidden within a beautiful walled garden on the Millichope Park estate. When the couple first arrived, the walled garden hadn\u2019t been in productive use since the 1960s. It was home to the huge Bouts viola collection \u2013 hardy and scented violas, many varieties spanning back to Victorian times \u2013 which they inherited when they bought the nursery. A 19th-century, curvilinear glasshouse was just a metal framework with trees growing through it; and as for the rest of the garden, there was none of the original layout left, just two acres of wilderness. Laura and Jack, who met as horticultural students at RHS Wisley, had long held a dream of restoring a walled garden, and here it was: a blank canvas. The glasshouse has been restored to its full glory and now grows fruit and vegetables for the cafe \u2013 from tomatoes and chillies to cucumbers and other fruits \u2013 as well as acting as a workshop space for courses. But the pair decided against a traditional restoration for the rest of the garden. \u201cAt the beginning we could see all four corners and we knew we needed to break up the design,\u201d says Laura. The space is now a series of interlocking \u201crooms\u201d divided by hedges. \u201cThere are intentional glimpses here and there into the next area to entice you, while also truly surrounding you by plants.\u201d The result is a garden in which you feel utterly immersed, protected by high walls but with tantalising glimpses of the Shropshire countryside beyond. There is a wild floral meadow, a jungle of tall perennials \u2013 including the North American sunflower relative, Silphium perfoliatum \u2013 and narrow winding paths that weave you down into the hot garden, full of fantastic scarlets, tawny oranges and searing yellows. \u201cIt\u2019s wild, full of all those hot late-summer colours we love so much,\u201d says Laura. From here you enter into the central circle, which \u2013 instead of a traditional walled-garden design, with a dipping pond at its centre \u2013 has a circular space enclosed by a hedge, with a giant metal sculpture of an eryngium surrounded by the acid yellow umbels of Bupleurum falcatum and the purple spikes of Verbena officinalis var. grandiflora \u2018Bampton\u2019. This leads up to a new double border that frames the greenhouse. \u201cWe wanted to create a border that reflects something of a meadow, in the way that certain grasses will dominate and then intermingle,\u201d she says. So there\u2019s a backbone of Stipa gigantea woven through with the slender, arched stems of Melica ciliata and Anemanthele lessoniana, growing between a succession of hardy perennials and annuals, biennials and tender perennials. Every year, the couple trial annual and other shorter-lived plants, to find the best. \u201cI think annual and tender perennials are wonderful, as they allow you to create a new garden every year, and that can be very freeing, particularly if you are working in a small garden,\u201d says Laura. This year their test beds are looking at Cosmos; next year it will be Nigella and Scabious. It\u2019s a wonderful mix of sculptural hedges and informal, naturalistic plantings, full of movement, energy and joy. \u201cIt\u2019s important to me that this space has enough for everyone,\u201d says Laura. \u201cIt\u2019s a haven for wildlife \u2013 there\u2019s the odd mole, and a resident rabbit. It\u2019s full of butterflies and bees. And it\u2019s wonderful when people have an emotional response to it \u2013 I like to think we\u2019ve created something spiritually fulfilling.\u201d Wildegoose\u2019s favourite late-summer colours Rudbeckia triloba \u2018Prairie Glow\u2019 A short-lived, bushy perennial, with cheery, daisy-like flowers with dusky orange petal tips and yellow and dark brown centres. Flowers its head off from summer into autumn. Chard \u2018Charlotte\u2019 A wonderful ornamental vegetable with fantastic bright red stems; it looks wonderful with Tagetes \u2018Burning Embers\u2019. Helichrysum bracteatum \u2018Scarlet\u2019 An annual everlasting flower in brilliant red that looks great with red orach (Atriplex hortensis var. rubra). Patrinia monandra Wonderful big, flat heads of acid-green flowers, it grows 120cm tall and then seeds about a lot. Looks wonderful contrasted with other late flowers such as helenium. Lythrum virgatum \u2018Dropmore Purple\u2019 The wand loosestrife is loved by insects. It is tall, never needs staking, and holds itself very elegantly, with such vibrant flowers. Molinia caerulea \u2018Fontane\u2019 A lovely statement grass that looks good dotted through monarda and persicaria, and turns the most wonderful buttery yellow in autumn. Origanum laevigatum \u2018Herrenhausen\u2019 The best of the ornamental marjorams, it looks wonderful at the front of the border, with its pink flowers. \u2022 Wildegoose Nursery is open 10am-4.30pm Friday, Saturday and Sunday to 13 October.",

      "body": "<p>In 1953, a young Ivanna Maszczak trudged through the Siberian labour camp in which she was serving a 10-year sentence. She was 28 years old, 5ft tall, and hungry. Her shoes were wet from the snow and the temperature had dropped below minus 50. Ivanna and some fellow female prisoners were being escorted by guards through the camp to begin their day of gruelling physical work: mining gold, felling trees and hacking into the frozen ground.</p> <p>As they stumbled through the snow, a scrunched-up piece of paper landed at their feet, thrown from a truck transporting male prisoners. One of them picked it up before a guard noticed, and later the women huddled together and opened it. It was from a male prisoner asking whether someone would write to him, to distract him from the relentless bleakness. Ivanna was deeply moved. Five years into her imprisonment, she, too, was desperate for human contact. She decided to reply to this stranger.</p> <p>Ivanna, now 93, tells her story in her one-bedroom ex-council flat in London. The flat is on the top floor and there is no lift, but, although Ivanna is very small and thin, she\u2019s strong enough to walk up and down three flights of concrete stairs several times a day. Born in Ukraine, she was taken from her family one frosty January morning in 1948 while her mother, a schoolteacher, made beetroot soup for lunch. She belonged to a Ukrainian youth organisation, and her brother was a member of the Ukrainian underground. \u201cAt that time every Ukrainian was under suspicion,\u201d Ivanna recalls. \u201cMy father was a priest, which didn\u2019t help, because the authorities were suspicious of priests, members of the intelligentsia, teachers and students.\u201d Even after Nazi Germany\u2019s surrender in May 1945, the civil war in Ukraine and eastern Poland continued, as underground organisations, including the Ukrainian Insurrectionary army, refused to live under communist rule. Ivanna was one of many thousands of ethnic Ukrainians sent to Siberia after being accused of aiding the rebellion.</p> <p>Military guards stormed the house and marched the 22-year-old out of her home and into a truck. \u201cMy mother\u2019s eyes were full of tears,\u201d she says, quietly, in her strong Ukrainian accent. \u201cI told her that I would be back one day. I still can\u2019t believe I ever came back alive.\u201d</p> <p>Ivanna was sentenced to 10 years in Stalin\u2019s labour camps. She was moved from one to another, before she and 700 other prisoners were put on a boat and taken to a gulag in Kolyma, a sub-arctic region in Siberia. \u201cAs we pulled into the wharf we could see snow, and guards in furs,\u201d Ivanna remembers. \u201cWe were in our tatty, thin clothes and, getting off the boat, we were so weak that some of us fell into the snow. We were forced to strip outside and given a typhoid injection \u2013 all with the same needle \u2013 and a lice check.\u201d Everyone got the same size clothes and shoes. \u201cImagine me in huge shoes when I have feet this small,\u201d says Ivanna. \u201cNumbers were sewn on to our backs \u2013 I was 108 \u2013 and we felt our identity was taken away from us.\u201d At night she slept on a wooden plank in barracks alongside hundreds of others.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Then the crumpled note landed at Ivanna\u2019s feet. His name was Vladimir; he was the same age as Ivanna and also serving 10 years. She asked around, found out which part of the gulag he was in and, with help from sympathetic construction workers who agreed to pass the notes on, managed to get a letter to him. She used the pen and paper the prisoners were sometimes given in order to write home. Their letters, which Ivanna has kept and shows me, stored in a wooden box, came back and forth, talking of life in the camp (\u201cThere is a roaring snowstorm outside even though it\u2019s spring\u201d), but also philosophy and the idea of freedom. \u201cWhat is happiness?\u201d writes Vladimir in one letter. In another: \u201cOne day the corrective labour system will be recognised as a huge political mistake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe wanted to find a kindred spirit and I became that person,\u201d Ivanna says now. Despite the fact that they were unable to meet, she began to feel a deep bond with this young man. \u201cAfter the cruelty I had seen, writing to him was some respite from the hell I was in. I was terribly lonely, so to have Vladimir wanting to know how I felt made things bearable.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1c0672ea20402e062861a5aa4239ae0604b68b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1c0672ea20402e062861a5aa4239ae0604b68b9/0_1176_6630_4752/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ivanna Maszczak, who wrote letters to a fellow prisoner in a Siberian gulag\" width=\"1000\" height=\"717\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ivanna Maszczak: \u2018He wanted to find a kindred spirit.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lydia Goldblatt/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The greatest physical suffering was the hunger, Ivanna says. \u201cWe had one piece of bread and a bowl of fish-bone soup a day. The bread was thin and heavy like clay, because it was full of water. Some prisoners ate it in one go; others \u2013 including me \u2013 divided it into three and carried the other two bits with them all day. We were hungry all the time.\u201d Often, Ivanna was only allowed to eat if she finished her tasks, such as felling trees and hacking into the permafrost. \u201cI rarely finished. I weighed 35kg [5st 5lb] when I was arrested, so I wasn\u2019t built for it, but most people just couldn\u2019t do it all. I wasn\u2019t very strong, but I was stubborn. I kept telling myself I had to survive.\u201d</p> <p>It was illegal for prisoners to correspond with each other, so they relied on the construction workers to deliver the letters. \u201cSometimes it took weeks for a letter to come, and some letters disappeared,\u201d Ivanna says. \u201cBut when our system worked, the notes were a salvation.\u201d Soon the tone changed. \u201cAt first it was friendship, but when you talk for so long, so intensely, you start to feel love,\u201d Ivanna says. \u201cIn one letter Vladimir writes, \u201cWaiting for your letters causes my heart to beat faster.\u201d In another, \u201cBelieve me that my love for you is so great that I will do anything for you.\u201d They made tentative plans to meet if they were ever freed.</p> <p>Ivanna was finally released in August 1955, after almost eight years of her sentence. Stalin\u2019s death in 1953 had somewhat thawed the regime; prisoners had begun to rebel and were gradually being let free. Ivanna\u2019s family had no idea she was coming home. \u201cI walked to the door and my mother turned and screamed my name. She started crying with joy, but I wasn\u2019t able to cry. I didn\u2019t know how to live as a free person. Everything seemed strange \u2013 buying milk, going to a hairdresser, eating an apple.\u201d Her freedom came too late for her to be reunited with her father; he had died just two months before her return home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4f5692791391ec1b56e52c6d370b652b6db97385\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f5692791391ec1b56e52c6d370b652b6db97385/330_53_436_576/378.jpg\" alt=\"Old photos of Ivanna, who wrote love letters in a Siberian gulag\" width=\"378\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Images of Ivanna: the pair exchanged photographs after their release.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lydia Goldblatt/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vladimir was still imprisoned, and when she first wrote to him from the outside world, he replied: \u201cIf I had had the opportunity, I would have left everything behind and followed you. Have you now found everything you dreamed of during these dreadful years? One day we will have the opportunity to meet each other \u2013 but it will not happen soon.\u201d</p> <p>When Vladimir was eventually released two years later, he wrote: \u201cDear Ivanna! Your prayers have reached the heavens and here I am, alive and healthy. Reunited with my parents. There were many events and stories to share but, most importantly, I am home.\u201d</p> <p>Soon afterwards, Vladimir wrote again to tell Ivanna he was getting married. Under pressure from his father, he would wed his former classmate, someone his family had expected him to be with all along. \u201cDespite the emotions we felt for each other, I was not surprised about the marriage,\u201d she says. \u201cThis was what his father had planned \u2013 he had even tried to stop us writing to each other at one point, believing I would scupper his plans. I felt that, despite his marriage, we had an unbreakable bond: the bond of two people who have been in prison together for so long. We were both trying to adjust to freedom and learn to be with our families again. I understood how things were, that he needed to move on.\u201d Yet the letters kept coming and Vladimir confided in her, telling her he found it difficult to adjust to normal life. \u201cOn the outside everything looks great: I have a wife, a house, a job, friends, but I cannot recover from the nightmares I\u2019ve endured. I watch my life like a film that I am not part of.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Those letters were a lifeline; they gave me some purpose. I\u00a0felt that things could be better again one day</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A few years later, Ivanna got married, too. While visiting a friend in Britain, she was introduced to a Ukrainian man named Wolodomyr who proposed to her just five days after they met. \u201cI never regretted it. We lived a simple life in London, and were happy together for 47 years,\u201d she says. Wolodomyr, who passed away in 2012, aged 94, understood why the correspondence with Vladimir was still so important to his wife. In May 1965, Vladimir wrote to her in wonderment that it had been \u201c10 years of knowing each other\u2026 of holding pieces of paper on which we shared our thoughts, hopes, doubts, expectations and love. I thank the heavens that you\u2019re in my life.\u201d The following Christmas they exchanged other family photos. Then one morning Ivanna received a curt letter from Vladimir\u2019s wife demanding that the correspondence cease immediately. Ivanna never heard from Vladimir again.</p> <p>As darkness falls, she pauses in her story to reach across to switch on a softly lit lamp above the small wooden table where we sit. \u201cIt hurt me greatly. I didn\u2019t write back to Vladimir. I didn\u2019t want to interfere in his family life. I know I was lucky to be released from Siberia early,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I lost out on a chance to meet him.\u201d</p> <p>Three years ago, contemplating her old age, Ivanna wondered whether this might be a good time to re-establish contact. She Googled Vladimir and found he had his own website. \u201cI recognised him immediately from the photos I\u2019d seen over the years. He now looked older and had grey hair but I knew it was him, and was excited.\u201d</p> <p>Yet after more research she discovered that it was too late, and he had recently died. \u201cI should have tried harder to find him, I regret that I didn\u2019t. But I worried that it would cause problems for him and his marriage if we ever actually met.\u201d</p> <p>***</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f8adf6d4414b3a3ede29633a4c7ae49b7ecb7b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f8adf6d4414b3a3ede29633a4c7ae49b7ecb7b0/0_13_1080_648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Old photos of Vladimir, who wrote love letters in a Siberian gulag\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photographs of Vladimir that Ivanna had seen over the years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lydia Goldblatt/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It has now been 64 years since Ivanna was released, but eight years in the gulag still has an impact on her daily life in ways that few outsiders would notice. She doesn\u2019t eat much \u2013 maybe a baked potato at lunch, but usually no dinner. It doesn\u2019t occur to her to want anything that she doesn\u2019t have. She has a small bedroom, but sleeps on a futon in the living room as she hates feeling confined. \u201cI don\u2019t like to admit this, but I don\u2019t like doors being closed because it reminds me of being imprisoned.\u201d She points to the wardrobe doors, slightly ajar. \u201cEven those I keep open,\u201d she says sheepishly.</p> <p>It\u2019s been more than 50 years since Ivanna received her final letter from Vladimir. Now in her 90s, she thinks more than ever about the bond they forged in the harsh extremities of the Stalin gulag. \u201cVladimir and I were linked by our experience. Those letters were a lifeline, they gave me some purpose. I felt a sense that things could be better again one day,\u201d she says. It\u2019s clear that Vladimir felt just as strongly. In a letter to Ivanna while he was still imprisoned, he wrote: \u201cLife is very short and we only live once, but, wherever I am and whatever happens to me, I will remember and think of you always.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I</strong><strong>f you get married, I will be terribly jealous\u2019: </strong><strong>excerpts from Vladimir\u2019s </strong><strong>letters to Ivanna after her release</strong></h2> <p><strong>2 November 1955</strong><br>I am so glad I haven\u2019t lost contact with you! The news of your departure shook me. I felt lonely and abandoned but then I thought \u2013 you have freedom! On the one hand I felt so happy for you, on the other hand I felt such pain. I knew that you would write, I longed for the moment you would\u2026 sometimes the loneliness became intolerable. Then I sat down and wrote to you without even having your address because it was like having a conversation with you.</p> <p><strong>31 December 1955</strong><br>In these final minutes of New Year\u2019s Eve, I think of you, my dear\u2026 look at the stars, maybe it\u2019s possible that our eyes could meet while looking up at the same stars.</p> <p><strong>4 February 1956</strong><br>I love you. But we\u2019ve never met in person. This is probably not the way clever people act. It is so difficult, so difficult to define our relationship! You are so far from me now. But every day you become more dear to me. I can\u2019t forget you and I don\u2019t imagine a future without you.</p> <p><strong>8 February 1956</strong><br>I was longing for your letters with an anticipation that can\u2019t be described. I do not know how to thank you for everything you wrote. We owe each other so much and this is why there is no way we\u2019d be able to forget each other. I know that if you get married, I will respect that person although I will be terribly jealous.</p> <p><strong>25 March 1956</strong><br>You wrote that you felt indebted to me for many things \u2013 you do not need to explain \u2013 sometimes I am in awe of everything you have brought into my life. My dear friend! Some things do not need words because none of them could possibly reflect the complexity of our feelings for each other.</p> <p><strong>18 April 1959</strong><br>Who knows?

I thank the heavens that you\u2019re in my life.\u201d The following Christmas they exchanged other family photos. Then one morning Ivanna received a curt letter from Vladimir\u2019s wife demanding that the correspondence cease immediately. Ivanna never heard from Vladimir again. As darkness falls, she pauses in her story to reach across to switch on a softly lit lamp above the small wooden table where we sit. \u201cIt hurt me greatly. I didn\u2019t write back to Vladimir. I didn\u2019t want to interfere in his family life. I know I was lucky to be released from Siberia early,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I lost out on a chance to meet him.\u201d Three years ago, contemplating her old age, Ivanna wondered whether this might be a good time to re-establish contact. She Googled Vladimir and found he had his own website. \u201cI recognised him immediately from the photos I\u2019d seen over the years. He now looked older and had grey hair but I knew it was him, and was excited.\u201d Yet after more research she discovered that it was too late, and he had recently died. \u201cI should have tried harder to find him, I regret that I didn\u2019t. But I worried that it would cause problems for him and his marriage if we ever actually met.\u201d *** It has now been 64 years since Ivanna was released, but eight years in the gulag still has an impact on her daily life in ways that few outsiders would notice. She doesn\u2019t eat much \u2013 maybe a baked potato at lunch, but usually no dinner. It doesn\u2019t occur to her to want anything that she doesn\u2019t have. She has a small bedroom, but sleeps on a futon in the living room as she hates feeling confined. \u201cI don\u2019t like to admit this, but I don\u2019t like doors being closed because it reminds me of being imprisoned.\u201d She points to the wardrobe doors, slightly ajar. \u201cEven those I keep open,\u201d she says sheepishly. It\u2019s been more than 50 years since Ivanna received her final letter from Vladimir. Now in her 90s, she thinks more than ever about the bond they forged in the harsh extremities of the Stalin gulag. \u201cVladimir and I were linked by our experience. Those letters were a lifeline, they gave me some purpose. I felt a sense that things could be better again one day,\u201d she says. It\u2019s clear that Vladimir felt just as strongly. In a letter to Ivanna while he was still imprisoned, he wrote: \u201cLife is very short and we only live once, but, wherever I am and whatever happens to me, I will remember and think of you always.\u201d \u2018If you get married, I will be terribly jealous\u2019: excerpts from Vladimir\u2019s letters to Ivanna after her release 2 November 1955 I am so glad I haven\u2019t lost contact with you! The news of your departure shook me. I felt lonely and abandoned but then I thought \u2013 you have freedom! On the one hand I felt so happy for you, on the other hand I felt such pain. I knew that you would write, I longed for the moment you would\u2026 sometimes the loneliness became intolerable. Then I sat down and wrote to you without even having your address because it was like having a conversation with you. 31 December 1955 In these final minutes of New Year\u2019s Eve, I think of you, my dear\u2026 look at the stars, maybe it\u2019s possible that our eyes could meet while looking up at the same stars. 4 February 1956 I love you. But we\u2019ve never met in person. This is probably not the way clever people act. It is so difficult, so difficult to define our relationship! You are so far from me now. But every day you become more dear to me. I can\u2019t forget you and I don\u2019t imagine a future without you. 8 February 1956 I was longing for your letters with an anticipation that can\u2019t be described. I do not know how to thank you for everything you wrote. We owe each other so much and this is why there is no way we\u2019d be able to forget each other. I know that if you get married, I will respect that person although I will be terribly jealous. 25 March 1956 You wrote that you felt indebted to me for many things \u2013 you do not need to explain \u2013 sometimes I am in awe of everything you have brought into my life. My dear friend! Some things do not need words because none of them could possibly reflect the complexity of our feelings for each other. 18 April 1959 Who knows? We might meet one day. We must believe this, otherwise there is no point to living. You are always in my heart. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson\u2019s shrinking options have narrowed further on Friday, after opposition leaders agreed to reject his demand for a snap general election, until a Brexit delay has been secured.</p> <p>The prime minister reportedly wrote to Tory members on Friday evening pledging to break the law that will require him to seek an extension of article 50. \u201cThey just passed a law that would force me to beg Brussels for an extension to the Brexit deadline. This is something I will never do.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier on Friday he said he would not entertain seeking another deadline extension from Brussels, as the incoming law, expected to receive royal assent on Monday, compels him to if no agreement is in place by 19 October. \u201cI will not. I don\u2019t want a delay,\u201d Johnson said.</p> <p>The BBC reported on Saturday that cross-party MPs, including expelled Conservatives, had sought legal advice and were preparing to go to court \u201cto compel Mr Johnson to seek a delay\u201d.</p> <p>David Lidington, the de facto deputy prime minister when Theresa May was in Downing Street, said it would set a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d if Johnson chose to disobey the law.</p> <p>Lidington, a former Europe minister, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIt is such a fundamental principle that we are governed by the rule of law that I hope no party would question it. Defying any particular law sets a really dangerous precedent.\u201d</p> <p>Lidington said Johnson had convinced him that he still wanted to strike a deal with the EU. </p> <p>The former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith encouraged Johnson to break the law, saying he would be seen as a Brexit \u201cmartyr\u201d if judges opted to put him jail for breaching parliament\u2019s terms.</p> <p>With parliament due to be suspended by next Thursday at the latest, it now appears unlikely Johnson will succeed in his bid to force an election before 31 October \u2013 unless he takes the nuclear option of resigning.</p> <p>After a tumultuous week for the prime minister, the rebels\u2019 pact came as:</p> <p>\u2022 Former justice secretary David Gauke warned that Johnson risked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/gauke-johnson-risks-millions-of-votes-with-farage-lite-strategy\">turning the Conservative party into \u201cFarage-lite\u201d</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 The backbench bill aimed at blocking a no-deal Brexit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/06/brexit-boris-johnson-news-latest-eu-labour-confirms-it-will-not-vote-on-monday-night-for-early-election-live-newsbior\">completed its passage through the House of Lords</a>, clearing the way for it to receive royal assent on Monday.</p> <p>\u2022 A scrawled note leaked to Sky News showed Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/boris-johnson-calls-david-cameron-girly-swot-in-leaked-note\">referring to David Cameron as a \u201cgirly swot\u201d</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 Johnson was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/criticism-grows-boris-johnson-use-police-officers-political-speech\">criticised by the chief constable of West Yorkshire police</a> for using new police recruits as the backdrop for a political speech.</p> <p>\u2022 The prime minister\u2019s first concrete proposal for replacing the Irish backstop <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/boris-johnsons-irish-border-plan-stalls-disastrous-eu-brexit-backstop-talks\">hit the buffers</a> following a \u201cdisastrous\u201d meeting between his chief negotiator and the EU in Brussels.</p> <p>Plaid Cymru\u2019s Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts, who was involved in the rebel talks, said: \u201cWe need to make sure that we get past 31 October, and an extension to article 50. We were in agreement that the prime minister is on the run. Boris is broken. We have an opportunity to bring down Boris, to break Boris, and to bring down <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> \u2013 and we must take that.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cOur intention is to be here, in this place, to hold him to account and to make sure that he abides by that law.\u201d</p> <p>The brutal treatment of the Tory rebels, and the erratic behaviour of Johnson\u2019s adviser Dominic Cummings, have provoked growing disquiet even in cabinet, with Michael Gove raising the question this week of whether they could be welcomed back into the party.</p> <p>Gove, who as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster is in charge of accelerating no-deal planning, asked officials to leave the regular gathering of the key \u201cXO\u201d committee of ministers on Friday so they could air their concerns, one source told the Guardian \u2013 although allies insisted the meeting was routine.</p> <p>Johnson will fly back on Saturday morning from a visit to the Queen\u2019s summer residence of Balmoral with his partner Carrie Symonds to spend the weekend plotting his next move.</p> <p>The passage of Hilary Benn\u2019s backbench bill means Johnson will be legally obliged to request an extension to article 50, if he has failed to pass a Brexit deal, or received MPs\u2019 approval to leave without a deal, by 19 October.</p> <p>Speaking in Scotland on Friday, the prime minister insisted he would refuse to ask for any delay.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve spent a long time trying to sort of fudge this thing and I think the British public really want us to get out. They don\u2019t want more dither and delay,\u201d he said during a visit on Friday to a farm near Banchory, Aberdeenshire, at which he encountered a prize bull called Keene.</p> <p>Asked how he would secure a new deal at the EU summit on 17 October, he said: \u201cBy powers of persuasion. Because there\u2019s absolutely no doubt we should come out \u2026 It\u2019s a pointless delay.\u201d</p> <p>But Gauke, one of the 21 Conservative rebels who lost their party whip this week for supporting the Benn bill, said Johnson would ultimately be left with little choice.</p> <p>\u201cDuring both the leadership election and subsequently, he has just boxed himself in, again and again and again. Just this week he is now saying there are no circumstances in which he will seek an extension. But if the law requires him to seek an extension, he either has to comply with the law, or resign. Surely he must comply with the law?\u201d</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/gauke-johnson-risks-millions-of-votes-with-farage-lite-strategy\">an interview with the Guardian</a>, Gauke also strongly criticised the Tory party\u2019s direction under Johnson.</p> <p>If Johnson did resign, the Queen would be expected to ask Corbyn to try to form a majority government.</p> <p>The Labour leader has mooted the idea of leading a short-term caretaker government, in order to extend article 50 and call a general election. But many members of the rebel alliance have concerns about backing a Corbyn-led administration, even for a short period.</p> <p>There was further embarrassment after it emerged that Johnson referred to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\">Cameron</a> as a \u201cgirly swot\u201d in a recent cabinet paper. The leak of an unredacted version of court documents to Sky News prompted condemnation of the prime minister for sexist insults.</p> <p>During his inaugural prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday, Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/04/you-great-big-girls-blouse-boris-johnson-appears-to-insult-corbyn-during-pmqs\">seemed to call Corbyn</a> a \u201cgreat big girl\u2019s blouse\u201d in relation to the Labour leader\u2019s refusal to back an immediate general election.</p> <p>The other reference dates back to 16 August, appearing in a handwritten note about the idea of suspending parliament for five weeks.</p> <p>The document was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/prorogation-parliament-abuse-power-high-court-shocking-brexit\">initially revealed on Thursday</a> by Downing Street as it resisted legal challenges in Edinburgh and London to the prorogation of parliament, both of which cases were eventually won by No 10.</p> <p>In Aberdeenshire on Friday, at the end of a bruising week, Johnson was asked twice whether he would sack his chief strategist, Dominic Cummings, after the former prime minister, Sir John Major, described him as a \u201cpoison\u201d at the heart of government on Thursday night.</p> <p>Johnson did not answer the first question on his adviser\u2019s future but pressed a second time refused to give Cummings his unambiguous support. He answered: \u201cLook \u2026 advisers, as I think someone said in the Commons the other day, advisers advise and ministers decide.\u201d</p> <p>He was also asked about his own future after a tumultuous week during which he suspended 21 Tory MPs, including the former chancellor Ken Clarke, his younger brother Jo Johnson stepped down from the government and as an MP, and other senior Tories announced their retirement. His brother cited irreconcilable conflicts between his family and the national interest.</p> <p>Asked about his failure to uphold his pledge during the Tory leadership campaign to unite the party, Johnson said he had promised to \u201cdeliver Brexit, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d Asked again when he would resign, he said: \u201cEr \u2026 well \u2026 I think after those three objectives have been accomplished I will \u2026 At some point after those three objectives have been accomplished.\u201d</p> <p>With a no-deal Brexit now all but impossible, Johnson will come under intense pressure to achieve the renegotiated deal with Brussels he has always said was his preferred option.</p> <p>To encourage him to do so, a new cross-party group launched on Friday called \u201cMPs for a deal\u201d, including Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock and Caroline Flint, Liberal Democrat Norman Lamb, and former Conservative leadership contender Rory Stewart, who lost the party whip this week.</p> <p>\u201cEven at the eleventh hour it\u2019s not too late to agree a deal to ensure an orderly exit from the European Union,\u201d they said in a joint statement. \u201cThe media focus has been on the short extension proposed by the Benn bill. However, we believe that Boris Johnson\u2019s response to the bill should be to ensure he secures a deal with the EU27.\u201d</p>",

Defying any particular law sets a really dangerous precedent.\u201d Lidington said Johnson had convinced him that he still wanted to strike a deal with the EU. The former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith encouraged Johnson to break the law, saying he would be seen as a Brexit \u201cmartyr\u201d if judges opted to put him jail for breaching parliament\u2019s terms. With parliament due to be suspended by next Thursday at the latest, it now appears unlikely Johnson will succeed in his bid to force an election before 31 October \u2013 unless he takes the nuclear option of resigning. After a tumultuous week for the prime minister, the rebels\u2019 pact came as: \u2022 Former justice secretary David Gauke warned that Johnson risked turning the Conservative party into \u201cFarage-lite\u201d. \u2022 The backbench bill aimed at blocking a no-deal Brexit completed its passage through the House of Lords, clearing the way for it to receive royal assent on Monday. \u2022 A scrawled note leaked to Sky News showed Johnson referring to David Cameron as a \u201cgirly swot\u201d. \u2022 Johnson was criticised by the chief constable of West Yorkshire police for using new police recruits as the backdrop for a political speech. \u2022 The prime minister\u2019s first concrete proposal for replacing the Irish backstop hit the buffers following a \u201cdisastrous\u201d meeting between his chief negotiator and the EU in Brussels. Plaid Cymru\u2019s Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts, who was involved in the rebel talks, said: \u201cWe need to make sure that we get past 31 October, and an extension to article 50. We were in agreement that the prime minister is on the run. Boris is broken. We have an opportunity to bring down Boris, to break Boris, and to bring down Brexit \u2013 and we must take that.\u201d She added: \u201cOur intention is to be here, in this place, to hold him to account and to make sure that he abides by that law.\u201d The brutal treatment of the Tory rebels, and the erratic behaviour of Johnson\u2019s adviser Dominic Cummings, have provoked growing disquiet even in cabinet, with Michael Gove raising the question this week of whether they could be welcomed back into the party. Gove, who as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster is in charge of accelerating no-deal planning, asked officials to leave the regular gathering of the key \u201cXO\u201d committee of ministers on Friday so they could air their concerns, one source told the Guardian \u2013 although allies insisted the meeting was routine. Johnson will fly back on Saturday morning from a visit to the Queen\u2019s summer residence of Balmoral with his partner Carrie Symonds to spend the weekend plotting his next move. The passage of Hilary Benn\u2019s backbench bill means Johnson will be legally obliged to request an extension to article 50, if he has failed to pass a Brexit deal, or received MPs\u2019 approval to leave without a deal, by 19 October. Speaking in Scotland on Friday, the prime minister insisted he would refuse to ask for any delay. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent a long time trying to sort of fudge this thing and I think the British public really want us to get out. They don\u2019t want more dither and delay,\u201d he said during a visit on Friday to a farm near Banchory, Aberdeenshire, at which he encountered a prize bull called Keene. Asked how he would secure a new deal at the EU summit on 17 October, he said: \u201cBy powers of persuasion. Because there\u2019s absolutely no doubt we should come out \u2026 It\u2019s a pointless delay.\u201d But Gauke, one of the 21 Conservative rebels who lost their party whip this week for supporting the Benn bill, said Johnson would ultimately be left with little choice. \u201cDuring both the leadership election and subsequently, he has just boxed himself in, again and again and again. Just this week he is now saying there are no circumstances in which he will seek an extension. But if the law requires him to seek an extension, he either has to comply with the law, or resign. Surely he must comply with the law?\u201d In an interview with the Guardian, Gauke also strongly criticised the Tory party\u2019s direction under Johnson. If Johnson did resign, the Queen would be expected to ask Corbyn to try to form a majority government. The Labour leader has mooted the idea of leading a short-term caretaker government, in order to extend article 50 and call a general election. But many members of the rebel alliance have concerns about backing a Corbyn-led administration, even for a short period. There was further embarrassment after it emerged that Johnson referred to Cameron as a \u201cgirly swot\u201d in a recent cabinet paper. The leak of an unredacted version of court documents to Sky News prompted condemnation of the prime minister for sexist insults. During his inaugural prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday, Johnson seemed to call Corbyn a \u201cgreat big girl\u2019s blouse\u201d in relation to the Labour leader\u2019s refusal to back an immediate general election. The other reference dates back to 16 August, appearing in a handwritten note about the idea of suspending parliament for five weeks. The document was initially revealed on Thursday by Downing Street as it resisted legal challenges in Edinburgh and London to the prorogation of parliament, both of which cases were eventually won by No 10. In Aberdeenshire on Friday, at the end of a bruising week, Johnson was asked twice whether he would sack his chief strategist, Dominic Cummings, after the former prime minister, Sir John Major, described him as a \u201cpoison\u201d at the heart of government on Thursday night. Johnson did not answer the first question on his adviser\u2019s future but pressed a second time refused to give Cummings his unambiguous support. He answered: \u201cLook \u2026 advisers, as I think someone said in the Commons the other day, advisers advise and ministers decide.\u201d He was also asked about his own future after a tumultuous week during which he suspended 21 Tory MPs, including the former chancellor Ken Clarke, his younger brother Jo Johnson stepped down from the government and as an MP, and other senior Tories announced their retirement. His brother cited irreconcilable conflicts between his family and the national interest. Asked about his failure to uphold his pledge during the Tory leadership campaign to unite the party, Johnson said he had promised to \u201cdeliver Brexit, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d Asked again when he would resign, he said: \u201cEr \u2026 well \u2026 I think after those three objectives have been accomplished I will \u2026 At some point after those three objectives have been accomplished.\u201d With a no-deal Brexit now all but impossible, Johnson will come under intense pressure to achieve the renegotiated deal with Brussels he has always said was his preferred option. To encourage him to do so, a new cross-party group launched on Friday called \u201cMPs for a deal\u201d, including Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock and Caroline Flint, Liberal Democrat Norman Lamb, and former Conservative leadership contender Rory Stewart, who lost the party whip this week. \u201cEven at the eleventh hour it\u2019s not too late to agree a deal to ensure an orderly exit from the European Union,\u201d they said in a joint statement. \u201cThe media focus has been on the short extension proposed by the Benn bill. However, we believe that Boris Johnson\u2019s response to the bill should be to ensure he secures a deal with the EU27.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Anthony Ekundayo Lennon remembers the moment his life spun out of control. It was late morning, Friday 2 November 2018. The actor and director was giving a talk about the performing arts to university students, and his phone kept flashing. It was so incessant that the students suggested he\u2019d better take a look. He told them it wouldn\u2019t be anything important, turned the phone over and got on with his lecture. When the class broke for lunch, he saw missed calls from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/talawa-theatre-company\" title=\"\">Talawa theatre company</a>, where he had been working for the past year, as well as several unknown numbers and messages.</p> <p>One text stood out. It was from a journalist at the Sunday Times, asking for a comment on a story the paper was preparing to run about Lennon\u2019s place on a prestigious scheme \u2013 the artistic director leadership programme (ADLP) for black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) theatre practitioners. Lennon had been awarded an 18-month residency with Talawa, Britain\u2019s best-known black-led theatre company. He scrolled down the text.</p> <p>\u201cIt does seem striking that neither the ADLP nor the Talawa has ever made clear that you are a white man,\u201d the journalist wrote, adding: \u201cWhy has neither Talawa theatre or the ADLP programme made clear that you have received BAME funding as a white man with Irish parents?\u201d Lennon decided not to respond. It was true that his parents were white, but this was no secret; nor was the fact that he believed he had African heritage. He had always been treated by people as mixed race, and so identified as a person of mixed heritage. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I had anything to answer,\u201d he tells me now. We\u2019re sitting in a pub in north London. \u201cTalawa knew about my being of mixed heritage while having white parents. I\u2019ve never not spoken about it.\u201d </p> <p>Two days after Lennon received the text, the Sunday Times published its story, accusing Lennon of \u201cpassing\u201d as black. \u201cA theatre director who has won funds meant for \u2018people of colour\u2019 has admitted his parents and grandparents were all white,\u201d ran the introduction, going on to quote one unnamed black actor who had expressed disquiet: \u201cWhen I discovered his background, I thought it was unfair that a white man had taken a black person\u2019s place on a BAME scheme.\u201d The article compared Lennon to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/25/rachel-dolezal-not-going-stoop-apologise-grovel\" title=\"\">Rachel Dolezal</a>, the former president of the Spokane chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in the US, who claimed she was black despite having white parents, and when challenged in 2015, argued that \u201cthe idea of race is a lie\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd72a6122a8cd470d8d4a57dd816cfd9c9bc8f51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd72a6122a8cd470d8d4a57dd816cfd9c9bc8f51/0_0_1083_735/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actor and director Anthony Ekundayo Lennon as a boy, with his brother Vincent\" width=\"1000\" height=\"679\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With his brother Vincent (on left). Photograph: courtesy of Anthony Ekundayo Lennon</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Anthony Lennon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lennon was floored. \u201cI call it the hit,\u201d he says. \u201cIt really did feel like an assassination \u2013 a character assassination.\u201d But there was more to come. The story was picked up by other journalists, and Lennon was portrayed as a conman who had cheated his way to the top at the expense of people of colour. As a dramatic plot, it appeared to have everything: hubris, nemesis, mistaken identity, even the occasional hint of comedy.</p> <p>The Sun suggested that Lennon had chosen to identify as black because he had \u201ccurly hair\u201d and had struggled to find decent parts as an actor. The Daily Mail pointed to the \u00a3406,500 Arts Council grant shared between the four recipients of the ADLP award and suggested that Lennon had cheated the taxpayer. The Mirror said he had won the grant \u201cbecause he believes everyone is African\u201d. It was true that British theatre, like much of the arts world, was, and is, disproportionately white: <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/anthony-ekundayo-lennon-black-theatre-arts-council-england-theatre-rachel-dolezal-transracial-a8616851.html\" title=\"\">the Independent published data</a> showing that, in 2016-17, people from BAME backgrounds made up just 8% of chief executives, 10% of artistic directors and 10% of theatre chairs; Lennon\u2019s award, it argued, was \u201ca kick in the teeth\u201d for practitioners of colour. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/trevor-phillips\" title=\"\">Trevor Phillips</a>, former chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, told the Telegraph: \u201cWe should be doing more to help individuals of talent from black and ethnic minority communities, and we cannot do that if the few opportunities that exist are going to white people who are self-identifying as something else.\u201d </p> <p>Apart from the friends and colleagues closest to him (both Talawa and the Arts Council stood by Lennon, arguing that they had never been misled), he found himself damned right across the political spectrum. He was hardly a household name, but as an actor with 30 years\u2019 experience \u2013 much of it with black theatre groups \u2013 he was well-respected within the industry, and starting to show promise as a director. But overnight he had become a pariah.</p> <p>Lennon wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/10/white-parents-african-ancestry-anthony-ekundayo-lennon\" title=\"\">a column for the Guardian</a>, explaining that the Sunday Times had misrepresented him \u2013 but refused all other requests for comment. The controversy was taking its toll. He went to ground, took time off work, and came very close to taking his own life.</p> <p>Ten months on, Lennon has chosen to tell his story for the first time. Rather than trying to \u201cpass\u201d as black, he says, he has spent a lifetime failing to pass as white \u2013 from babyhood to the present day. And many years ago he decided to embrace that \u2013 to live with the identity the rest of the world persisted in giving him.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Lennon first calls me out of the blue in July. We have never met, but a mutual friend has suggested he get in touch. He outlines his story, and says he has just received information that sheds new light on his racial identity. He sounds nervous, and asks if we can meet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>From the moment I was born, I used to feel I\u2019d damaged my family \u2013 that my arrival was like a bomb had gone off</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A few days later, we get together for a coffee. Lennon, aged 53, has an extraordinary face \u2013 sculpted cheekbones, caterpillar eyebrows, flared nostrils, piercing blue eyes. These days his head is shaved, but as a child and young man he had an afro; that was the way his hair grew naturally. He shows me a series of photographs. Here he is with his younger brother, Vincent, aged six and four \u2013 two cute, gap-toothed, mixed-race boys, or so you would assume. There he is at 18, body-popping with his all-black crew in London. And in his early 20s, as a politicised young man with a big afro worn under his black leather beret. Sometimes he looks black, sometimes mixed race. The one thing he doesn\u2019t look is white.</p> <p>We agree to meet again in a couple of weeks. Meanwhile he emails and texts me regularly, almost obsessively \u2013 notes, mini essays, childhood recollections, most of them painful. He remembers being with Vincent in a cupboard upstairs, hiding from the prying neighbours who had come round for a nosy at the two strange children; friends asking where his black parent was; the school caretaker threatening to set dogs on him and telling him, \u201cRun, nigger.\u201d</p> <p>Almost a year into his stint at Talawa, Lennon says he was warned by the company\u2019s artistic director Michael Buffong that a number of people weren\u2019t happy about him winning the award, but he didn\u2019t think much about it. Nobody had said anything to him, and he assumed any mutterings would subside.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a914f0d1727afee67ace7c6c6a0aa3df7002fe1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a914f0d1727afee67ace7c6c6a0aa3df7002fe1b/0_37_594_668/445.jpg\" alt=\"Old black and white photograph of actor and director Anthony Ekundayo Lennon's mother\" width=\"445\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lennon\u2019s mother\u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Anthony Lennon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a78f0fc13c55079216d1a9c1608b9d76984591a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a78f0fc13c55079216d1a9c1608b9d76984591a9/0_0_308_435/308.jpg\" alt=\"Old black and white photograph of actor and director Anthony Ekundayo Lennon's mother\" width=\"308\" height=\"435\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2026and father.

For my generation, and when Talawa started as a company in 1986, there was a spirit of inclusivity which meant that he was accepted by many, inside the organisation and externally, as a person of mixed heritage.\u201d The Arts Council backed this up, arguing: \u201cThis is a very unusual case and we do not think it undermines the support we provide to black and minority ethnic people within the theatre sector.\u201d Forty-eight prominent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/16/anthony-ekundayo-lennons-story-is-not-black-and-white\" title=\"\">black artists and activists wrote to the Guardian</a> in support of Lennon, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/michaela-coel\" title=\"\">Michaela Coel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/clarke-peters\" title=\"\">Clarke Peters</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/roy-williams\" title=\"\">Roy Williams</a> and Lennon\u2019s friend, the actor and writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/lennie-james\" title=\"\">Lennie James</a>. Lennon shows me a text he recently received from James: \u201cI just want to check in to make sure you\u2019re good and looking after yourself. Remember you don\u2019t have to say, answer or justify yourself to anyone. Those who know you know you. If people aren\u2019t ready for the nuance of the conversation, you may just have to wait for them to catch up. Don\u2019t get dragged back. I\u2019m thinking of you, my friend. Be strong.\u201d</p> <p>Lennon was anything but strong, though. The allegation that he was a fraud was devastating. All his life, he says, his mother had worked to instil in him her core values: don\u2019t lie, say please and thank you, don\u2019t bring police to my door. And here he was, accused not only of living a lie but of making money out of it.</p> <p>His first worry was the impact the accusation would have on her. \u201cI saw a look in my mum\u2019s eyes when she was telling me about the reporters knocking on her door or loitering around the back. I\u2019d never seen her looking so frightened and so confused. I felt completely helpless and I wanted to take it all away.\u201d His voice rises, and he starts crying. \u201cFrom the moment I was born, I used to feel I\u2019d damaged my family \u2013 that my arrival was like a bomb had gone off.\u201d It had taken him so long to feel OK about himself, and now he felt he\u2019d done the worst thing possible: he made life difficult for his mother.</p> <p>***</p> <p>When I ask Lennon why he is so sure that he is not the result of an affair, he smiles and says he knows his mother. But there is more to it than that; his two younger brothers also looked mixed race, the youngest less strikingly so. But Lennon asks if I really believe that his mother would have such a long-term affair, given the hostility she faced. She told him that when he was a baby, people would stare at the two of them in the street \u2013 if they were lucky. \u201cSome would shout at her from the other side of the road, some would spit, some would throw stones at the pram. But we\u2019re talking the 60s \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/16/enoch-powell-rivers-of-blood-speech-brexit-right\" title=\"\">Enoch Powell</a>, teddy boys, skinheads,\u201d he says. Even his grandmother told him he was a curse on the family, and sent him to bed clutching rosary beads so he could pray for forgiveness. A Sunday school worker chastised him for using a light brown pencil when drawing a picture of himself and Vincent; maybe they looked the way they did because they had been bad when they were younger, he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e96aa06a279d388d6d0c46df95cb11eacdf8499a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e96aa06a279d388d6d0c46df95cb11eacdf8499a/860_335_2511_2283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actor and director Anthony Ekundayo Lennon with actor and writer Michaela Coel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"909\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With actor and writer Michaela Coel.

As an adult, Lennon discovered that his father had accused her of having an affair. He says his appearance must have created such tension, he is amazed they stayed together for so long \u2013 until he was 12. \u201cHow do you apologise for accusing your partner of having an affair when they didn\u2019t?\u201d he asks. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re the mother of this child and you\u2019ve got all these fingers pointing at you, the pain that must have come with that...\u201d He trails off. While he and his brothers looked mixed race, they also resembled their father. Lennon says he doesn\u2019t like to use the word, but can\u2019t think of another that does the job: he believes he is a \u201cthrowback\u201d. Yes, his family is white as far back as he can go \u2013 but he is sure that there is African ancestry somewhere.</p> <p>At school, Lennon says, most of his friends were black or mixed race. He doesn\u2019t know why he always gravitated towards people of colour \u2013 and they towards him. Back then, he didn\u2019t have either the language or perspective to describe what was happening. He has some happy memories of that time: the school friend who snuck him an afro comb in solidarity; the neighbours who cooked him and Vincent African-Caribbean food and sorted out their hair on Saturdays; the ticket collector at the underground station letting him sit on the tall stool inside his ticket box, because he looked like his son; the friends who called him \u201cSidders\u201d, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sidney-poitier\" title=\"\">Sidney Poitier</a>, when he told them he wanted to be an actor.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Casting directors often told my agent that there were no parts for mixed-race characters</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As teenagers, both Lennon and Vincent developed nervous tics. He says that Vincent struggled with his identity, but in a different way; he couldn\u2019t understand why Anthony embraced his \u201cblackness\u201d. Vincent became a skinhead and petty criminal, and suffered from depression. At the age of 19, he died after a terrible incident on a train: a door opened and he fell on to the tracks. That day, he had phoned their mother to tell her that he loved her \u2013 something he rarely, if ever, did. An investigation into Vincent\u2019s death (in which a witness described him as \u201chalf-caste\u201d) concluded that there was no fault with the door, and Lennon has always been convinced that his brother intended to take his own life. \u201cI was devastated by his death, and still am.\u201d</p> <p>As a teenager, Anthony found his home in drama classes. He loved acting and decided he was going to make a career of it. But as soon as he turned professional, he realised the range of roles he was being offered was limited. \u201cCasting directors often told my agent that there were no parts for mixed-race characters,\u201d he says. Again and again, the same roles came up: loud, aggressive men, running into trouble or away from the law. Often the characters were criminals; occasionally, they were victims of a miscarriage of justice.</p> <p>He started to turn down roles because of the negative stereotypes. One part he did accept was in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-bill\" title=\"\">The Bill</a>, playing a young man falsely accused of robbery: \u201cThe only reason I did it was because my character wasn\u2019t guilty.\u201d He watched the clip again recently and was reminded how many of the characters he played were the butt of racism. \u201cAt one point the police officer says to my character, \u2018We know it\u2019s you because we\u2019ve got a set of prints.\u2019 I say, \u2018Fingerprints?\u2019 and he replies, \u2018No, lip prints.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Lennon says that, more than anything else, it was the prejudice he experienced as a child and young adult that made him want to identify as black. The Sunday schoolteacher and his own grandmother may have thought his appearance was something to be ashamed of, but he didn\u2019t. If their attitudes were representative of being white, he was happy to renounce his whiteness.</p> <p>In 1990, Lennon appeared in a TV play called Chilling Out, as part of the BBC\u2019s Everyman slot. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yshUNQmjQps\" title=\"\">He sends me a link</a>: it\u2019s<strong> </strong>a brilliantly nuanced exploration of race, class and identity, in which seven young actors \u2013 including Lennie James \u2013 talk about the \u201cexperience and spirit of being black\u201d in Britain. Although the actors played themselves and the scenes began with improvisation, the end result was a scripted docudrama. When Lennon is asked about his backstory, he says he is from Ireland. The other actors nod approvingly, and ask which island. \u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cIreland, Ireland\u201d, and goes on to explain that both his parents are white. The others look at him astonished and suggest he is in denial about his blackness; there are jokes about his mother and the milkman.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d85d87b178d3c83e236cb5b3b1d8918a64ed6cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d85d87b178d3c83e236cb5b3b1d8918a64ed6cb/0_0_1238_840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Ekundayo Lennon with two other actors in the BBC Everyman play Chilling Out in 1990\" width=\"1000\" height=\"679\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the BBC Everyman play Chilling Out in 1990: the other actors suggested Lennon was in denial about his blackness</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The conversation moves on: if it is true that his parents are white, is he in denial, his fellow actors ask. Is race an objective truth, or a construct based on what others see in you, and what you see in the mirror? Lennon is asked how he himself identifies. He looks bashful, and says he has never talked about this before. \u201cWhen I\u2019m alone in my bedroom looking in the mirror, thinking about stuff I\u2019ve written down, thinking about my past, relationship-wise, pictures on the wall, I think I\u2019m a black man. I\u2019ve not said that to anyone. And I won\u2019t say it outside.\u201d James tells the group he has seen Lennon changing over the six years of their friendship, and is puzzled by it. \u201cSometimes I feel like you are watching me,\u201d he says. \u201cWatching me to say, this equals a black man. Then you\u2019re taking it from me and sticking it on yourself.\u201d</p> <p>When the Sunday Times story appeared, Chilling Out was cited as evidence that Lennon was a fraud, with James quoted as a witness for the prosecution. For Lennon, this was a deliberate misreading \u2013 of him, of James, of their friendship. At the time the drama was made, James had known about Lennon\u2019s parentage for years. Perhaps more importantly, Lennon says, it should be obvious to anybody watching Chilling Out that the other actors were eager to help him make peace with his complex identity, rather than accuse him of cultural misappropriation. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One of the last conversations I had with Dad, he said, 'You\u2019re white and I think you\u2019ve got an identity problem'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Soon after making Chilling Out, Lennon decided to change his name formally. Anthony David Lennon did not reflect who he was, he thought, so he became Soweto Alkebulan Ekundayo: Soweto because his friend and mentor Paul Kinch had a son called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/19/soweto-kinch-review-jazz-hip-hop-ronnie-scotts\" title=\"\">Soweto (now a celebrated saxophonist)</a>; Alkebulan because it is said to be the earliest name for Africa; Ekundayo because he liked the sound of the Yoruba name, and discovered it meant \u201cweeping becomes joy\u201d. He started reading literature about black culture and politics, withdrew from the acting world and moved to Manchester, where he dedicated himself to developing his political consciousness. He read up on the history of British imperialism. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said all the literature I read was about loving black culture \u2013 some was derogatory about white people. I just wanted to read stories by black people, about black culture and history.\u201d</p> <p>He had two daughters, who are now in their 20s \u2013 one is a dancer, the other works in the film industry \u2013 and named the oldest Soweto, too. Lennon\u2019s mother continued to call him Anthony, but quietly embraced his African identity. His father, who died in 1999, thought Lennon had lost the plot. \u201cOne of the last conversations I had with Dad was him saying, \u2018As far as I\u2019m concerned you\u2019re white and I think you\u2019ve got an identity problem.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Some time after changing his name, he met the<strong> </strong>educational consultant<strong> </strong>Paul Wilson-Eme, who went on to have a huge influence on him. Wilson-Eme asked him why he had called himself Soweto. Lennon mentioned the obvious: the associations with South Africa, black pride, the uprising. Wilson-Eme asked him if he knew what Soweto meant. \u201cTo my shame I had no answer. Then he filled in the missing gaps \u2013 it stands for South West Township. Then he said, \u2018I love you, my brother, but I think you need to check in with yourself as to why you have named yourself that.\u2019\u201d So he simply became Ekundayo. Then he changed his name legally again, choosing Taharka as a first name.</p> <p>His agent got in touch and said that directors were still keen to hire him, but there was a problem: if he returned to acting as Taharka Ekundayo, there would be too much explaining to do. \u201cShe said, \u2018Why don\u2019t we compromise \u2013 bring Anthony Lennon back, and put Ekundayo in the middle? Casting directors will know it\u2019s the same old Anthony Lennon, but Ekundayo is there out of respect for your ancestry.\u201d</p> <p>And so began his fifth, and happiest, incarnation \u2013 as Anthony Ekundayo Lennon. He returned to the theatre, working largely for black-led companies, and segued from acting to directing. For two decades, he lived easy in his skin \u2013 a man with white parents, unknown African ancestry, and many friends, none of whom questioned his right to be who he said he was. When I ask if he ever considered he might not meet the criteria for the Talawa award, he says no: \u201cTo doubt my eligibility would be akin to doubting my existence.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>After the story broke, Lennon tells me people pointed at him in public places. I can\u2019t help thinking of the little boy and his mother who were demonised in the streets 50 years ago. \u201cIt was surreal and scary, and the start of many panic attacks and sleepless nights,\u201d he says. His worst childhood memories returned.</p> <p>He says he reached his nadir soon afterwards. \u201cI\u2019m going to be totally up front with you. There\u2019s a little part of me that knows I don\u2019t want to say this next bit, because I worry about what family and friends will think.\u201d He sips from the pint of strawberry and lime lager he\u2019s been nursing for two hours. \u201cI went to a tube station. I took myself to the mouth of the tunnel and looked at the tracks. I just felt I didn\u2019t want any of this any more. I didn\u2019t want the toxicity, the pain, the accusations. I was imagining everything my dad went though, my mum, my brother. I came so close.\u201d</p> <p>In the end, he says, what stopped him was thinking about his mother and his daughters. He sweeps away a tear. \u201cAnd this is a message for anybody else thinking about it: force yourself to think about somebody you love, or who would desperately miss you if you are no longer there. Find a reason not to do it, then don\u2019t. Let the next morning arrive.\u201d He repeats the last sentence, more to himself than to me. \u201cLet the next morning arrive.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b7e98adc75e95fb827844a517ee568893129167\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b7e98adc75e95fb827844a517ee568893129167/0_733_3840_3056/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Head shot of actor and director Anthony Ekundayo Lennon, against a turquoise background\" width=\"1000\" height=\"796\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019ve never not spoken about being of mixed heritage while having white parents.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Vintiner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He returned to work and saw out his contract at Talawa, which ended a couple of weeks ago. During his final months he mentored young artists, directed a reimagined Othello called Men Are Not Gods, and continued to learn the craft of running a theatre company. It\u2019s been a tough year, but he says Buffong and other staff have always been supportive. </p> <p>In March this year, Lennon was invited to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/shakespeares-globe\" title=\"\">the Globe theatre</a>\u2019s press night for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/mar/07/richard-ii-review-lynette-linton-adjoa-andoh-sam-wanamaker-playhouse\" title=\"\">Richard II</a> \u2013 the first all-women-of-colour production of a Shakespeare play in the UK. Despite Talawa\u2019s backing, it was the first major industry event he had attended since the media storm. He says it was an inspiring night \u2013 both the production, and the support from friends. But at the afterparty he struggled. \u201cI noticed a few people who I didn\u2019t know looking over at me, and it was clear I was being whispered about. I felt othered for the first time ever, in a space with a group of artists.\u201d But he says no actor or director has ever challenged him to his face. A couple of months ago, Lennon was verbally attacked by a stranger on the underground. \u201cA black guy came up to me, and said, \u2018You\u2019re a fraud, you\u2019re a thief.\u2019 A couple of people stood between us because they thought he might physically attack me. He was really angry: \u2018You\u2019re that guy in the paper. Why are you pretending?\u2019\u201d Did Lennon defend himself verbally? \u201cNo, because there\u2019s nothing to defend.\u201d By now, he was feeling stronger.</p> <p>Would he have qualms about working for a black-led theatre company in the future? \u201cNo!\u201d He sounds appalled. \u201cI\u2019ll work with anyone who wants to have a conversation with me, anyone who\u2019s interested in telling stories. I\u2019d really like to direct plays, please, and lead a company. That\u2019s why I was put on the artistic directors\u2019 programme in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>I ask him about the news he mentioned when he first called me a couple of months ago. Lennon smiles and whips out an envelope containing the results of an ancestry DNA test he recently took. It shows his genetic makeup, country by country: 46% Irish and Scottish, 22% from England, Wales and north-western Europe. He points me to the last stat: 32% West African. The science of ancestry DNA testing is not infallible, but it feels like a significant result. Does he feel vindicated? \u201cAll it\u2019s done for me is confirmed in data what I\u2019ve always known.\u201d Some time in the future, he will trace those African roots right back through his family. But for now only one thing matters to him \u2013 that they are there.</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 September 2019 because an earlier version said that Rachel Dolezal was the former president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in the US.

      "bodyText": "Anthony Ekundayo Lennon remembers the moment his life spun out of control. It was late morning, Friday 2 November 2018. The actor and director was giving a talk about the performing arts to university students, and his phone kept flashing. It was so incessant that the students suggested he\u2019d better take a look. He told them it wouldn\u2019t be anything important, turned the phone over and got on with his lecture. When the class broke for lunch, he saw missed calls from Talawa theatre company, where he had been working for the past year, as well as several unknown numbers and messages. One text stood out. It was from a journalist at the Sunday Times, asking for a comment on a story the paper was preparing to run about Lennon\u2019s place on a prestigious scheme \u2013 the artistic director leadership programme (ADLP) for black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) theatre practitioners. Lennon had been awarded an 18-month residency with Talawa, Britain\u2019s best-known black-led theatre company. He scrolled down the text. \u201cIt does seem striking that neither the ADLP nor the Talawa has ever made clear that you are a white man,\u201d the journalist wrote, adding: \u201cWhy has neither Talawa theatre or the ADLP programme made clear that you have received BAME funding as a white man with Irish parents?\u201d Lennon decided not to respond. It was true that his parents were white, but this was no secret; nor was the fact that he believed he had African heritage. He had always been treated by people as mixed race, and so identified as a person of mixed heritage. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I had anything to answer,\u201d he tells me now. We\u2019re sitting in a pub in north London. \u201cTalawa knew about my being of mixed heritage while having white parents. I\u2019ve never not spoken about it.\u201d Two days after Lennon received the text, the Sunday Times published its story, accusing Lennon of \u201cpassing\u201d as black. \u201cA theatre director who has won funds meant for \u2018people of colour\u2019 has admitted his parents and grandparents were all white,\u201d ran the introduction, going on to quote one unnamed black actor who had expressed disquiet: \u201cWhen I discovered his background, I thought it was unfair that a white man had taken a black person\u2019s place on a BAME scheme.\u201d The article compared Lennon to Rachel Dolezal, the former president of the Spokane chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in the US, who claimed she was black despite having white parents, and when challenged in 2015, argued that \u201cthe idea of race is a lie\u201d. Lennon was floored. \u201cI call it the hit,\u201d he says. \u201cIt really did feel like an assassination \u2013 a character assassination.\u201d But there was more to come. The story was picked up by other journalists, and Lennon was portrayed as a conman who had cheated his way to the top at the expense of people of colour. As a dramatic plot, it appeared to have everything: hubris, nemesis, mistaken identity, even the occasional hint of comedy. The Sun suggested that Lennon had chosen to identify as black because he had \u201ccurly hair\u201d and had struggled to find decent parts as an actor. The Daily Mail pointed to the \u00a3406,500 Arts Council grant shared between the four recipients of the ADLP award and suggested that Lennon had cheated the taxpayer. The Mirror said he had won the grant \u201cbecause he believes everyone is African\u201d. It was true that British theatre, like much of the arts world, was, and is, disproportionately white: the Independent published data showing that, in 2016-17, people from BAME backgrounds made up just 8% of chief executives, 10% of artistic directors and 10% of theatre chairs; Lennon\u2019s award, it argued, was \u201ca kick in the teeth\u201d for practitioners of colour. Trevor Phillips, former chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, told the Telegraph: \u201cWe should be doing more to help individuals of talent from black and ethnic minority communities, and we cannot do that if the few opportunities that exist are going to white people who are self-identifying as something else.\u201d Apart from the friends and colleagues closest to him (both Talawa and the Arts Council stood by Lennon, arguing that they had never been misled), he found himself damned right across the political spectrum. He was hardly a household name, but as an actor with 30 years\u2019 experience \u2013 much of it with black theatre groups \u2013 he was well-respected within the industry, and starting to show promise as a director. But overnight he had become a pariah. Lennon wrote a column for the Guardian, explaining that the Sunday Times had misrepresented him \u2013 but refused all other requests for comment. The controversy was taking its toll. He went to ground, took time off work, and came very close to taking his own life. Ten months on, Lennon has chosen to tell his story for the first time. Rather than trying to \u201cpass\u201d as black, he says, he has spent a lifetime failing to pass as white \u2013 from babyhood to the present day. And many years ago he decided to embrace that \u2013 to live with the identity the rest of the world persisted in giving him. *** Lennon first calls me out of the blue in July. We have never met, but a mutual friend has suggested he get in touch. He outlines his story, and says he has just received information that sheds new light on his racial identity. He sounds nervous, and asks if we can meet. A few days later, we get together for a coffee. Lennon, aged 53, has an extraordinary face \u2013 sculpted cheekbones, caterpillar eyebrows, flared nostrils, piercing blue eyes. These days his head is shaved, but as a child and young man he had an afro; that was the way his hair grew naturally. He shows me a series of photographs. Here he is with his younger brother, Vincent, aged six and four \u2013 two cute, gap-toothed, mixed-race boys, or so you would assume. There he is at 18, body-popping with his all-black crew in London. And in his early 20s, as a politicised young man with a big afro worn under his black leather beret. Sometimes he looks black, sometimes mixed race. The one thing he doesn\u2019t look is white. We agree to meet again in a couple of weeks. Meanwhile he emails and texts me regularly, almost obsessively \u2013 notes, mini essays, childhood recollections, most of them painful. He remembers being with Vincent in a cupboard upstairs, hiding from the prying neighbours who had come round for a nosy at the two strange children; friends asking where his black parent was; the school caretaker threatening to set dogs on him and telling him, \u201cRun, nigger.\u201d Almost a year into his stint at Talawa, Lennon says he was warned by the company\u2019s artistic director Michael Buffong that a number of people weren\u2019t happy about him winning the award, but he didn\u2019t think much about it. Nobody had said anything to him, and he assumed any mutterings would subside. When the story broke last year, Buffong released a statement saying, \u201cI have always been aware of Anthony\u2019s unique and complicated story. For my generation, and when Talawa started as a company in 1986, there was a spirit of inclusivity which meant that he was accepted by many, inside the organisation and externally, as a person of mixed heritage.\u201d The Arts Council backed this up, arguing: \u201cThis is a very unusual case and we do not think it undermines the support we provide to black and minority ethnic people within the theatre sector.\u201d Forty-eight prominent black artists and activists wrote to the Guardian in support of Lennon, including Michaela Coel, Clarke Peters, Roy Williams and Lennon\u2019s friend, the actor and writer Lennie James. Lennon shows me a text he recently received from James: \u201cI just want to check in to make sure you\u2019re good and looking after yourself. Remember you don\u2019t have to say, answer or justify yourself to anyone. Those who know you know you. If people aren\u2019t ready for the nuance of the conversation, you may just have to wait for them to catch up. Don\u2019t get dragged back. I\u2019m thinking of you, my friend. Be strong.\u201d Lennon was anything but strong, though. The allegation that he was a fraud was devastating. All his life, he says, his mother had worked to instil in him her core values: don\u2019t lie, say please and thank you, don\u2019t bring police to my door. And here he was, accused not only of living a lie but of making money out of it. His first worry was the impact the accusation would have on her. \u201cI saw a look in my mum\u2019s eyes when she was telling me about the reporters knocking on her door or loitering around the back. I\u2019d never seen her looking so frightened and so confused. I felt completely helpless and I wanted to take it all away.\u201d His voice rises, and he starts crying. \u201cFrom the moment I was born, I used to feel I\u2019d damaged my family \u2013 that my arrival was like a bomb had gone off.\u201d It had taken him so long to feel OK about himself, and now he felt he\u2019d done the worst thing possible: he made life difficult for his mother. *** When I ask Lennon why he is so sure that he is not the result of an affair, he smiles and says he knows his mother. But there is more to it than that; his two younger brothers also looked mixed race, the youngest less strikingly so. But Lennon asks if I really believe that his mother would have such a long-term affair, given the hostility she faced. She told him that when he was a baby, people would stare at the two of them in the street \u2013 if they were lucky. \u201cSome would shout at her from the other side of the road, some would spit, some would throw stones at the pram. But we\u2019re talking the 60s \u2013 Enoch Powell, teddy boys, skinheads,\u201d he says. Even his grandmother told him he was a curse on the family, and sent him to bed clutching rosary beads so he could pray for forgiveness. A Sunday school worker chastised him for using a light brown pencil when drawing a picture of himself and Vincent; maybe they looked the way they did because they had been bad when they were younger, he said. His mother hated talking about \u201cit\u201d \u2013 the bewildering appearance of her boys \u2013 so she didn\u2019t. As an adult, Lennon discovered that his father had accused her of having an affair. He says his appearance must have created such tension, he is amazed they stayed together for so long \u2013 until he was 12. \u201cHow do you apologise for accusing your partner of having an affair when they didn\u2019t?\u201d he asks. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re the mother of this child and you\u2019ve got all these fingers pointing at you, the pain that must have come with that...\u201d He trails off. While he and his brothers looked mixed race, they also resembled their father. Lennon says he doesn\u2019t like to use the word, but can\u2019t think of another that does the job: he believes he is a \u201cthrowback\u201d. Yes, his family is white as far back as he can go \u2013 but he is sure that there is African ancestry somewhere. At school, Lennon says, most of his friends were black or mixed race. He doesn\u2019t know why he always gravitated towards people of colour \u2013 and they towards him. Back then, he didn\u2019t have either the language or perspective to describe what was happening. He has some happy memories of that time: the school friend who snuck him an afro comb in solidarity; the neighbours who cooked him and Vincent African-Caribbean food and sorted out their hair on Saturdays; the ticket collector at the underground station letting him sit on the tall stool inside his ticket box, because he looked like his son; the friends who called him \u201cSidders\u201d, after Sidney Poitier, when he told them he wanted to be an actor. As teenagers, both Lennon and Vincent developed nervous tics. He says that Vincent struggled with his identity, but in a different way; he couldn\u2019t understand why Anthony embraced his \u201cblackness\u201d. Vincent became a skinhead and petty criminal, and suffered from depression. At the age of 19, he died after a terrible incident on a train: a door opened and he fell on to the tracks. That day, he had phoned their mother to tell her that he loved her \u2013 something he rarely, if ever, did. An investigation into Vincent\u2019s death (in which a witness described him as \u201chalf-caste\u201d) concluded that there was no fault with the door, and Lennon has always been convinced that his brother intended to take his own life. \u201cI was devastated by his death, and still am.\u201d As a teenager, Anthony found his home in drama classes. He loved acting and decided he was going to make a career of it. But as soon as he turned professional, he realised the range of roles he was being offered was limited. \u201cCasting directors often told my agent that there were no parts for mixed-race characters,\u201d he says. Again and again, the same roles came up: loud, aggressive men, running into trouble or away from the law. Often the characters were criminals; occasionally, they were victims of a miscarriage of justice. He started to turn down roles because of the negative stereotypes. One part he did accept was in The Bill, playing a young man falsely accused of robbery: \u201cThe only reason I did it was because my character wasn\u2019t guilty.\u201d He watched the clip again recently and was reminded how many of the characters he played were the butt of racism. \u201cAt one point the police officer says to my character, \u2018We know it\u2019s you because we\u2019ve got a set of prints.\u2019 I say, \u2018Fingerprints?\u2019 and he replies, \u2018No, lip prints.\u2019\u201d Lennon says that, more than anything else, it was the prejudice he experienced as a child and young adult that made him want to identify as black. The Sunday schoolteacher and his own grandmother may have thought his appearance was something to be ashamed of, but he didn\u2019t. If their attitudes were representative of being white, he was happy to renounce his whiteness. In 1990, Lennon appeared in a TV play called Chilling Out, as part of the BBC\u2019s Everyman slot. He sends me a link: it\u2019s a brilliantly nuanced exploration of race, class and identity, in which seven young actors \u2013 including Lennie James \u2013 talk about the \u201cexperience and spirit of being black\u201d in Britain. Although the actors played themselves and the scenes began with improvisation, the end result was a scripted docudrama. When Lennon is asked about his backstory, he says he is from Ireland. The other actors nod approvingly, and ask which island. \u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cIreland, Ireland\u201d, and goes on to explain that both his parents are white. The others look at him astonished and suggest he is in denial about his blackness; there are jokes about his mother and the milkman. The conversation moves on: if it is true that his parents are white, is he in denial, his fellow actors ask. Is race an objective truth, or a construct based on what others see in you, and what you see in the mirror? Lennon is asked how he himself identifies. He looks bashful, and says he has never talked about this before. \u201cWhen I\u2019m alone in my bedroom looking in the mirror, thinking about stuff I\u2019ve written down, thinking about my past, relationship-wise, pictures on the wall, I think I\u2019m a black man. I\u2019ve not said that to anyone. And I won\u2019t say it outside.\u201d James tells the group he has seen Lennon changing over the six years of their friendship, and is puzzled by it. \u201cSometimes I feel like you are watching me,\u201d he says. \u201cWatching me to say, this equals a black man. Then you\u2019re taking it from me and sticking it on yourself.\u201d When the Sunday Times story appeared, Chilling Out was cited as evidence that Lennon was a fraud, with James quoted as a witness for the prosecution. For Lennon, this was a deliberate misreading \u2013 of him, of James, of their friendship. At the time the drama was made, James had known about Lennon\u2019s parentage for years. Perhaps more importantly, Lennon says, it should be obvious to anybody watching Chilling Out that the other actors were eager to help him make peace with his complex identity, rather than accuse him of cultural misappropriation. Soon after making Chilling Out, Lennon decided to change his name formally. Anthony David Lennon did not reflect who he was, he thought, so he became Soweto Alkebulan Ekundayo: Soweto because his friend and mentor Paul Kinch had a son called Soweto (now a celebrated saxophonist); Alkebulan because it is said to be the earliest name for Africa; Ekundayo because he liked the sound of the Yoruba name, and discovered it meant \u201cweeping becomes joy\u201d. He started reading literature about black culture and politics, withdrew from the acting world and moved to Manchester, where he dedicated himself to developing his political consciousness. He read up on the history of British imperialism. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said all the literature I read was about loving black culture \u2013 some was derogatory about white people. I just wanted to read stories by black people, about black culture and history.\u201d He had two daughters, who are now in their 20s \u2013 one is a dancer, the other works in the film industry \u2013 and named the oldest Soweto, too. Lennon\u2019s mother continued to call him Anthony, but quietly embraced his African identity. His father, who died in 1999, thought Lennon had lost the plot. \u201cOne of the last conversations I had with Dad was him saying, \u2018As far as I\u2019m concerned you\u2019re white and I think you\u2019ve got an identity problem.\u2019\u201d Some time after changing his name, he met the educational consultant Paul Wilson-Eme, who went on to have a huge influence on him. Wilson-Eme asked him why he had called himself Soweto. Lennon mentioned the obvious: the associations with South Africa, black pride, the uprising. Wilson-Eme asked him if he knew what Soweto meant. \u201cTo my shame I had no answer. Then he filled in the missing gaps \u2013 it stands for South West Township. Then he said, \u2018I love you, my brother, but I think you need to check in with yourself as to why you have named yourself that.\u2019\u201d So he simply became Ekundayo. Then he changed his name legally again, choosing Taharka as a first name. His agent got in touch and said that directors were still keen to hire him, but there was a problem: if he returned to acting as Taharka Ekundayo, there would be too much explaining to do. \u201cShe said, \u2018Why don\u2019t we compromise \u2013 bring Anthony Lennon back, and put Ekundayo in the middle? Casting directors will know it\u2019s the same old Anthony Lennon, but Ekundayo is there out of respect for your ancestry.\u201d And so began his fifth, and happiest, incarnation \u2013 as Anthony Ekundayo Lennon. He returned to the theatre, working largely for black-led companies, and segued from acting to directing. For two decades, he lived easy in his skin \u2013 a man with white parents, unknown African ancestry, and many friends, none of whom questioned his right to be who he said he was. When I ask if he ever considered he might not meet the criteria for the Talawa award, he says no: \u201cTo doubt my eligibility would be akin to doubting my existence.\u201d *** After the story broke, Lennon tells me people pointed at him in public places. I can\u2019t help thinking of the little boy and his mother who were demonised in the streets 50 years ago. \u201cIt was surreal and scary, and the start of many panic attacks and sleepless nights,\u201d he says. His worst childhood memories returned. He says he reached his nadir soon afterwards. \u201cI\u2019m going to be totally up front with you. There\u2019s a little part of me that knows I don\u2019t want to say this next bit, because I worry about what family and friends will think.\u201d He sips from the pint of strawberry and lime lager he\u2019s been nursing for two hours. \u201cI went to a tube station. I took myself to the mouth of the tunnel and looked at the tracks. I just felt I didn\u2019t want any of this any more. I didn\u2019t want the toxicity, the pain, the accusations. I was imagining everything my dad went though, my mum, my brother. I came so close.\u201d In the end, he says, what stopped him was thinking about his mother and his daughters. He sweeps away a tear. \u201cAnd this is a message for anybody else thinking about it: force yourself to think about somebody you love, or who would desperately miss you if you are no longer there. Find a reason not to do it, then don\u2019t. Let the next morning arrive.\u201d He repeats the last sentence, more to himself than to me. \u201cLet the next morning arrive.\u201d He returned to work and saw out his contract at Talawa, which ended a couple of weeks ago. During his final months he mentored young artists, directed a reimagined Othello called Men Are Not Gods, and continued to learn the craft of running a theatre company. It\u2019s been a tough year, but he says Buffong and other staff have always been supportive. In March this year, Lennon was invited to the Globe theatre\u2019s press night for Richard II \u2013 the first all-women-of-colour production of a Shakespeare play in the UK. Despite Talawa\u2019s backing, it was the first major industry event he had attended since the media storm. He says it was an inspiring night \u2013 both the production, and the support from friends. But at the afterparty he struggled. \u201cI noticed a few people who I didn\u2019t know looking over at me, and it was clear I was being whispered about. I felt othered for the first time ever, in a space with a group of artists.\u201d But he says no actor or director has ever challenged him to his face. A couple of months ago, Lennon was verbally attacked by a stranger on the underground. \u201cA black guy came up to me, and said, \u2018You\u2019re a fraud, you\u2019re a thief.\u2019 A couple of people stood between us because they thought he might physically attack me. He was really angry: \u2018You\u2019re that guy in the paper. Why are you pretending?\u2019\u201d Did Lennon defend himself verbally? \u201cNo, because there\u2019s nothing to defend.\u201d By now, he was feeling stronger. Would he have qualms about working for a black-led theatre company in the future? \u201cNo!\u201d He sounds appalled. \u201cI\u2019ll work with anyone who wants to have a conversation with me, anyone who\u2019s interested in telling stories. I\u2019d really like to direct plays, please, and lead a company. That\u2019s why I was put on the artistic directors\u2019 programme in the first place.\u201d I ask him about the news he mentioned when he first called me a couple of months ago. Lennon smiles and whips out an envelope containing the results of an ancestry DNA test he recently took. It shows his genetic makeup, country by country: 46% Irish and Scottish, 22% from England, Wales and north-western Europe. He points me to the last stat: 32% West African. The science of ancestry DNA testing is not infallible, but it feels like a significant result. Does he feel vindicated? \u201cAll it\u2019s done for me is confirmed in data what I\u2019ve always known.\u201d Some time in the future, he will trace those African roots right back through his family. But for now only one thing matters to him \u2013 that they are there. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication). \u2022 This article was amended on 9 September 2019 because an earlier version said that Rachel Dolezal was the former president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in the US.

But unlike many others, he had a get-out-of-jail-free card: an Irish-born grandfather, which meant he could apply for citizenship there and obtain an EU passport.</p> <p>So Gadsdon set about pulling together the sequence of birth and marriage certificates that would be the first step in becoming a fully-fledged Irishman.</p> <p>It\u2019s a two-step process: first, the applicant has to prove Irish heritage and obtain citizenship via the Foreign Births Register.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/07/british-eu-passport-european-brexit\">British and want an EU passport? Here's where you can apply</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then they have to separately apply for an Irish passport. And it\u2019s not cheap \u2013 anyone applying is likely to have to spend nearly \u00a3500 on fees and certificates, but with Britain heading to a crash-out Brexit, Gadsdon thought it was worth it.</p> <p>But two years after he began the process, he is disillusioned. Ireland\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs has cashed his cheques \u2013 but done almost nothing in return.</p> <p>As he says: \u201cI spent a year gathering evidence (birth, marriage, death certificates), along with certified copies of identification, to get dual Irish citizenship through its foreign birth registry, and I haven\u2019t heard a thing since. That was one year ago, and I was told it would take six months.</p> <p>\u201cI know they have been swamped, but I did pay \u20ac278. It\u2019s not so much the application, or the money \u2013 it\u2019s all the documentation that I needed to apply, that I need back. It took around a year to get the 20 or so legal documents in order to start this application.\u201d</p> <p>What irks Gadsdon and some other applicants, is that the Irish authorities cash the payment immediately on receipt of an application, knowing that it won\u2019t be examined for months if not longer.</p> <p>Even when Gadsdon obtains his citizenship, he is likely to face another nine-month wait or longer \u2013 plus the \u20ac80 fee \u2013 to obtain a passport.</p> <p>Tim Minogue, from Lewes, Sussex, shares Gadsdon\u2019s concerns. \u201cI submitted the online form and paid the fee in late September last year, followed up by the notarised copies of my UK passport and the various family birth/death/marriage certificates required.</p> <p>\u201cI received an emailed acknowledgement of receipt of the completed application in October. Since then, not a dickybird.\u201d</p> <p>Minogue says emails to the Irish authorities have not produced replies, while phone calls go unanswered.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the information on the Irish government\u2019s website seems to vary, he says, with some saying that applications will take six months, and others six to nine months. Eleven months on, he\u2019s still waiting. \u201cOf course you have got to be sympathetic as they are obviously dealing with a flood of applications,\u201d says Minogue, who is contemplating retirement in Ireland.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that nothing happens \u2026 on the DFA site there is a phone number, but it either just rings and rings, or it takes you to a recorded message. I sent a polite email but did not receive a reply.\u201d</p> <p>He says he feels in limbo, not knowing if his application has gone astray, if he has sent the correct documentation, or if he will have to re-apply.</p> <p>\u201cI have no way of finding out.

      "bodyText": "Like millions of other British citizens, Paul Gadsdon from Somerset was unhappy with the result of the EU referendum. He values the feeling that he is European, and the freedom to live and work across most of the continent. But unlike many others, he had a get-out-of-jail-free card: an Irish-born grandfather, which meant he could apply for citizenship there and obtain an EU passport. So Gadsdon set about pulling together the sequence of birth and marriage certificates that would be the first step in becoming a fully-fledged Irishman. It\u2019s a two-step process: first, the applicant has to prove Irish heritage and obtain citizenship via the Foreign Births Register. Then they have to separately apply for an Irish passport. And it\u2019s not cheap \u2013 anyone applying is likely to have to spend nearly \u00a3500 on fees and certificates, but with Britain heading to a crash-out Brexit, Gadsdon thought it was worth it. But two years after he began the process, he is disillusioned. Ireland\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs has cashed his cheques \u2013 but done almost nothing in return. As he says: \u201cI spent a year gathering evidence (birth, marriage, death certificates), along with certified copies of identification, to get dual Irish citizenship through its foreign birth registry, and I haven\u2019t heard a thing since. That was one year ago, and I was told it would take six months. \u201cI know they have been swamped, but I did pay \u20ac278. It\u2019s not so much the application, or the money \u2013 it\u2019s all the documentation that I needed to apply, that I need back. It took around a year to get the 20 or so legal documents in order to start this application.\u201d What irks Gadsdon and some other applicants, is that the Irish authorities cash the payment immediately on receipt of an application, knowing that it won\u2019t be examined for months if not longer. Even when Gadsdon obtains his citizenship, he is likely to face another nine-month wait or longer \u2013 plus the \u20ac80 fee \u2013 to obtain a passport. Tim Minogue, from Lewes, Sussex, shares Gadsdon\u2019s concerns. \u201cI submitted the online form and paid the fee in late September last year, followed up by the notarised copies of my UK passport and the various family birth/death/marriage certificates required. \u201cI received an emailed acknowledgement of receipt of the completed application in October. Since then, not a dickybird.\u201d Minogue says emails to the Irish authorities have not produced replies, while phone calls go unanswered. Meanwhile, the information on the Irish government\u2019s website seems to vary, he says, with some saying that applications will take six months, and others six to nine months. Eleven months on, he\u2019s still waiting. \u201cOf course you have got to be sympathetic as they are obviously dealing with a flood of applications,\u201d says Minogue, who is contemplating retirement in Ireland. \u201cIt\u2019s just that nothing happens \u2026 on the DFA site there is a phone number, but it either just rings and rings, or it takes you to a recorded message. I sent a polite email but did not receive a reply.\u201d He says he feels in limbo, not knowing if his application has gone astray, if he has sent the correct documentation, or if he will have to re-apply. \u201cI have no way of finding out. And there will then be another long delay when I can actually apply for a passport,\u201d he says. The Irish authorities told Guardian Money that it has, indeed, been deluged with applications from Britain, but has now created a new team to deal with the rush. The DFA says: \u201cUntil 2016 the number of applications for Foreign Births Registration was relatively low, at approximately 6,000 a year.

      "body": "<p>Watching a day\u2019s filming for the new season of The Crown, I had the dizzying impression that organising a shoot of Winston Churchill\u2019s state funeral must have been only marginally less complex than organising Winston Churchill\u2019s state funeral. On a sunny September day last year there was a cast of 300, many of them in full military costume, and a crew of 250. The congregation was issued with perfect facsimiles of the real order of service used on 30 January 1965. Dozens of people, their functions mysterious, busied themselves in the side aisles: everything was done with hushed precision and respect for instinctively understood hierarchies. Winchester Cathedral was playing St Paul\u2019s, and the director of photography, Adriano Goldman, was keeping his eye on its performance via the puffs of water vapour that were helping create what he called \u201cGod\u2019s light\u201d \u2013 the gleaming shafts lancing down from the clerestory windows.</p> <p>Over and over again, Olivia Colman\u2019s Queen walked down the aisle to her place next to Princess Margaret (Helena Bonham Carter) and Prince Philip (Tobias Menzies). For a few moments, but not much more, it seemed odd to see older actors in place of Claire Foy, Vanessa Kirby and Matt Smith, the much beloved principal cast of The Crown\u2019s first two seasons. As the Queen settled herself into her pew she took an uncertain, sidelong glance at Harold Wilson, channelled rather than played by the chameleon-like Jason Watkins, who has perfected Wilson\u2019s slight stoop of the shoulders and laryngeal voice. The illusion of a tremendously regal, solemn occasion was almost complete, if you overlooked the fact that Bonham Carter and Colman were wearing comfortable slippers rather than polished court shoes between takes.</p> <p>The British sense of intimacy with the real Queen has largely been built through television \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.royal.uk/50-facts-about-queens-coronation-0\" title=\"\">ever since her coronation</a> provoked a rush on TVs in 1953. The makers of The Crown, back when they were pitching it in late 2013 and early 2014, assumed it would end up as a BBC co-production. But it was the upstart streaming service Netflix that offered the writer Peter Morgan, director Stephen Daldry and Left Bank Films chief executive Andy Harries creative freedom and a commission for 20 episodes on the spot \u2013 an act of confidence almost unheard of in the famously dilatory world of TV.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1f082fbbae08be528c544322e0d3afdd2ec0383\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1f082fbbae08be528c544322e0d3afdd2ec0383/0_72_1918_1827/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olivia Colman as the Queen in the Crown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"953\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colman as the Queen: \u2018We always thought it should be Olivia, right from the beginning.

One reason The Crown turned out to be so unexpectedly compelling, given the fact it is about a rather dull family made exceptional only by an accident of birth, is that by and large, it feels right. Even the most punctilious, pedantic British viewer can settle into it without flinching at (too many) historical inaccuracies, or false notes by way of costume, location or language. This is the result of tremendous care enabled by a huge budget of \u00a350m per season (or the cost of around six BBC dramas), and rising. In some years it costs more to make The Crown than it does to fund the real Queen\u2019s sovereign grant \u2013 that is, the income from her estates that she is allocated by the government. (For 2016\u201317, the year The Crown first aired, that grant was \u00a342.8m.) All those expensive efforts I saw in Winchester were cut down to mere seconds of footage for the first episode of season three, which covers the period between Wilson\u2019s election in 1964 and the silver jubilee of 1977.</p> <p>The new season will be a particular test for The Crown\u2019s makers, with its change of principal cast and a group of new young actors to take on Prince Charles, Princess Anne and Camilla Parker Bowles, or Shand, as she then was. To start with, Colman was fitted with blue contact lenses to match her eyes to Foy\u2019s \u2013 something that turned out to be a disastrous move, according to Ben Caron, who directs the first four episodes. It made Colman seem as if \u201cshe was acting behind a mask,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was as if we had taken all of her acting ability and put it in a safe and locked it away.\u201d They tested turning her eyes blue in post-production, using visual effects. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t feel like her. CGI-ing her eyes seemed to diminish what she was doing.\u201d</p> <p>So, disconcertingly perhaps, the middle-aged Queen will have Colman\u2019s deep-brown eyes. There was never any question that it would be her who played the next Queen. The Crown\u2019s casting director Nina Gold told me: \u201cWe always thought it should be Olivia, right from the beginning. The thing everybody loves about Claire was that she transmits her humanity in a very simple, plain, not-doing-anything kind of a way: you just get it. We felt that was exactly the same thing Olivia does. It\u2019s not about looks \u2013 it\u2019s about a quality.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Everything on The Crown begins and ends with its creator, the writer and executive producer Peter Morgan, a slim, serious, dark-haired man of 56 who seems almost to vibrate with energy. The project is his all-consuming passion. \u201cI\u2019ve gone all in on it,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m still here, years in. I cannot believe that I wake up in the morning and I\u2019m still writing this stuff.\u201d He writes weekdays and weekends, sending pages to his closest colleagues as he goes, sometimes several times a day. \u201cThe core producing team live and breathe The Crown on an almost cellular level,\u201d executive producer Suzanne Mackie tells me. Season three is still only the halfway point: six seasons are projected; by the time it finishes, The Crown will have moved all the way from the death of George VI in 1952 to the 2010s. The seasons tend to coincide with prime ministerial terms: next year\u2019s season four, for example, will take the action up to the resignation of Gillian Anderson\u2019s Margaret Thatcher, before another change of cast for the final two series.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Peter might write a massive speech overnight.

Season three, he thought, would be about the Queen\u2019s relationship with Harold Wilson. But I\u2019d say what he has discovered is that it\u2019s actually about Charles. Partly because Josh O\u2019Connor, the actor who plays him, is so astonishingly good.\u201d</p> <p>The team has a phrase to describe the moment when one of the series\u2019 broad themes clicks satisfyingly into place \u2013 the conflict between duty and desire, say, or the anxiety about a son\u2019s fitness to succeed a parent. \u201cPeter might write a massive speech overnight,\u201d says Mackie. \u201cAnd in the morning you read that and think, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s a Crown moment.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Morgan has become the screenwriting equivalent of a historical novelist, someone who has found his groove dramatising the events of the 20th century: The Deal tackled the bargain struck between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown for the Labour leadership; Frost/Nixon took on the famous interviews between the British journalist and the US president. And as with any self-respecting historical novelist, accuracy is important. \u201cWe really, really, really do our best,\u201d Morgan says. \u201cIf we have something on record, if we are conscious of it, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9a59c1b2a57b154428a6f66607eb7471f94cb917\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a59c1b2a57b154428a6f66607eb7471f94cb917/0_179_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Racks of period costumes, including kaftans for Margaret and suits for Anne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Racks of period costumes, including kaftans for Margaret and suits for Anne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Des Willie/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Five historical researchers work from a lair in the basement of Left Bank Pictures\u2019 London offices, where they construct detailed timelines for the principal characters drawn from their library of 500 books, from cabinet papers, and from the National Archives. As the action inches forward, they also have increasing recourse to the living. Edward Millward, the academic and Plaid Cymru politician who found himself language tutor to Prince Charles in 1969, shared his old lecture notes and teaching timetables with the production; the actor playing him, Mark Lewis Jones, wore some of his old ties.</p> <p>That particular episode, co-authored with playwright James Graham (Ink, This House) tells the story of the investiture of Charles as Prince of Wales \u2013 digging out the narrative\u2019s metaphorical content to make it a drama about a young man in search of a role. The metaphor is made literal: Charles is shown playing Richard II in a student production. (You would be right in thinking that the notion of him having played this flawed, sensitive, self-regarding king is too good to be true \u2013 though he did once play Macbeth at school.)</p> <p>Morgan\u2019s work, as he describes it, is to fill out the spaces between the known events, \u201cto join the dots, to find the thread that goes between the pearls,\u201d he says. \u201cI make no apology for the fact that most of the time that\u2019s intuitive. I am doing my best \u2013 I am sober and I am responsible.\u201d At the same time, he says, the audience knows they are \u201cnot watching a documentary. They are not asking Lucian Freud to paint a picture and then judging it by its closeness to reality. They are asking, \u2018What does it stir in me?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"060870fc8c62921a920b3d9f2f9ff95df5472e66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/060870fc8c62921a920b3d9f2f9ff95df5472e66/0_498_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Helena Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret and Ben Daniels as Lord Snowdon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helena Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret and Ben Daniels as Lord Snowdon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Des Willie/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He is well aware of the possibility of his fiction\u2019s being mistaken for fact \u2013 even of his made-up accounts shading into the factual record. He has seen it happen. In the 2006 film The Queen, Morgan invented a scene depicting Blair\u2019s first private audience. In 2010, Blair published his autobiography. When Morgan came to read the ex-prime minister\u2019s account of that same moment, \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018Hang on, that\u2019s dialogue I wrote, that I didn\u2019t get from him \u2013 so either I fluked it, clairvoyantly, or he was blurring the facts of his own memory with my fiction.\u2019\u201d I looked it up, and Morgan is right: the encounter described in A Journey feels remarkably similar in tone and shape to the scene in the film. Morgan argues that the relationship \u201cbetween history, narrative, fact and fiction [is] so much more fluid and unreliable, but also more interesting, than anyone imagines\u201d. </p> <p>***</p> <p>At Elstree Studios, the world of The Crown presents itself as a confounding, impossible geography. The backlot, which I visited in December, includes a set of carefully re-created Buckingham Palace gates, their lamps bought from the makers who supply the real palace. Beside it stands the facade of 10 Downing Street, but a truncated version; there are no upper storeys. Over the way is Aberfan village school, and a row of Glamorgan cottages, for an episode turning on the terrible disaster of 1966, when 144 people, most of them children, were killed by a collapsing coal tip.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Colman\u2019s route to her character is instinctive. 'I can feel bogged down and panicky if I do too much research'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nearby are the costume workshops, where designer Amy Roberts and her deputy, Sidonie Roberts, preside over Margaret\u2019s 1970s kaftans, and a nifty suit for Geraldine Chaplin\u2019s Duchess of Windsor. The back wall of their office is covered in images of the royals. For the memorable state occasions they re-create real outfits: the lemon ensemble the Queen wore for Prince Charles\u2019s investiture with its curious, helmet-like headgear. Otherwise, it is a question of internalising and then playing with the royals\u2019 style. \u201cThe Queen Mum gets stuck,\u201d Sidonie Roberts says. \u201cShe\u2019s found a shape \u2013 it\u2019s a bit like a fluffy loo-roll holder \u2013 and she\u2019s sticking with it.\u201d Princess Anne, surprisingly chic in the late 60s, was much more fun. Roberts shows me a silk jacquard outfit in apricot and lemon for a queenly hospital visit, beautifully made, and likely to be in shot for mere seconds. \u201cIt\u2019ll be spit and cough and then it\u2019s all over.\u201d</p> <p>The obsessive pursuit of detail is visible everywhere you look. One morning in June I join a meeting between director Ben Caron, the show\u2019s visual effects supervisor Ben Turner, and employees of a VFX company in London: a good 15 minutes are spent discussing the artificially created view that will be briefly glimpsed from the window of the Queen\u2019s plane as she flies over the Welsh valleys, after her visit to Aberfan. Are the scudding clouds moving at the right speed? Could the slag heaps be better defined, to look more like slag heaps? What about dropping an extra village into the background? Should there be a couple of twinkling lights? The emphasis is on getting the landscape to echo, very precisely, the mood; Caron uses the phrase \u201cpathetic fallacy\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"483fc8c0ad6f73a5528744f79549f1e745f9da98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/483fc8c0ad6f73a5528744f79549f1e745f9da98/0_234_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The investiture of Prince Charles, played by Josh O\u2019Connor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The investiture of Prince Charles, played by Josh O\u2019Connor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Des Willie/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On another occasion, last December, Cate Hall, the hair and makeup designer, shows me the almost excessive care she has taken to assemble historical sources for her work. In her trailer at Wrotham Park, she leafs through the \u201cbibles\u201d she had made \u2013 photographic scrapbooks showing the month-by-month changes in the real characters\u2019 hairstyles. \u201cI was a bit worried I\u2019d treated the Crown like a GCSE art project and everyone would think I was mad,\u201d she tells me. But despite the minuteness of the research, her aim was not verisimilitude \u2013 Bonham Carter, for example, does not look much like Princess Margaret, nor ever will \u2013 but about allowing a performance to take place. \u201cThere\u2019s an instinct and a moment when the character arrives. When she feels \u2018Margarety\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Bonham Carter researched her role voraciously: she read everything she could lay her hands on, met Princess Margaret\u2019s former hairdresser, who had kept a lock of her hair (\u201cthat was a bit weird\u201d), and spoke to her friends \u2013 including the princess\u2019s lover in the 70s, Roddy Llewellyn, a character in season three. \u201cI consulted my aunt, who is a graphologist. And I did see a medium, sort of jokingly, about something else. And the medium said, \u2018Oh yes, Margaret\u2019s here, fingering her pearls.\u2019\u201d She was trying to find the princess\u2019s essence, she tells me. \u201cI went around trying to bottle her.\u201d</p> <p>Josh O\u2019Connor, a wide-smiling, disarmingly enthusiastic young man who gives a remarkable performance as a volatile, emotionally immature Charles, spent a lot of time watching old footage, noting the prince\u2019s body language and verbal tics, he tells me over coffee. He noticed, for example, that every time Charles gets out of a car, his right hand will go to each cuff, then to his breast pocket, and from there into a wave. He demonstrates: the effect is instant and uncanny. Eventually, though, \u201cI realised I had to let go of this person who exists \u2013 or just take aspects of him so that people feel safe \u2013 and focus on the idea of a young man. A young man who is waiting for his mother to die for his life to have meaning.\u201d</p> <p>Then there was the added complication, for the older principal actors, of dealing with not just their real avatars, but their predecessors in the role. \u201cThat was the hardest bit,\u201d Colman tells me. \u201cFor months I tried to imagine how Claire [Foy] would do it. Richard III can be played by 1,000 different actors, but she is in everyone\u2019s immediate memory.\u201d Unlike Bonham Carter, Colman\u2019s route to her character is, in the end, instinctive. \u201cI can feel bogged down and panicky and a bit giggly if I do too much research.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"86805bb4a03665197e57d42ab374d1a46667e039\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86805bb4a03665197e57d42ab374d1a46667e039/0_101_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olivia Colman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colman as the Queen: \u2018A very average mortal woman raised up into a goddess\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophie Mutevelian/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her Queen is a mother who finds it hard to connect with her son and heir apparent. \u201cShe is trying to get someone who is completely ill-prepared to do what he doesn\u2019t want to do, and what she didn\u2019t want to do either,\u201d Colman says. All of this is somehow projected with minimal means, the reverse of her recent, Oscar-winning performance as another royal, Queen Anne in The Favourite \u2013 \u201clying on the floor, screaming and hitting people\u201d. She summons up Elizabeth in her full midlife Gloriana phase: more assured, chillier than Foy\u2019s uncertain monarch.</p> <p>***</p> <p>In February 2013, The Audience, a new play by Peter Morgan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/05/the-audience-review-helen-mirren\" title=\"\">premiered at the Gielgud Theatre in London</a>. Its central idea was the weekly conversation between the Queen and the prime minister \u2013 those confidential, unminuted meetings between the head of state and its elected leader, between the monarch and a changing cast of prime ministers which seemed to say something deeply resonant about Britain itself. (There have been 14 premiers since Elizabeth II\u2019s accession in 1952, eight of whom she has outlived; until recently, the screensaver on Morgan\u2019s computer was a 1985 photograph of her surrounded by the survivors.) The Queen, as a line in the play has it, provided \u201can unbroken line, the constant presence\u201d around which a story could be fleshed out.</p> <p>From this non-linear, non-realist play came the stately march through time that is The Crown. But while whole scenes from The Audience crop up in The Crown, Morgan\u2019s story is no longer about an encounter, but about a country. The backdrop of history gives the show the epic sweep and magnificence that are so essential to its enjoyment: early seasons had Suez and the Profumo affair; series three will have the moon landings and the devaluation of the pound. It\u2019s a very particular kind of history, though, seen entirely through the eyes of its principal characters. This is a world in which the prime minister barely enters parliament; a world in which the three-day week and electricity shortages of the early 70s are shown by a palace lit by twinkling candles.</p> <p>The Crown is not the place to come if you are looking for a critique of the British monarchy. It is a curious experience, being drawn into the show as someone who objects to inherited privilege and the shameful trappings of empire. The show\u2019s charismatic actors humanise its characters, taking our attention away from the structural context. The screenplay can also lighten the bleakness of real events; the compelling episode about Prince Charles\u2019s investiture does not show us the real bombs that exploded in Wales in protest at the arrival of the English imperialist oppressor. Season three is set in an era of counterculture, of grassroots political ferment \u2013 but this barely registers, beyond Princess Margaret\u2019s forays into posh bohemianism. The world of The Crown is burnished, a brighter version of the real, just as Mad Men was a more perfect, gleaming version of office life in 1960s New York. I watched parts of The Crown while reading The Quest For Queen Mary \u2013 a volume of notes James Pope-Hennessy made in the early 1950s while working on the official biography of the Queen\u2019s grandmother. Visiting Balmoral, Pope-Hennessy notices yellow patches on the carpet \u2013 and immediately realises that they are piss stains, courtesy of the royal Corgis. There are no piss-stained carpets in The Crown.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a1335a484c83761873babc42a13ed44d388d6c36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1335a484c83761873babc42a13ed44d388d6c36/0_427_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On set with Helena Bonham Carter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On set with Helena Bonham Carter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Des Willie/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Caron tells me that his earliest, 90-minute cut of the Aberfan episode \u2013 with its profoundly affecting material about a mining community turned upside down by an unspeakable tragedy \u2013 \u201cwas like a Ken Loach film\u201d. It was, of course, re-edited: social-realism wasn\u2019t the point at all. However respectful the makers were determined to be to the people of Aberfan, the point was to tell a story about the Queen and the crown.</p> <p>Visiting the shoots at Winchester and Wrotham Park, I meet a man whom everyone on the show calls \u201cMajor David\u201d, a nattily dressed figure in tweeds and a tie. David Rankin-Hunt, CVO MBE KCN TD, is The Crown\u2019s dispenser of wisdom on matters royal, including bowing and curtseying and the fact that the Queen would never, ever say \u201ccheers\u201d when raising her glass (she would say absolutely nothing). Rankin-Hunt knows about protocol because he has lived it: he spent 33 years working in the royal household organising, among other things, state funerals. He also occupies a post called the Norfolk Herald Extraordinary and can be seen processing in medieval finery on royal occasions. \u201cBefore taking up the role on The Crown I was anxious to get the approval of the Palace,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWhich I obtained.\u201d</p> <p>He has no idea whether the Queen watches the show, though he says he is sure that other family members do. \u201cVery senior members of the royal household have said to me, \u2018Oh, we love The Crown.\u2019 If there were some indication from on high that it was some kind of scandalous production, that might be reflected in their view, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71022363e274c6741cfd834cc86cb8d5b0098d11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71022363e274c6741cfd834cc86cb8d5b0098d11/750_185_4520_2926/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Crown\u2019s creator Peter Morgan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"647\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Creator Peter Morgan: \u2018I am dealing with archetypes that are more suitable to Greek tragedy.\u2019 Photograph: Camera Press</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Mangione/CAMERA PRESS/APA-PictureDesk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As far as Morgan is concerned, The Crown is not really about the royal family on any fundamental level. \u201cI am dealing with archetypes that are more suitable to Greek tragedy,\u201d he tells me. \u201cFathers and mothers, gods and goddesses, mothers and sons. Betrayals. The fact that we raise up a very average mortal woman into a goddess.\u201d</p> <p>It is the drama that is the point, not the monarchy, Caron argues. \u201cI don\u2019t think the mafia is a great thing. Nor do lots of people. But lots of people watch The Sopranos because they are fascinated by Tony Soprano and his family relationships, and because the stakes in the story are massive.\u201d (As it happens, The Crown has been repeatedly compared to a mafia drama in which the Queen is at first a reluctant, then a ruthless capo at the head of a hierarchical family structure.)</p> <p>And yet: Morgan\u2019s characters are not the fictional Soprano family, nor characters from Greek myth, but real and (mostly) living people. It is a measure of The Crown\u2019s proximity to the crown that, Morgan tells me, he meets members of the royal household four times a year \u2013 \u201cpeople who are very high-ranking and very active within the organisation\u201d \u2013 and, \u201crespectfully, I tell them what I have in mind, and they brace themselves slightly\u201d. But only slightly.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The royal family presents itself as a kind of prefabricated national fiction. The make-believe of monarchy may be of the institution\u2019s own making \u2013 the smoke and mirrors of ritual and ceremony \u2013 or it may be moulded by the media. \u201cIt is riveting how much inventiveness exists. People create scenarios and write scripts for strange almost-plays,\u201d Prince Charles once told his biographer, Jonathan Dimbleby.</p> <p>The royal family has been fictionalised countless times: there is Sue Townsend\u2019s The Queen And I, which imagines the royal family living on a council estate; or Alan Bennett\u2019s The Uncommon Reader, in which the Queen becomes a voracious consumer of novels. Or his play A Question Of Attribution, about an imaginary encounter between the monarch and Anthony Blunt, the surveyor of the Queen\u2019s pictures and a KGB spy. Almost every British fictional treatment of the royals sits on a spectrum between gentle humour and biting satire. The Crown is different: it is not funny.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>O\u2019Connor will do Charles 'so much good', Bonham Carter predicts.

But I\u2019m not remotely interested in that. I\u2019m constantly trying to steer it in the other direction \u2013 towards something heroic.\u201d</p> <p>Treating the characters satirically would be like playing the piano with only one hand, he says. \u201cBut if you dare to take them and their predicaments more seriously and dare to see them within a tradition of a different kind of drama, in which you explore the complexity of their internal lives, and their struggle against what is expected, and the fact that their smallest steps can have national or international consequences, then suddenly you open up the possibilities of playing the piano with two, or even four hands, and with all of that tonal range.\u201d</p> <p>This is despite Morgan\u2019s own encounters with the real-life ridiculousness of royal pomp, which he witnessed firsthand in 2016 when he received a CBE from Prince Charles. \u201cI spent my whole time giggling,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were grown men with spurs and breastplates wandering around and talking to each other seriously.

It\u2019s so interesting, the interplay of this series with reality, as PR.\u201d Morgan tells me, too, that Tobias Menzies\u2019 performance \u201cwill do a lot of good for Prince Philip. Because Prince Philip is not considered a complex person.\u201d The Crown is \u201cspiky \u2013 it punches and pokes and digs at the royal family, it doesn\u2019t hug them,\u201d Morgan says. But nor does it put them on trial. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to slightly spare their dignity.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m no monarchist, but at times I have felt, over the past two or three years, that the Queen is the only thing holding this country together, even as the current prime minister attempts to manipulate the constitution for his own ends. The traditional royal virtues \u2013 dullness, stability \u2013 have their appeal, despite everything.

      "bodyText": "Watching a day\u2019s filming for the new season of The Crown, I had the dizzying impression that organising a shoot of Winston Churchill\u2019s state funeral must have been only marginally less complex than organising Winston Churchill\u2019s state funeral. On a sunny September day last year there was a cast of 300, many of them in full military costume, and a crew of 250. The congregation was issued with perfect facsimiles of the real order of service used on 30 January 1965. Dozens of people, their functions mysterious, busied themselves in the side aisles: everything was done with hushed precision and respect for instinctively understood hierarchies. Winchester Cathedral was playing St Paul\u2019s, and the director of photography, Adriano Goldman, was keeping his eye on its performance via the puffs of water vapour that were helping create what he called \u201cGod\u2019s light\u201d \u2013 the gleaming shafts lancing down from the clerestory windows. Over and over again, Olivia Colman\u2019s Queen walked down the aisle to her place next to Princess Margaret (Helena Bonham Carter) and Prince Philip (Tobias Menzies). For a few moments, but not much more, it seemed odd to see older actors in place of Claire Foy, Vanessa Kirby and Matt Smith, the much beloved principal cast of The Crown\u2019s first two seasons. As the Queen settled herself into her pew she took an uncertain, sidelong glance at Harold Wilson, channelled rather than played by the chameleon-like Jason Watkins, who has perfected Wilson\u2019s slight stoop of the shoulders and laryngeal voice. The illusion of a tremendously regal, solemn occasion was almost complete, if you overlooked the fact that Bonham Carter and Colman were wearing comfortable slippers rather than polished court shoes between takes. The British sense of intimacy with the real Queen has largely been built through television \u2013 ever since her coronation provoked a rush on TVs in 1953. The makers of The Crown, back when they were pitching it in late 2013 and early 2014, assumed it would end up as a BBC co-production. But it was the upstart streaming service Netflix that offered the writer Peter Morgan, director Stephen Daldry and Left Bank Films chief executive Andy Harries creative freedom and a commission for 20 episodes on the spot \u2013 an act of confidence almost unheard of in the famously dilatory world of TV. And then there were Netflix\u2019s resources. One reason The Crown turned out to be so unexpectedly compelling, given the fact it is about a rather dull family made exceptional only by an accident of birth, is that by and large, it feels right. Even the most punctilious, pedantic British viewer can settle into it without flinching at (too many) historical inaccuracies, or false notes by way of costume, location or language. This is the result of tremendous care enabled by a huge budget of \u00a350m per season (or the cost of around six BBC dramas), and rising. In some years it costs more to make The Crown than it does to fund the real Queen\u2019s sovereign grant \u2013 that is, the income from her estates that she is allocated by the government. (For 2016\u201317, the year The Crown first aired, that grant was \u00a342.8m.) All those expensive efforts I saw in Winchester were cut down to mere seconds of footage for the first episode of season three, which covers the period between Wilson\u2019s election in 1964 and the silver jubilee of 1977. The new season will be a particular test for The Crown\u2019s makers, with its change of principal cast and a group of new young actors to take on Prince Charles, Princess Anne and Camilla Parker Bowles, or Shand, as she then was. To start with, Colman was fitted with blue contact lenses to match her eyes to Foy\u2019s \u2013 something that turned out to be a disastrous move, according to Ben Caron, who directs the first four episodes. It made Colman seem as if \u201cshe was acting behind a mask,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was as if we had taken all of her acting ability and put it in a safe and locked it away.\u201d They tested turning her eyes blue in post-production, using visual effects. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t feel like her. CGI-ing her eyes seemed to diminish what she was doing.\u201d So, disconcertingly perhaps, the middle-aged Queen will have Colman\u2019s deep-brown eyes. There was never any question that it would be her who played the next Queen. The Crown\u2019s casting director Nina Gold told me: \u201cWe always thought it should be Olivia, right from the beginning. The thing everybody loves about Claire was that she transmits her humanity in a very simple, plain, not-doing-anything kind of a way: you just get it. We felt that was exactly the same thing Olivia does. It\u2019s not about looks \u2013 it\u2019s about a quality.\u201d *** Everything on The Crown begins and ends with its creator, the writer and executive producer Peter Morgan, a slim, serious, dark-haired man of 56 who seems almost to vibrate with energy. The project is his all-consuming passion. \u201cI\u2019ve gone all in on it,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m still here, years in. I cannot believe that I wake up in the morning and I\u2019m still writing this stuff.\u201d He writes weekdays and weekends, sending pages to his closest colleagues as he goes, sometimes several times a day. \u201cThe core producing team live and breathe The Crown on an almost cellular level,\u201d executive producer Suzanne Mackie tells me. Season three is still only the halfway point: six seasons are projected; by the time it finishes, The Crown will have moved all the way from the death of George VI in 1952 to the 2010s. The seasons tend to coincide with prime ministerial terms: next year\u2019s season four, for example, will take the action up to the resignation of Gillian Anderson\u2019s Margaret Thatcher, before another change of cast for the final two series. A small group of trusted producers and script executives assembles at Morgan\u2019s home in central London around three times a week.\u201cWe read the scripts aloud as a team, which is hilarious, as we\u2019re all so bad,\u201d Mackie says. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll stop and say, \u2018That doesn\u2019t feel true, that feels wrong.\u2019\u201d After these \u201ctable reads\u201d Morgan refines and reworks, or the direction of travel might change mid-flow. \u201cPeter felt season one was about her, the princess becoming the reluctant queen,\u201d Mackie says. \u201cSeason two was about them, the Queen and Philip. Season three, he thought, would be about the Queen\u2019s relationship with Harold Wilson. But I\u2019d say what he has discovered is that it\u2019s actually about Charles. Partly because Josh O\u2019Connor, the actor who plays him, is so astonishingly good.\u201d The team has a phrase to describe the moment when one of the series\u2019 broad themes clicks satisfyingly into place \u2013 the conflict between duty and desire, say, or the anxiety about a son\u2019s fitness to succeed a parent. \u201cPeter might write a massive speech overnight,\u201d says Mackie. \u201cAnd in the morning you read that and think, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s a Crown moment.\u2019\u201d Morgan has become the screenwriting equivalent of a historical novelist, someone who has found his groove dramatising the events of the 20th century: The Deal tackled the bargain struck between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown for the Labour leadership; Frost/Nixon took on the famous interviews between the British journalist and the US president. And as with any self-respecting historical novelist, accuracy is important. \u201cWe really, really, really do our best,\u201d Morgan says. \u201cIf we have something on record, if we are conscious of it, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Five historical researchers work from a lair in the basement of Left Bank Pictures\u2019 London offices, where they construct detailed timelines for the principal characters drawn from their library of 500 books, from cabinet papers, and from the National Archives. As the action inches forward, they also have increasing recourse to the living. Edward Millward, the academic and Plaid Cymru politician who found himself language tutor to Prince Charles in 1969, shared his old lecture notes and teaching timetables with the production; the actor playing him, Mark Lewis Jones, wore some of his old ties. That particular episode, co-authored with playwright James Graham (Ink, This House) tells the story of the investiture of Charles as Prince of Wales \u2013 digging out the narrative\u2019s metaphorical content to make it a drama about a young man in search of a role. The metaphor is made literal: Charles is shown playing Richard II in a student production. (You would be right in thinking that the notion of him having played this flawed, sensitive, self-regarding king is too good to be true \u2013 though he did once play Macbeth at school.) Morgan\u2019s work, as he describes it, is to fill out the spaces between the known events, \u201cto join the dots, to find the thread that goes between the pearls,\u201d he says. \u201cI make no apology for the fact that most of the time that\u2019s intuitive. I am doing my best \u2013 I am sober and I am responsible.\u201d At the same time, he says, the audience knows they are \u201cnot watching a documentary. They are not asking Lucian Freud to paint a picture and then judging it by its closeness to reality. They are asking, \u2018What does it stir in me?\u2019\u201d He is well aware of the possibility of his fiction\u2019s being mistaken for fact \u2013 even of his made-up accounts shading into the factual record. He has seen it happen. In the 2006 film The Queen, Morgan invented a scene depicting Blair\u2019s first private audience. In 2010, Blair published his autobiography. When Morgan came to read the ex-prime minister\u2019s account of that same moment, \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018Hang on, that\u2019s dialogue I wrote, that I didn\u2019t get from him \u2013 so either I fluked it, clairvoyantly, or he was blurring the facts of his own memory with my fiction.\u2019\u201d I looked it up, and Morgan is right: the encounter described in A Journey feels remarkably similar in tone and shape to the scene in the film. Morgan argues that the relationship \u201cbetween history, narrative, fact and fiction [is] so much more fluid and unreliable, but also more interesting, than anyone imagines\u201d. *** At Elstree Studios, the world of The Crown presents itself as a confounding, impossible geography. The backlot, which I visited in December, includes a set of carefully re-created Buckingham Palace gates, their lamps bought from the makers who supply the real palace. Beside it stands the facade of 10 Downing Street, but a truncated version; there are no upper storeys. Over the way is Aberfan village school, and a row of Glamorgan cottages, for an episode turning on the terrible disaster of 1966, when 144 people, most of them children, were killed by a collapsing coal tip. Nearby are the costume workshops, where designer Amy Roberts and her deputy, Sidonie Roberts, preside over Margaret\u2019s 1970s kaftans, and a nifty suit for Geraldine Chaplin\u2019s Duchess of Windsor. The back wall of their office is covered in images of the royals. For the memorable state occasions they re-create real outfits: the lemon ensemble the Queen wore for Prince Charles\u2019s investiture with its curious, helmet-like headgear. Otherwise, it is a question of internalising and then playing with the royals\u2019 style. \u201cThe Queen Mum gets stuck,\u201d Sidonie Roberts says. \u201cShe\u2019s found a shape \u2013 it\u2019s a bit like a fluffy loo-roll holder \u2013 and she\u2019s sticking with it.\u201d Princess Anne, surprisingly chic in the late 60s, was much more fun. Roberts shows me a silk jacquard outfit in apricot and lemon for a queenly hospital visit, beautifully made, and likely to be in shot for mere seconds. \u201cIt\u2019ll be spit and cough and then it\u2019s all over.\u201d The obsessive pursuit of detail is visible everywhere you look. One morning in June I join a meeting between director Ben Caron, the show\u2019s visual effects supervisor Ben Turner, and employees of a VFX company in London: a good 15 minutes are spent discussing the artificially created view that will be briefly glimpsed from the window of the Queen\u2019s plane as she flies over the Welsh valleys, after her visit to Aberfan. Are the scudding clouds moving at the right speed? Could the slag heaps be better defined, to look more like slag heaps? What about dropping an extra village into the background? Should there be a couple of twinkling lights? The emphasis is on getting the landscape to echo, very precisely, the mood; Caron uses the phrase \u201cpathetic fallacy\u201d. On another occasion, last December, Cate Hall, the hair and makeup designer, shows me the almost excessive care she has taken to assemble historical sources for her work. In her trailer at Wrotham Park, she leafs through the \u201cbibles\u201d she had made \u2013 photographic scrapbooks showing the month-by-month changes in the real characters\u2019 hairstyles. \u201cI was a bit worried I\u2019d treated the Crown like a GCSE art project and everyone would think I was mad,\u201d she tells me. But despite the minuteness of the research, her aim was not verisimilitude \u2013 Bonham Carter, for example, does not look much like Princess Margaret, nor ever will \u2013 but about allowing a performance to take place. \u201cThere\u2019s an instinct and a moment when the character arrives. When she feels \u2018Margarety\u2019.\u201d Bonham Carter researched her role voraciously: she read everything she could lay her hands on, met Princess Margaret\u2019s former hairdresser, who had kept a lock of her hair (\u201cthat was a bit weird\u201d), and spoke to her friends \u2013 including the princess\u2019s lover in the 70s, Roddy Llewellyn, a character in season three. \u201cI consulted my aunt, who is a graphologist. And I did see a medium, sort of jokingly, about something else. And the medium said, \u2018Oh yes, Margaret\u2019s here, fingering her pearls.\u2019\u201d She was trying to find the princess\u2019s essence, she tells me. \u201cI went around trying to bottle her.\u201d Josh O\u2019Connor, a wide-smiling, disarmingly enthusiastic young man who gives a remarkable performance as a volatile, emotionally immature Charles, spent a lot of time watching old footage, noting the prince\u2019s body language and verbal tics, he tells me over coffee. He noticed, for example, that every time Charles gets out of a car, his right hand will go to each cuff, then to his breast pocket, and from there into a wave. He demonstrates: the effect is instant and uncanny. Eventually, though, \u201cI realised I had to let go of this person who exists \u2013 or just take aspects of him so that people feel safe \u2013 and focus on the idea of a young man. A young man who is waiting for his mother to die for his life to have meaning.\u201d Then there was the added complication, for the older principal actors, of dealing with not just their real avatars, but their predecessors in the role. \u201cThat was the hardest bit,\u201d Colman tells me. \u201cFor months I tried to imagine how Claire [Foy] would do it. Richard III can be played by 1,000 different actors, but she is in everyone\u2019s immediate memory.\u201d Unlike Bonham Carter, Colman\u2019s route to her character is, in the end, instinctive. \u201cI can feel bogged down and panicky and a bit giggly if I do too much research.\u201d Her Queen is a mother who finds it hard to connect with her son and heir apparent. \u201cShe is trying to get someone who is completely ill-prepared to do what he doesn\u2019t want to do, and what she didn\u2019t want to do either,\u201d Colman says. All of this is somehow projected with minimal means, the reverse of her recent, Oscar-winning performance as another royal, Queen Anne in The Favourite \u2013 \u201clying on the floor, screaming and hitting people\u201d. She summons up Elizabeth in her full midlife Gloriana phase: more assured, chillier than Foy\u2019s uncertain monarch. *** In February 2013, The Audience, a new play by Peter Morgan, premiered at the Gielgud Theatre in London. Its central idea was the weekly conversation between the Queen and the prime minister \u2013 those confidential, unminuted meetings between the head of state and its elected leader, between the monarch and a changing cast of prime ministers which seemed to say something deeply resonant about Britain itself. (There have been 14 premiers since Elizabeth II\u2019s accession in 1952, eight of whom she has outlived; until recently, the screensaver on Morgan\u2019s computer was a 1985 photograph of her surrounded by the survivors.) The Queen, as a line in the play has it, provided \u201can unbroken line, the constant presence\u201d around which a story could be fleshed out. From this non-linear, non-realist play came the stately march through time that is The Crown. But while whole scenes from The Audience crop up in The Crown, Morgan\u2019s story is no longer about an encounter, but about a country. The backdrop of history gives the show the epic sweep and magnificence that are so essential to its enjoyment: early seasons had Suez and the Profumo affair; series three will have the moon landings and the devaluation of the pound. It\u2019s a very particular kind of history, though, seen entirely through the eyes of its principal characters. This is a world in which the prime minister barely enters parliament; a world in which the three-day week and electricity shortages of the early 70s are shown by a palace lit by twinkling candles. The Crown is not the place to come if you are looking for a critique of the British monarchy. It is a curious experience, being drawn into the show as someone who objects to inherited privilege and the shameful trappings of empire. The show\u2019s charismatic actors humanise its characters, taking our attention away from the structural context. The screenplay can also lighten the bleakness of real events; the compelling episode about Prince Charles\u2019s investiture does not show us the real bombs that exploded in Wales in protest at the arrival of the English imperialist oppressor. Season three is set in an era of counterculture, of grassroots political ferment \u2013 but this barely registers, beyond Princess Margaret\u2019s forays into posh bohemianism. The world of The Crown is burnished, a brighter version of the real, just as Mad Men was a more perfect, gleaming version of office life in 1960s New York. I watched parts of The Crown while reading The Quest For Queen Mary \u2013 a volume of notes James Pope-Hennessy made in the early 1950s while working on the official biography of the Queen\u2019s grandmother. Visiting Balmoral, Pope-Hennessy notices yellow patches on the carpet \u2013 and immediately realises that they are piss stains, courtesy of the royal Corgis. There are no piss-stained carpets in The Crown. Caron tells me that his earliest, 90-minute cut of the Aberfan episode \u2013 with its profoundly affecting material about a mining community turned upside down by an unspeakable tragedy \u2013 \u201cwas like a Ken Loach film\u201d. It was, of course, re-edited: social-realism wasn\u2019t the point at all. However respectful the makers were determined to be to the people of Aberfan, the point was to tell a story about the Queen and the crown. Visiting the shoots at Winchester and Wrotham Park, I meet a man whom everyone on the show calls \u201cMajor David\u201d, a nattily dressed figure in tweeds and a tie. David Rankin-Hunt, CVO MBE KCN TD, is The Crown\u2019s dispenser of wisdom on matters royal, including bowing and curtseying and the fact that the Queen would never, ever say \u201ccheers\u201d when raising her glass (she would say absolutely nothing). Rankin-Hunt knows about protocol because he has lived it: he spent 33 years working in the royal household organising, among other things, state funerals. He also occupies a post called the Norfolk Herald Extraordinary and can be seen processing in medieval finery on royal occasions. \u201cBefore taking up the role on The Crown I was anxious to get the approval of the Palace,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWhich I obtained.\u201d He has no idea whether the Queen watches the show, though he says he is sure that other family members do. \u201cVery senior members of the royal household have said to me, \u2018Oh, we love The Crown.\u2019 If there were some indication from on high that it was some kind of scandalous production, that might be reflected in their view, don\u2019t you think?\u201d As far as Morgan is concerned, The Crown is not really about the royal family on any fundamental level. \u201cI am dealing with archetypes that are more suitable to Greek tragedy,\u201d he tells me. \u201cFathers and mothers, gods and goddesses, mothers and sons. Betrayals. The fact that we raise up a very average mortal woman into a goddess.\u201d It is the drama that is the point, not the monarchy, Caron argues. \u201cI don\u2019t think the mafia is a great thing. Nor do lots of people. But lots of people watch The Sopranos because they are fascinated by Tony Soprano and his family relationships, and because the stakes in the story are massive.\u201d (As it happens, The Crown has been repeatedly compared to a mafia drama in which the Queen is at first a reluctant, then a ruthless capo at the head of a hierarchical family structure.) And yet: Morgan\u2019s characters are not the fictional Soprano family, nor characters from Greek myth, but real and (mostly) living people. It is a measure of The Crown\u2019s proximity to the crown that, Morgan tells me, he meets members of the royal household four times a year \u2013 \u201cpeople who are very high-ranking and very active within the organisation\u201d \u2013 and, \u201crespectfully, I tell them what I have in mind, and they brace themselves slightly\u201d. But only slightly. *** The royal family presents itself as a kind of prefabricated national fiction. The make-believe of monarchy may be of the institution\u2019s own making \u2013 the smoke and mirrors of ritual and ceremony \u2013 or it may be moulded by the media. \u201cIt is riveting how much inventiveness exists. People create scenarios and write scripts for strange almost-plays,\u201d Prince Charles once told his biographer, Jonathan Dimbleby. The royal family has been fictionalised countless times: there is Sue Townsend\u2019s The Queen And I, which imagines the royal family living on a council estate; or Alan Bennett\u2019s The Uncommon Reader, in which the Queen becomes a voracious consumer of novels. Or his play A Question Of Attribution, about an imaginary encounter between the monarch and Anthony Blunt, the surveyor of the Queen\u2019s pictures and a KGB spy. Almost every British fictional treatment of the royals sits on a spectrum between gentle humour and biting satire. The Crown is different: it is not funny. \u201cYou know when you get a supermarket trolley that veers to one side, because its wheels aren\u2019t right?\u201d Morgan says. \u201cThe wheels on this show want it to do satire, which is what we love doing with our political leaders and royals. But I\u2019m not remotely interested in that. I\u2019m constantly trying to steer it in the other direction \u2013 towards something heroic.\u201d Treating the characters satirically would be like playing the piano with only one hand, he says. \u201cBut if you dare to take them and their predicaments more seriously and dare to see them within a tradition of a different kind of drama, in which you explore the complexity of their internal lives, and their struggle against what is expected, and the fact that their smallest steps can have national or international consequences, then suddenly you open up the possibilities of playing the piano with two, or even four hands, and with all of that tonal range.\u201d This is despite Morgan\u2019s own encounters with the real-life ridiculousness of royal pomp, which he witnessed firsthand in 2016 when he received a CBE from Prince Charles. \u201cI spent my whole time giggling,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were grown men with spurs and breastplates wandering around and talking to each other seriously. It was beyond a theme park.\u201d In this royal world of fictions and theme parks, where \u201creality\u201d is strangely elusive, The Crown, which is not a \u201cstrange almost-play\u201d but a particularly skilful and highly polished drama, cannot help but affect the way that the royal family is seen. The more the actors imbue their characters with intriguing, flawed complexity, the more charismatic and attractive they make their real counterparts appear. O\u2019Connor \u201cis going to do Charles so much good\u201d, Bonham Carter predicts. \u201cHe\u2019s got so much charm and sensitivity. It\u2019s so interesting, the interplay of this series with reality, as PR.\u201d Morgan tells me, too, that Tobias Menzies\u2019 performance \u201cwill do a lot of good for Prince Philip. Because Prince Philip is not considered a complex person.\u201d The Crown is \u201cspiky \u2013 it punches and pokes and digs at the royal family, it doesn\u2019t hug them,\u201d Morgan says. But nor does it put them on trial. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to slightly spare their dignity.\u201d I\u2019m no monarchist, but at times I have felt, over the past two or three years, that the Queen is the only thing holding this country together, even as the current prime minister attempts to manipulate the constitution for his own ends. The traditional royal virtues \u2013 dullness, stability \u2013 have their appeal, despite everything. When Britain is a confusing and fragmented place, The Crown\u2019s stately, touching progress is deeply reassuring: it goes on and on, just as the Queen has done for the lifetimes of nearly all of us. With its tragic, larger-than-life characters, The Crown represents a fading dream of something that never quite existed. It is also a kind of talisman against Elizabeth\u2019s death. As Colman tells me, \u201cWe\u2019ll all be at sea when we don\u2019t have the Queen.\u201d \u2022 The Crown season three begins on 17 November. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 September 2019 to clarify that the whole of season three, not just the first episode, covers the period between Wilson\u2019s election in 1964 and the silver jubilee of 1977.

      "body": "<p>Harvard Square in high summer is crisscrossed with tourists, but inside the university all is serene. Those academics who stay behind to work can enjoy the empty seminar rooms, loose deadlines and short queues at the cafeteria.</p> <p>Samantha Power used to dread such periods of calm. The former US ambassador to the United Nations, and foreign policy and human rights adviser to Barack Obama, was afflicted for most of her adult life with intense anxiety attacks that left her unable to catch her breath, as well as inexplicable but excruciating back pain. She called them \u201clungers\u201d \u2013 a term coined by a former boyfriend who witnessed her struggling to draw air into her lungs.</p> <p>The symptoms would ambush her during the holidays, and later, while she was a freelance correspondent covering the Bosnian war, when the shelling stopped. \u201cI had them in the summer of 1995 when there was a brief ceasefire,\u201d she says. \u201cI was like, what is wrong? I can\u2019t breathe. There\u2019s a ceasefire and I can\u2019t breathe. That should have been a clue that something was a little bit amiss.\u201d</p> <p>The panic attacks persisted in the rare lulls during the hectic years of her stellar career that followed. At 48, Power has now written a memoir, <em>The Education of an Idealist</em>, that charts not only her steep upward trajectory, but also her excavation of her Irish immigrant roots, where the clues to her bouts of breathlessness and pain lay hidden. She doesn\u2019t believe in neat ideas of \u201cclosure\u201d \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s no moment where you just tie a bow around that stuff\u201d \u2013 but she has noticed that since burrowing into her childhood, the demons have remained largely at bay.</p> <p>\u201cThis period, after finishing the book, would be a perfect candidate,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s really abated a lot.\u201d The pressure will return however, as the book is published and scrutinised, because it will be not just the painful episodes from Power\u2019s youth that are being dissected, but also the decisions taken by the Obama administration that were at odds with her own beliefs and recommendations.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wanted policymakers to\u00a0do some\u00adthing about the specific horror show in\u00a0front of me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Before entering government, Power had a single all\u2011encompassing preoccupation: how to respond to genocide and mass atrocities. It was watching TV pictures of the Chinese government crushing the Tiananmen protests in June 1989, and the famous image of a lone protester standing in front of a tank, that turned her from sports journalism to foreign policy. It was the unfolding genocide in Bosnia that drew her there as a 23-year-old freelancer.</p> <p>I first met Power in Bosnia in the 1990s. We were part of a shifting group of journalists and aid workers who set up home in a Sarajevo bed and breakfast called The Hondo. Power was a decade or so younger than most, but even then was full of self-confidence and optimism about what she could achieve. She was already focusing on how she might change events rather than merely describe them. Looking back, she puts that drive down in part to a short stint working at a Washington thinktank, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and the influence of its president at the time, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/mortonabramowitz\" title=\"\">Morton Abramowitz</a>, a retired diplomat who became her mentor. \u201cI think it was because of Mort that I had this annoying habit, which was to be constantly thinking: \u2018What should Washington be doing?\u2019 Which was ridiculous for a twentysomething stringer who barely knows how to file.\u201d</p> <p>When, at the height of the war, Power left Bosnia for Harvard Law School, one older male reporter told her \u2013 somewhat derisively but more prophetically than he could have imagined \u2013 that she was on her way to becoming secretary of state. His implication that she was a calculating careerist still rankles: \u201cIt drove me crazy. It just seemed absurd but it did kind of follow me in a way that I found very discomfiting,\u201d Power says. \u201cI know this probably sounds not believable but I sincerely wanted policymakers to do something about the specific horror show in front of me.\u201d</p> <p>At Harvard she imagined being a war crimes prosecutor at The Hague. \u201cThe idea was you go to law school and you go get the bad guy somehow.\u201d But she became absorbed instead in the question of why and how successive US administrations since the second world war had failed to respond effectively to genocide, for all the vows of \u201cnever again\u201d. So she dropped out of the law course and embarked on what ended up being a five year project on genocide. It culminated in her book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jul/05/highereducation.news\" title=\"\"><em>A Problem from Hell</em></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a375922f668d9f76fa2e342ab10ae56ae0e70c9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a375922f668d9f76fa2e342ab10ae56ae0e70c9d/375_82_910_546/500.png\" alt=\"Samantha Power with Barack Obama in the White House in 2013.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samantha Power with Barack Obama in the White House in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pete Souza/The White House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her prominence caught the attention of the then senator Obama, who recruited her as a foreign policy adviser. But his rise to the presidency, and her ascent alongside him to the White House and then the UN, took her from foreign policy theory to practice, with all the compromises that entailed.</p> <p>One of the darkest clouds that hangs over the legacy of the Obama administration is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\" title=\"\">Syria</a>. Its decision not to intervene to try to stop the slaughter was arguably the most consequential. Power argued for action but ended up on the losing side, drawing accusations of betrayal and hypocrisy from many former supporters and colleagues. The US gave limited support and training to rebel groups, but made no direct military intervention, even after President Bashar al-Assad crossed Obama\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d on chemical weapons, killing hundreds of people in rebel-held suburbs of Damascus with a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/16/syrian-chemical-attack-sarin-says-un\" title=\"\"> sarin gas attack</a> in the summer of 2013.</p> <p>Power\u2019s memoir reveals for the first time just how close-run that decision was. Obama resolved to carry out air strikes in the aftermath of the chemical weapon attacks, but they were put on hold while a team of UN inspectors investigated Damascus. When they eventually left, having confirmed the use of sarin, Power rushed to call Obama\u2019s national security adviser, Susan Rice, unaware that by then the pendulum had begun to swing away from intervention. \u201cI call Susan and I can\u2019t reach her, and I say to her assistant: \u2018It\u2019s really urgent because I know we are still going forward.\u2019 And she\u2019s just totally unreachable,\u201d Power recalls.</p> <p>By the time Rice called back, Obama had changed his mind. David Cameron had lost a parliamentary vote on UK involvement in military action. Details of the planned strikes had leaked from the Pentagon, and Democrats were telling the president there was no appetite in their home states for military action. The president decided to go to Congress, which voted against giving him a mandate. \u201cThe conspiracy theorists believe that he wanted to fail. And they rightly see him as somebody sceptical of military entanglement,\u201d she says. \u201cBut he absolutely thought he was going to succeed.\u201d</p> <p>In <em>A Problem from Hell</em>, Power had written admiringly of the US diplomats who had resigned over US inaction in the face of the Bosnian genocide. When her turn came to step down, she decided against it. She felt she could still achieve results by continually pushing for human rights to be central in foreign policy making. \u201cThere was so much else we were able to do.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Power shows herself, at the centre of\u00a0global political affairs, as a flesh-and\u2011blood human, plagued by\u00a0personal problems</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Power argues that it is impossible to know what might have happened had the US taken action. The consequences of not intervening are clear however. The Russians and Iranians have moved in to prop up Assad and help him wipe out the rebels along with hundreds of thousands of civilians, helping fuel the rise of the Isis caliphate. The exodus of refugees has destabilised the region and Europe, prompting a racist backlash exploited by populist politicians. \u201cSo with that logic of hindsight being 20/20 then I think indeed we should have tried to push the envelope a little bit more,\u201d she says.</p> <p>What distinguishes Power\u2019s new book from most diplomatic memoirs is that the figure at the centre of these global political developments is a flawed, flesh-and-blood human being, plagued by personal problems. She details visits to therapists on the same page as debates about military intervention.</p> <p>The pressures of working in the Obama White House were heightened by the tension of trying to start a family with her husband Cass Sunstein, a fellow Obama aide, author and law professor. In the memoir we find her sprinting from policy meetings to IVF appointments and slipping into White House toilets with pregnancy tests. The couple succeeded in having two children; Declan, born in 2009, and R\u00edan in 2012.</p> <p>Power also seems more prepared than most of her male counterparts to talk about her mistakes. Her public career almost came to an end during the 2008 presidential campaign when, in an interview with the Scotsman, she took a call from a fellow Obama aide about the primary battle with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">Hillary Clinton</a>, and called Clinton a \u201cmonster\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt was such a rookie mistake,\u201d she says, still kicking herself after more than a decade. Power was fired. \u201cSuddenly to fall flat professionally in such a highly public way and to have no job ... I was just like a wandering person,\u201d she remembers. \u201cAll my dreams of the future, all the campaign stops I was going to do and the fundraisers I was going to host and the help I was going to give this amazing team and this amazing candidate.\u201d Power mouths the sound of an explosion. \u201cIt was suddenly an empty calendar.\u201d</p> <p>The experience has left its mark. She calls it \u201cScotsman PTSD\u201d. On plane journeys, Sunstein would walk in front of her to the toilet so she couldn\u2019t be identified by fellow passengers. \u201cI\u2019m still much less free in public \u2026 I feel very much on guard,\u201d she says. \u201cBut some of that was good. I was too trusting.\u201d</p> <p>Obama quickly forgave her transgression and brought her into the White House, where she had to overcome her lack of experience. On her way to her first Oval Office meeting she realised she had no idea where the room was within the White House. She Googled a Washington Post floorplan of the building and still ended up on the wrong floor.</p> <p>But the emotional core of the memoir is set many years before the Obama administration and a long way away from the White House, in Dublin, where Power\u2019s parents\u2019 marriage fell apart over her father\u2019s alcoholism. Power spent many days in her childhood doing her homework in a Dublin pub while her father, Jim, \u201cbrilliant, dashing and charismatic\u201d, lined up pints of Guinness and held court. Her mother, Vera Delaney, a determined figure, fled to the US with Samantha and her younger brother to escape Jim\u2019s downward spiral. On a return trip to Ireland, their father seized the opportunity to try to wrest custody, leading to a Christmas Eve showdown on his doorstep, and a brutal choice for the children.</p> <p>The 10-year-old Samantha obeyed her mother and walked away from her father. Five years later, he died alone, leaving his daughter feeling responsible for his death. She only discovered when she was writing the book that he was found lying on her bed. \u201cThere was just this fear that I was carrying and on one level, still carry,\u201d she says. But, in writing the memoir, \u201cI learned things I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Other than telling her story, Power\u2019s broader purpose is a call to action during a time of despair, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\" title=\"\">Donald Trump</a> lays siege to what is left of the liberal order at home and abroad. \u201cI would like to make people feel, when they read the book, that they can do something about the problems around them,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She will campaign for the Democratic cause in swing states and plans to spend the coming years teaching at Harvard, including a course on effecting change, taught with her husband.

In a way, the word \u201csmitten\u201d is not strong enough to describe the effect \u2013 what occurred was a form of total uncritical devotion. It\u2019s not too emphatic an assessment to say that Turgenev\u2019s life was utterly shaped, controlled and dominated by his love for her thereafter. But she was married. Some 20 years older than she was, Louis Viardot was her manager \u2013 she had a hugely successful career as an opera singer \u2013 and, in his own right, was a connoisseur, hispanophile, art dealer, political agitator and successful author of guide books.

As Turgenev\u2019s fortunes rose and fell, the Viardots were always there providing support, financial and emotional.

A very successful woman in a world dominated by men, she made a great deal of money and parlayed her remarkable talent into a long and influential life and career. Her circle of friends and acquaintances reads like a <em>Who\u2019s Who </em>of 19th-century culture: Clara Schumann, George Sand, Berlioz, Dickens, Wagner, Saint-Sa\u00ebns, Gounod, Chopin, Flaubert, Massenet, Meyerbeer, Rossini, Liszt, Delacroix and so on. She was no beauty. Henry James, another of her circle, described her as \u201cas ugly as eyes in the sides of her head and an interminable upper lip can make her\u201d.

An aristocrat, not without funds, he didn\u2019t follow the accepted career path of his peers (army or the civil service) and chose instead to become a writer. He was 6ft 3in \u2013 in 19th-century Europe that made him a veritable giant \u2013 and a passionate Europhile. As well as his native Russian, he spoke fluent German, French and good English.

In time, Freud\u2019s depictions of himself may be seen as his greatest works.

      "bodyText": "Film Ad Astra At last, fans can witness Brad Pitt in space. Ad Astra is this season\u2019s big-budget sci-fi, but it\u2019s far from breezy multiplex bait. Director James Gray is a maverick, a singular film-maker yet to make any creative compromises. This one has Tommy Lee Jones as Pitt\u2019s rogue astronaut dad, Donald Sutherland warning of \u201cthe endless void\u201d (bring it on), plus Liv Tyler, possibly atoning for Armageddon. With cinematography by Interstellar\u2019s Hoyte van Hoytema and music by Max Richter, it\u2019ll be a classy joint. AG Out 18 September The Goldfinch Baby Driver\u2019s Ansel Elgort leads this all-star adaptation of Donna Tartt\u2019s devastating, Pulitzer-winning book. Elgort is Theodore, the boy whose life goes haywire when he nicks a painting from New York\u2019s Metropolitan Museum of Art after his mum is killed in a terrorist attack. It\u2019s directed by Brooklyn\u2019s John Crowley, and the cast includes Nicole Kidman, a guarantee of quality these days, plus kid of the hour Finn Wolfhard. AG Out 27 September Judy Expect an onslaught of colourful uppers and downers (mostly downers) in this Judy Garland biopic. Here we find the legendary performer down on her financial luck and reluctantly living in London to play a series of sold-out concerts. She comes to us in the form of Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, looking and sounding uncannily like her, while we also get Jessie Buckley who, after Beast and Wild Rose, is reason to watch anything. AG Out 4 October The Joker Despite its lead character\u2019s lauded status, this is blessedly unrelated to the DC cinematic universe, a tonal U-turn from the gaudy glitz we\u2019ve been subjected to from that stable. Conceived and directed by Todd Phillips, this Joaquin Phoenix-starring, Scorsese-tinged drama, written by Phillips and Scott Silver (8 Mile, The Fighter), explores how someone might end up a psychotic murderous clown. Unshackled by superhero tropes, it looks delightfully troubling. AG Out 4 October The Day Shall Come Nearly a decade after Four Lions exploded the cliches of movie terrorism, super-satirists Chris Morris and Succession\u2019s Jesse Armstrong reunite for this black comedy about Homeland Security. A fresh-from-drama-school March\u00e1nt Davis stars as the unarmed leader of a small Miami commune who poses no real threat to the US government. That is, until an FBI officer (Anna Kendrick) spots an opportunity to impress her boss. EEJ Out 11 October Sorry We Missed You Director Ken Loach\u2019s follow-up to the Palme d\u2019Or-winning I, Daniel Blake is another gut-punch drama about struggling families and, this time, all of us internet shoppers are implicated. When Ricky (Kris Hitchen) becomes a delivery driver, he discovers the lie in the gig economy\u2019s promise of self-determination. At age 83, Loach is more relevant than ever; a fact that bodes well for world cinema and terribly for modern Britain. EEJ Out 1 November Frozen 2 In 2013, Frozen\u2019s tale of a strong sibling bond melted hearts to become the highest-grossing animated film of all time. Now the royal sisters are back \u2013 plus Olaf the sunbathing snowman, of course \u2013 and embarking on a new quest. When Elsa hears a strange sound calling to her from the north, she ventures beyond the borders of the magical queendom of Arendelle to discover the origins of her icy powers. EEJ Out 22 November A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood The second nicest guy in America (Tom Hanks) plays the first nicest guy in America (Mr Rogers) in this film about the much-beloved children\u2019s TV presenter. In 1998 a journalist (named Lloyd Vogel in the film) was sent to interview then-70-year-old Fred Rogers for an Esquire magazine profile, and the encounter transformed his outlook on life. The Americans\u2019 Matthew Rhys co-stars as Vogel. EEJ Out 6 December Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker God only knows how JJ Abrams is going to pull this off. Returning to the series he resurrected with The Force Awakens, here he has to complete Carrie Fisher\u2019s arc with cutting-room floor footage from Episode VII, wrap up a nine-film saga, and please an impossible-to-please fanbase. The involvement of the original trilogy\u2019s characters \u2013 The Emperor (dead, but whatever), Lando Calrissian and, probably, Ghost Luke \u2013 provides the nostalgia, while Adam Driver provides the sexually frustrated oddness. AG Out 19 December Cats If the trailer alone had us squirming with nauseated glee, what will the release of the film do? This screen adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s long-running stage musical brings together the varied talents of Judi Dench, Idris Elba, Taylor Swift and James Corden, playing CGI-feline-human hybrids on one fateful night for their tribe. Clearly Cats has the potential to be an exquisitely uncomfortable watch, but might it be so bad, it\u2019s puuuurfect? EEJ Out 20 December Music Charli XCX \u2013 Charli Famed for her 6am house-party bangers (Boys, After the Afterparty, I Love It), the songs to emerge so far from Charli XCX\u2019s collab-heavy third album proper swap uppers for downers. The Lizzo-assisted Blame it on Your Love dishes the flak for a failed romance; Cross You Out, with Sky Ferreira, noisily dismisses a toxic relationship; while Gone sees Charli and Christine and the Queens muse on anxiety over crackling, metallic electropop. It\u2019s still a party, just one with a bit more depth. MC Out 13 September Kanye West \u2013 Jesus Is King Announced on Twitter by his official PR, AKA wife Kim Kardashian, Kanye West\u2019s ninth album looks set to double down on his recent move into the evangelical as showcased by his gospel-infused Sunday Service gigs/fashion shows. Recent Pusha T collab, Coming Home, also suggests a return to the sample-heavy, retro soul-feel of The College Dropout era but, this being Kanye, all bets are off. MC Out 27 September Tegan and Sara \u2013 Hey, I\u2019m Just Like You It was when Tegan and Sara were researching their forthcoming memoir, High School, that the Canadian twins stumbled across two dusty old cassette tapes featuring songs they had written between the ages of 15 and 17. With some minor tweaks, they have re-animated the punk-hued songs with an all-female cast of collaborators to create not just a time capsule but a clean slate for the future. MC Out 27 September Danny Brown \u2013 U Know What I\u2019m Sayin? Detroit rapper Danny Brown doesn\u2019t care about expectations. His last album, 2016\u2019s dense, sonically splenetic Atrocity Exhibition, referenced everyone from Joy Division to the Stooges, while this follow-up is executive-produced by the equally genre-agnostic Q-Tip. Expect the WTF quota to be increased by the presence of rapper-producer and kindred spirit JPEGMAFIA. MC Out 4 October King Princess \u2013 Cheap Queen At a recent gig by her label boss Mark Ronson, 20-year-old Brooklynite Mikaela Straus, AKA King Princess, got up on stage, vaped and then left without singing a note. Rules are for squares, basically, and it\u2019s this sense of louche cool that has earned Straus a fevered following. It helps, too, that her songs are full of character, lurching from loping R&amp;B (last year\u2019s excellent queer anthem Pussy Is God) to the off-kilter strut of her debut album\u2019s title track. MC Out 25 October Tours Aphex Twin Since making his return to the live arena in 2017 after a five-year UK absence, the fz pseudotimestretch+e+3 hitmaker has barely stopped chasing that festival coin around the world, even confusing sun-burned pop fans at this year\u2019s Coachella. He returns to his homeland for two shows in cavernous warehouses, ie the perfect locations for some head-scrambling beats and perhaps the chance to rub shoulders with day-one fans Madonna and Kylie Minogue. MC Printworks, SE16, 14 September; Mayfield Depot, Manchester, 20 September Cher Fourteen years after her farewell tour, actual legend and all-caps Twitter enthusiast Cher returns to the UK for the knowingly titled Here We Go Again tour. Ostensibly in support of recalibration of the very concept of camp, 2018\u2019s Abba covers album Dancing Queen, it also promises the hits (Believe as an encore? You betcha), a ludicrous array of costume changes and \u2013 fingers crossed \u2013 some between-song banter. MC The O2, SE10, 20 &amp; 21 October; touring to 3 November Lizzo Two parts pop star and one part motivational speaker, 2019 has belonged to Lizzo, whose single Juice was as ubiquitous as her shiny silver sidekick Sasha Flute. Third album Cuz I Love You also made her a proper star in the United States \u2013 helped by the single Truth Hurts appearing in Netflix romcom Someone Great \u2013 while a euphoric Glastonbury appearance cemented her as a live must-see. MC O2 Academy Brixton, SW9, 6 &amp; 7 November; touring to 11 November Bj\u00f6rk Billed as Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s \u201cmost elaborate stage concert yet\u201d, which is saying something given that she utilised actual lightning to make a bassline on the Biophilia tour, Cornucopia sees the Icelandic experimentalist collaborating with Argentinian film-maker Lucrecia Martel to create an immersive, theatrical fusion of flora, fauna and feminism. That it will all take place in some of the UK\u2019s biggest arenas, and mainly feature songs from 2017\u2019s lush \u201cTinder album\u201d Utopia, is exactly the kind of single-minded risk-taking fans have come to expect. MC The O2, SE10, 19 November; touring to 28 November Skepta Fresh from sampling Sophie Ellis-Bextor on his latest album, Ignorance Is Bliss, Skepta steps up to pop star-sized venues for the supporting tour. His recent Manchester international festival collaboration Dystopia987 created a sort of theatre-rave hybrid billed as \u201ca waking dream\u201d, representing what he called a \u201csingular vision of the future: deep, dark, radical and riveting\u201d. MC Mayfield Depot, Manchester, 23 November; touring to 29 November Exhibitions William Blake No other British artist has inspired the modern imagination as profoundly as Blake. His portrait of Newton mapping the cosmos with giant dividers is one of the world\u2019s favourite images of science. His insistence on the value of visions and dreams influenced everyone from Aldous Huxley to Jim Morrison and Patti Smith. Blake\u2019s art is fiery, imagistic and heretical \u2013 a delight for the inner eye. JJ Tate Britain, SW1, Wednesday 11 September to 2 February The Turner prize The Turner prize hits a town strongly associated with its namesake. If the ghost of JMW Turner wanders in from the wild winter shore, it may be confused by art\u2019s many forms in the 21st century, from the political sound art of self-described \u201cprivate ear\u201d Lawrence Abu Hamdan to Tai Shani\u2019s multimedia project inspired by medieval feminism. Meanwhile, Oscar Murillo uses painting to reveal the dark side of globalisation and Helen Cammock tells a women\u2019s history of the Troubles with film and photography. What do you make of that, Mr Turner? JJ Turner Contemporary, Margate, 28 September to 12 January Kara Walker This is an exciting departure from recent commissions in Tate Modern\u2019s Turbine Hall. We have had a string of interactive projects that avoided the traditional gratifications of art. Now here is a proper artist who uses vivid imagery to tell powerful stories about race in America. Walker\u2019s tableaux revive the archaic Victorian craft of the cut-paper silhouette to portray black American history. JJ Tate Modern, SE1, 2 October to 5 April Gauguin Portraits There is a full-faced frankness to Eug\u00e8ne Henri Paul Gauguin\u2019s portraits that seems to capture the wholeness of a person. The sensitivity with which he depicted his friend Van Gogh gives the lie to the biographical stereotype of a hard-hearted bohemian who bullied poor Vincent. But his most extraordinary portraits were done in Tahiti. Here he portrayed Pacific people with a compassion and respect a million miles from colonial ways of seeing. To look into Gauguin\u2019s Pacific faces is to sense the sorrow of a culture on the verge of destruction. JJ National Gallery, WC2, 7 Oct to 26 January Bridget Riley This is a scintillating retrospective of one of Britain\u2019s greatest-ever artists. Riley\u2019s paintings reach into your mind and alter your perceptions. Her abstract curves create optical illusions of expanding and vibrating forms that rise up from the flat picture. She hit on her revolutionary method by studying Seurat, and her early landscapes after the 19th-century pointillist are deliriously beautiful. JJ Hayward Gallery, Southbank Centre, SE1, 23 October to 26 January Lucian Freud: The Self-Portraits This savagely truthful painter once said wryly of a naked image of himself as an old man that, given how he painted others, portraying himself honestly was the least he could do. In time, Freud\u2019s depictions of himself may be seen as his greatest works. You always sense the mirror he is looking into, be it in his lounge or a shaving mirror, in which he sees strange reflective effects so his children look tiny beside him or he resembles a wild animal at bay. He watches himself age with merciless precision. JJ Royal Academy of Arts, W1, 27 October to 26 January Steve McQueen Year 3 This ambitious public artwork has the straightforward humanism that has enabled McQueen to make Oscar-winning cinema as well as compelling visual art. Here he turns his camera not on a hunger striker or a man who stands still while a house falls around him, but a generation who embody a city\u2019s future. He has photographed every Year 3 primary school class in London, formally posed as in a traditional school photograph. JJ Tate Britain, SW1, 12 November to 3 May Judy Chicago Amazingly enough, this is the first retrospective in Britain for the artist whose installation The Dinner Party made feminist art famous four decades ago. The Dinner Party, a dinner table with places laid for notable women in history and mythology, is just one of her ambitious anthropological works. This show includes The Birth Project, begun in 1980, which celebrates childbirth, and The End, which contemplates death. Chicago is a modern visionary in the mould of Blake. JJ BALTIC, Gateshead, 16 November to 19 April Troy: Myth and Reality There really was a Troy. The remains of this ancient city show that it was burned in a devastating war. But the legend of the Trojan war is just as \u201creal\u201d as any facts. From early Greek vase paintings of black ships laden with warriors to sculptures of heroes taken from Aegina to Munich in the 19th century, ancient Greek art was obsessed with Homer\u2019s mythic version of this war in The Iliad. Artists since, from Rubens to Turner, have brooded on its tragedy. See the real and imagined horrors of the war that started all wars. JJ British Museum, WC1, 21 November to 8 March Theaster Gates After the American civil war, an island called Malaga off the Maine coast was settled by an interracial community whose embrace of diversity flouted the prejudices of the time. Malaga\u2019s people were evicted in the early 20th century and all trace of their plural society eradicated by 1911. Chicago\u2019s Theaster Gates resurrects this lost history in a series of installations entitled Amalgam, a word that in America\u2019s past implied the dangerous \u201camalgamation\u201d of races. JJ Tate Liverpool, 13 December to 3 May Theatre Faith, Hope and Charity Alexander Zeldin\u2019s plays are total one-offs. In fact, they don\u2019t really feel like plays. Instead, they\u2019re deeply unsettling experiences that immerse the audience in the lives of people living on the fringes of society. Zeldin\u2019s latest follows on from Beyond Caring and Love and takes place in a rundown community hall. It won\u2019t be an easy watch but it will get under your skin. MG National Theatre: Dorfman, SE1, Monday 9 September to 12 October Glass. Kill. Bluebeard. Imp. A new play from Caryl Churchill is always cause for celebration. Each play is so different from the last, pushing our feelings and theatre itself in all sorts of wild directions. Now we have got four Churchill plays all at once, which will include a girl made of glass, gods, murderers, serial killers and secrets. James Macdonald directs and the cast includes Deborah Findlay, Toby Jones and Tom Mothersdale. Do. Not. Miss. MG Royal Court, SW1, 18 September to 12 October On Bear Ridge This co-production between National Theatre Wales and the Royal Court is written by Welsh playwright and TV scriptwriter Ed Thomas. It\u2019s a loosely autobiographical work about memory, joy and identity, and is inspired by Thomas\u2019s childhood growing up in the Brecon Beacons. Thomas will co-direct alongside Vicky Featherstone and the play will feature Rhys Ifans, who always brings a livewire energy to his performances. MG Sherman Theatre, Cardiff, 20 September to 5 October; Royal Court, SW1, 24 October to 23 November My Beautiful Laundrette Nikolai Foster directs a stage adaptation of Hanif Kureishi\u2019s groundbreaking 1985 film. Set in London during the Thatcher years, Kureishi\u2019s story is about a young British Pakistani, Omar, who transforms his uncle\u2019s rundown laundrette into a thriving business \u2013 busting taboos and breaking down cultural boundaries along the way. Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe of Pet Shop Boys have written the score and Omar Malik (East Is East) will star. MG Curve, Leicester, 20 September to 5 October; touring to 9 November Dublin theatre festival Where to start with this theatrical sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord? This year\u2019s Dublin theatre festival includes 10 world premieres and an extended programme of theatre for younger audiences, including a new take on Baba Yaga. There is a new version of The Playboy of the Western World; Marina Carr\u2019s reimagining of Hecuba; a play from Nancy Harris; and a site-specific work from ANU Productions and the Gate Theatre about the queer experience in Dublin. MG Various venues, 26 September to 13 October Lungs Artistic director Matthew Warchus is flying high at the Old Vic, where his last show, Present Laughter starring Andrew Scott, was a huge hit. Next up is Duncan Macmillan\u2019s brilliant play Lungs, starring The Crown\u2019s king and queen Claire Foy and Matt Smith. It is a stunning piece of writing about a young couple racing towards parenthood, excited and terrified, bristling with doubts and bursting with joy. MG The Old Vic, SE1, 14 October to 9 November Light Falls This is the final show for artistic director Sarah Frankcom, who has had such a terrific run at the Royal Exchange Theatre. Her swansong will be a new play from Simon Stephens, who grew up in nearby Stockport. The show will connect five relatives in five disparate English towns and is all about love, death, community and kindness. To top it all off, there will be original music from Jarvis Cocker. MG Royal Exchange, Manchester, 24 October to 16 November Dear Evan Hansen This Broadway smash transfers to London with six Tony awards to its name and a tremendous amount of hype in its wake. The score is composed by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the dream team behind The Greatest Showman and La La Land. The book, written by Steven Levenson, is about a troubled teen struggling to come to terms with the tragic death of a school friend. Should pack a punch. MG No\u00ebl Coward Theatre, WC2, 29 October to 4 April Dance Richard Alston Dance Company: Final Edition The don of British contemporary dance is closing his company next year, so it\u2019s the last chance to catch Sir Richard\u2019s fine dancers as they embark on the first half of their ultimate tour (there will be more dates in the spring before a last ever show at London\u2019s Sadler\u2019s Wells). Most notable in the shifting programme is the premiere of Alston\u2019s final work for the company, Shine On (debuts at Snape Maltings Concert Hall, 1 to 2 Nov), set to Benjamin Britten\u2019s first published songs, On This Island, which features five poems by WH Auden. LW Edinburgh Festival Theatre, 27 &amp; 28 September; touring to spring 2020 Dada Masilo: Giselle Soweto-born choreographer Dada Masilo has form when it comes to updating ballet\u2019s fairytales. After success with Swan Lake, Carmen and Romeo and Juliet, her Giselle is a #MeToo story for our times. Transported to a lively South African village, using a mix of ballet, contemporary and traditional Tswana dance, Masilo herself plays the heroine as a gutsy young woman who sets out for revenge after falling for a cheating creep. LW Sadler\u2019s Wells, EC1, 4 &amp; 5 October; touring to 2 November Royal Ballet: Cross Currents / Monotones II / New Tanowitz A modestly sized show for a major company \u2013 a small cast in the Royal Opera House\u2019s second theatre \u2013 but all eyes will be on this triple bill, which features a new work by Pam Tanowitz, who wowed with her TS Eliot-inspired Four Quartets. Part of the Merce Cunningham centenary celebrations, the bill also includes Royal Ballet dancers tackling Cunningham\u2019s work for the first time, plus the sublime modernism of Frederick Ashton\u2019s Monotones II. LW Royal Opera House: Linbury Theatre, WC2, 10 to 11 October Shobana Jeyasingh Dance: Staging Schiele Jeyasingh is not the first choreographer to be inspired by Egon Schiele\u2019s warped and disquieting bodies but you can be sure she will approach the subject matter with her customary questioning intelligence, as she probes the murky relationship between male artist and female model in the Austrian artist\u2019s intense portraits. Orlando Gough composes the score and the cast of four includes the brilliant ex-Rambert dancer Dane Hurst. LW DanceEast, Ipswich, 18 &amp; 19 October; touring to 5 November Comedy Jordan Brookes Described by the director of the Edinburgh comedy awards as \u201cutterly unique\u201d, this year\u2019s winner takes his I\u2019ve Got Nothing show on a victory lap. Jaw-droppingly brutal about his brain\u2019s dark meanderings, it\u2019s one for fans of dramatic existentialism \u2013 and material about seducing mums. HG Soho Theatre, W1, Saturday 7 September; touring to February Tez Ilyas With The Tez O\u2019Clock Show, Ilyas proved there is a gap in the market for topical lols from different perspectives. And, given his identity as a British-Muslim, northern, working-class comic, there are enough perspectives to go around. Live, he offers a masterclass in how to talk about race and society without veering into cheap and nasty territory. HJD Part of Desi Central Comedy Show, Queen\u2019s Theatre, Hornchurch, 15 September; touring to 2 November Eddie Izzard The polyglot comic has always embraced his nonconformity, previously identifying as a transvestite before coming out as transgender. His latest show, Wunderbar, combines personal tales with an array of strangeness ranging from \u201chumans over the last 100,000 years to talking dogs and animal superheroes\u201d. HJD De La Warr Pavilion, Bexhill-on-Sea, 15 September; touring to 16 November Jayde Adams Bristolian Adams is a formerly all-singing, all-rapping, Adele-parodying comic who\u2019s recently done away with the bells and whistles. Her latest show, The Ballad of Kylie Jenner\u2019s Old Face, is a case in point, tackling the feminism \u2013 and often lack thereof \u2013 demonstrated by celebs, among them the youngest scion of the Kardashian clan. HJD Bloomsbury Theatre, WC1, 21 September; touring 23 October to 26 April Kate Berlant You may well have spotted Kate Berlant in places as diverse as 30 Rock-ish comedy The Other Two and Tarantino\u2019s latest, Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood. While the LA-based comic steals every scene she\u2019s in, however small, as a standup Berlant really comes into her own, with a surreal and often deadpan energy. HJD Soho Theatre, W1, 7 to 12 October David Baddiel From The Mary Whitehouse Experience to Three Lions larks to an Olivier-nominated stage show, My Family: Not the Sitcom, David Baddiel has had nothing if not a varied career. His upcoming show, Trolls: Not the Dolls, sees him turn his attention to online insults and abuse. HJD Royal Northern College of Music, Manchester, 20 October; touring 24 January to 3 May Hannah Gadsby The Tasmanian comic used to deal in self-deprecating lols, with barbs that made light of her own struggles as a gay woman. Her Netflix special, Nanette, was a turning point, however, with Gadsby deciding to terminate that type of material. Having sought a more authentic comedy, her latest show, Douglas, swerves trauma in favour of stereotype-skewing standup and a healthier kind of personal admission. HJD New Theatre, Oxford, 24 October; touring to 23 November London Hughes Hughes\u2019s two first presenting gigs were on adult channel Babestation and, er, CBBC, giving a taste of her comedy career to come: ribald yet also rather endearing. Having recently become the first black woman ever nominated for the main category at the Edinburgh comedy awards, expect big things for Hughes, whose current show, To Catch a Dick, is a celebration of female sexuality. HJD Soho Theatre, W1, 6 to 14 December",

      "body": "<p>Could the UK\u2019s savings rates be heading towards the zero mark?</p> <p>As the Brexit chaos continued to unfold at Westminster, some of Britain\u2019s leading savings providers were busy cutting their interest rates, dealing a fresh blow to millions of people.</p> <p>On Monday, state-backed National Savings and Investments (NS&amp;I) axed some of its most popular products and slashed interest rates for loyal customers.</p> <p>Lloyds Bank told customers this week that its Instant Cash Isa rate will drop from 0.35% to 0.2% on Friday. Meanwhile, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, the online banking brand that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/23/goldman-sachs-to-tempt-britains-savers-with-marcus-account\" title=\"\">launched with a splash</a> a year ago, trimmed the headline rate on its once market-leading \u201ceasy access\u201d account from 1.5% to 1.45%.</p> <p>These will not be the last savings rate cuts we see over the coming weeks. For one thing, the money market rates that dictate the pricing of many savings products slumped to record lows this week.</p> <p>The crucial interest rate on 10-year gilts (government bonds) \u2013 which dictates the interest rate on many mortgage and savings accounts \u2013 fell below 0.5%.</p> <p>On top of that, news that the UK may be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/04/uk-slips-closer-to-recession-as-service-sector-slows-brexit\" title=\"\">moving closer to a \u201cBrexit recession\u201d</a> bolstered expectations that the Bank of England will cut interest rates this year \u2013 perhaps by as much as 0.5%.</p> <p>That would be great news for borrowers, but terrible for savers at a time when many older people appear to be using easily accessible savings accounts <a href=\"https://moneyfacts.co.uk/news/retirement/rise-in-pension-pot-withdrawals/\" title=\"\">as a \u201csafe haven\u201d for pension cash</a>.</p> <p>If and when there is a Bank rate cut, much or all of it is likely to be passed on to savers. But with the average easy access rate at 0.64%, and some accounts such as HSBC\u2019s Flexible Saver paying just 0.15%, there is not much left to cut.</p> <p>And perhaps we cannot completely rule out the possibility of interest rates going negative for savers in the UK, as they have done in European countries including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/06/raking-it-in-ubs-to-start-charging-super-rich-clients-for-cash-deposits\" title=\"\">Switzerland</a> and <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-denmark-rates-jyske-bank/denmarks-jyske-bank-to-charge-wealthy-clients-for-deposits-idUKKCN1VA0YW\" title=\"\">Denmark</a>, where some banks are now charging wealthy individuals for looking after their cash instead of paying interest.</p> <p>Andrew Hagger at the financial website MoneyComms says: \u201cIt\u2019s not looking good for savers at the moment.\u201d Asked whether savings rates could potentially head towards zero, he says: \u201cPotentially on some instant-access accounts, that could happen. If the base rate was cut, in some instances we could be heading towards zero or pretty close.\u201d</p> <p>The move by NS&amp;I is especially notable because as well as being one of the UK\u2019s biggest savings providers, it is also a government department.</p> <p>NS&amp;I has withdrawn its one-year and three-year guaranteed growth bonds and guaranteed income bonds from sale, and has cut the rate by 0.25% for anyone rolling over an existing guaranteed growth bond, guaranteed income bond or fixed-interest savings certificate.

      "bodyText": "Could the UK\u2019s savings rates be heading towards the zero mark? As the Brexit chaos continued to unfold at Westminster, some of Britain\u2019s leading savings providers were busy cutting their interest rates, dealing a fresh blow to millions of people. On Monday, state-backed National Savings and Investments (NS&amp;I) axed some of its most popular products and slashed interest rates for loyal customers. Lloyds Bank told customers this week that its Instant Cash Isa rate will drop from 0.35% to 0.2% on Friday. Meanwhile, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, the online banking brand that launched with a splash a year ago, trimmed the headline rate on its once market-leading \u201ceasy access\u201d account from 1.5% to 1.45%. These will not be the last savings rate cuts we see over the coming weeks. For one thing, the money market rates that dictate the pricing of many savings products slumped to record lows this week. The crucial interest rate on 10-year gilts (government bonds) \u2013 which dictates the interest rate on many mortgage and savings accounts \u2013 fell below 0.5%. On top of that, news that the UK may be moving closer to a \u201cBrexit recession\u201d bolstered expectations that the Bank of England will cut interest rates this year \u2013 perhaps by as much as 0.5%. That would be great news for borrowers, but terrible for savers at a time when many older people appear to be using easily accessible savings accounts as a \u201csafe haven\u201d for pension cash. If and when there is a Bank rate cut, much or all of it is likely to be passed on to savers. But with the average easy access rate at 0.64%, and some accounts such as HSBC\u2019s Flexible Saver paying just 0.15%, there is not much left to cut. And perhaps we cannot completely rule out the possibility of interest rates going negative for savers in the UK, as they have done in European countries including Switzerland and Denmark, where some banks are now charging wealthy individuals for looking after their cash instead of paying interest. Andrew Hagger at the financial website MoneyComms says: \u201cIt\u2019s not looking good for savers at the moment.\u201d Asked whether savings rates could potentially head towards zero, he says: \u201cPotentially on some instant-access accounts, that could happen. If the base rate was cut, in some instances we could be heading towards zero or pretty close.\u201d The move by NS&amp;I is especially notable because as well as being one of the UK\u2019s biggest savings providers, it is also a government department. NS&amp;I has withdrawn its one-year and three-year guaranteed growth bonds and guaranteed income bonds from sale, and has cut the rate by 0.25% for anyone rolling over an existing guaranteed growth bond, guaranteed income bond or fixed-interest savings certificate. The new rates range between 1.2% and 2%. When we invest in NS&amp;I products, we are lending money to the government, and in return it pays us interest (or prizes for premium bond holders). But there is a big problem for savers: it is now cheaper for the government to raise cash on the money markets instead, which it does by issuing bonds. Sarah Coles of the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown says: \u201cAt the moment, the enormous uncertainty in the market means investors want bonds and are willing to accept low yields in return.\u201d Meanwhile, the latest data from Moneyfacts shows that across the market, average fixed savings rates have been steadily falling. It said the average rate on a five-year fixed rate savings bond, assuming a \u00a310,000 investment, stood at 1.94% on Wednesday.

Rates might be falling, but Ray Boulger at the mortgage broker John Charcol \u2013 who tracks gilt yields \u2013 says that if you are a saver who has some money you don\u2019t need right now, there is an argument for locking it up for a year or two on the basis that over the next few months, rates are more likely to fall than go up. So what can you do? \u2022 Take advantage of the deals still out there. At 1.45%, the Marcus interest rate is still decent. Meanwhile, Shawbrook Bank has an easy-access account paying 1.48%.

      "bodyText": "Can you sufficiently remove makeup without product? Many cleansing-cloth devotees believe you can. The idea is that a specific fine weave of microfibre, when soaked in plain water and wrung out, can remove even waterproof mascara, long-wear foundation, dirt and oil, without the aid of cleanser or face wash. I\u2019ll meet them halfway and concede that if you can stand the feel of microfibre, the cloths are great as a first step, lifting the worst of it before knuckling down to the real business of cleansing, much how you\u2019d use a micellar water or wipe. It\u2019s where I deploy the brilliantly useful Face Halo microfibre makeup remover pad (\u00a37.50) after a photoshoot or event that requires heavy makeup.

      "body": "<p>It was the eyes that I noticed first; where before he\u2019d made soothing eye contact, now he kept his gaze averted. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked as he tapped at his computer.</p> <p>Eyes down, he replied, \u201cI\u2019m taking you off the flight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut... but\u2026\u201d I stuttered.</p> <p>He handed my passport back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, looking at me, now flinty eyed. \u201cYou can\u2019t go to India without a visa. You\u2019ll have to go back to London.\u201d</p> <p>I was 18, in Schiphol airport, Amsterdam, not boarding the second half of my flight to Delhi. My mum had suggested I visit a travel agent before booking this three-week trip to the north of India and I\u2019d balked. \u201cTravel agent? Have you heard of the internet, Mum?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d booked my flights and the hotel, and although I was dimly aware that I should get a visa, the website had a tiny script and the forms seemed difficult to navigate; I clicked away and decided it would all, somehow, just work out.</p> <p>Of course, it didn\u2019t, because international travel rules are international travel rules. I flew back to London that same day, got a visa the next morning from the Indian consulate, and the day after boarded a new flight. Luckily, the flight I missed had been oversubscribed, so the replacement was free: the funds I\u2019d spent months scraping together were dented but not totally depleted, and I decided this was a learning experience. </p> <p>The next time it happened, I was 28 and en route to Heathrow, to fly to Miami with my then boyfriend. \u201cDid you get your Esta?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I checked and I don\u2019t need one,\u201d I blithely replied.</p> <p>\u201cYou do,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBut... but\u2026\u201d</p> <p>I felt the familiar sense of dread. The admin for this holiday had been on a list that included consolidating pension plans, going to the dentist, replying to at least eight emails from my accountant (I am freelance) and sewing up a hole in the arm of my favourite jacket. These were my non-crucial-but-still\u2011quite-important to-dos (although that jacket still has a hole in it, two years later).</p> <p>I\u2019m sure you know the feeling. According to one 2018 survey of 2,000 Brits, the average adult carries out 109 life admin tasks a year, from sorting out car insurance to paying council tax; about half the respondents admitted they struggled to keep up with household paperwork. Life admin might be at once the most boring and overwhelming anxiety of our age: look closely, and we are procrastinating and blind panicking our way into an organisational crisis.</p> <p>The little jobs that fill the gaps in our days like sand between stones have always been a problem for me. Filling in the forms to pay the bills that will keep the lights on and the phone working. Buying milk. Signing up in time to get the best deal. When I was 18, this was forgivable: I\u2019d grow out of it. Ten years later, less so. Now I\u2019m 31, and my inability to manage life admin has become a shameful character flaw. I tell myself I am too self-involved and not practical enough, immature and lazy. The more debit cards I have lost (I\u2019m on my seventh for this year alone), the more bills I have forgotten to pay, the more I have started to see myself as a defective person. \u201cI\u2019m so silly,\u201d became \u201cI\u2019m an idiot,\u201d became \u201cI just hate myself sometimes.\u201d I work for myself, I pay my rent and I don\u2019t rely on anyone else for money; I even do work that I enjoy. By some standards, I\u2019m successful. But my admin ineptitude still makes me feel I\u2019m lacking a fundamental piece of the \u201cadult\u201d jigsaw.</p> <p>The US academic and journalist Anne Helen Petersen recently <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work\" title=\"\">diagnosed people like me with \u201cerrand paralysis\u201d</a>, a symptom of \u201cmillennial burnout\u201d. She argues that the 2008 financial crisis, the decline of the middle class and the rise of the 1%, together with the decay of stable, full-time jobs, means our mental energy is fully trained on keeping afloat: we don\u2019t have the energy left for the smaller tasks. In this scenario, I\u2019m a victim of the always-on mentality that has come to define my generation. This analysis does help to alleviate some of my shame \u2013 but it turns out that being bad at life admin isn\u2019t just a flaky millennial thing \u2013 fully fledged adults suffer, too.</p> <p>When Elizabeth Emens, a professor of law at Columbia University in New York and undeniable grownup, gave a lecture on the subject, she wondered if she might be making a huge mistake. \u201cIt was different from anything I\u2019d written, or even heard presented, before,\u201d she tells me. But as she started speaking, \u201can amazing thing happened: the law professors in the audience responded intensely to the topic. At the end, people approached me to say that it was as if I were seeing into their minds and marriages.\u201d Emens went on to turn her paper into a book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/art-of-life-admin.html\" title=\"\">The Art </a><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/art-of-life-admin.html\" title=\"\">Of Life Admin</a>, a project which she says grew out of her own life. \u201cI was completely overwhelmed after my second child was born, with a whole lot of work that I didn\u2019t expect would go with parenting. I knew there would be diapers to change and mouths to feed, but it didn\u2019t occur to me that there would be so much paperwork. And mental labour. And it seemed largely an invisible part of parenting.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think I\u00a0ate\u00a0breakfast till\u00a0I\u00a0was 20, because my mum was just as disorganised and\u00a0wouldn\u2019t set\u00a0an alarm</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kim Palmer, a 40-year-old CEO of a tech company from Kent, can relate to this. \u201cI have emails, WhatsApp, Slack, Trello. Bills come in different formats \u2013 paper, email, I get notifications on apps. Trying to make sense of all that is really difficult.\u201d She recently sent her son to school in his uniform instead of fancy dress. \u201cI forgot,\u201d she sighs. \u201cThat\u2019s the second time this year he was meant to go in a dress-up outfit and didn\u2019t. I do feel bad but honestly, on the never-ending list of to-dos it was near the bottom. I know I should get more organised \u2013 I have a friend who is amazing: her life is spreadsheet heaven. But running a business and a household, I\u2019ve found that unless I prioritise quite strictly, my mental health suffers.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s the same for Kenny Mammarella-D\u2019Cruz, a 55-year-old life coach. \u201cThe worst thing for me is modern society\u2019s obsession with emptying the inbox and staying on top of all our communications. Everything seems to happen faster than the speed of light,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all automated \u2013 bills, applications, reminders for medical appointments. I tried to do inbox zero for a time \u2013 it was impossible: I was constantly missing deadlines. It was a nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>Even professional administrators can be tripped up by personal tasks. Marie Richards, a 67-year-old retiree from Stratford-upon-Avon, spent the last 12 years of her working life as an administrator for Warwickshire police. \u201cBut at home I never did my own paperwork,\u201d she tells me. \u201cWe divided up the labour in the household; my husband did the paperwork and I attended to things related to our two daughters. I don\u2019t know, my brain just never worked that way. I never got things sorted in time. At work I was very good, but at home I switched off.\u201d When it came to pensions, though, Richards was adamant she would take charge. \u201cI did it all: the paperwork, telephone calls and anything that needed to be done online. If I\u2019m honest with you, I hated it. It made me incredibly anxious. Even now I hate receiving letters related to it, but I try not to put off opening them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65711ba2d46ed978cc09d24b2a294dbc48ab9a22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65711ba2d46ed978cc09d24b2a294dbc48ab9a22/16_28_2869_1875/1000.jpg\" alt=\"To do list - multicoloured Post-it notes  on white background, with hand choosing one\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">So much to do: according to one survey, the average adult carries out 109 life admin tasks a year. Photograph: Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: neirfy/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her husband, Keith Richards (not that one), also 67 and retired, suggests that we view admin more negatively now because of the huge shift in the way we perform it. \u201cA lot of my admin is keyboard-mediated \u2013 for example, I do my bank accounts online. My dad gave my mum the household cash each week and she separated it into different old handbags. If she wanted something, she\u2019d go to the relevant handbag and see what she had in notes and small change. And if you needed the bank, you had to go there. For my parents, there seemed to be fewer things to think about. I now feel bombarded with to-dos, but many of them take no time at all. I can hit a button and it\u2019s done. The quality of the interaction is different, and perhaps that\u2019s why it can feel like drudge work \u2013 there\u2019s rarely a human there.\u201d</p> <p>Emens argues that, \u201cCertain features of modern life make admin more pervasive. One of them is the rise of the bureaucratic state: we have more paperwork to complete, particularly around things like weddings, divorces, births and deaths. And another is technology, so admin reaches us with greater insistence and frequency. People expect us to respond to emails and texts; there\u2019s an escalation of demands.\u201d And where once we might have outsourced the business of booking a holiday, or the drudgery of filling in our tax return to an expert, we now turn to Airbnb, Skyscanner and Booking.com, or download apps such as QuickBooks. We build our own websites with Squarespace and cannibalise our lives to create content for social media. Individually each of these tasks might seem quick and painless, but as a whole they amount to a lot more work.</p> <p>So much, in fact, that a whole new industry has sprung up to help us keep on top of it. Take the Bullet Journal, a specially designed notebook where to-dos are mindfully broken down into bullet points. It\u2019s so popular there are now Instagram accounts, each with thousands of followers, dedicated to the art of bullet journalling. Millions of us watch \u201cadmin routine\u201d YouTube videos and follow \u201ccleanfluencers\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/marie-kondo\" title=\"\">Marie Kondo</a> disciples who have become famous for their tips on effective life admin management, as well as cleaning. The staggering popularity of what is, essentially, watching other people manage their to-do lists, hints at an overwhelmed population desperately trying to keep on top of myriad demands.</p> <p>There is, of course, a spectrum of ineptitude, and I\u2019ve never let anything get so bad that it has threatened my livelihood. But there have been big oversights. I have paid for two separate phone contracts for an entire year, even though I had only one phone (I didn\u2019t realise I\u2019d been signed up to two contracts; then when I did, it took me a few months to call my phone company). And I paid a year\u2019s worth of insurance for phones I\u2019d long since lost and not claimed for. But I\u2019ve always been just organised enough to correct mistakes before the consequences became too dire. For some, though, errand paralysis can have terrifying consequences.</p> <p>Sara Tasker, 35, a business consultant and author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/hashtag-authentic-9781911127611.html\" title=\"\">Hashtag Authentic: Finding </a><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/hashtag-authentic-9781911127611.html\" title=\"\">Creativity </a><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/hashtag-authentic-9781911127611.html\" title=\"\">And </a><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/hashtag-authentic-9781911127611.html\" title=\"\">Building </a><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/hashtag-authentic-9781911127611.html\" title=\"\">A </a><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/hashtag-authentic-9781911127611.html\" title=\"\">Community </a><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/hashtag-authentic-9781911127611.html\" title=\"\">On Instagram </a><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/hashtag-authentic-9781911127611.html\" title=\"\">And </a><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/hashtag-authentic-9781911127611.html\" title=\"\">Beyond</a>, is \u201cawful at life admin\u201d, she tells me. \u201cI\u2019m always running out of my prescriptions because there are so many steps that you have to remember. You have to notice you\u2019re running low and then call the GP and then collect it. That chain of events always trips me up \u2013 there are too many points at which it can break down.\u201d She would frequently forget to pay her phone bill, and also to invoice for work she\u2019d done, meaning she did not have enough money to fill up her car. Then disaster struck: \u201cI sold my car and forgot to send one of the pieces of paperwork to the DVLA. I then moved house twice and never got any of my redirected letters.\u201d She missed reminders and threats of a fine, and it wasn\u2019t until bailiffs came to her house, a week after the birth of her daughter, that she realised. \u201cI had to go with my newborn to stand in court and speak in front of magistrates, and declare that I hadn\u2019t received these letters so that the fine would be cancelled.\u201d</p> <p>Tasker traces this chaos in her adult life to a similar atmosphere at home when she was growing up. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ate breakfast until I was 20 because my mum was just as disorganised, and wouldn\u2019t set an alarm, so we were always running late,\u201d she explains. \u201cI remember at school being frustrated that I couldn\u2019t apply myself in a way that you\u2019re told is the only right way. I wanted to do it, the reading and the homework, but coordinating all of it \u2013 actually sitting in a room and making it happen \u2013 never seemed to work out.\u201d There is something freeing in the way she refuses to see this as a moral defect. \u201cBecause most people find it really easy, they assume that everyone finds it easy. They assume that those of us who don\u2019t must be lazy or not trying hard enough. But it\u2019s not true. Going to court, a week after my daughter was born, took infinitely more effort than sending off one letter.\u201d She now employs her husband to take care of all her business and life admin, and has not missed a deadline since. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t met him, all that admin would have swallowed me up.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even a small task\u00a0like clearing my inbox triggered anxiety. Now I can\u00a0acknowledge the panic and move\u00a0forward</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mammarella-D\u2019Cruz also says he can trace his own problems back to his early life, which was marked by trauma. At seven years old, he was living in a refugee camp in Uganda, separated from his father. He became the \u201cman of the family\u201d, and felt responsible for looking after his mother and younger brother. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any money or much food and I think I internalised the idea that I needed to stay out of trouble at any cost. Nowadays, it seems so easy to be \u2018in trouble\u2019. I run a successful business and have a great rapport with my clients. But outside of that, I feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of tasks we\u2019re expected to complete every day. I think for someone who didn\u2019t go through what I went through, or who hasn\u2019t experienced any significant mental health issues, it might seem more straightforward. But if you\u2019re working from a high-alert starting point, even seemingly small tasks like getting through your email backlog can trigger this incredible anxiety. You think, \u2018Who am I letting down?\u2019 and \u2018What if I\u2019ve done something wrong?\u2019 It stops you in your tracks.\u201d Like Tasker, Mammarella-D\u2019Cruz has employed his partner to help with the admin, and says, \u201cNow my wife works with me, I can just acknowledge the panic and then move forward. She makes all of that more manageable.\u201d</p> <p> Emens tells me she interviewed people of all ages about the shame of not being able to complete their to-do list. \u201cThat\u2019s a powerful emotion. Carrying shame around all the time must be pretty difficult.\u201d She\u2019s right. If I\u2019m not careful, the shame relating to my 5,203 unread emails starts to inform my opinion of myself more broadly; it is very difficult to get anything done if you are weighed down by the shame of not having done it yet.</p> <p>But in July, I achieved a life admin milestone: I paid my taxes on time. I felt a small thrill of pride at sending the money, via online banking, on the day of the deadline. I felt lighter knowing that I wouldn\u2019t have to expect a threatening letter from HMRC. This, I thought, is what <em>they</em> must feel like, the people who\u2019ve got it together \u2013 I wanted more. On Emens\u2019 advice, I\u2019ve been riding the high by making some simple changes; I\u2019ve switched all my bills to direct debits and added notes to my Google calendar to remind me of important HMRC deadlines.</p> <p>I know I\u2019m not a completely reformed character; many of those 5,000-plus emails are likely to remain unread. But I also now see that perhaps it\u2019s not helpful to set emotional stock by my efficiency. Does it really matter if you are exceptionally organised, or exceptionally haphazard? None of it speaks to the truth of who we are as people.</p> <p>And as Emens points out, \u201cEven people who avoid life admin have some really useful strategies to teach those who get it all done \u2013 namely, that there are some tasks you shouldn\u2019t devote masses of energy to, because it\u2019s not an effective use of your time.\u201d In a world where there is more junk life admin than ever before, we all need to get strategic. For me, that means that on my next holiday, my travel partner will be in charge of the visas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\"

      "bodyText": "It was the eyes that I noticed first; where before he\u2019d made soothing eye contact, now he kept his gaze averted. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked as he tapped at his computer. Eyes down, he replied, \u201cI\u2019m taking you off the flight.\u201d \u201cBut... but\u2026\u201d I stuttered. He handed my passport back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, looking at me, now flinty eyed. \u201cYou can\u2019t go to India without a visa. You\u2019ll have to go back to London.\u201d I was 18, in Schiphol airport, Amsterdam, not boarding the second half of my flight to Delhi. My mum had suggested I visit a travel agent before booking this three-week trip to the north of India and I\u2019d balked. \u201cTravel agent? Have you heard of the internet, Mum?\u201d I\u2019d booked my flights and the hotel, and although I was dimly aware that I should get a visa, the website had a tiny script and the forms seemed difficult to navigate; I clicked away and decided it would all, somehow, just work out. Of course, it didn\u2019t, because international travel rules are international travel rules. I flew back to London that same day, got a visa the next morning from the Indian consulate, and the day after boarded a new flight. Luckily, the flight I missed had been oversubscribed, so the replacement was free: the funds I\u2019d spent months scraping together were dented but not totally depleted, and I decided this was a learning experience. The next time it happened, I was 28 and en route to Heathrow, to fly to Miami with my then boyfriend. \u201cDid you get your Esta?\u201d he asked. \u201cOh, I checked and I don\u2019t need one,\u201d I blithely replied. \u201cYou do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut... but\u2026\u201d I felt the familiar sense of dread. The admin for this holiday had been on a list that included consolidating pension plans, going to the dentist, replying to at least eight emails from my accountant (I am freelance) and sewing up a hole in the arm of my favourite jacket. These were my non-crucial-but-still\u2011quite-important to-dos (although that jacket still has a hole in it, two years later). I\u2019m sure you know the feeling. According to one 2018 survey of 2,000 Brits, the average adult carries out 109 life admin tasks a year, from sorting out car insurance to paying council tax; about half the respondents admitted they struggled to keep up with household paperwork. Life admin might be at once the most boring and overwhelming anxiety of our age: look closely, and we are procrastinating and blind panicking our way into an organisational crisis. The little jobs that fill the gaps in our days like sand between stones have always been a problem for me. Filling in the forms to pay the bills that will keep the lights on and the phone working. Buying milk. Signing up in time to get the best deal. When I was 18, this was forgivable: I\u2019d grow out of it. Ten years later, less so. Now I\u2019m 31, and my inability to manage life admin has become a shameful character flaw. I tell myself I am too self-involved and not practical enough, immature and lazy. The more debit cards I have lost (I\u2019m on my seventh for this year alone), the more bills I have forgotten to pay, the more I have started to see myself as a defective person. \u201cI\u2019m so silly,\u201d became \u201cI\u2019m an idiot,\u201d became \u201cI just hate myself sometimes.\u201d I work for myself, I pay my rent and I don\u2019t rely on anyone else for money; I even do work that I enjoy. By some standards, I\u2019m successful. But my admin ineptitude still makes me feel I\u2019m lacking a fundamental piece of the \u201cadult\u201d jigsaw. The US academic and journalist Anne Helen Petersen recently diagnosed people like me with \u201cerrand paralysis\u201d, a symptom of \u201cmillennial burnout\u201d. She argues that the 2008 financial crisis, the decline of the middle class and the rise of the 1%, together with the decay of stable, full-time jobs, means our mental energy is fully trained on keeping afloat: we don\u2019t have the energy left for the smaller tasks. In this scenario, I\u2019m a victim of the always-on mentality that has come to define my generation. This analysis does help to alleviate some of my shame \u2013 but it turns out that being bad at life admin isn\u2019t just a flaky millennial thing \u2013 fully fledged adults suffer, too. When Elizabeth Emens, a professor of law at Columbia University in New York and undeniable grownup, gave a lecture on the subject, she wondered if she might be making a huge mistake. \u201cIt was different from anything I\u2019d written, or even heard presented, before,\u201d she tells me. But as she started speaking, \u201can amazing thing happened: the law professors in the audience responded intensely to the topic. At the end, people approached me to say that it was as if I were seeing into their minds and marriages.\u201d Emens went on to turn her paper into a book, The Art Of Life Admin, a project which she says grew out of her own life. \u201cI was completely overwhelmed after my second child was born, with a whole lot of work that I didn\u2019t expect would go with parenting. I knew there would be diapers to change and mouths to feed, but it didn\u2019t occur to me that there would be so much paperwork. And mental labour. And it seemed largely an invisible part of parenting.\u201d Kim Palmer, a 40-year-old CEO of a tech company from Kent, can relate to this. \u201cI have emails, WhatsApp, Slack, Trello. Bills come in different formats \u2013 paper, email, I get notifications on apps. Trying to make sense of all that is really difficult.\u201d She recently sent her son to school in his uniform instead of fancy dress. \u201cI forgot,\u201d she sighs. \u201cThat\u2019s the second time this year he was meant to go in a dress-up outfit and didn\u2019t. I do feel bad but honestly, on the never-ending list of to-dos it was near the bottom. I know I should get more organised \u2013 I have a friend who is amazing: her life is spreadsheet heaven. But running a business and a household, I\u2019ve found that unless I prioritise quite strictly, my mental health suffers.\u201d It\u2019s the same for Kenny Mammarella-D\u2019Cruz, a 55-year-old life coach. \u201cThe worst thing for me is modern society\u2019s obsession with emptying the inbox and staying on top of all our communications. Everything seems to happen faster than the speed of light,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all automated \u2013 bills, applications, reminders for medical appointments. I tried to do inbox zero for a time \u2013 it was impossible: I was constantly missing deadlines. It was a nightmare.\u201d Even professional administrators can be tripped up by personal tasks. Marie Richards, a 67-year-old retiree from Stratford-upon-Avon, spent the last 12 years of her working life as an administrator for Warwickshire police. \u201cBut at home I never did my own paperwork,\u201d she tells me. \u201cWe divided up the labour in the household; my husband did the paperwork and I attended to things related to our two daughters. I don\u2019t know, my brain just never worked that way. I never got things sorted in time. At work I was very good, but at home I switched off.\u201d When it came to pensions, though, Richards was adamant she would take charge. \u201cI did it all: the paperwork, telephone calls and anything that needed to be done online. If I\u2019m honest with you, I hated it. It made me incredibly anxious. Even now I hate receiving letters related to it, but I try not to put off opening them.\u201d Her husband, Keith Richards (not that one), also 67 and retired, suggests that we view admin more negatively now because of the huge shift in the way we perform it. \u201cA lot of my admin is keyboard-mediated \u2013 for example, I do my bank accounts online. My dad gave my mum the household cash each week and she separated it into different old handbags. If she wanted something, she\u2019d go to the relevant handbag and see what she had in notes and small change. And if you needed the bank, you had to go there. For my parents, there seemed to be fewer things to think about. I now feel bombarded with to-dos, but many of them take no time at all. I can hit a button and it\u2019s done. The quality of the interaction is different, and perhaps that\u2019s why it can feel like drudge work \u2013 there\u2019s rarely a human there.\u201d Emens argues that, \u201cCertain features of modern life make admin more pervasive. One of them is the rise of the bureaucratic state: we have more paperwork to complete, particularly around things like weddings, divorces, births and deaths. And another is technology, so admin reaches us with greater insistence and frequency. People expect us to respond to emails and texts; there\u2019s an escalation of demands.\u201d And where once we might have outsourced the business of booking a holiday, or the drudgery of filling in our tax return to an expert, we now turn to Airbnb, Skyscanner and Booking.com, or download apps such as QuickBooks. We build our own websites with Squarespace and cannibalise our lives to create content for social media. Individually each of these tasks might seem quick and painless, but as a whole they amount to a lot more work. So much, in fact, that a whole new industry has sprung up to help us keep on top of it. Take the Bullet Journal, a specially designed notebook where to-dos are mindfully broken down into bullet points. It\u2019s so popular there are now Instagram accounts, each with thousands of followers, dedicated to the art of bullet journalling. Millions of us watch \u201cadmin routine\u201d YouTube videos and follow \u201ccleanfluencers\u201d, Marie Kondo disciples who have become famous for their tips on effective life admin management, as well as cleaning. The staggering popularity of what is, essentially, watching other people manage their to-do lists, hints at an overwhelmed population desperately trying to keep on top of myriad demands. There is, of course, a spectrum of ineptitude, and I\u2019ve never let anything get so bad that it has threatened my livelihood. But there have been big oversights. I have paid for two separate phone contracts for an entire year, even though I had only one phone (I didn\u2019t realise I\u2019d been signed up to two contracts; then when I did, it took me a few months to call my phone company). And I paid a year\u2019s worth of insurance for phones I\u2019d long since lost and not claimed for. But I\u2019ve always been just organised enough to correct mistakes before the consequences became too dire. For some, though, errand paralysis can have terrifying consequences. Sara Tasker, 35, a business consultant and author of Hashtag Authentic: Finding Creativity And Building A Community On Instagram And Beyond, is \u201cawful at life admin\u201d, she tells me. \u201cI\u2019m always running out of my prescriptions because there are so many steps that you have to remember. You have to notice you\u2019re running low and then call the GP and then collect it. That chain of events always trips me up \u2013 there are too many points at which it can break down.\u201d She would frequently forget to pay her phone bill, and also to invoice for work she\u2019d done, meaning she did not have enough money to fill up her car. Then disaster struck: \u201cI sold my car and forgot to send one of the pieces of paperwork to the DVLA. I then moved house twice and never got any of my redirected letters.\u201d She missed reminders and threats of a fine, and it wasn\u2019t until bailiffs came to her house, a week after the birth of her daughter, that she realised. \u201cI had to go with my newborn to stand in court and speak in front of magistrates, and declare that I hadn\u2019t received these letters so that the fine would be cancelled.\u201d Tasker traces this chaos in her adult life to a similar atmosphere at home when she was growing up. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ate breakfast until I was 20 because my mum was just as disorganised, and wouldn\u2019t set an alarm, so we were always running late,\u201d she explains. \u201cI remember at school being frustrated that I couldn\u2019t apply myself in a way that you\u2019re told is the only right way. I wanted to do it, the reading and the homework, but coordinating all of it \u2013 actually sitting in a room and making it happen \u2013 never seemed to work out.\u201d There is something freeing in the way she refuses to see this as a moral defect. \u201cBecause most people find it really easy, they assume that everyone finds it easy. They assume that those of us who don\u2019t must be lazy or not trying hard enough. But it\u2019s not true. Going to court, a week after my daughter was born, took infinitely more effort than sending off one letter.\u201d She now employs her husband to take care of all her business and life admin, and has not missed a deadline since. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t met him, all that admin would have swallowed me up.\u201d Mammarella-D\u2019Cruz also says he can trace his own problems back to his early life, which was marked by trauma. At seven years old, he was living in a refugee camp in Uganda, separated from his father. He became the \u201cman of the family\u201d, and felt responsible for looking after his mother and younger brother. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any money or much food and I think I internalised the idea that I needed to stay out of trouble at any cost. Nowadays, it seems so easy to be \u2018in trouble\u2019. I run a successful business and have a great rapport with my clients. But outside of that, I feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of tasks we\u2019re expected to complete every day. I think for someone who didn\u2019t go through what I went through, or who hasn\u2019t experienced any significant mental health issues, it might seem more straightforward. But if you\u2019re working from a high-alert starting point, even seemingly small tasks like getting through your email backlog can trigger this incredible anxiety. You think, \u2018Who am I letting down?\u2019 and \u2018What if I\u2019ve done something wrong?\u2019 It stops you in your tracks.\u201d Like Tasker, Mammarella-D\u2019Cruz has employed his partner to help with the admin, and says, \u201cNow my wife works with me, I can just acknowledge the panic and then move forward. She makes all of that more manageable.\u201d Emens tells me she interviewed people of all ages about the shame of not being able to complete their to-do list. \u201cThat\u2019s a powerful emotion. Carrying shame around all the time must be pretty difficult.\u201d She\u2019s right. If I\u2019m not careful, the shame relating to my 5,203 unread emails starts to inform my opinion of myself more broadly; it is very difficult to get anything done if you are weighed down by the shame of not having done it yet. But in July, I achieved a life admin milestone: I paid my taxes on time. I felt a small thrill of pride at sending the money, via online banking, on the day of the deadline. I felt lighter knowing that I wouldn\u2019t have to expect a threatening letter from HMRC. This, I thought, is what they must feel like, the people who\u2019ve got it together \u2013 I wanted more. On Emens\u2019 advice, I\u2019ve been riding the high by making some simple changes; I\u2019ve switched all my bills to direct debits and added notes to my Google calendar to remind me of important HMRC deadlines. I know I\u2019m not a completely reformed character; many of those 5,000-plus emails are likely to remain unread. But I also now see that perhaps it\u2019s not helpful to set emotional stock by my efficiency. Does it really matter if you are exceptionally organised, or exceptionally haphazard? None of it speaks to the truth of who we are as people. And as Emens points out, \u201cEven people who avoid life admin have some really useful strategies to teach those who get it all done \u2013 namely, that there are some tasks you shouldn\u2019t devote masses of energy to, because it\u2019s not an effective use of your time.\u201d In a world where there is more junk life admin than ever before, we all need to get strategic. For me, that means that on my next holiday, my travel partner will be in charge of the visas. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

This is a truth that has been learned the hard way by the new film from American independent writer-director Alex Ross Perry: a daring, grungily immersive and quite brilliantly acted character study that has been saddled, for reasons best known to Perry himself, with the buzz-killing moniker <strong>Her Smell</strong>.</p> <p>Try telling people, as I have for several months now, that they should be looking out for a terrific film called <em>Her Smell </em>\u2013 only to be greeted with grimacing, nose-wrinkling, \u201cher <em>what</em>?\u201d questions and often a swift change of subject. It hasn\u2019t courted much of a crowd: after premiering to strong reviews at the Toronto film festival a year ago, the film eventually secured a tiny release in the States, grossing just over $250,000.

The way Moss plays her, as a whirligig of ego, anger, untended talent and self-loathing, makes Courtney Love look like Taylor Swift. Perry\u2019s film charts Becky\u2019s self-destruction, self-reckoning and tentative self-renewal in five kinetic, unstinting acts, with a kind of updated, pressed-to-the-glass John Cassavetes energy.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThe people who should decide whether someone\u2019s an MP are the local constituents,\u201d said Rory Stewart this week after being kicked out of the Conservative party for voting against the government to block a no-deal Brexit. \u201cIf you start controlling it from the centre, you\u2019re not really running a democracy.\u201d With talk of a snap election in which he has pledged to stand, Stewart\u2019s constituents in Penrith and the Border may make that decision very soon. Given that the seat has been Conservative since its creation in 1950 and 55% of voters opted to leave the EU, it will be a question of whether Stewart has a strong enough personal vote to be re-elected. He is well known for his political perambulations, taking long hikes around his huge constituency to talk to voters \u2013 not to mention his unconventional CV, which includes deputy governor in post-2003 Iraq and chair of an Afghan craft organisation. But while he may be treasured in the liberal media as a thoughtful oddball immune to party tribalism, some constituents \u2013 having helped him build a majority of almost 16,000 since he entered parliament in 2010 \u2013 feel his actions are unforgivable. Eric Lamb, who works in a menswear shop in Penrith, said: \u201cRory is certainly popular and I\u2019ve voted for him every time as a Conservative, but he\u2019s in a leave constituency. \u201cHe said he\u2019d respect Brexit, but he\u2019s done the opposite, so I couldn\u2019t vote for him as an independent. I do want a deal but we must be prepared to walk away. We just need to get out.\u201d In a similar vein, Nicola, from Great Salkeld, shook her head as she said: \u201cHe\u2019s done a lot for Cumbrians, but he should\u2019ve toed the party line. We voted to leave and they need to get on with it.\u201d Others have not written him off completely, noting that he did vote for Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement on all three occasions Alistair Harper, 34, a leave voter who works in his family\u2019s toy shop in Penrith and has always voted for Stewart, seemed personally torn by his MP\u2019s decision. \u201cIf there were an election I really don\u2019t know how I\u2019d vote,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just need to get on with it and leave, but I do respect his position. I think he was very brave to stick by his principles and stand up to Boris Johnson.\u201d Fourteen miles (23km) away in Appleby-in-Westmorland, Harry, 25, a charity worker, welcomed Stewart\u2019s conviction. \u201cI think Rory did the right thing and I admire him for it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked him but never voted for him because I\u2019d never vote Tory. Now that he\u2019s independent, I would. No-deal would a disaster for this country.\u201d Almost an hour\u2019s drive to the north in Wigton, Lynette Shaw, 68, concurred. \u201cRory\u2019s a brilliant politician,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve always voted Labour but now that he\u2019s independent, I might vote for him. Even though his stance is May\u2019s deal, which I think was no good, it\u2019s still better than no-deal.\u201d With many feeling political fatigue and another delay to Brexit possible, will it be his stance on no deal that ultimately decides Stewart\u2019s fate, despite his popularity? Outside Penrith station, Paul Cowperthwaite, 62, a taxi driver from Skelton, said he admired his MP but felt his vote was not being represented in parliament. \u201cI\u2019m pretty hacked off that we haven\u2019t left yet,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be appalled if we don\u2019t get an election.

What connects them all is a preoccupation with power at its overweening apogee, on the brink of combustion and collapse. Charged always with contemporary resonance, it is a fascination that in his best books comes unsettlingly close to prescience.</p> <p><em>The Second Sleep</em> is driven by the same preoccupation. Described as a \u201cgenre-bending thriller\u201d, it appears to open conventionally enough \u201clate on the afternoon of Tuesday the ninth of April in the Year of our Risen Lord 1468\u201d. A young cleric, Christopher Fairfax, is making his way resentfully to a remote corner of Wessex on the orders of his bishop to officiate at the burial of a village priest. An hour\u2019s ride past a market town where \u201cthree executed felons hung rotting from their gibbets\u201d, his aged horse sliding on the muddy road, he is afraid that he has been misdirected; that he will be caught out of doors after curfew, risking a night in jail. By the time he finally reaches his destination, he is determined to conclude his unpleasant business as swiftly as he is able.</p> <p>In his opening pages Harris conjures a lost England in its mix of religiosity and brutishness. There are moments when the details feel off \u2013 a parakeet flashes through the darkness, surely an anachronism? Were there really longcase clocks in the 15th century? \u2013 but it is only when Fairfax discovers a display cabinet in the dead priest\u2019s study, its shelves crammed with illegal artefacts, that the truth of this world is revealed. Among the plastic bottles, banknotes and toy bricks displayed there, Fairfax discovers \u201cone of the devices used by the ancients to communicate\u201d, its back marked with the ultimate symbol of their \u201chubris and blasphemy \u2013 an apple with a bite taken out of it\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ef060a1bf10f13a1130971701b0fecd744e19aa5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef060a1bf10f13a1130971701b0fecd744e19aa5/937_890_3767_4709/800.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Harris.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Harris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a stunning sleight of hand. Abruptly everything shifts, slotting those strange anachronisms into place. Fairfax\u2019s 15th century is not ours but part of a new calendar that had been reset to 666, the numeral of the Beast of Revelation. In Harris\u2019s imagined future, God has brought down the four riders of the apocalypse on the satanic civilisation of the 21st century and the church has reasserted itself at the centre of the state. \u201cScientism\u201d, the curse of the ancients, is a heresy, a mortal sin. Stripped of the medical and technological advances of the Industrial Revolution, life is once more nasty, brutish and short. It has never occurred to Fairfax to question the principles that underpin this world order but, in this remote rural backwater, he stumbles on books and papers that challenge his most fundamental beliefs. Though it is a crime to investigate the past, over the days that follow he finds himself drawn ever deeper into a quest to discover the truth.</p> <p>During the course of his career Harris has perfected the art of creating tension within a story to which we already know the ending: the Enigma codes were cracked, the eruption of Vesuvius destroyed Pompeii, the Munich Agreement did not bring peace. In <em>The Second Sleep</em> he turns the tables: this time we do not know the beginning. Twenty-first century civilisation has crashed to a catastrophic end \u2013 but why? Was it technological failure, antibiotic resistance, nuclear war? The stage seems set for a classic Harris thriller, the lowly functionary intent on challenging the entrenched interests of a secretive and ruthless state.</p> <p>Instead <em>The Second Sleep</em> develops into something more contemplative: an exploration of a world that is both unfamiliar and as old as time, and of the consequences of our flagrant disregard for the existential perils of our own era. A convincingly imagined future world requires a steady accretion of small, telling details and there are sections in Harris\u2019s novel that feel frustratingly inconsistent or approximate.

      "bodyText": "\u201cAll of my books are about power,\u201d Robert Harris acknowledged in a recent interview. While that power is most often political \u2013 the fall of a charismatic former prime minister in The Ghost, Chamberlain\u2019s struggle for peace in Munich, the failure of the Roman republic in his wonderful Cicero trilogy \u2013 he has explored its perils in other, more insidious guises: technology in The Fear Index, religion in Conclave, the devastating force of nature in Pompeii. What connects them all is a preoccupation with power at its overweening apogee, on the brink of combustion and collapse. Charged always with contemporary resonance, it is a fascination that in his best books comes unsettlingly close to prescience. The Second Sleep is driven by the same preoccupation. Described as a \u201cgenre-bending thriller\u201d, it appears to open conventionally enough \u201clate on the afternoon of Tuesday the ninth of April in the Year of our Risen Lord 1468\u201d. A young cleric, Christopher Fairfax, is making his way resentfully to a remote corner of Wessex on the orders of his bishop to officiate at the burial of a village priest. An hour\u2019s ride past a market town where \u201cthree executed felons hung rotting from their gibbets\u201d, his aged horse sliding on the muddy road, he is afraid that he has been misdirected; that he will be caught out of doors after curfew, risking a night in jail. By the time he finally reaches his destination, he is determined to conclude his unpleasant business as swiftly as he is able. In his opening pages Harris conjures a lost England in its mix of religiosity and brutishness. There are moments when the details feel off \u2013 a parakeet flashes through the darkness, surely an anachronism? Were there really longcase clocks in the 15th century? \u2013 but it is only when Fairfax discovers a display cabinet in the dead priest\u2019s study, its shelves crammed with illegal artefacts, that the truth of this world is revealed. Among the plastic bottles, banknotes and toy bricks displayed there, Fairfax discovers \u201cone of the devices used by the ancients to communicate\u201d, its back marked with the ultimate symbol of their \u201chubris and blasphemy \u2013 an apple with a bite taken out of it\u201d. It is a stunning sleight of hand. Abruptly everything shifts, slotting those strange anachronisms into place. Fairfax\u2019s 15th century is not ours but part of a new calendar that had been reset to 666, the numeral of the Beast of Revelation. In Harris\u2019s imagined future, God has brought down the four riders of the apocalypse on the satanic civilisation of the 21st century and the church has reasserted itself at the centre of the state. \u201cScientism\u201d, the curse of the ancients, is a heresy, a mortal sin. Stripped of the medical and technological advances of the Industrial Revolution, life is once more nasty, brutish and short. It has never occurred to Fairfax to question the principles that underpin this world order but, in this remote rural backwater, he stumbles on books and papers that challenge his most fundamental beliefs. Though it is a crime to investigate the past, over the days that follow he finds himself drawn ever deeper into a quest to discover the truth. During the course of his career Harris has perfected the art of creating tension within a story to which we already know the ending: the Enigma codes were cracked, the eruption of Vesuvius destroyed Pompeii, the Munich Agreement did not bring peace. In The Second Sleep he turns the tables: this time we do not know the beginning. Twenty-first century civilisation has crashed to a catastrophic end \u2013 but why? Was it technological failure, antibiotic resistance, nuclear war? The stage seems set for a classic Harris thriller, the lowly functionary intent on challenging the entrenched interests of a secretive and ruthless state. Instead The Second Sleep develops into something more contemplative: an exploration of a world that is both unfamiliar and as old as time, and of the consequences of our flagrant disregard for the existential perils of our own era. A convincingly imagined future world requires a steady accretion of small, telling details and there are sections in Harris\u2019s novel that feel frustratingly inconsistent or approximate. But if his dystopia lacks the political and social coherence of, say, Gilead in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, he has contrived in The Second Sleep to do something rather brilliant and new. He has put us at the heart of the mystery. Whatever disaster has struck the world it has struck because of us, our greed and ambition, our arrogance. We are all responsible. As Fairfax edges closer to the truth, the reader is left with at least as many questions as answers, and most of those questions are directed at ourselves. \u2022 Clare Clark\u2019s In the Full Light of the Sun is published by Virago.

Fancy furniture, paintings on the walls. But it was his home.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/17/jean-luc-brunel-jeffrey-epstein-models-sexual-assault\">Jean-Luc Brunel: three former models say they were sexually assaulted by Jeffrey Epstein friend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not long before, Huisman had met Jean-Luc Brunel in a chocolate shop round the corner from Models Office, the Brussels agency that had just begun to represent her. Its owners, Pierre and Marielou Eggermont, had said she must see him.</p> <p>He was in his mid-40s and a charmer. \u201cHe said: \u2018You\u2019re unbelievable. You\u2019re stunning. You must come to Paris, right away. I can make you a star,\u2019\u201d says Huisman, now a TV editor-in-chief, sitting in the kitchen of her home in a neat new suburb of Amsterdam.</p> <p>Her agents were sure: Brunel could launch her. Karin Models, his agency, had done it before and would do it again: Monica Bellucci, Sharon Stone, Christy Turlington, Jerry Hall, Milla Jovovich \u2013 all, <a href=\"https://www.pr.com/press-release/418694\">Brunel has since claimed</a>, owe their careers to him.</p> <p>So Huisman, 46, went to Paris. She was so special that she was to stay in his apartment, Brunel told her. But within a week she had left, because on her fourth or fifth night, she says, Brunel \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/06/modelling-scout-jean-luc-brunel-jeffrey-epstein\">who has been accused of supplying</a> the late Jeffrey Epstein, his close friend, with underage girls \u2013 spiked her drink and raped her.</p> <p>Allegations of misconduct against Brunel date back decades, but he has faced no action. Huisman and two other former models have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/17/jean-luc-brunel-jeffrey-epstein-models-sexual-assault\">told the Guardian they were sexually assaulted</a> by Brunel in the 1980s and 1990s in and around Paris, where he was a power player in the global fashion industry.</p> <p>Brunel and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment. In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/06/modelling-scout-jean-luc-brunel-jeffrey-epstein\">2015 statement</a>, Brunel vehemently denied involvement \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d in Epstein\u2019s crimes. \u201cI strongly deny having committed any illicit act or any wrongdoing in the course of my work as a scouter or model agencies manager,\u201d he said then.</p> <p>But from the first evening Huisman met Brunel, she says, relating the events of 28 years ago with calm but clearly painful precision, the Frenchman was \u201ccoming on to me. Really flirting. Like in a jokey way on one level, saying I was so lovely, that we\u2019d get married one day. But then also more menacing.</p> <p>\u201cSo when I asked where I was supposed to sleep, he said: \u2018Oh, my bed, of course.\u2019 One time, later, he came into the closet where I was, locked the door behind him, and told me: \u2018You know, one day we\u2019re going to have sex.\u2019 I kept him away, made a joke of it, told him he was too old for me, and too short. A short, old Frenchman.\u201d</p> <p>But Huisman felt deeply uncomfortable. \u201cThere were lots of other girls there, some I recognised from magazines,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe half a dozen. Young girls, certainly some underage, from Czechoslovakia, Russia, Yugoslavia. They looked \u2026 sad. And these older, much older businessmen. It was obvious they were sleeping together.\u201d</p> <p>Part of her wondered whether this was all simply normal for the fashion industry. Part of her realised it could not possibly be right. And part of her thought: \u201cI want to be a model, the whole world awaits, and this man can make it happen. I just have to be careful. Not drink. Stay in control. Keep focused. I thought I could handle it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2118548166b658b129b98a7df7cef83f66785402\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2118548166b658b129b98a7df7cef83f66785402/0_0_4819_6873/701.jpg\" alt=\"Thysia Huisman was an 18-year-old model in 1991 who stayed at Jean-Luc Brunel\u2019s apartment.\" width=\"701\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thysia Huisman was an 18-year-old model in 1991 who stayed at Jean-Luc Brunel\u2019s apartment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Thysia Huisman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first night, she slept on blankets on the floor of another girl\u2019s room. The next day, Brunel\u2019s assistant Pamela took her to the agency and to lunch. The third day there was a test shoot, and a couple of go-sees \u2013 preliminary castings for multiple jobs. Every night there were dinners, groups of 15 or 20, in expensive restaurants.</p> <p>One night, Brunel told Huisman that she could have a career in the movies too, and that \u201chis good friend the CEO of Miramax \u2013 I realised later, Harvey Weinstein \u2013 would be in Paris the following week, so I should really meet him.\u201d</p> <p>Another evening, there was a man with wavy hair, in a black turtleneck sweater, black-and-white checked trousers. Quite striking. \u201cIt was \u2013 I\u2019m not 100% sure, I couldn\u2019t swear it,\u201d she says. \u201cBut years later, when Epstein was in jail for 13 months, all over the news \u2026 I saw him and I thought, I <em>know</em> that man.\u201d</p> <p>On what was to be her final night in Paris, after a restaurant and nightclub, the party returned to Brunel\u2019s flat, Huisman says. \u201cHe gave me a drink. I don\u2019t know what it was, a mixed drink of some kind, he said he made it specially for me. I drank it and straight away I started feeling tired, woozy.\u201d</p> <p>Her recollections after that, she says, are \u201cvague, but with really clear, like, snapshots \u2013 like a fuzzy, unclear movie, all in slow motion, but with a few super-sharp stills. I remember he took me to his room, laid me on his bed, said I should relax. I recall him lying on top of me, me trying to push him off.</p> <p>\u201cI remember trying to move, but not really being able to. Like almost being paralysed. I heard the sound of my blouse, a black blouse, ripping. I had a black skirt, too. I felt him \u2013 this is difficult \u2013 between my legs. Pushing.\u201d</p> <p>She was awoken the next morning, Huisman says, when Brunel\u2019s butler (he employed an Indian couple as cook and factotum) came in with a cup of tea. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem surprised to see me there,\u201d she says. \u201cJean-Luc wasn\u2019t there. But I \u2026 felt we had had sex. I had marks, bruises, on my inner thighs. I knew. I know.\u201d</p> <p>She was naked but for a kimono that was not hers, her clothes in a pile on the floor. \u201cI just ran,\u201d she says. \u201cI was scared. I grabbed my clothes, rushed to the other girl\u2019s room, got my backpack and left. Like a thief in the night. He was on the phone in the living room. I was scared what he would say.\u201d</p> <p>On the street, she says, all the buildings \u201cwere like \u2026 moving. Everything sounded really loud. I felt totally disconnected.\u201d</p> <p>Huisman mentioned the incident to her Dutch boyfriend, she said, but in the vaguest terms, and told no one else. \u201cI was really ashamed,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt really stupid. Guilty. Angry with myself.\u201d Over the years, she said, she told various friends of an \u201cunpleasant incident\u201d in Paris. \u201cI buried it, really,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Her current partner, whom she met eight years ago, says she told him soon after they got together that she had been \u201cmolested\u201d. More details emerged gradually over time, he says, until, two years ago, he heard the whole ugly story.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of things happened at the same time,\u201d says Huisman. \u201cI started therapy and it came up. The #MeToo movement really stirred something in me. I began looking into Brunel; saw the scandals he was implicated in; realised the ties to Epstein; talked to women with similar experiences \u2026 It feels good to have brought it all out of the dark, to realise I was not the only one and it was not my fault.\u201d</p> <p>Justice may be too late for Epstein, who was found dead in his cell earlier this month while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. But she hopes Brunel will be prosecuted, even if he is now in his 70s.

      "bodyText": "Thysia Huisman had just turned 18 when, late one evening in September 1991, she arrived before the door of an imposing apartment building on avenue Hoche in central Paris carrying a small backpack and three photographs from her portfolio. A young would-be model from Leiden in the Netherlands, she was impressed, but also alarmed. \u201cIt was very grand,\u201d she says. \u201cA vast, grand apartment, right by the Arc de Triomphe. Fancy furniture, paintings on the walls. But it was his home.\u201d Not long before, Huisman had met Jean-Luc Brunel in a chocolate shop round the corner from Models Office, the Brussels agency that had just begun to represent her. Its owners, Pierre and Marielou Eggermont, had said she must see him. He was in his mid-40s and a charmer. \u201cHe said: \u2018You\u2019re unbelievable. You\u2019re stunning. You must come to Paris, right away. I can make you a star,\u2019\u201d says Huisman, now a TV editor-in-chief, sitting in the kitchen of her home in a neat new suburb of Amsterdam. Her agents were sure: Brunel could launch her. Karin Models, his agency, had done it before and would do it again: Monica Bellucci, Sharon Stone, Christy Turlington, Jerry Hall, Milla Jovovich \u2013 all, Brunel has since claimed, owe their careers to him. So Huisman, 46, went to Paris. She was so special that she was to stay in his apartment, Brunel told her. But within a week she had left, because on her fourth or fifth night, she says, Brunel \u2013 who has been accused of supplying the late Jeffrey Epstein, his close friend, with underage girls \u2013 spiked her drink and raped her. Allegations of misconduct against Brunel date back decades, but he has faced no action. Huisman and two other former models have told the Guardian they were sexually assaulted by Brunel in the 1980s and 1990s in and around Paris, where he was a power player in the global fashion industry. Brunel and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment. In a 2015 statement, Brunel vehemently denied involvement \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d in Epstein\u2019s crimes. \u201cI strongly deny having committed any illicit act or any wrongdoing in the course of my work as a scouter or model agencies manager,\u201d he said then. But from the first evening Huisman met Brunel, she says, relating the events of 28 years ago with calm but clearly painful precision, the Frenchman was \u201ccoming on to me. Really flirting. Like in a jokey way on one level, saying I was so lovely, that we\u2019d get married one day. But then also more menacing. \u201cSo when I asked where I was supposed to sleep, he said: \u2018Oh, my bed, of course.\u2019 One time, later, he came into the closet where I was, locked the door behind him, and told me: \u2018You know, one day we\u2019re going to have sex.\u2019 I kept him away, made a joke of it, told him he was too old for me, and too short. A short, old Frenchman.\u201d But Huisman felt deeply uncomfortable. \u201cThere were lots of other girls there, some I recognised from magazines,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe half a dozen. Young girls, certainly some underage, from Czechoslovakia, Russia, Yugoslavia. They looked \u2026 sad. And these older, much older businessmen. It was obvious they were sleeping together.\u201d Part of her wondered whether this was all simply normal for the fashion industry. Part of her realised it could not possibly be right. And part of her thought: \u201cI want to be a model, the whole world awaits, and this man can make it happen. I just have to be careful. Not drink. Stay in control. Keep focused. I thought I could handle it.\u201d The first night, she slept on blankets on the floor of another girl\u2019s room. The next day, Brunel\u2019s assistant Pamela took her to the agency and to lunch. The third day there was a test shoot, and a couple of go-sees \u2013 preliminary castings for multiple jobs. Every night there were dinners, groups of 15 or 20, in expensive restaurants. One night, Brunel told Huisman that she could have a career in the movies too, and that \u201chis good friend the CEO of Miramax \u2013 I realised later, Harvey Weinstein \u2013 would be in Paris the following week, so I should really meet him.\u201d Another evening, there was a man with wavy hair, in a black turtleneck sweater, black-and-white checked trousers. Quite striking. \u201cIt was \u2013 I\u2019m not 100% sure, I couldn\u2019t swear it,\u201d she says. \u201cBut years later, when Epstein was in jail for 13 months, all over the news \u2026 I saw him and I thought, I know that man.\u201d On what was to be her final night in Paris, after a restaurant and nightclub, the party returned to Brunel\u2019s flat, Huisman says. \u201cHe gave me a drink. I don\u2019t know what it was, a mixed drink of some kind, he said he made it specially for me. I drank it and straight away I started feeling tired, woozy.\u201d Her recollections after that, she says, are \u201cvague, but with really clear, like, snapshots \u2013 like a fuzzy, unclear movie, all in slow motion, but with a few super-sharp stills. I remember he took me to his room, laid me on his bed, said I should relax. I recall him lying on top of me, me trying to push him off. \u201cI remember trying to move, but not really being able to. Like almost being paralysed. I heard the sound of my blouse, a black blouse, ripping. I had a black skirt, too. I felt him \u2013 this is difficult \u2013 between my legs. Pushing.\u201d She was awoken the next morning, Huisman says, when Brunel\u2019s butler (he employed an Indian couple as cook and factotum) came in with a cup of tea. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem surprised to see me there,\u201d she says. \u201cJean-Luc wasn\u2019t there. But I \u2026 felt we had had sex. I had marks, bruises, on my inner thighs. I knew. I know.\u201d She was naked but for a kimono that was not hers, her clothes in a pile on the floor. \u201cI just ran,\u201d she says. \u201cI was scared. I grabbed my clothes, rushed to the other girl\u2019s room, got my backpack and left. Like a thief in the night. He was on the phone in the living room. I was scared what he would say.\u201d On the street, she says, all the buildings \u201cwere like \u2026 moving. Everything sounded really loud. I felt totally disconnected.\u201d Huisman mentioned the incident to her Dutch boyfriend, she said, but in the vaguest terms, and told no one else. \u201cI was really ashamed,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt really stupid. Guilty. Angry with myself.\u201d Over the years, she said, she told various friends of an \u201cunpleasant incident\u201d in Paris. \u201cI buried it, really,\u201d she says. Her current partner, whom she met eight years ago, says she told him soon after they got together that she had been \u201cmolested\u201d. More details emerged gradually over time, he says, until, two years ago, he heard the whole ugly story. \u201cA lot of things happened at the same time,\u201d says Huisman. \u201cI started therapy and it came up. The #MeToo movement really stirred something in me. I began looking into Brunel; saw the scandals he was implicated in; realised the ties to Epstein; talked to women with similar experiences \u2026 It feels good to have brought it all out of the dark, to realise I was not the only one and it was not my fault.\u201d Justice may be too late for Epstein, who was found dead in his cell earlier this month while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. But she hopes Brunel will be prosecuted, even if he is now in his 70s. She has consulted a French lawyer and is considering filing a formal complaint in Paris. \u201cI hope he gets punished, and the whole modelling industry gets a shake-up,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not deluded; I don\u2019t imagine my story will change everything. But if a few more parents are made aware, if a few more industry figures realise these predators exist \u2026 Because, look, what really makes me angry \u2013 I called Marielou [Eggermont], from my very first agency in Brussels, this winter. \u201cI recorded the call.

She parlayed that profile boost into regular appearances on MTV\u2019s comedy commentary show <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/shows/girl-code\">Girl Code </a>and then \u2013 suddenly \u2013 a series of scene-stealing roles in Hollywood movies including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/05/oceans-8-review-rating-all-female-reboot\">Ocean\u2019s Eight</a> and Crazy Rich Asians. Now, she has recast herself once again with an understated and subtly devastating starring role in The Farewell, in which she plays Billi, a disaffected millennial grappling with cultural identity and familial bonds while visiting her dying grandmother in China.</p> <p>Down the line from LA, where she has been fulfilling contractual obligations at <a href=\"https://d23.com/\">Disney fan expo D23</a>, Lum denies this latest left-turn into drama was deliberate. Rather, the plot of the film resonated strongly with her. The Farewell centres on Billi\u2019s touching relationship with her grandma; in real life Lum\u2019s is even closer. When she was four her mother died, and so she was raised by her Chinese paternal grandmother. But she wasn\u2019t just a guardian: she was an inspiration, a \u201cmatriarch\u201d and \u201cthe support system for so many of us. She worked three jobs and taught me that sex has no part in what your worth is.\u201d</p> <p>Yet The Farewell isn\u2019t only concerned with intergenerational ties; it is also a fish-out-of-water drama that sees Billi reckoning with her Chinese heritage. Like Crazy Rich Asians, it features a visit to China by an Asian-American protagonist who finds the world they are faced with at once familiar and deeply strange. In her 20s, Lum went on a similar journey. Having \u201cspent a good part of my childhood not having a strong identity in terms of that world\u201d, she decided to move to China to study the language. But rather than finding herself, the experience left her even more lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f18642cdffeb17db02ade175636062a1efb22b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f18642cdffeb17db02ade175636062a1efb22b0/268_45_3009_1806/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sandra Bullock, Sarah Paulson, Rihanna, Cate Blanchett and Awkwafina in Ocean\u2019s Eight.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Honour among thieves...

      "bodyText": "Nora Lum\u2019s voice is deep and distinctive \u2013 a husky New York drawl that rings with both world-weariness and barely constrained mirth. That voice, which Lum \u2013 who goes by the name of her outlandish rap alter ego Awkwafina, a moniker inspired by her general awkwardness \u2013 has said makes her sound like a \u201c58-year-old divorce attorney\u201d or \u201cSatan\u201d, is now her calling card. It is the connective tissue that runs through her decidedly scattershot career. You can hear it on the 30-year-old\u2019s comedy-rap records, in her stint as a talkshow host, during her winningly bonkers turn in Crazy Rich Asians and her poignant performance in this summer\u2019s US box-office hit The Farewell. Soon, it will be reaching millions more ears thanks to her lead roles in blockbuster Disney property (Raya and the Last Dragon and the live-action The Little Mermaid, if you believe the rumours), the new SpongeBob SquarePants movie, and her autobiographical, eponymous Comedy Central sitcom. In a nutshell, Lum is \u201cjust your average Asian trumpet player-turned-rapper-turned-actress\u201d \u2013 as she drolly put it during her Saturday Night Live opening monologue last year. And that\u2019s her underplaying the complexity of her trajectory. After an adolescent infatuation with the brass instrument, in 2012 she became a comedy-rap star, winning YouTube fame with her genitalia-based trash-talk track My Vag.

This wasn\u2019t quite how I meant it to begin. Never mind. I say my piece as drafted, she listens. No eye contact so no stress. I keep it short and cool. \u2018So there you are, Steff, now you have it. I\u2019ve been living a necessary lie, and that\u2019s all I\u2019m allowed to tell you. I may look like a failure, but I do have a certain status in my own Service.\u2019 She doesn\u2019t say anything. We reach the top, uncouple and set off down the hill, still nothing said. She\u2019s faster than I am, or likes to think she is, so I let her have her head. We meet up again at the bottom of the lift.</p> <p>Standing in the queue we don\u2019t speak to each other and she doesn\u2019t look in my direction, but that doesn\u2019t disconcert me. Steff lives in her world, well now she knows I live in mine too, and it\u2019s not some knacker\u2019s yard for Foreign Office low-flyers. She\u2019s in front of me so she grabs the T-bar first. We have barely set off before she asks in a matter-of-fact voice whether I\u2019ve ever killed anyone. I chuckle, say no, Steff, absolutely not, thank God, which is true. Others have, if only indirectly, but I haven\u2019t. Not even arm\u2019s length or third flag, not even as the Office calls it, <em>deniable authorship</em>.</p> <p>\u2018Well if you <em>haven\u2019t </em>killed anyone, what\u2019s the <em>next</em>-worst thing you\u2019ve done as a spy?\u2019 \u2013 in the same casual tone.</p> <p>\u2018Well, Steff, I suppose the <em>next </em>worst I\u2019ve done is persuade chaps to do things they might not have done if I hadn\u2019t talked them into it, so to speak.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Bad things?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Arguably. Depends which side of the fence you\u2019re on.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Such as what, for instance?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Well, betray their country for starters.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018And you persuaded them to do that?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018If they hadn\u2019t persuaded themselves already, yes.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Just <em>chaps</em>, or did you persuade <em>female </em>chaps too?\u2019 \u2013 which if you\u2019d heard Steff on the subject of feminism is not as light-hearted as it might otherwise sound.</p> <p>\u2018Largely male chaps, Steff. Yes, men, overwhelmingly men,\u2019 I assure her.</p> <p>We have reached the top. We again uncouple and descend, Steff streaking ahead. Once more we meet at the bottom of the lift. No queue. Until now she has pushed her goggles up on to her forehead for the ride. This time she leaves them in place. They\u2019re the mirrored kind that you can\u2019t see into.</p> <p>\u2018Persuade <em>how </em>exactly?\u2019 she resumes as soon as we set off.</p> <p>\u2018Well, we\u2019re not talking <em>thumbscrews</em>, Steff,\u2019 I reply, which is pilot error on my part: <em>Humour at serious moments is simply an escape route as far as Steff\u2019s concerned.</em></p> <p>\u2018So how?\u2019 she persists, gnawing at the subject of persuasion.</p> <p>\u2018Well, Steff, a lot of people will do a lot of things for <em>money </em>and a lot of people will do things for <em>spite </em>or <em>ego</em>. There are also people who do things for an <em>ideal</em>, and wouldn\u2019t take your money if you shoved it down their throats.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018And what ideal would that be exactly, <em>Dad </em>?\u2019 \u2013 from behind the shiny goggles. It\u2019s the first time for weeks that she\u2019s called me Dad. Also I notice that she is not swearing, which with Steff can be a bit of a red warning light.</p> <p>\u2018Well, let\u2019s say, just for instance, somebody has an idealistic vision of England as the mother of all democracies. Or they love our dear Queen with an unexplained fervour. It may not be an England that exists for <em>us </em>any more, if it ever did, but they think it does, so go with it.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Do <em>you </em>think it does?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018With reservations.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Serious reservations?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Well, who wouldn\u2019t have, for Christ\u2019s sake?\u2019 I reply, stung by the suggestion that I\u2019ve somehow failed to notice that the country\u2019s in free fall. \u2018A minority Tory cabinet of tenth-raters. A pig- ignorant foreign secretary who I\u2019m supposed to be serving. Labour no better. The sheer bloody lunacy of Brexit\u2019 \u2013 I break off. I have feelings too. Let my indignant silence say the rest.</p> <p>\u2018Then you <em>do </em>have serious reservations?\u2019 she insists in her purest tone. \u2018Even very serious. Yes?\u2019</p> <p>Too late I realise I have left myself wide open, but perhaps that was what I wanted to achieve all along: to give her the victory, acknowledge I\u2019m not up to the standards of her brilliant professors, and then we can all go back to being who we were.</p> <p>\u2018So if I\u2019ve got this right,\u2019 she resumes, as we embark on our next ascent, \u2018for the sake of a country that you have serious reservations about, even <em>very </em>serious, you persuade <em>other </em>nationals to betray their <em>own </em>countries.\u2019 And as an afterthought: \u2018The reason being that <em>they </em>don\u2019t share the same reservations that <em>you </em>have about <em>your </em>country, whereas they <em>do </em>have reservations about their own country. Yes?\u2019</p> <p>At which I let out a merry exclamation that accepts honourable defeat while simultaneously asking for mitigation: \u2018But they\u2019re not innocent lambs, Steff! They <em>volunteer. </em>Or most of them do. And we look after them. We welfare them. If it\u2019s money they\u2019re after, we give them a pot of it. If they\u2019re into God, we do God with them. It\u2019s whatever works, Steff. We\u2019re their friends. They trust us. We provide for their needs. They provide for ours. It\u2019s the way of the world.\u2019</p> <p>But she\u2019s not interested in the way of the world. She\u2019s interested in mine, as becomes apparent on the next ride up: When you were telling <em>other </em>people who to be, did you ever consider who <em>you </em>were?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I just knew I was on the right side, Steff,\u2019 I reply.</p>",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nationwide\" title=\"\">Nationwide</a> has announced a major downgrade to its popular \u00a313-a-month FlexPlus current account, leaving thousands of customers wondering whether it is still worth paying \u00a3156 a year for what it provides.</p> <p>The building society started sending out letters this week to customers with the \u201cbest buy\u201d packaged account, which comes with decent travel and breakdown insurance, and offers monthly credit interest payments.</p> <p>However, from 1 November, customers will no longer be paid the 3% interest on credit balances of up to \u00a32,500, which was worth up to \u00a375 a year or \u00a36.25 a month for those who maintained that amount and was, for many, one of the main attractions of the account.</p> <p>Also being withdrawn is the fee-free \u00a3250 overdraft buffer. Instead, those going overdrawn will pay a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jul/25/nationwide-overdraft-rate-banks-fca-fees\" title=\"\">39.9% APR interest rate</a>. Gone too is the \u00a35-a-day fee for those straying outside their agreed overdraft limit.</p> <p>Nationwide says the interest withdrawal reflects the higher cost of maintaining the account, in particular providing family travel insurance, which includes winter sports and golf cover up until the account holder\u2019s 70th birthday. This popular insurance, which could easily cost \u00a3120 a year to buy on its own, offers good cover that will help customers in the event that their airline collapses or they miss a flight for reasons beyond their control.</p> <p>Account holders will continue to receive UK and European car breakdown cover, which provides for two cars for joint account holders and comes with home recovery. To replace this would cost at least \u00a3110 a year if bought from the RAC/AA, or <a href=\"https://autoaidbreakdown.co.uk/personal-based-cover/\" title=\"\">\u00a360 a year from AutoAid.</a></p> <p>Nationwide, which has nearly 8 million current account holders, has also downgraded its mobile phone insurance by upping the excess paid in the event of a claim. The excess on claims for damaged or broken phones will be \u00a375 for Apple handsets and \u00a350 for other handsets, up from \u00a350 and \u00a325 respectively. If the phone is lost or stolen, the excess will be \u00a3125 for Apple handsets and \u00a3100 for the rest. In many cases, this makes the cover pointless.</p> <p>So is FlexPlus still worth it? The short answer is yes, in certain circumstances. If you are a family with dependent children still in school or university, who regularly go on holidays abroad \u2013 and in particular head outside Europe or go skiing \u2013 then the travel insurance is almost worth it on its own. If you all own expensive mobiles and drive a car then it is doubly so.</p> <p>However, if you only take holidays once or twice a year \u2013 always at home or in Europe \u2013 and rarely if ever use your car abroad, there is a case for downgrading to a basic, fee-free FlexAccount instead.</p> <p>Decent Europe-only travel insurance for a family can be bought cheaply enough at about \u00a360 for an annual policy, or \u00a316 by the week. If you have no children or they have long flown the nest, or you are about to turn 70, or you regularly go overdrawn, there is a strong case to drop the account.</p> <p>It is a similar story if you have a newish car that includes breakdown cover as part of the warranty.</p> <p>Account holders should also ask if they are ever likely to claim on the mobile insurance. If you have a basic \u00a3100-\u00a3150 Android handset, it will probably not be worth claiming, particularly when you find out the insurer will not pay out in cash. If you claim, you will soon discover the insurer insists on repairing your handset itself, or sending you a replacement \u2013 which can take weeks to arrive \u2013 and by which time many people will simply have gone out and bought another phone.</p> <p>On the plus side, FlexPlus account holders will continue to be able to make fee-free cash withdrawals worldwide, which could be worth \u00a340 a year to frequent travellers. Those ditching the account could buy a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jun/08/travel-spending-put-your-kids-cash-on-a-card-before-they-go\" title=\"\">Caxton FX prepaid card instead</a> and retain the same benefit.</p> <p>Chris Rhodes, an executive director at Nationwide, defended the changes. \u201cAs a mutual, Nationwide is not driven by profit. However, we are not immune to inflationary pressures and we need to make some essential changes to our FlexPlus account,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cMembers tell us that the quality of the insurances and the monthly fee are the most important aspects of a packaged account, which is why we have improved some of the insurance benefits and maintain[ed] the monthly fee, rather than retain the interest rate.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nationwide has announced a major downgrade to its popular \u00a313-a-month FlexPlus current account, leaving thousands of customers wondering whether it is still worth paying \u00a3156 a year for what it provides. The building society started sending out letters this week to customers with the \u201cbest buy\u201d packaged account, which comes with decent travel and breakdown insurance, and offers monthly credit interest payments. However, from 1 November, customers will no longer be paid the 3% interest on credit balances of up to \u00a32,500, which was worth up to \u00a375 a year or \u00a36.25 a month for those who maintained that amount and was, for many, one of the main attractions of the account. Also being withdrawn is the fee-free \u00a3250 overdraft buffer. Instead, those going overdrawn will pay a 39.9% APR interest rate. Gone too is the \u00a35-a-day fee for those straying outside their agreed overdraft limit. Nationwide says the interest withdrawal reflects the higher cost of maintaining the account, in particular providing family travel insurance, which includes winter sports and golf cover up until the account holder\u2019s 70th birthday. This popular insurance, which could easily cost \u00a3120 a year to buy on its own, offers good cover that will help customers in the event that their airline collapses or they miss a flight for reasons beyond their control. Account holders will continue to receive UK and European car breakdown cover, which provides for two cars for joint account holders and comes with home recovery. To replace this would cost at least \u00a3110 a year if bought from the RAC/AA, or \u00a360 a year from AutoAid. Nationwide, which has nearly 8 million current account holders, has also downgraded its mobile phone insurance by upping the excess paid in the event of a claim. The excess on claims for damaged or broken phones will be \u00a375 for Apple handsets and \u00a350 for other handsets, up from \u00a350 and \u00a325 respectively. If the phone is lost or stolen, the excess will be \u00a3125 for Apple handsets and \u00a3100 for the rest. In many cases, this makes the cover pointless. So is FlexPlus still worth it? The short answer is yes, in certain circumstances. If you are a family with dependent children still in school or university, who regularly go on holidays abroad \u2013 and in particular head outside Europe or go skiing \u2013 then the travel insurance is almost worth it on its own. If you all own expensive mobiles and drive a car then it is doubly so. However, if you only take holidays once or twice a year \u2013 always at home or in Europe \u2013 and rarely if ever use your car abroad, there is a case for downgrading to a basic, fee-free FlexAccount instead. Decent Europe-only travel insurance for a family can be bought cheaply enough at about \u00a360 for an annual policy, or \u00a316 by the week. If you have no children or they have long flown the nest, or you are about to turn 70, or you regularly go overdrawn, there is a strong case to drop the account. It is a similar story if you have a newish car that includes breakdown cover as part of the warranty. Account holders should also ask if they are ever likely to claim on the mobile insurance. If you have a basic \u00a3100-\u00a3150 Android handset, it will probably not be worth claiming, particularly when you find out the insurer will not pay out in cash. If you claim, you will soon discover the insurer insists on repairing your handset itself, or sending you a replacement \u2013 which can take weeks to arrive \u2013 and by which time many people will simply have gone out and bought another phone. On the plus side, FlexPlus account holders will continue to be able to make fee-free cash withdrawals worldwide, which could be worth \u00a340 a year to frequent travellers. Those ditching the account could buy a Caxton FX prepaid card instead and retain the same benefit. Chris Rhodes, an executive director at Nationwide, defended the changes. \u201cAs a mutual, Nationwide is not driven by profit. However, we are not immune to inflationary pressures and we need to make some essential changes to our FlexPlus account,\u201d he said. \u201cMembers tell us that the quality of the insurances and the monthly fee are the most important aspects of a packaged account, which is why we have improved some of the insurance benefits and maintain[ed] the monthly fee, rather than retain the interest rate.\u201d",

But what choice does one have when the death of a once towering figure raises complex emotions, and not in a good way?</p> \n<p>On 18 April 1980, Zimbabwe was born. In a colourful celebration that started the previous night at Rufaro stadium in Harare (then known as Salisbury), the independence flame was lit. Bob Marley sang <a href=\"https://scroll.in/video/858142/today-a-coup-in-1980-independence-watch-bob-marley-at-zimbabwes-freedom-celebrations\" title=\"\">Zimbabwe</a>, a song he\u2019d written at the invitation of the government. Hope filled the air as Robert Gabriel Mugabe, the nation\u2019s first prime minister, took his oath of office and swore allegiance to the new nation. Julius Nyerere, the leader of Tanzania, prophetically cautioned Mugabe, saying: \u201cYou have inherited a jewel in Africa. Don\u2019t tarnish it.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/06/zimbabwes-intellectual-despot-how-mugabe-became-africas-fallen-angel\">Zimbabwe's intellectual despot: how Mugabe became Africa's fallen angel</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Mugabe represented the birth and hope of a new era. Eloquent, ideologically clear and popular, he represented what many a Zimbabwean and parent at the time wished for the next generation. The optimism was not unfounded. Mugabe was a teacher by profession. He declared education a basic human right and changed the constitution to recognise primary and secondary public education as free and compulsory \u2013 a policy that woud reap dividends for decades to come. He preached unity, his aspiration for a non-racial society, and his belief in the rule of law and democracy.</p> \n<p>It is the Mugabe of this moment that plunged many Zimbabweans into a feeling of conflict when his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/06/robert-mugabe-former-zimbabwean-president-dies-aged-95\" title=\"\">death was announced</a> on Friday morning. While his legacy to many Africans across the continent is that of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/06/hero-turned-tyrant-international-reaction-robert-mugabe-death\" title=\"\">revolutionary hero</a> who championed the continent\u2019s liberation struggle, this image of him presents an incomplete picture. Though he was admittedly a master politician, many Zimbabweans were killed, tortured and brutalised as he entrenched his insatiable grip on power. The unromantic part of his legacy must not be ignored.</p> \n<p>While revolutionary and eloquent in his speeches, Mugabe tarnished a precious jewel with violence, economic mismanagement and repression. In the 37 years he ruled over Zimbabwe, a dark cloud of broken hope replaced the promise of a bright future. We were left poorer and damaged for it. His ousting in a coup orchestrated by some of his trusted comrades and generals was tragic but celebrated by the masses.</p> \n<p>In the early 1980s, Mugabe\u2019s proclivity for violence was already evident. Insecure about his enemies, he established the notorious Fifth Brigade, a military group that was trained by the North Koreans. Between 1983 and 1987, Mugabe deployed the brigade into Matabeleland, in the south of Zimbabwe. The brigade oversaw a campaign of beatings, arson, public executions and massacres. This period came to be known as Gukurahundi, a term drawn from a Shona word that means \u201cthe wind that sweeps away the chaff before the rains\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace documented at least 2,000 deaths but estimated that figure was more than 8,000. Other groups believe the death toll could be as high as 20,000. Throughout his decades of rule, Mugabe never afforded justice to the survivors and victims of Gukurahundi, although he later acknowledged that \u201cthousands\u201d had been killed, and he called the massacres \u201ca moment of madness\u201d.</p> \n<p>During the 1990s, Zimbabwe\u2019s economy steadily contracted. Unemployment rose threefold, average wages were lower and, by 2000, living standards were a pale shadow of what they\u2019d been in 1980. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/09/zimbabwe\" title=\"\">economic crisis</a> reached a climax in mid-November 2008 when year-on-year inflation reached <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevehanke/2017/10/28/zimbabwe-hyperinflates-again-entering-the-record-books-for-a-second-time-in-less-than-a-decade/\" title=\"\">89.7 sextillion per cent</a>. This period was characterised by food shortages, empty shelves and the failure of the Zimbabwean dollar.</p> \n<p>In addition to the economic failure, Zimbabwe experienced a deep political crisis. Opposition figures and human rights activists were beaten, arrested, abducted and killed for daring to raise their voices against Mugabe. Elections were fraught with rigging and violence as Mugabe refused to give up power \u2013 the most brutal of these elections was in 2008.</p> \n<p>One of the strategies devised by Mugabe to maintain his grip was a controversial land reform exercise, which began in 2000. It was high on the rhetoric of restoring land to the black majority, although in reality the land remained in the hands of the state, with the holders of the farms holding no title or security of tenure. Critics accused Mugabe of parcelling land out to political elites at the expense of ordinary Zimbabweans.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWafa wanaka\u201d \u2013 it is said that it is unAfrican to speak ill of the dead. But what choice does one have when the death of a once towering figure raises complex emotions, and not in a good way? On 18 April 1980, Zimbabwe was born. In a colourful celebration that started the previous night at Rufaro stadium in Harare (then known as Salisbury), the independence flame was lit. Bob Marley sang Zimbabwe, a song he\u2019d written at the invitation of the government. Hope filled the air as Robert Gabriel Mugabe, the nation\u2019s first prime minister, took his oath of office and swore allegiance to the new nation. Julius Nyerere, the leader of Tanzania, prophetically cautioned Mugabe, saying: \u201cYou have inherited a jewel in Africa. Don\u2019t tarnish it.\u201d Mugabe represented the birth and hope of a new era. Eloquent, ideologically clear and popular, he represented what many a Zimbabwean and parent at the time wished for the next generation. The optimism was not unfounded. Mugabe was a teacher by profession. He declared education a basic human right and changed the constitution to recognise primary and secondary public education as free and compulsory \u2013 a policy that woud reap dividends for decades to come. He preached unity, his aspiration for a non-racial society, and his belief in the rule of law and democracy. It is the Mugabe of this moment that plunged many Zimbabweans into a feeling of conflict when his death was announced on Friday morning. While his legacy to many Africans across the continent is that of a revolutionary hero who championed the continent\u2019s liberation struggle, this image of him presents an incomplete picture. Though he was admittedly a master politician, many Zimbabweans were killed, tortured and brutalised as he entrenched his insatiable grip on power. The unromantic part of his legacy must not be ignored. While revolutionary and eloquent in his speeches, Mugabe tarnished a precious jewel with violence, economic mismanagement and repression. In the 37 years he ruled over Zimbabwe, a dark cloud of broken hope replaced the promise of a bright future. We were left poorer and damaged for it. His ousting in a coup orchestrated by some of his trusted comrades and generals was tragic but celebrated by the masses. In the early 1980s, Mugabe\u2019s proclivity for violence was already evident. Insecure about his enemies, he established the notorious Fifth Brigade, a military group that was trained by the North Koreans. Between 1983 and 1987, Mugabe deployed the brigade into Matabeleland, in the south of Zimbabwe. The brigade oversaw a campaign of beatings, arson, public executions and massacres. This period came to be known as Gukurahundi, a term drawn from a Shona word that means \u201cthe wind that sweeps away the chaff before the rains\u201d. The Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace documented at least 2,000 deaths but estimated that figure was more than 8,000. Other groups believe the death toll could be as high as 20,000. Throughout his decades of rule, Mugabe never afforded justice to the survivors and victims of Gukurahundi, although he later acknowledged that \u201cthousands\u201d had been killed, and he called the massacres \u201ca moment of madness\u201d. During the 1990s, Zimbabwe\u2019s economy steadily contracted. Unemployment rose threefold, average wages were lower and, by 2000, living standards were a pale shadow of what they\u2019d been in 1980. The economic crisis reached a climax in mid-November 2008 when year-on-year inflation reached 89.7 sextillion per cent. This period was characterised by food shortages, empty shelves and the failure of the Zimbabwean dollar. In addition to the economic failure, Zimbabwe experienced a deep political crisis. Opposition figures and human rights activists were beaten, arrested, abducted and killed for daring to raise their voices against Mugabe. Elections were fraught with rigging and violence as Mugabe refused to give up power \u2013 the most brutal of these elections was in 2008. One of the strategies devised by Mugabe to maintain his grip was a controversial land reform exercise, which began in 2000. It was high on the rhetoric of restoring land to the black majority, although in reality the land remained in the hands of the state, with the holders of the farms holding no title or security of tenure. Critics accused Mugabe of parcelling land out to political elites at the expense of ordinary Zimbabweans. More than 400,000 black farmworkers were also displaced during the exercise. While many agreed that rebalancing land ownership was necessary, many also found fault with the \u201cfast-track\u201d manner in which this was done. The poor administration of the programme had a negative impact on the economy and the one-time \u201cbreadbasket of Africa\u201d. Zimbabwe now, in the aftermath of Mugabe, faces a huge crisis and requires at least US$400m in food aid to avoid starvation. When all is said and done, Mugabe\u2019s legacy is a complicated, conflicted and problematic one. On the one hand, he will always be an African liberation icon. On the other, he presided over economic destruction and killed the freedoms he had worked so hard to give birth to. It will take many years to undo the system of repression that he created and which continues under his successor today. While it is unAfrican to speak ill of the dead, Mugabe offers a cautionary tale to all in the continent of how not to destroy a jewel. \u2022 Fadzayi Mahere is a Zimbabwean lawyer and politician",

He is patient and methodical, as if I have a forthcoming exam on this very repair. The postman comes out of the loo and into the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cYou write for the papers, don\u2019t you?\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d I say.

      "bodyText": "On my phone I discover a contact called Francois Oven. I must have done this deliberately, knowing that if I stored Francois under his actual surname I would forget why I had his phone number. Also, I didn\u2019t know his actual surname. I\u2019m still surprised to find it because I have no memory of putting it there. I had been scrolling through my contacts, more in hope than expectation, looking for the number of someone my wife insisted was called Gervais. There remains the problem of how I introduce myself to Francois on the phone after all this time. It\u2019s unlikely he has me listed under Tim Broken Function Selector Switch. Francois, it turns out, has a much better memory of our last encounter than I do. He recalls all the technical details of the repair, and only needs me to text him my address as a reminder. Later that afternoon, my wife finds me reading in the kitchen. \u201cHave you rung Gervais?\u201d she says. \u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cWhy not?\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been two weeks!\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t ring Gervais because he\u2019s not called Gervais,\u201d I say. \u201cHe\u2019s called Francois Oven.\u201d \u201cNo, he isn\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cA remarkable coincidence, I know,\u201d I say. \u201cHe\u2019s coming tomorrow after 11.\u201d Confronted with skilled tradespersons, I tend to adopt whichever persona \u2013 curious onlooker, bewildered idiot, fellow central heating enthusiast \u2013 best suits the moment. With Francois, I naturally assume the role of apprentice. He seems to expect it. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure,\u201d I say as Francois unscrews the base plate of the hob, \u201cthat it\u2019s the same problem as last time.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Francois says. \u201cPlease turn off the power at the wall.\u201d I am right: the function selector switch has burned out. Again. \u201cThat should not happen,\u201d Francois says. \u201cI know!\u201d I say. \u201cIt was only 18 months ago that we bought this one!\u201d \u201cParts are not very well made these days,\u201d he says. The doorbell rings. \u201cAnd as I recall,\u201d I say, \u201ca new function selector switch isn\u2019t cheap.\u201d I only sort of recall this. \u201cLet\u2019s see what we can do,\u201d Francois says. \u201cHand me that screwdriver.\u201d My wife is having a loud and unfathomable conversation at the door. It stops suddenly and another door shuts. I leave my station to look down the hall. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d I say. \u201cThe postman is just using the loo,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s in a hurry.\u201d I return to Francois, who shows me how to reconfigure the wiring so the switch will operate temporarily. He is patient and methodical, as if I have a forthcoming exam on this very repair. The postman comes out of the loo and into the kitchen. \u201cYou write for the papers, don\u2019t you?\u201d he says. \u201cUh-huh,\u201d I say. How does he know? \u201cWhat\u2019s gonna happen with Brexit?\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say, with confidence. \u201cIt\u2019s mad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cIt is,\u201d I say. \u201cSo this is the neutral wire,\u201d Francois says. I walk to the door to wave off the postman, but he stops. Under the guise of eliciting my opinion about Brexit, he gives me his. He is articulate and he is furious: with the government, the opposition and anyone who would invoke Britain\u2019s wartime spirit in support of No Deal. \u201cThe people who fought in that war,\u201d he says. \u201cThey know why we joined the EU!\u201d \u201cExactly,\u201d I say.

      "bodyText": "Strictly Come Dancing Launch Show 2019 7.10pm, BBC One Everyone\u2019s favourite kitsch ballroom contest returns for a pre-recorded launch, kicking off with a typically glitter-fuelled extravaganza featuring musical performances from Kylie Minogue and Mark Ronson. This year\u2019s cohort includes former England footballer David James, presenter Anneka Rice and Made in Chelsea\u2019s Jamie Laing making his only appearance before dropping out due to injury. Judge Motsi Mabuse also replaces Darcey Bussell. Expect speculation as to whether the \u201cStrictly curse\u201d will return and dance partners become more than just ballroom companions. Ammar Kalia Proms Encore 7pm, BBC Two With the last night of the Proms approaching next week (Rule Britannia at the ready), Katie Derham chats to 21-year-old saxophonist Jess Gillam and composer Daniel Kidane about their forthcoming works and Finnish conductor Sakari Oramo talks to Tom Service in an Austin Maestro. AK Britain\u2019s Got Talent: The Champions 8.30pm, ITV The showdown between previous BGT standouts from the UK and beyond continues. In episode two, plucky dance crew Mersey Girls and beefcake warbler Jai McDowall return to try their luck against the 12-year-old dog trainer who brought Germany\u2019s Das Supertalent to heel. Graeme Virtue Python at 50: Silly Talks and Holy Grails 10pm, BBC Two \u201cSick, surreal or just plain silly\u201d: Doon Mackichan narrates this lovely little celebration \u2013 a collection of BBC archive clips, including Graham Chapman frankly telling Parky about being gay and an alcoholic, and an elfin Terry Gilliam gleefully putting animations together in his flat. Ali Catterall The Cavern Club: The Beat Goes On 10pm, Sky Arts First opening as a jazz venue in 1957 before hosting a staggering 292 gigs by the Beatles between 1961 and 1963, Liverpool\u2019s Cavern Club has become a musical icon. This upbeat doc charts the rise of the club and its fight to stay relevant in a rapidly shrinking landscape of small venues. AK The Rap Game UK 11.55pm, BBC One It\u2019s time for the seven unsigned rappers to get soppy, as they perform a \u201cheartfelt dedication\u201d (big-up all the mums, basically). Earnest emotion is a daunting challenge in a post-People Just Do Nothing rap world, but their aim is to prove they can flow on a slower tempo, as well as keep up with speedy drum\u2019n\u2019bass. Ellen E Jones Film Choice Split 9pm, Channel 4 A creepy and effective thriller from the often underwhelming M Night Shyamalan. Teenager Casey gets a lift home with two other girls, before all are kidnapped by James McAvoy\u2019s smiling weirdo and locked in his basement. And the weirdest thing about their captor is his dissociative identity disorder: he has 23 raging inside him. Paul Howlett Sport Choice Athletics: Great North City Games 1.15pm, BBC One. Track and field action from Stockton-on-Tees. International Rugby Union: Ireland v Wales 1.30pm, Channel 4. World Cup warm-up from Dublin. International Football: England v Bulgaria 4.30pm, ITV.

Because who wants to wait till they\u2019re gone?</p> <h2><strong>The baby years</strong></h2> <p>Philippa Perry is a psychotherapist and the author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/10/the-book-you-wish-your-parents-had-read-philippa-perry-review\" title=\"\">The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read</a>. She says a major key to happier parenting is to simply take \u201cparenting\u201d out of the equation \u2013 because having a baby is more about being a human being in the throes of developing a new relationship. And thinking about it in that way will help you find the joy in it. \u201cDon\u2019t see a baby as a chore, or parenting him or her as something you have to \u2018do\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cInstead, see the child as someone to relate to.\u201d Be curious about your baby as a person, and revel in his or her curiosity about you.</p> <p>You also need to readjust, says psychologist Penelope Leach; it will be hard to find the joy in babyhood if you have unrealistic expectations. Leach, the bestselling author of Your Baby And Child, first published in 1977 and out in a new edition next year, says, \u201cThe mistake people make is to think they can get \u2018back to normal\u2019, but in fact there\u2019s a whole new normal.

Competitiveness always has its roots in our own insecurities \u2013 and valuing children for themselves, rather than in relation to others, is much more likely to help you appreciate them and, in turn, boost their self-confidence.</p> <p>What is it about your own insecurities that is driving your competitiveness? Sorting your own demons out always makes your relationship with your child a lot better. The therapy I had when I was undergoing treatment for breast cancer made me realise that I had a right to own my feelings, that I could have a story that was separate from my life as a mother.

Because if you\u2019re happy, they\u2019re happy. She advises parents to be more honest with kids of primary school age. \u201cIf you\u2019re at the playground and you want to go home, instead of saying: \u2018Let\u2019s get you home, you need your tea,\u2019 tell it like it is: \u2018Let\u2019s go home now, because I\u2019m cold and I\u2019ve had enough.\u2019\u201d Your child, she says, will know what it feels like to be cold, and they want to help.</p> <p>A gem from Biddulph is to develop interests that you do one-to-one with them, and make them entirely for fun (there may be some learning on the side, but make sure that\u2019s accidental rather than the point). \u201cA daughter who walks the dog with her dad, for example, develops a cast-iron self-esteem because she knows \u2018me and dad\u2019 love one another\u2019s company. You need ritual times when the good talks happen.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s also important not to take their criticism personally. Honestly.

Leach\u2019s advice is to keep in mind that \u201cjust because you found your partner in bed with your best friend, it doesn\u2019t mean he \u2013 or she \u2013 isn\u2019t the great dad or mum you believed they were\u201d.

On the contrary, the government may be leading him to his death.</p> <p>Segovia is currently imprisoned at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention center in Adelanto, California where he says he is being denied critical medical and mental health care. The 38-year-old veteran is facing deportation to El Salvador, a country he left when he was three years old and where his loved ones fear he could be killed.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to die here. I refuse to die here,\u201d Segovia said on a recent morning, wearing a red jail uniform and seated in a cramped room with no windows to the outside.</p> <p>During his 21 months of detention in the southern California facility, Ice has failed to provide adequate care for Segovia\u2019s serious heart condition, denied him proper treatment for his post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and repeatedly placed him in isolation, according to the former marine and his lawyers. The consequences, they fear, could be fatal.</p> <p>Segovia is one of fifteen current detainees who filed a federal lawsuit against Ice last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/19/us-immigration-detainee-class-action-lawsuit\">alleging medical neglect and horrific conditions</a> that rise to the level of \u201ctorture\u201d. He is also one of the estimated thousands of veterans who have faced deportation over the years despite their service to the country.</p> <p>He said he didn\u2019t know how much more he could take and was desperate to leave Adelanto and return to his hometown and family in Long Beach, California: \u201cI want my freedom so bad \u2026 I try to hold onto any kind of strength I have, but I\u2019m not doing well mentally, emotionally, physically.\u201d </p> <h2><strong>Life after war: \u2018I tried to seek help\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Segovia, who became a legal permanent resident soon after arriving in the US as a child, became interested in the military at a very young age.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"637ffc4da9a864241c6a15a421b375940dd49b20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/637ffc4da9a864241c6a15a421b375940dd49b20/264_0_640_800/400.jpg\" alt=\"Jose Segovia Benitez enlisted in the US Marine Corps one week after graduating high school.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jose Segovia Benitez enlisted in the US Marine Corps one week after graduating high school.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy the family of Jose Segovia Benitez</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Raised in Long Beach, a city just south of Los Angeles, he has early memories of playing with toy soldiers. In high school, he was different from his peers and drawn to the discipline of the Junior Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps, a US Army program for students.</p> <p>At age 18 in 1999, one week after he graduated high school, he enlisted in the marines.</p> <p>\u201cI joined not to go to war, because nobody ever signs up for that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But then war happened.</p> <p>He was deployed as part of the initial Iraq invasion in 2003, ultimately completing two tours of duty.</p> <p>His mother, Martha Garcia, recalled the stress of his deployment and her constant fear that soldiers would show up at her door announcing his death: \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to go. It was very, very scary for me. But he said, \u2018No, I wanna go.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Segovia survived \u2013 but barely. He was honorably discharged in 2004 after he was badly injured by an explosive device in Iraq the year before. </p> <p>He struggles to talk about it today: \u201cI\u2019ve seen combat. I don\u2019t like that subject, I stay away from it.\u201d</p> <p>Life after war was a battle, and he said he had a hard time returning to society and finding a stable routine.</p> <p>Doctors suggested he find jobs that didn\u2019t involve loud noises, because that triggered his PTSD, his mother said. He worked a range of jobs, including in retail, security and manual labor. Meanwhile, he struggled to get the urgent mental health treatment he needed from Veterans Affairs, she said, adding it took roughly seven years to properly diagnose his PTSD and traumatic brain injury.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"755c32fbf0dc6a2aaf8ad3f34f7b3bf5aa202224\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/755c32fbf0dc6a2aaf8ad3f34f7b3bf5aa202224/0_51_923_554/500.jpg\" alt=\"Segovia, a US marine veteran, is now fighting deportation to El Salvador.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Segovia, a US marine veteran, is now fighting deportation to El Salvador.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy the family of Jose Segovia Benitez</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI was trying to seek help,\u201d Segovia Benitez said. \u201cMeanwhile, you\u2019re doing your own therapy.\u201d</p> <p>He struggled with substance abuse, had run-ins with the law, and was ultimately convicted of numerous serious felony crimes related to drug possession and violent offenses.

Service has traditionally provided a path to citizenship for foreign-born members, and roughly 130,000 of them have been <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/military/military-naturalization-statistics\">naturalized</a> since 2001.</p> <p>However bureaucratic challenges mean some immigrant service members don\u2019t complete it, and under the Trump administration, a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/09/06/military-service-was-once-fast-track-us-citizenship-trump-administration-keeps-narrowing-that-possibility/\">series of changes have made the process even harder</a>.

When immigrant veterans who haven\u2019t been naturalized are convicted of certain felonies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/14/iraq-war-veteran-chong-kim-deportation-portland-interview\">they can then be deported</a>.</p> <p>Ice <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/06/08/ice-deported-veterans-while-unaware-it-was-required-screen-them-with-care-report-says/\">says it doesn\u2019t know</a> how many veterans it has deported, but groups that assist deported veterans have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/local/309/2019/06/21/733371297/deported-u-s-veterans-feel-abandoned-by-the-country-they-defended\">tracked roughly 400 cases since 2014</a>. Advocates estimate there are likely thousands.</p> <p>In deportation proceedings, Ice is required to take into consideration a veteran\u2019s health and deployment record and elevate their cases to senior officials, but a federal watchdog department recently <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/699549.pdf\">found</a> that the agency frequently failed to do so.</p> <p>Segovia repeatedly submitted paperwork for naturalization, but the process was never completed, according to Brandee Dudzic, one of his advocates.</p> <p>\u201cThe system was designed for them to fail at every single step of the way,\u201d said Dudzic, founder of Repatriate Our Patriots. Immigrant service members sometimes start the immigration process and then get deployed and the paperwork doesn\u2019t follow them, or they have difficulties navigating bureaucracy due to PTSD.</p> <p>As a result, disabled veterans have ended up in prisons and then Ice detention centers where their struggles to access healthcare are exacerbated and their mental health further deteriorates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d9fdc0cbd2d8845b644c7ee96b75868f350d8926\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9fdc0cbd2d8845b644c7ee96b75868f350d8926/0_50_1084_650/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Segovia served two tours of duty before being honorably discharged.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Segovia served two tours of duty before being honorably discharged.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy the family of Jose Segovia Benitez</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis was not what I envisioned my life to be,\u201d Segovia said.<strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p> <p>He noted that he was already incarcerated for his offenses, served his sentence and paid his debts to society.

      "bodyText": "Jose Segovia Benitez survived two tours of duty with the US Marine Corps, a bomb blast, and a traumatic brain injury. But the US is not helping him recover. On the contrary, the government may be leading him to his death. Segovia is currently imprisoned at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention center in Adelanto, California where he says he is being denied critical medical and mental health care. The 38-year-old veteran is facing deportation to El Salvador, a country he left when he was three years old and where his loved ones fear he could be killed. \u201cI\u2019m not going to die here. I refuse to die here,\u201d Segovia said on a recent morning, wearing a red jail uniform and seated in a cramped room with no windows to the outside. During his 21 months of detention in the southern California facility, Ice has failed to provide adequate care for Segovia\u2019s serious heart condition, denied him proper treatment for his post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and repeatedly placed him in isolation, according to the former marine and his lawyers. The consequences, they fear, could be fatal. Segovia is one of fifteen current detainees who filed a federal lawsuit against Ice last month alleging medical neglect and horrific conditions that rise to the level of \u201ctorture\u201d. He is also one of the estimated thousands of veterans who have faced deportation over the years despite their service to the country. He said he didn\u2019t know how much more he could take and was desperate to leave Adelanto and return to his hometown and family in Long Beach, California: \u201cI want my freedom so bad \u2026 I try to hold onto any kind of strength I have, but I\u2019m not doing well mentally, emotionally, physically.\u201d Life after war: \u2018I tried to seek help\u2019 Segovia, who became a legal permanent resident soon after arriving in the US as a child, became interested in the military at a very young age. Raised in Long Beach, a city just south of Los Angeles, he has early memories of playing with toy soldiers. In high school, he was different from his peers and drawn to the discipline of the Junior Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps, a US Army program for students. At age 18 in 1999, one week after he graduated high school, he enlisted in the marines. \u201cI joined not to go to war, because nobody ever signs up for that,\u201d he said. But then war happened. He was deployed as part of the initial Iraq invasion in 2003, ultimately completing two tours of duty. His mother, Martha Garcia, recalled the stress of his deployment and her constant fear that soldiers would show up at her door announcing his death: \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to go. It was very, very scary for me. But he said, \u2018No, I wanna go.\u2019\u201d Segovia survived \u2013 but barely. He was honorably discharged in 2004 after he was badly injured by an explosive device in Iraq the year before. He struggles to talk about it today: \u201cI\u2019ve seen combat. I don\u2019t like that subject, I stay away from it.\u201d Life after war was a battle, and he said he had a hard time returning to society and finding a stable routine. Doctors suggested he find jobs that didn\u2019t involve loud noises, because that triggered his PTSD, his mother said. He worked a range of jobs, including in retail, security and manual labor. Meanwhile, he struggled to get the urgent mental health treatment he needed from Veterans Affairs, she said, adding it took roughly seven years to properly diagnose his PTSD and traumatic brain injury. \u201cI was trying to seek help,\u201d Segovia Benitez said. \u201cMeanwhile, you\u2019re doing your own therapy.\u201d He struggled with substance abuse, had run-ins with the law, and was ultimately convicted of numerous serious felony crimes related to drug possession and violent offenses. He was sent to prison and due to be released in January of 2018. He was eager to get out, his mother recalled. She was planning to make him a welcome-home meal of tamales. But he never came. After serving his sentence, Ice agents were awaiting him at the prison to take him into custody. When immigrants are sentenced to \u2018double jeopardy\u2019 Immigrants have long served in the military, with an estimated 5,000 enlisting each year. Service has traditionally provided a path to citizenship for foreign-born members, and roughly 130,000 of them have been naturalized since 2001. However bureaucratic challenges mean some immigrant service members don\u2019t complete it, and under the Trump administration, a series of changes have made the process even harder. Some also mistakenly believe citizenship is automatic, advocates say. When immigrant veterans who haven\u2019t been naturalized are convicted of certain felonies, they can then be deported. Ice says it doesn\u2019t know how many veterans it has deported, but groups that assist deported veterans have tracked roughly 400 cases since 2014. Advocates estimate there are likely thousands. In deportation proceedings, Ice is required to take into consideration a veteran\u2019s health and deployment record and elevate their cases to senior officials, but a federal watchdog department recently found that the agency frequently failed to do so. Segovia repeatedly submitted paperwork for naturalization, but the process was never completed, according to Brandee Dudzic, one of his advocates. \u201cThe system was designed for them to fail at every single step of the way,\u201d said Dudzic, founder of Repatriate Our Patriots. Immigrant service members sometimes start the immigration process and then get deployed and the paperwork doesn\u2019t follow them, or they have difficulties navigating bureaucracy due to PTSD. As a result, disabled veterans have ended up in prisons and then Ice detention centers where their struggles to access healthcare are exacerbated and their mental health further deteriorates. \u201cThis was not what I envisioned my life to be,\u201d Segovia said. He noted that he was already incarcerated for his offenses, served his sentence and paid his debts to society. Instead of letting him rebuild his life, he is being punished again \u2013 in new and more severe ways: \u201cYou hear about double jeopardy, but this feels like triple jeopardy \u2026 I did time, and now I\u2019m being exiled?\u201d One of the most upsetting moments of his detention, he said, was when an Ice agent suggested that America was not his home. \u201c\u2018Thank you for your service, but you were not born in this country\u2019,\u201d Segovia recalled the officer saying. In Adelanto, a legacy of death and scandal The immigration jail where Segovia has lived for more than 20 months is located in Adelanto, a remote desert town that is a two-hour drive inland from Los Angeles. A road sign at the edge of town advertises a \u201ccity with unlimited possibilities\u201d. Geo Group, the private prison company that runs the jail, has repeatedly been accused of abuse and neglect. Last year, a US government audit found there were \u201cnooses\u201d made out of bedsheets in 15 cells, which guards overlooked even though someone had died by suicide in 2017. That year, three detainees died within three months, and there were reports of at least five suicide attempts. Guards also improperly shackled detainees and placed them in solitary confinement and failed to provide adequate medical care, the audit said. \u201cThese people don\u2019t know how to treat combat stress veterans,\u201d Segovia said. \u201cIt\u2019s a slap in the face. I\u2019ve been in a downward spiral of depression.\u201d He has been isolated in segregation multiple times, typically for three to five days, during which time he did not receive daily medical or mental health check-ins, according to the recent lawsuit filed by Disability Rights Advocates and other groups. He has repeatedly complained of chest pain, dizziness and other heart problems, but has been denied timely care, the suit said. Lawyers alleged that the facility \u201centirely ignored\u201d multiple abnormal cardiology test results, and that on 3 July, after he reported significant chest pain, he wasn\u2019t evaluated for seven hours. At that point, the facility called 911 and took him to emergency care. Segovia had no way to tell his family, and after his mother didn\u2019t hear from him by phone, she rushed to the detention center in person, demanding answers, she recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to leave until you tell me where my son is\u2019,\u201d said Garcia, 58. \u201cThey said, \u2018You can\u2019t see him. He\u2019s not here\u2019.\u201d Eventually, she heard from the family member of another detainee that he had been hospitalized, but she couldn\u2019t find out where he was taken and wasn\u2019t able to visit him. \u201cHow am I going to get better?\u201d Segovia asked. Some days, he added, \u201cI shut down. I close everybody out.\u201d An enduring patriotism: \u2018I took an oath\u2019 Segovia is running out of options. An Ice spokeswoman said in a statement to the Guardian that he is a \u201ccitizen of El Salvador\u201d who was \u201cordered removed to his home country\u201d and has an \u201cextensive criminal history\u201d. A Geo Group spokesperson did not comment on Segovia\u2019s case, but said the allegations in the lawsuit were \u201cbaseless\u201d and that the corporation\u2019s medical programs \u201cprovide 24/7 access to health care free of charge \u2026 supported by professional teams, including full-time physicians\u201d. The VA declined to comment. Segovia\u2019s advocates are now urging California governor Gavin Newsom to pardon him for his criminal record, which would shield him from deportation to El Salvador, where he would be vulnerable to gang violence. Garcia said she wanted Newsom to know that her son\u2019s incarceration and pending deportation was ruining so many lives. \u201cIt\u2019s not just my son. My whole family is broken. We\u2019re asking him to please help.\u201d For Segovia, being forced to live in his birth country is unfathomable: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing over there for me.\u201d Segovia said he tries to stay positive and spends time assisting deaf detainees, who can\u2019t communicate with the guards. He learned sign language after he thought he might lose his hearing due to injuries overseas. \u201cI don\u2019t like to see injustices. I have to stand up for those that need help,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not afraid of retaliation because I\u2019ve been through worse.\u201d Somedays, he wants to be deported, just to feel free. But he continues to fight for the sake of his family. And despite everything, his love for his country remains deep, he said. He has a tattoo of the Statue of Liberty on the side of his body and another on his arm that says USMC to commemorate his service. \u201cPatriotism is still a part of me. I took an oath long ago, and I haven\u2019t untaken that oath,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cEverything I love is here. Everything I know is in Long Beach, California.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s 40-year effort to find a way to either influence or dislodge Robert Mugabe is one of the country\u2019s great post-war foreign policy failures. It is a story spanning six UK prime ministers, nearly \u00a31bn in aid and every conceivable strategy.</p> \n<p>Whether the cause of that failure lies at the door of a colonial mindset in the Foreign Office, a failed land transfer policy, the collective weakness of the Commonwealth, a cowardly African political elite or simply the corrupt thuggery of Mugabe himself will be a matter of dispute for generations.</p> \n<p>At the heart of the story is misunderstanding and apprehension, neatly illustrated by Lord Howard de Walden\u2019s description of Christopher Soames on being told the latter was to be made Britain\u2019s interim governor in Rhodesia during the colonial handover in 1979: \u201cA cloud passed over his face, as if he could see himself being plucked of his plumed hat and being eaten by savages. There was no alternative to agree. Before leaving the building to face the press, he asked for another drink.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fears for Soames\u2019s personal safety in Zimbabwe proved misplaced, but from the outset the Foreign Office had doubts about Mugabe, and how to respond to the manipulation of elections by his Zanu-PF party. Diplomats told Lord Carrington, the then foreign secretary, that the ballot rigging was blatant.</p> \n<p>Carrington \u2013 who had been reluctant even to send outside election observers \u2013 demurred on calling for Zanu-PF to be banned from participating, in part believing, according to his biographer Christopher Lee, that Mugabe would not be elected.</p> \n<p>When he was indeed victorious, and by a landslide, Carrington was reassured by the tone of Mugabe\u2019s inauguration speech as prime minister, which preached reconciliation and forgiveness worthy of any 20th century liberation hero.</p> \n<p>A policy of benign tolerance, and hoping for the best, ensued for nearly a decade. As late as 1988 Carrington wrote he had been fortified by Mugabe\u2019s magnanimity and intelligence, seemingly unaware of the slaughters Mugabe instigated in his political rival\u2019s power base, the two Matabeleland provinces of western Zimbabwe, from 1982 to 1987.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0f0f558e-6bd5-4a7f-a9a3-567505b8f195\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(February 21, 1924)</i>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Mugabe is born in what was then British-ruled Southern Rhodesia.

But in many ways 1997 was the decisive year both for Zimbabwe, and its relationship with Britain, now led by a Labour government with an ethically-driven foreign policy.</p> \n<p>Although Mugabe had won the 1995 elections easily, the arrival of a pressure group of war veterans demanding land soon made itself felt. In November 1997 Mugabe offered large one-off payments to each of the 70,000 \u201cwar veterans\u201d, in addition to a monthly payment.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/06/robert-mugabe-obituary\">Robert Mugabe obituary</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Tony Blair and then foreign secretary Robin Cook initially responded by convening a Land Donors conference to address the issue, but then pulled out of talks. Mugabe\u2019s hatred of Blair started, as he accused the British of trying to engineer a coup by funding his political opponents.</p> \n<p>As the Zimbabwean economy rapidly deteriorated, tensions over land reform reached boiling point in February 2000, when the government\u2019s new draft constitution, which contained a clause providing for land acquisition without compensation unless paid for by the British government, was defeated in a referendum. Shortly thereafter, so-called \u201cwar veterans\u201d invaded white-owned farms across the country.</p> \n<p>As late as 2000 Cook offered an extra \u00a340m to fund land reform. But he set conditions including \u201ca fair price to the farmer\u201d and reducing poverty among the working poor.</p> \n<p>Labour believed Mugabe\u2019s programme was not only unlawful, but corrupt. Half of all the farms redistributed since 1997 had gone to employees or members of the Zimbabwean government.</p> \n<p>The shutters went down. Britain imposed an arms embargo against Zimbabwe on 3 May 2000. It halted the provision of 450 Land Rovers to its police force, withdrew the British military advisory training team and cut aid to Zimbabwe by one-third. An EU-wide travel ban was imposed on Mugabe and 19 members of his inner circle.</p> \n<p>Blair did not just try isolation. He used the Commonwealth to urge Mugabe to sign a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/sep/10/zimbabwe.guardianleaders\">declaration at Abuja in 2001</a> and elsewhere later committing to democracy. But such words proved largely worthless when it came to actual elections won by Mugabe.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s 40-year effort to find a way to either influence or dislodge Robert Mugabe is one of the country\u2019s great post-war foreign policy failures. It is a story spanning six UK prime ministers, nearly \u00a31bn in aid and every conceivable strategy. Whether the cause of that failure lies at the door of a colonial mindset in the Foreign Office, a failed land transfer policy, the collective weakness of the Commonwealth, a cowardly African political elite or simply the corrupt thuggery of Mugabe himself will be a matter of dispute for generations. At the heart of the story is misunderstanding and apprehension, neatly illustrated by Lord Howard de Walden\u2019s description of Christopher Soames on being told the latter was to be made Britain\u2019s interim governor in Rhodesia during the colonial handover in 1979: \u201cA cloud passed over his face, as if he could see himself being plucked of his plumed hat and being eaten by savages. There was no alternative to agree. Before leaving the building to face the press, he asked for another drink.\u201d Fears for Soames\u2019s personal safety in Zimbabwe proved misplaced, but from the outset the Foreign Office had doubts about Mugabe, and how to respond to the manipulation of elections by his Zanu-PF party. Diplomats told Lord Carrington, the then foreign secretary, that the ballot rigging was blatant. Carrington \u2013 who had been reluctant even to send outside election observers \u2013 demurred on calling for Zanu-PF to be banned from participating, in part believing, according to his biographer Christopher Lee, that Mugabe would not be elected. When he was indeed victorious, and by a landslide, Carrington was reassured by the tone of Mugabe\u2019s inauguration speech as prime minister, which preached reconciliation and forgiveness worthy of any 20th century liberation hero. A policy of benign tolerance, and hoping for the best, ensued for nearly a decade. As late as 1988 Carrington wrote he had been fortified by Mugabe\u2019s magnanimity and intelligence, seemingly unaware of the slaughters Mugabe instigated in his political rival\u2019s power base, the two Matabeleland provinces of western Zimbabwe, from 1982 to 1987. Above all, Carrington was reassured that Mugabe did not seem willing to tamper with the special protection sunset clauses in Lancaster House given to white Zimbabwean landowners at least for the first 10 years of independence, including provisions that the government of Zimbabwe would not engage in compulsory land acquisition but would instead proceed on a \u201cwilling buyer, willing seller\u201d principle. The warning signs for the British became unmistakable in 1992 when, with the economy stagnating, a compulsory land acquisition programme slowly started. But in many ways 1997 was the decisive year both for Zimbabwe, and its relationship with Britain, now led by a Labour government with an ethically-driven foreign policy. Although Mugabe had won the 1995 elections easily, the arrival of a pressure group of war veterans demanding land soon made itself felt. In November 1997 Mugabe offered large one-off payments to each of the 70,000 \u201cwar veterans\u201d, in addition to a monthly payment. Tony Blair and then foreign secretary Robin Cook initially responded by convening a Land Donors conference to address the issue, but then pulled out of talks. Mugabe\u2019s hatred of Blair started, as he accused the British of trying to engineer a coup by funding his political opponents. As the Zimbabwean economy rapidly deteriorated, tensions over land reform reached boiling point in February 2000, when the government\u2019s new draft constitution, which contained a clause providing for land acquisition without compensation unless paid for by the British government, was defeated in a referendum. Shortly thereafter, so-called \u201cwar veterans\u201d invaded white-owned farms across the country. As late as 2000 Cook offered an extra \u00a340m to fund land reform. But he set conditions including \u201ca fair price to the farmer\u201d and reducing poverty among the working poor. Labour believed Mugabe\u2019s programme was not only unlawful, but corrupt. Half of all the farms redistributed since 1997 had gone to employees or members of the Zimbabwean government. The shutters went down. Britain imposed an arms embargo against Zimbabwe on 3 May 2000. It halted the provision of 450 Land Rovers to its police force, withdrew the British military advisory training team and cut aid to Zimbabwe by one-third. An EU-wide travel ban was imposed on Mugabe and 19 members of his inner circle. Blair did not just try isolation. He used the Commonwealth to urge Mugabe to sign a declaration at Abuja in 2001 and elsewhere later committing to democracy. But such words proved largely worthless when it came to actual elections won by Mugabe. Blair led the call to suspend Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth in March 2002. Mugabe never forgave him. Since then all the weapons of diplomacy \u2013 quiet megaphone, economic, political, multilateral, unilateral \u2013 were used to weaken Mugabe, or strengthen his opponents in the stolen elections that have succeeded. Short of using force, the British alone had the ability to wound, but never to end the Mugabe regime. Mugabe was repeatedly protected by other African leaders, notably the ANC in South Africa, that declined to criticise him on the grounds of non-interference and national sovereignty. \u201cMugabe was one of those people the British empire created who specialised in knowing how to twist the British government\u2019s tail,\u201d Lord Hurd, another British foreign secretary, said: \u201cHe was well-trained in the art of annoying the British if he needed to. He knew our ways.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 9 September 2019 because Matabeleland is in the west of Zimbabwe, not the east as an earlier version said. This has been corrected.",

You may also notice that Matteo is a little more ... unpredictable when it comes to hitting big shots (although it should be noted that the Italian has spent far more time on court that Nadal). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/tale-of-the-tape/index.html?opinion-tint=false&amp;title-a=Rafael%20Nadal&amp;description-a=Spain&amp;image-a=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F89e3d4402677a4b1ec31f560581389ad3a47d1a6%3Fcrop%3D1578_104_1412_1412&amp;colour-a=Blue&amp;title-b=Matteo%20Berrettini&amp;description-b=Italy&amp;image-b=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F330a5f5e0354727f6008579f2a1ccacff2567632%3Fcrop%3D1052_47_1631_1631&amp;colour-b=Red&amp;row-1-label=World%20ranking&amp;row-1-value-a=2&amp;row-1-value-b=25&amp;row-2-label=Age&amp;row-2-value-a=33&amp;row-2-value-b=23&amp;row-3-label=Career%20prize%20money&amp;row-3-value-a=%24111m&amp;row-3-value-b=%242m&amp;row-4-label=Career%20singles%20titles&amp;row-4-value-a=83&amp;row-4-value-b=3&amp;row-5-label=Winners%20at%202019%20US%20Open&amp;row-5-value-a=124&amp;row-5-value-b=250&amp;row-6-label=Unforced%20errors%20at%202019%20US%20Open&amp;row-6-value-a=122&amp;row-6-value-b=248&amp;row-7-label=&amp;row-7-value-a=&amp;row-7-value-b=&amp;row-8-label=&amp;row-8-value-a=&amp;row-8-value-b=&amp;source=\" data-alt=\"Tale of the tape\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/tale-of-the-tape/index.html?opinion-tint=false&title-a=Rafael%20Nadal&description-a=Spain&image-a=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F89e3d4402677a4b1ec31f560581389ad3a47d1a6%3Fcrop%3D1578_104_1412_1412&colour-a=Blue&title-b=Matteo%20Berrettini&description-b=Italy&image-b=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F330a5f5e0354727f6008579f2a1ccacff2567632%3Fcrop%3D1052_47_1631_1631&colour-b=Red&row-1-label=World%20ranking&row-1-value-a=2&row-1-value-b=25&row-2-label=Age&row-2-value-a=33&row-2-value-b=23&row-3-label=Career%20prize%20money&row-3-value-a=%24111m&row-3-value-b=%242m&row-4-label=Career%20singles%20titles&row-4-value-a=83&row-4-value-b=3&row-5-label=Winners%20at%202019%20US%20Open&row-5-value-a=124&row-5-value-b=250&row-6-label=Unforced%20errors%20at%202019%20US%20Open&row-6-value-a=122&row-6-value-b=248&row-7-label=&row-7-value-a=&row-7-value-b=&row-8-label=&row-8-value-a=&row-8-value-b=&source=\">Tale of the tape</a> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d72c18a8f083106f4556eca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-06T20:30:14.186Z\">9.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Tom will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s how Rafa got on in the quarter-final:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rafaelnadal\">Rafael Nadal</a> overcame a spirited challenge from Argentina\u2019s Diego Schwartzman to win 6-4, 7-5, 6-2 in the US Open quarter-finals on Wednesday night at Arthur Ashe Stadium, staying on course for a fourth title at Flushing Meadows and 19th major championship to move within one of Roger Federer\u2019s all-time record.</p> <p>The second-seeded Spaniard squandered double-break leads in the first and second sets, but recovered to win each of them with exquisite shotmaking and his trademark steel before closing out the match after two hours and 47 minutes.</p> <p>\u201cWhen he is under confidence he\u2019s very difficult to stop,\u201d Nadal said after reaching the semi-finals of a major tournament for the 33rd time. \u201cOf course I made some mistakes, but I\u2019m super happy the way I accepted the situation and I accepted the challenge.

      "bodyText": "You can read a full report from tonight\u2019s match here: Rafa is asked how he has managed to sustain his success for so long: \u201cThe secret is the passion and love for what you are doing. It is impossible to have a successful and long career if you don\u2019t love what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Nadal speaks: \u201cThe first set was frustrating with all the break points ... and I was a little bit lucky in the tiebreak. After that the match changed and I am super happy to be back in the final of the US Open.\u201d A double fault from an understandably tired Berrettini gives Rafa, who is cruising now, match point. And he takes it with a withering crosscourt forehand. Third set: *Nadal 7-6, 6-4, 5-1 Berrettini (* denotes server) Rafa still has plenty of energy - he races back to retrieve a lob and whips a forehand winner past his bemused opponent. He closes out the game to love. Third set: Nadal 7-6, 6-4, 4-1 Berrettini* (* denotes server) Berrettini has 42 unforced errors to 16 for Nadal. And it\u2019s little surprise when he finds himself at 0-40. I will stick my neck out and say this isn\u2019t going be another five-set victory for the Italian. He does, however, bring up deuce with a drop shot that Nadal can\u2019t reach after he slips. Rafa comes back to break though. Third set: *Nadal 7-6, 6-4, 3-1 Berrettini (* denotes server) Rafa opens the game with an ace down the middle. And then goes to 40-0 with another one - 50% of his aces for the match have come in this game. And then he double faults. He hasn\u2019t been broken in this match but his serving has been average at best - it will need to be much better in the final. Third set: Nadal 7-6, 6-4, 2-1 Berrettini* (* denotes server) How would the match have panned out if Berrettini had won that first-set tiebreak? He still would have had to deal with an exhausting first set after a tough path to get here in the first place. But maybe the euphoria of going a set up in a grand slam semi would have helped those tired legs. A good hold for the Italian. Third set: *Nadal 7-6, 6-4, 2-0 Berrettini (* denotes server) Berrettini is thinking about a nice, well deserved nap now. And it\u2019s that stage of the match where the commentators team speculate which position Rafa would play in the NFL (correct answer: no position because he\u2019s too small). Anyway, another easy hold. Third set: Nadal 7-6, 6-4, 1-0 Berrettini* (* denotes server) This set could be quick - even Berrettini\u2019s forehand is looking off pace. Well, not all his forehands - he whacks a 92mph winner past Nadal to make it 40-30. But that\u2019s as good as it gets and Nadal breaks. You wait for one break and then... Rafa serves for the set. He goes to the net twice - a rarity in this match - and wins both points. He brings up three sets point with a very tired shot from Berrettini. And clinches it at the first attempt. Berrettini swipes at the air in frustration - he knows his hopes are all but gone now. Second set: Nadal 7-6, 5-4 Berrettini* (* denotes server) Nadal knows he just needs to stay in rallies against the tiring Berrettini. And Berrettini knows his best chance is to launch those big shots - but that\u2019s tough when you\u2019ve been on court for so much longer than your opponent over the course of the tournament. Berrettini will not give up though - and some good serving keeps him alive in the set. Second set: *Nadal 7-6, 5-3 Berrettini (* denotes server) Berrettini has barely challenged Nadal on his serve, apart from in the tiebreak, and if he is to have any chance he needs to hit back quickly. It\u2019s a good start - he wins the first point. It\u2019s nearly 0-30 too but Nadal\u2019s forehand skims the line to even the game at 15-15. Matteo, who looked spent at the end of the last game, somehow makes it to deuce - partly thanks to a Rafa double fault but the Spaniard closes things out. Second set: Nadal 7-6, 4-3 Berrettini* (* denotes server) Has Berrettini\u2019s impressive resistance ended? He\u2019s had to fight in nearly every service game in this match - and he\u2019s always ended up winning. But this time he finds himself at 15-40 after his latest drop shot - a shot that had served him well in the opening set - and Nadal breaks on his 10th attempt. Second set: *Nadal 7-6, 3-3 Berrettini (* denotes server) Great opening point from Nadal. He moves his opponent all around the court - putting those tired legs to the test - before striking a winner into the corner. Nadal\u2019s fourth hold to love. Second set: Nadal 7-6, 2-3 Berrettini* (* denotes server) It\u2019s impressive that Berrettini is still in this match. He is yet to be broken despite defending a pile of break points. And despite admitting he was fatigued he\u2019s hanging around after blowing a good chance to take the first set. His best service game of the set so far. Second set: *Nadal 7-6, 2-2 Berrettini (* denotes server) On ESPN, John McEnroe is attempting to figure out how many Jonas Brothers there are. Nine? A lot of people forget about Dudley. Nadal, who appeared to be conserving his energy a little in the first serve, is now scampering around the baseline a lot more than he was earlier. His first serve percentage is only 52% - which nearly cost him in that tiebreak, and Berrettini (a fresher Berrettini?) should have made him pay. Nadal holds. Second set: Nadal 7-6, 1-2 Berrettini* (* denotes server) Every Berrettini service game is a battle for the Italian. But then again that was the case in the first set - and he almost won it. And - like the first set - it\u2019s another break point for Nadal. He has had eight now and is yet to convert ... and won\u2019t this time either. Berrettini has plenty of time to wind up for one of his huge forehands and we\u2019re at deuce. Another fight back to hold for Matteo. Second set: *Nadal 7-6, 1-1 Berrettini (* denotes server) A hold to love for Nadal - and his serve is looking much more consistent than it did at the end of the first set. Second set: Nadal 7-6, 0-1 Berrettini* (* denotes server) Agony for Berrettini who had battled to stay in that set before getting his chance with a set point in the tiebreak. But - as the great ones always do - Nadal upped his play when it most mattered and returned shot after shot in the closing stages of the tiebreak. Will that finish the Italian? He had an exhausting five-setter in the quarter-final and now most live with the knowledge he had a great chance to go a set up. Anyway, to the second set. Rafa has a great chance to make it 0-30 but hits a routine volley into the net. Matteo tries the drop shot again but Nadal seems to have this figured out and gets it back - soon we\u2019re at 40-40. A bad first serve and then a tired backhand gives Nadal his seventh break point of the match - but Matteo saves and holds. Plenty of pressure on the Italian as he serves to stay in the set. And he hits his first serve into the net. He has held his nerve beautifully so many times in this net but a loose forehand from the Italian secures Rafa the set after 74 minutes. First set tiebreak: *Nadal 7-6 Berrettini (* denotes server) Nadal\u2019s serving has been poor in this tiebreak and it\u2019s another second serve. But after a long rally Berrettini hits a backhand into the net. First set tiebreak: *Nadal 6-6 Berrettini (* denotes server) And finally Berrettini\u2019s drop shot lets him down. Nadal\u2019s first serve was also out but called in and his opponent didn\u2019t challenge. First set tiebreak: Nadal 5-6 Berrettini* (* denotes server) Berrettini has set point on his own serve. Two lets off the first two serves. The tension mounts and he dumps the thirds into the net. An incredibly hard half volley for Matteo at the net is too tough and we\u2019re back on serve. First set tiebreak: Nadal 4-6 Berrettini* (* denotes server) Nadal finally gets to a drop shot but his opponent sends it back for a winner. First set tiebreak: *Nadal 4-5 Berrettini (* denotes server) Good serving from Nadal to make it 4-5. First set tiebreak: *Nadal 3-5 Berrettini (* denotes server) Another bad serve from Rafa but Berrettini sends his lob long. First set tiebreak: Nadal 2-5 Berrettini* (* denotes server) Matteo has played five tiebreaks this tournament - this is Rafa\u2019s first. The Italian hits his first serve into the net - but then Nadal hits his backhand long. First set tiebreak: *Nadal 1-4 Berrettini (* denotes server) Rafa wins his first point of the tiebreak and we get a fist pump. First set tiebreak: *Nadal 0-4 Berrettini (* denotes server) The noise rises in Arthur Ashe as the crowd sense an upset and then - a miracle! Matteo hits a backhand winner! First set tiebreak: Nadal 0-3 Berrettini* (* denotes server) A couple of big forehands takes us to 3-0 to Berrettini and the Italian is in control. First set tiebreak: *Nadal 0-1 Berrettini (* denotes server) Rafa dumps his first serve into the net ... and then double faults! A mini-break for the Italian. Nadal 6-6 Berrettini* (* denotes server) Berrettini goes to 40-0 with, yep, a drop shot. Rafa doesn\u2019t even bother to run for it. A point later and we\u2019re going to a tiebreak. *Nadal 6-5 Berrettini (* denotes server) Nadal has been the better player in this set but he\u2019s still yet to find a way to break his opponent. Berrettini takes a few wild swings and Nadal holds to love. If the Italian is going to win this crucial set - particularly given the amount of time he\u2019s spent on court this tournament - it will have to be in a tiebreak. But first he must hold. Nadal 5-5 Berrettini* (* denotes server) That backhand lets Berrettini down - he dumps one into the net on the first point. Another loose backhand has us at 0-30 and the underdog is under pressure. But what a response! His fourth drop shot of the match outfoxes Nadal and he then dials up an ace to take the score to 30-30. Berrettini then climbs into a backhand - and you know what comes next - set point for Nadal. An ace from the Italian levels it at 40-40 and he brings up advantage with another drop shot. An excellent serve helps him hold. Rafa has now passed up six break points, and Matteo has shown excellent nerves to stay in this set. *Nadal 5-4 Berrettini (* denotes server) A really bad first serve from Rafa at 30-30 - but Matteo can\u2019t exploit the second serve and sends his return into the net. Rafa holds and the Italian will need to hold his nerve - and serve - to stay in the set. Nadal 4-4 Berrettini* (* denotes server) Berrettini cracks what would be a winner down the line against most players but Nadal hits it back with interest. The Italian may be thinking about that as he serves on the next point and sends down a double fault: 15-40. He responds well with a huge ace down the middle and then sends Rafa wide with the next serve and we\u2019re at deuce. Nadal then dances around the court until his opponent sends it long and faces another break point - which is saved again when the Spaniard\u2019s backhand goes just side - that\u2019s the fifth break point Nadal has failed to convert (or, being more positive, Berrettini has saved). He seals the hold with a big serve. He\u2019s done very well to stay in this set -considering the setting and opponent. *Nadal 4-3 Berrettini (* denotes server) Rafa offers a little bit of hope for Matteo as he double faults to make it 30-30. The Italian then goes for broke as he attacks a good forehand from Nadal and - predictably - it goes into the net. Still, his best chance of winning here is taking a few risks. Nadal holds but Berrettini is holding his own so far and shows few signs of fatigue. Nadal 3-3 Berrettini* (* denotes server) Berrettini\u2019s backhand is 594 times better than yours. But against Rafa Nadal? It\u2019s not causing much trouble. He flops one right into Nadal\u2019s feet and it\u2019s promptly slammed back to make it 15-15. That dropshot is back again though and it\u2019s successful again as we go to 30-15. It spurs the Italian on to take the game in his best hold of the match so far. *Nadal 3-2 Berrettini (* denotes server) Nadal\u2019s second ace of the match - Berrettini has three already - takes us to 40-0. The game doesn\u2019t last much longer after that. Nadal 2-2 Berrettini* (* denotes server) Berrettini\u2019s second service game is similar to his first - he starts well with two big serves before a few loose shots let Rafa back in. It doesn\u2019t go to deuce this time though - Matteo shuts the door at 40-30 with a booming winner down the line. *Nadal 2-1 Berrettini (* denotes server) Berrettini has already played a few drop shots tonight - on ESPN they think his compatriot Fabio Fognini may have told him that\u2019s one way he can beat Nadal. Both times it has worked. Having said that, it\u2019s another good game for Rafa and he holds. My colleague Tumaini Carayol was at Flushing Meadows for the first semi-final and has filed a report on Medvedev\u2019s impressive victory: Nadal 1-1 Berrettini* (* denotes server) Two big serves - and a nice drop shot - win Berrettini the first two points on his serve. A whipped forehand falls just out to take us to 30-30 and then a few unforced errors and Nadal has the first break point of the game. Berrettini holds eventually but it\u2019s a long game for a man who has already played plenty of tennis this tournament. *Nadal 1-0 Berrettini (* denotes server) Rafa serves first. We see Berrettini\u2019s big forehand early as he sends down a winner to pull a point back at 30-0. John McEnroe thinks he should take an example from the New York Mets, who are playing just across the road tonight, and swing for the fences (except, unlike the Mets, he should make contact). A comfortable hold for the Spaniard despite Matteo\u2019s winner. Berrettini has described Nadal as \u201cthe greatest fighter ever in this sport\u201d but he has a few weapons of his own, namely his big forehand and serve. He\u2019s sent down 66 aces at Flushing Meadows this tournament and 111 forehand winners. These two have never met on court before either, so there\u2019s always the surprise factor. On the other hand, Rafael Nadal is Rafael Nadal. Our protagonists are now on court to a huge roar. Apart from the small matter of beating one of the greatest players of all time, Berrettini will be less fresh than his opponent - he\u2019s spent 15 hours and 23 minutes on court at this tournament, while Rafa\u2019s tournament has involved just nine hours and 43 minutes of play. That\u2019s partly because his second-round opponent withdrew, and partly because he\u2019s beaten a few shades of hell out of most of the men he has faced. The players speak! Berrettini is asked how he is feeling after his five setter in the quarter-final. It turns out he is tired. \u201cI slept a lot,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cI was tired but I\u2019m ready for this match. I\u2019m really excited to play against this champion ... I\u2019m ready.\u201d Rafa is asked about playing in his 8,764th grand slam semi-final. \u201cThe connection with the crowd is very special,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to playing my best tennis.\u201d The winner of tonight will face Daniil Medvedev in the final, by the way - he dispatched Grigor Dimitrov in straight sets. It was a struggle for the Russian in the first but things went fairly comfortably after that. We\u2019ll have a full report up soon. Hello, and welcome to the second of tonight\u2019s semi-finals. As you will see below there is a slight discrepancy in the career achievements of our protagonists. On the other hand, our underdog has 10 years to win a mere 80 titles and equal Rafa\u2019s record. You may also notice that Matteo is a little more ... unpredictable when it comes to hitting big shots (although it should be noted that the Italian has spent far more time on court that Nadal). Tom will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s how Rafa got on in the quarter-final: Rafael Nadal overcame a spirited challenge from Argentina\u2019s Diego Schwartzman to win 6-4, 7-5, 6-2 in the US Open quarter-finals on Wednesday night at Arthur Ashe Stadium, staying on course for a fourth title at Flushing Meadows and 19th major championship to move within one of Roger Federer\u2019s all-time record. The second-seeded Spaniard squandered double-break leads in the first and second sets, but recovered to win each of them with exquisite shotmaking and his trademark steel before closing out the match after two hours and 47 minutes. \u201cWhen he is under confidence he\u2019s very difficult to stop,\u201d Nadal said after reaching the semi-finals of a major tournament for the 33rd time. \u201cOf course I made some mistakes, but I\u2019m super happy the way I accepted the situation and I accepted the challenge. Here I am in the semi-finals. It\u2019s super important to me. It means everything.\u201d",

The 34-year-old Laotian activist was last seen at his Bangkok home on 26 August, sparking fears for his safety in a region where there has been a spate of enforced disappearances of political activists. \u201cThe Thai government should immediately provide information on the whereabouts of outspoken Lao activist Od Sayavong,\u201d said Brad Adams, the Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cBangkok\u2019s streets should be safe from abductions and wrongful arrests.\u201d The pro-democracy campaigner had been living in Thailand as he sought resettlement to a third country by a UN refugee agency and was connected to the Free Lao group, a network of migrant workers and activists living in exile in Bangkok, who held occasional protests and peacefully advocated for human rights and democracy in Laos. Several members of the network recently told HRW they had been put under surveillance and intimidated by Thai and Lao authorities. Colleagues of the Laotian activist filed a report with the Thai police on 2 September but no progress in the investigation has been reported. On Friday, a defence ministry spokesman, Lt Gen Kongcheep Tantravanich, denied knowledge of Od\u2019s whereabouts. The one-party communist Lao government has arbitrarily arrested and detained critics before, while the Thai government has collaborated with foreign governments to arrest and forcibly return exiled dissidents. The disappearance of Od Sayavong follows a series of similar cases in recent years, including that of five Thai activists who have disappeared from their homes in Laos since 2016. In December two of their bodes were found in the Mekong River, their stomachs pumped with concrete. The disappearance of Od Sayavong comes days after the charred remains of ethnic Karen leader Por Cha Lee Rakcharoen, or \u201cBilly\u201d, were found in an oil drum and lake in a Thai national park, five years after he went missing.

But after two days of Hurricane Dorian\u2019s pounding winds, sometimes reaching 220mph, it has been reduced almost entirely to rubble. The category 5 storm was the most powerful hurricane to ever hit the Bahamas and left a trail of destruction and death across its northern archipelago. Top: A damaged house in High Rock, on the eastern part of Grand Bahama island. Bottom: The High Rock police station. All photos by Angel Valentin. Local residents who stayed behind each have their own survival stories. Some clung to tree branches for days on end; others witnessed their neighbors swept away in the winds. Many were left desperately searching for loved ones who went missing in the storm, with several bodies found and dozens unaccounted for. The surrounding forests were blasted so hard there are hardly any leaves left on trees. Of the handful of homes still standing, most are without roofs. Top: Sherman Roberts, 62, takes a break from cleaning a friend\u2019s house. Bottom: Inside the house of Ishmael Laing, which suffered extensive water damage. Some residents, including Euridice Kemp, were quick to link the ferocity of hurricane Dorian to the global climate crisis. Kemp, who returned to the town to salvage what she could from her grandparents\u2019 home, said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing to Mother Earth and the way this turns around on areas like here \u2026 I just can\u2019t.

It\u2019s unheard of that they would \u2013 with no scientific basis whatsoever \u2013 undermine their own employees for political reasons. That\u2019s never happened before under any administration ... This doesn\u2019t happen. This is a scientific agency.

That\u2019s what NOAA\u2019s doing. It\u2019s irresponsible, managerial malpractice, and frankly someone should look into them. They have no right to be running an organization if that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Sobien said that he was not been able to think of a way for the union to challenge NOAA\u2019s actions, since they did not violate the union contract. </p> \n  <p>Still, he said NWS employees were expressing displeasure on social media. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen from our own members that they\u2019re up in arms.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me today. Have a good weekend! Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s biggest political news: The Trump administration is considering effectively ending the refugee program, which has allowed thousands of people to resettle in the United States each year since 1980. Trump met with a Democratic senator yesterday to discuss possible gun measures after the three mass shootings last month, but he has not committed to a specific piece of legislation, raising serious doubts of any progress on the issue. The Justice Department has launched an anti-trust investigation into four car companies that struck a deal with California to heighten emissions standards, intensifying complaints of Trump weaponizing the department. Trump repeated his false claim that his warning of Hurricane Dorian hitting Alabama was accurate, even as the storm actually struck North Carolina. NOAA, which oversees the National Weather Service, issued a statement undermining the Birmingham, Alabama NWS office for issuing a statement correcting the president\u2019s false information about the storm. The president of the union that represents employees of the National Weather Service has responded to NOAA\u2019s statement undermining the Birmingham NWS office, telling the Guardian that NOAA\u2019s statement was \u201cdangerous\u201d, \u201cdisgusting\u201d, \u201cirresponsible\u201d and \u201cgoing to cost people\u2019s lives\u201d. Dan Sobien, president of the National Weather Service Employees Organization, responded to the Friday afternoon statement from NOAA (which oversees the NWS) on Twitter. In a phone interview with the Guardian, he explained his deep concern over the statement, which he said was unprecedented in his decades with the NWS. (Sobien stressed that he was speaking in his capacity as president of the union and not for the NWS.) \u201cI\u2019m absolutely shocked at what NOAA did tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cNever, never has the agency undermined its employees like that. It\u2019s unheard of that they would \u2013 with no scientific basis whatsoever \u2013 undermine their own employees for political reasons. That\u2019s never happened before under any administration ... This doesn\u2019t happen. This is a scientific agency. People gather data and they make the best decisions they can make form that data.\u201d Sobien\u2019s union represents about 4,000 employees of the NWS, including meteorologists, flight engineers, technicians, and others. \u201cThe NWS\u2019s job is to save people\u2019s lives, and if you undermine that authority, you\u2019re going to cost people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t believe hurricane warnings or tornado warnings, it will cost lives. That\u2019s what NOAA\u2019s doing. It\u2019s irresponsible, managerial malpractice, and frankly someone should look into them. They have no right to be running an organization if that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d Sobien said that he was not been able to think of a way for the union to challenge NOAA\u2019s actions, since they did not violate the union contract. Still, he said NWS employees were expressing displeasure on social media. \u201cI\u2019ve seen from our own members that they\u2019re up in arms. People are asking us to do something and I don\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s just disgusting. The whole thing is just ridiculous.\u201d The chairwoman of the Arizona Republican Party is facing criticism after a fundraising email called for stopping Democratic senate candidate \u201cgun-grabber Mark Kelly dead in his tracks\u201d. Mark Kelly is married to former to former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head by a gunman in a 2011 attack that left six people dead. Giffords survived but suffered serious injuries. Kelly, a former astronaut, is an advocate to gun control. \u201cSupport the Republican Party of Arizona today and, together, we\u2019ll stop gun-grabber Mark Kelly dead in his tracks,\u201d reads the email from Kelli Ward, according to the Washington Post. Boycotts get called all the time in the Trump era, and it\u2019s hard to tell how many of them have a real impact. (Did you actually #DeleteUber, or just tweet that you did?) But a new report by Vox suggests that the boycott of upscale spinning class SoulCycle over investor Stephen Ross\u2019s fundraiser for Trump actually had an effect. The report is based on data from Earnest Research, which analyzed public data an found consistent declines in attendance at SoulCyle classes in the four weeks since news of the fundraiser broke. I guess if your boycott makes a virtue out of skipping exercise it has a greater chance of succeeding than if it involves inconvenience or sacrifice. It\u2019s Friday afternoon, tens of thousands of people are facing devastation in the Bahamas, and Dorian is continuing to batter the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Meanwhile, President Trump is continuing to throw a temper tantrum about whether or not he should have said on Sunday that the state of Alabama would be hit by the hurricane. (He should not have.) NOAA, the federal agency overseeing the National Weather Service, has now released an official statement discounting its Birmingham, Alabama branch\u2019s statement from the weekend informing Alabamians that they need not worry about Dorian. Trump also just tweeted a video that shows a CNN reporter suggesting that the storm might hit Alabama, followed by a CNN logo superimposed over a speeding car that crashes and burns. Someone is certainly crashing and burning, though I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s CNN. Hello everyone. This is Julia Carrie Wong in San Francisco, taking over the blog for the rest of the day. Congress will reconvene next week, and CNN is reporting that Democrats on the House judiciary committee are considering broadening their investigation into Donald Trump beyond the scope of the Robert Mueller investigation. \u201cIt is not all about Russian interference in the 2016 election and the President\u2019s efforts to cover up his role in it,\u201d Representative Jamie Raskin told CNN. \u201cThe central sin, the original sin of the Trump administration, is the decision to convert the presidency into a money-making operation for the President and his business and his family.\u201d Other potential topics of congressional hearings could include hush-money payments and the reports that Trump promised to pardon officials if they violated the law to push through his anti-immigrant agenda, according to the report. That\u2019s it from me this week. My West Coast colleague, Julia Carrie Wong, will be taking over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The Trump administration is considering effectively ending the refugee program, which has allowed thousands of people to resettle in the United States each year since 1980. The final decision will be made next week. The Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, said he is not expecting a US or global recession, despite the most recent jobs report slightly missing expectations. Trump met with a Democratic senator yesterday to discuss possible gun measures after the three mass shootings last month, but he has not committed to a specific piece of legislation, raising serious doubts of any progress on the issue. The Justice Department has launched an anti-trust investigation into four car companies that struck a deal with California to heighten emissions standards, intensifying complaints of Trump weaponizing the department. Trump repeated his false claim that his warning of Hurricane Dorian hitting Alabama was accurate, even as the storm actually struck North Carolina. (Follow the latest updates on Dorian\u2019s progress here.) Speculation is mounting over whether Mike Pompeo will enter the Kansas Senate race, and the secretary of state has done virtually nothing to quell the rumors. Julia will have more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. And have a wonderful weekend! Fresh from the department of oof: Democratic presidential candidate Tim Ryan said he thinks Joe Biden is \u201cdeclining\u201d and doesn\u2019t have the \u201cenergy\u201d to defeat Trump. \u201cI just think Biden is declining,\u201d Ryan told a reporter, whom he apparently mistook for a potential donor. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has the energy. You see it almost daily. And I love the guy.\u201d Biden has suffered a series of embarrassing gaffes recently, but they don\u2019t appear to have dented his status as the Democratic front-runner. He has maintained a double-digit polling lead over all his competitors. Meanwhile, Ryan\u2019s campaign has languished, with the Ohio congressman failing to qualify for the third debate and generally attracting less than 1 percent of voters\u2019 support in polls. But Ryan said he may continue in the race even if he does not qualify for the fourth debate in October. The president\u2019s second son, Eric Trump, is being mocked by journalists for accusing a Washington Post reporter of sending ... well, a pretty normal email. From a Daily Beast reporter: From a Politico reporter: The Trump administration isn\u2019t only considering drastically rolling back refugee admissions. It\u2019s also trying to make it harder for refugees to work in the United States. Axios reports: The Trump administration is planning to allow immigration officials to take as long as needed to approve work permits for asylum seekers by throwing out the current 30-day processing deadline, according to the proposed regulation released on Friday. Why it matters: The rule could prevent some asylum seekers, awaiting a decision on their asylum claims in the U.S., from legally working for a long period of time. They are already forced to wait 180 days before they are eligible for a work permit. Asylum cases often take years due to immigration court backlogs. The new policies, in combination with the announcement last month that the administration would start penalizing green card applicants who use public benefits, demonstrate how Trump\u2019s White House is cracking down on immigration of all forms \u2014 legal and illegal. Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker has quietly and steadily amassed the most endorsements in the first two voting states, Iowa and New Hampshire. Local leaders insist that endorsements still matter in presidential primaries, but 2016 offered some very compelling evidence to the contrary. After all, Trump had attracted only a handful of endorsements before becoming the presumptive Republican nominee. And Bernie Sanders was able to launch a much more formidable bid against Hillary Clinton than many commentators expected, even though Clinton had the endorsement of most congressional Democrats. Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer is apparently trying to capitalize on the news that the liberal outlet ThinkProgress will shutter today. Steyer left the board of the Center for American Progress, the parent think tank of ThinkProgress, when he launched his presidential bid. But given the billionaire activist\u2019s immense wealth, many noted he could have easily paid to save the news site, which has run deficits in recent years. From a former ThinkProgress reporter: Here\u2019s more on ThinkProgress shutting down, from the Daily Beast: The outlet, which served as an editorially independent project of the Democratic Party think tank Center for American Progress, will stop current operations on Friday and be converted into a site where CAP scholars can post. Top officials at CAP had been searching for a buyer to take over ThinkProgress, which has run deficits for years, and according to sources there were potentially three serious buyers in the mix recently. But in a statement to staff, Navin Nayak, the executive director of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, said the site was ultimately unable to secure a patron. ... A dozen ThinkProgress employees will be losing their jobs, a CAP aide said, as many who were on staff had already gone to work elsewhere and some were incorporated into the larger CAP infrastructure. Meanwhile, Steyer has sunk tens of millions of dollars into his presidential bid and was not even able to qualify for the third debate. The shuttering of ThinkProgress is another reminder of how many causes could be supported with the money being spent on presidential campaigns unable to attract even 1 percent of voters\u2019 support. Larry Kudlow, Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, dismissed concerns about the most recent jobs report, which slightly missed expectations as the unemployment rate held steady. Kudlow also side-stepped a question about whether Trump still considers trade wars \u201ceasy to win,\u201d as he claimed last year. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Kudlow replied. \u201cYou\u2019d have to ask him directly.\u201d Trump\u2019s tariffs on China have roiled US markets in recent weeks, and he has shown little sign of backing down, even as negotiators from the two countries plan to resume talks next month. As Pompeo weighs whether to launch a Senate bid, the secretary of state is reportedly barely on speaking terms with Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John Bolton. CNN reports: Bolton and Pompeo rarely speak outside of formal meetings, three [people familiar with the situation] said, including a recent stretch of going weeks without speaking to one another. That has left key coordination efforts between the White House and State Department to underlings. There\u2019s also a rift between Bolton and Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who oversees the West Wing. Mulvaney has clashed with Bolton over ideological differences in recent months and sought to distance himself from the embattled national security adviser. ... But the current situation has led to a deep sense of isolation for NSC staffers working under Bolton, who are charged with coordinating foreign policy and national security options for the President. The internal rift has only added to the sense of confusion about the administration\u2019s foreign policy priorities, and left some allies and experts scratching their heads about who is running Trump\u2019s policy abroad, according to diplomats and administration officials. Mike Pompeo, currently serving as Trump\u2019s secretary of state, is really not doing much to quell speculation that he might jump into the Kansas Senate race next year. \u201cI do see the noise. I\u2019m flattered when people say Mike will be a good United States senator representing Kansas,\u201d Pompeo told a local talk radio station. \u201cBut I\u2019m doing something that I consider an incredible privilege, an opportunity of a lifetime to lead the State Department, and I\u2019m focused on doing that each and every day.\u201d Pompeo was similarly evasive on the topic during an interview with the Wichita Eagle and the Kansas City Star, saying his comments on the matter could be taken \u201chowever you\u2019d like.\u201d And as a Bloomberg News reporter noted, all of Pompeo\u2019s cagey answers are only heightening speculation that he will enter the race. The former congressman has also reportedly met with Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, to discuss the race, and some people have suggested Pompeo will launch a bid if he doesn\u2019t think the president will win re-election. The Trump administration meets next week to discuss what the refugee cap will be for the fiscal year starting Oct 1 after consistently working to trim back the US refugee program to zero admissions. It\u2019s an unusual target; refugees are subjected to the highest level of vetting of any person immigrating to the United States and the program has had consistent bipartisan support since it first began in 1980. Bob Carey, who oversaw the refugee resettlement program under Barack Obama, told the Guardian in June that the push to end refugee admissions is \u201cideologically driven by some people in this administration who are against immigration in any way, shape or form.\u201d Elizabeth Warren joined her follow Democratic presidential candidate, Beto O\u2019Rourke, in calling for an expansion of the US refugee resettlement program. For reference, the Obama administration set a goal of admitting 110,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017. Pew Research Center has more on the history of the program: About 3 million refugees have been resettled in the U.S. since Congress passed the Refugee Act of 1980, which created the Federal Refugee Resettlement Program and the current national standard for the screening and admission of refugees into the country. One of the Democratic presidential candidates, Beto O\u2019Rourke, reacted to the Trump administration considering an effective end to the refugee program. O\u2019Rourke, who previously represented the border city of El Paso in the House, said the move would go against the principles of America\u2019s founding. Jerome Powell said today that the Federal Reserve, of which he is chairman, is not expecting a US or global recession. But it is monitoring a number of uncertainties, including trade conflicts, and will \u201cact as appropriate to sustain the expansion.\u201d Powell gave an upbeat view of the American economy during an appearance with Swiss National Bank Chairman Thomas Jordan in Switzerland. Powell said that trade policy is causing \u201csome uncertainty\u201d but that the US consumer is in good shape. \u201cI would not see a recession as the most likely outcome for the United States or the global economy,\u201d Powell said. Powell was speaking at a conference sponsored by the Swiss Institute of International Studies at the University of Zurich. It was his first public appearance since his remarks at the Fed\u2019s annual monetary conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on August 23. Financial markets were eager to see whether Powell would provide any more clues about what the Fed will do at its next meeting on September 17-18. At its last meeting in July, the Fed cut rates for the first time in a decade, lowering its key policy rate to a new range of 2% to 2.25%. Markets believe there is a near certainty that the Fed will cut rates for a second time at the September meeting. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The Trump administration is weighing an effective end to the refugee program that has allowed tens of thousands of people to resettle in the United States each year. The final decision will likely come next week. Trump met with a Democratic senator yesterday to discuss possible gun measures after last month\u2019s three mass shootings, but the president has offered no commitment on supporting a specific piece of legislation. The Justice Department is launching an investigation into four automakers who struck a deal with California in July to heighten emission standards, raising concerns that Trump is weaponizing the department. Howard Schultz announced he would not pursue an independent presidential bid after all, despite toying with the idea for months. The US jobs report slightly missed expectations as the unemployment rate held steady. The blog is keeping an eye on all of the Trump administration\u2019s policy moves and Hurricane Dorian\u2019s progress, so stay tuned. Politico reported back in July that Trump was weighing an effective shutdown of the refugee program, at the urging of an official aligned with senior White House adviser Stephen Miller. Miller has been the most ardent anti-immigration official in the president\u2019s closest circle of advisers, and his influence is reportedly only rivaled by Jared Kushner\u2019s. In his two and a half years in the administration, Miller has championed a number of proposals aimed at limiting both legal and illegal immigration. For example, he was a major proponent of the administration\u2019s proposal, announced last month, to penalize green-card applicants who use public benefits. The Trump administration is considering an effective end to the refugee program that has allowed tens of thousands of people to resettle in the United States each year. The New York Times reports: In meetings over the past several weeks, one top administration official has proposed zeroing out the program altogether, while leaving the president with the ability to admit refugees in an emergency. Another option that top officials are weighing would cut refugee admissions by half or more, to 10,000 to 15,000 people, but reserve most of those spots for refugees from a few handpicked countries or groups with special status, such as Iraqis and Afghans who work alongside American troops, diplomats and intelligence operatives abroad. Both options would all but end the United States\u2019 status as one of the leading places accepting refugees from around the world. The issue is expected to come to a head on Tuesday, when the White House plans to convene a high-level meeting in the Situation Room to discuss at what number Mr. Trump should set the annual, presidentially determined ceiling on refugee admissions for the coming year. Reports of the Justice Department launching an investigation into car companies pursuing lower emission standards reignited complaints that Trump is weaponizing the department. From a former spokesman for Barack Obama\u2019s Justice Department: From a ProPublica editor: Trump\u2019s Justice Department has launched an investigation into the four car companies that struck a deal with California in July to heighten emission standards. The Wall Street Journal reports: Justice Department lawyers are seeking to determine if Ford Motor Co. , Honda Motor Co. , BMW AG and Volkswagen AG violated federal competition law by agreeing with each other to follow tailpipe-emissions standards beyond those proposed by the Trump administration, [people familiar with the situation] said. ... The new antitrust inquiry by the Justice Department stands to escalate tensions between Washington, Sacramento and the auto industry over plans by the Trump administration to roll back clean-air mandates on auto makers. California regulators have said they are willing to ease mandates, but not nearly as far as the Trump administration, which has proposed eliminating all upcoming increases in the efficiency requirements. Trump met with Joe Manchin, the Democratic senator of West Virginia, yesterday to discuss possible gun measures in the wake of three more mass shootings that left dozens dead. The Wall Street Journal reports: The 30-minute private meeting, which included several White House staffers, touched on a range of possible gun-related policy issues including background checks, the people said. Mr. Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, and Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) have long urged legislation expanding background checks for gun sales. Their bill failed to pass the Senate in 2013. \u2018The president expressed interest in getting a result, so conversations will continue to see if there\u2019s a way to create a reasonable background check proposal, along with other ideas,\u2019 a White House official said. But another person familiar with the meeting said the president didn\u2019t give Sen. Manchin a clear signal, illustrating the widespread uncertainty on Capitol Hill about what Mr. Trump might support. The meeting seems to be the latest attempt by the president to give the appearance of doing something on guns while actually doing nothing. Mitch McConnell has said he will not take up a gun bill in the Senate without Trump\u2019s explicit endorsement, and the president has consistently sent mixed messages on what legislation he wants to see. Given that Trump has reportedly been presented with polling showing that background checks are not popular among his voting base, it seems less and less likely the president will sign a gun bill into law in the near future, despite the dozens of lives lost. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign is now fundraising off Sharpiegate, giving supporters the chance to buy markers so that they, too, can alter maps showing the potential path of a hurricane and unnecessarily raise alarm in a state out of the storm\u2019s way. Of course, this tweet from Trump\u2019s campaign manager gets the order of events surrounding Sharpiegate a little backwards. The media isn\u2019t still covering the altered map because it\u2019s going \u201ccrazy.\u201d It\u2019s covering the story because the president is apparently having trouble letting the matter go, repeatedly tweeting (as recently as this morning) his false claim that his warning about the hurricane hitting Alabama was accurate. So if there\u2019s anyone who this story is driving \u201ccrazy,\u201d it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s the media. The blog will now return to one of the weirder news events of August: an anti-Trump boycott of Equinox and SoulCycle. In case you need a refresher: the luxury fitness chains faced calls for a boycott after it was revealed that one of the companies\u2019 major investors was hosting a fundraiser for Trump. Such political boycotts are generally unsuccessful, but new data indicates the flare-up may have actually affected SoulCycle\u2019s business. Recode reports: In the weeks following the August 7 news about the fundraiser, boycott calls appear to have worked, according to new data from Earnest Research, a company that analyzed publicly available website data. During the week that ended on Sunday, August 11, which includes dates both before and after the news, SoulCycle attendance declined about 1 percent compared with the same week a year earlier. That\u2019s been followed with consistent declines of 6 percent to 7.5 percent in subsequent weeks. The data only includes SoulCycle locations across the US that were open last year, in order to be able to make the comparison. Additional data, which Earnest blogged about last month, shows an even larger decline from earlier in August 2019, though it says some of that is related to seasonal attendance trends. The data could make high-dollar donors even more skittish about diving into politics in any form during the Trump era. Okay, one last thing about Sharpiegate: it appears the altered map of Hurricane Dorian, which was changed to include Alabama in the storm\u2019s potential path, was the work of the president himself. The Washington Post reports: It was Trump who used a black Sharpie to mark up an official National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration map, which he displayed during an Oval Office briefing on Wednesday, according to a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. \u2018No one else writes like that on a map with a black Sharpie,\u2019 the official said of the map, which added Alabama into the hurricane\u2019s potential pathway inside the loop of the marker. Well, here we are again. With Hurricane Dorian battering North Carolina, Trump has taken time out of his day to once again claim that his inaccurate warning about the storm hitting Alabama was, indeed, accurate. This blog has been over this many, many times, but Trump is not being truthful here. By the time that the president tweeted out his Sunday warning that Alabama \u201cwill most likely be hit,\u201d Dorian\u2019s projected path was not touching the state. This falsehood has been relentlessly fact-checked in recent days, so it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess why the president is waging a war on reality itself, even though Americans outside of Alabama are facing the storm right now. Trump has even taken this crusade to his favorite cable news outlet, as CNN reported yesterday: Fox News senior White House correspondent John Roberts had just finished his 3 p.m. live shot on Thursday when President Donald Trump beckoned him into the Oval Office. The President had one argument to make, according to an internal Fox email Roberts sent about the meeting provided to CNN. \u2018He stressed to me that forecasts for Dorian last week had Alabama in the warning cone,\u2019 Roberts wrote. \u2018He insisted that it is unfair to say Alabama was never threatened by the storm.\u2019 Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg has released his first statewide ad in Iowa, which will run across television and digital platforms in the early voting state. \u201cAs a veteran, and as a mayor, I\u2019ve seen what we can achieve when we have each other\u2019s backs. But in today\u2019s divided America, we\u2019re at each other\u2019s throats,\u201d Buttigieg says in the ad. \u201cTo meet these challenges and to defeat this president, we need real solutions, not more polarization.\u201d That last point is obviously a dig at Trump, but it also seems aimed at some of Buttigieg\u2019s more liberal opponents, like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who have consistently out-performed the Indiana mayor in recent polls. Buttigieg enjoyed a burst of enthusiasm about his campaign in the spring, which he has capitalized on to build a formidable fundraising operation. But so far, that energy hasn\u2019t translated into a polling surge. He has lingered in the single digits, just outside the top tier of candidates, in recent weeks. More on the jobs numbers: the US economy slightly missed expectations by adding only 130,000 jobs in August, less than the 158,000 economists predicted. As the unemployment rate held steady at 3.7 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics also revised down its July jobs number from 164,000 to 159,000. Trump immediately turned to blaming Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman that he nominated, for the slowing economy, but the jobs report didn\u2019t cause any additional concerns about a looming recession. For more insight on the numbers, catch up on our colleague Jasper Jolly\u2019s live blog. Former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders made her debut on Fox News today \u2013 and it\u2019s evident she\u2019ll have no trouble transitioning from Donald Trump\u2019s White House press booster to becoming the president\u2019s FOX TV mouthpiece. \u201cI\u2019m not going to suddenly change my positions,\u201d she told Fox &amp; Friends. \u201cI think that would be very odd. I loved working for the president.\u201d First call of duty for Sanders, who stepped down from the White House in June amid rumors, fueled by Trump, that she\u2019ll enter the race for Arkansas governor, was to talk up the latest jobs report. \u201cWe found a magic wand in president Trump and he\u2019s brought manufacturing jobs back this country,\u201d she kicked off, before defending the aggressive stance her former boss has taken on Chinese trade tariffs. \u201cThe president could not be more right on this. We have to make a decision at this point. Who do we want to lead the world? The United States or China? I can assure you that under this president I can assure you it will always be the United States of America.\u201d And so Sanders continued, taking aim \u2013 as expected \u2013 at the climate crisis proposals that came out of the Democratic candidates town hall debate, including banning commercial air travel, calling it \u201cvery scary the path they want to take us down.\u201d Sanders was asked about being thrown out of a restaurant in Virginia over her political views. Asked if she was still taking in public places, Sanders said it was \u201chit and miss.\u201d \u201cNinety percent of people who come over to say something negative and to attack you are women. I find that startling. I am only the third woman and first mom to be the White House press secretary. Yet women attack me relentlessly instead of being proud that more women doing those types of jobs\u2026\u201d Sanders announced her upcoming memoir on Thursday, tweeting that the book will \u201ctell my story about the fight for the future of our country.\u201d Twitter users were quick to offer title suggestions, including \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Lie,\u201d \u201cLiar, Liar, Pants On Fire\u201d and \u201cMalice in Blunderland.\u201d Hurricane Dorian is continuing its devastating journey through the Atlantic, unleashing intense winds and rain in North Carolina. Dorian\u2019s effects are also expected to be felt in Virginia and possibly southeast New England before the storm dissipates. But it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that the Bahamas experienced the most significant losses from the hurricane. The country\u2019s official death toll has risen to 30, but that\u2019s expected to increase as recovery efforts continue. The Guardian is keeping up its live coverage of the storm today, so follow along. The candidates challenging Trump for the Republican presidential nomination already had their work cut out for them, given the president\u2019s sky-high approval rating in the party. But now those challengers might not even get the chance to compete against Trump in certain states. Politico reports: Four states are poised to cancel their 2020 GOP presidential primaries and caucuses, a move that would cut off oxygen to Donald Trump\u2019s long-shot primary challengers. Republican parties in South Carolina, Nevada, Arizona and Kansas are expected to finalize the cancellations in meetings this weekend, according to three GOP officials who are familiar with the plans. The moves are the latest illustration of Trump\u2019s takeover of the entire Republican Party apparatus. They underscore the extent to which his allies are determined to snuff out any potential nuisance en route to his renomination \u2014 or even to deny Republican critics a platform to embarrass him. Trump advisers are quick to point out that parties of an incumbent president seeking reelection have a long history of canceling primaries and note it will save state parties money. But the president\u2019s primary opponents, who have struggled to gain traction, are crying foul, calling it part of a broader effort to rig the contest in Trump\u2019s favor. It is true that some states have canceled primaries in the past when an incumbent president was running, but the moves are still sure to trigger accusations that the GOP is trying to stifle democracy for Trump\u2019s benefit. Despite the pushback, Joe Biden went ahead with a fundraiser last night that was co-hosted by a founder of a natural gas company, which some activists said violated the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge. \u201cI just want to be very clear to everyone here: I am committed to not raising money from fossil fuel executives and I am not doing that tonight,\u201d Biden told fundraiser attendees. \u201cClimate change presents an existential threat, and it is real \u2026 I\u2019m so tired of having a president who picks fiction over science.\u201d Meanwhile, a couple dozen protesters outside the event chanted phrases like, \u201cHey hey, hey Joe, fracked gas has got to go.\u201d Biden chose to blame the controversy on a \u201cmild misrepresentation,\u201d and his aides have pointed out that the host in question, Andrew Goldman, is not involved in the day-to-day operations of the natural gas company. But climate activists are still crying foul, accusing Biden of playing semantics to get around the pledge that he signed. It doesn\u2019t help matters that many Democrats are already displeased about Biden holding high-dollar fundraisers at all. But given the former vice president\u2019s steady position atop most polls despite a series of recent gaffes, it seems unlikely that this flare-up will move the needle much. Happy Friday, live blog readers! Well, that\u2019s one less person running for president. Howard Schultz, the former Starbucks CEO, announced that he would not pursue the independent presidential bid he has been toying with since January. \u201cMy belief in the need to reform our two-party system has not wavered, but I have concluded that an independent campaign for the White House is not how I can best serve our country at this time,\u201d Schultz wrote in a letter posted to his website. Schulz also noted that \u201cnot enough people today are willing to consider backing an independent candidate because they fear doing so might lead to re-electing a uniquely dangerous incumbent president\u201d. That last sentiment will likely frustrate the many Democrats who have been making that same argument to Schultz for months. But it will still come as a relief on the left that Schultz, who presented himself as a pragmatic alternative to some of the more progressive presidential candidates, will not split the anti-Trump vote. More than anything, the announcement came as a shock to those who forgot Schultz was still considering a bid, given that back surgery has left him unable to campaign since June. This Slate headline neatly summed it up: \u201cFormer Starbucks CEO Reminds Everyone He Was Thinking of Running for President by Announcing He Won\u2019t.\u201d Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Donald Trump has no publicly scheduled events and is already tweeting about everything from immigration to interest rates. Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg will appear on the Breakfast Club. Hurricane Dorian, now a category 1 storm, is unleashing its havoc on North Carolina. The Guardian will have live coverage of the storm as it progresses. That\u2019s all still coming up, so stay tuned.",
