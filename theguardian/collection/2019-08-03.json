In 1960, he worked on Primary, which captured John F Kennedy\u2019s run in the presidential primary against Hubert Humphrey.</p> <p>He returned to politics with The War Room (1993), co-directed with his wife, Chris Hegedus, with whom he made most of his films. Their behind-the-scenes documentary looking at Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign received an Oscar nomination in 1994.</p> <p>Perhaps his most famous film, however, is Dont Look Back (sic), released in 1967, which depicts Bob Dylan\u2019s last acoustic concert tour of the UK in 1965.

      "bodyText": "The film-maker DA Pennebaker has died aged 94. He died of natural causes on Thursday, his son, Frazer Pennebaker, told the Hollywood Reporter. The concert film Monterey Pop was a record of the 1967 Monterey International Pop festival that launched the careers of Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix, while Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars captured on film the night in July 1973 that David Bowie \u201ckilled off\u201d his alien alter ego. Pennebaker received a lifetime achievement award Oscar in 2013 \u2013 the first documentary-maker to do so \u2013 honouring his contribution as a pioneer of cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 film-making, a movement that originated in France and, featuring natural actions and authentic dialogue, showed subjects living their day-to-day lives. Pennebaker made his first film, Daybreak Express, in 1953. In 1960, he worked on Primary, which captured John F Kennedy\u2019s run in the presidential primary against Hubert Humphrey. He returned to politics with The War Room (1993), co-directed with his wife, Chris Hegedus, with whom he made most of his films. Their behind-the-scenes documentary looking at Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign received an Oscar nomination in 1994. Perhaps his most famous film, however, is Dont Look Back (sic), released in 1967, which depicts Bob Dylan\u2019s last acoustic concert tour of the UK in 1965. It broke box-office records at the time, and is considered a benchmark in rock documentary. In an interview with Time in 2007, Pennebaker reflected on Dylan\u2019s reaction to the film. \u201cHe saw it out in Hollywood at a dreadful screening. Afterward, he said: \u2018We\u2019ll have another screening and I\u2019ll write down all of the things we have to change.\u2019 \u201cOf course, that made me a little gloomy. The next night, we assembled again and he sat in the front with this yellow pad. At the end of the film, he held up the pad and there was nothing on it.

      "body": "<p>Thomas Deng doesn\u2019t remember the year his father died. He can\u2019t recall the feeling of leaving Kenya, where his father stayed to continue his work as a doctor assisting disabled children, and joining a growing community of South-Sudanese refugees in Adelaide\u2019s northern suburbs.</p> <p>Nor does he remember afternoons playing football down discarded Nairobi alleyways with roving neighbourhood kids; rabonas, feints and step-overs shadowed beneath the leering sunset. He heard of his father\u2019s death years later, but to this day, the hardships his family endured in Africa remain a remote topic, bursting with unanswered questions \u201ctoo emotional\u201d to ask. </p> <p>The challenges they face today, however, are a different story. Deng has just finished filming a promotion for one of the numerous community organisations he is an ambassador for \u2013&#xa0;domestic-violence campaigners The Line. His wide-set, striking grin provides the video\u2019s click-bait and, standing formidably on the turf of AAMI Park, he gently encourages teenage boys to \u201cnever follow\u201d in the footsteps of domestic violence perpetrators.</p> <p>\u201cGrowing up, I thought to be a man was to put on an act and never show weakness,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I think it\u2019s better to show your vulnerability. People respect you more.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/30/barefoot-to-boots-socceroo-awer-mabil-recognised-for-refugee-work\">Barefoot to Boots: Socceroo Awer Mabil recognised for refugee work</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Soon before Deng signed for Melbourne Victory, his aunt\u2019s husband struck his infant nephew in the head during a family argument, leaving the child permanently disabled with a severe acquired brain injury. Deng shudders as he recounts the \u201cassault on the whole family\u201d, detailing the trauma of holding his nephew as a baby and watching him grow into an incapacitated child.</p> <p>\u201cSeeing my aunty go through this was heartbreaking,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s one stupid decision that ends someone\u2019s life.\u201d His aunt and her family moved to Sydney shortly after, where she eventually escaped the relationship, but the impact never left the Deng household. </p> <p>Since he earned his first professional contract, before going onto becoming an A-League champion, FFA Cup winner and Socceroo, Deng has resolutely leveraged his status to publicise social issues close to his heart. \u201cIt\u2019s our time,\u201d he says. \u201cThe right time for someone to speak out and be a voice for Africans in Melbourne. We need to show ourselves more.\u201d</p> <p>In many ways, Deng is just like any other 22-year-old. He grew up on Spiderman and loves crime thrillers, Kanye West and Kendrick Lamar. He describes himself as \u201cpretty good\u201d at hip-hop dancing and still blushes at the memory of falling over in front of his teammates on his first day of training.</p> <p>He finds the rigour of professional football difficult and acclimatising to the constant training and travel had to be \u201cdrilled\u201d into him. And during his short career, he has faced similar obstacles to every young defender \u2013 from game-losing errors, embarrassing slips and own-goals, to getting \u201cdragged off\u201d against Adelaide, his petulance broadcast on national television.</p> <p>But he has also overcome challenges unique to a refugee. When he was selected for the Young Socceroos in 2015, he had no passport and little proof of identity. He was forced to retrieve signed documents from every school he had ever attended and every football club he\u2019d ever played for, just to become eligible. He even had to receive clearance to travel overseas.</p> <p>Having overcome this kind of obstacle has given Deng a unique sense of perspective, compelling him to forfeit downtime for a greater cause. Now splitting his time off between numerous volunteer roles and maintaining an active voice in his community, he also regularly speaks to the detainees at Parkville youth detention centre in Melbourne\u2019s CBD, where his older brother, Peter, works.</p> <p>He grew up among some of the teenagers he visits and during one recent trip, encountered a childhood friend. He believes without his family\u2019s guidance growing up, he could have easily succumbed to the same \u201cwrong decisions\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMy teenage years were crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cYou see a lot of violence, your friends doing drugs, committing crimes. It\u2019s easy to be manipulated because you\u2019re always around the same peer group. My housemates work in youth services and we speak about it every day. They love that I\u2019m talking to kids about their issues because the trouble in our community is a massive problem nowadays.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b97a6b0b2a2adc1a1a0837405991008dea90f0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b97a6b0b2a2adc1a1a0837405991008dea90f0d/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomas Deng\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomas Deng in action for Melbourne Victory earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marcio Machado/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Deng speaks about the challenges South Sudanese refugees face, his voice sharpens, and it becomes clear that he\u2019s \u201cstressed\u201d. He repeats the word often, although never in relation to money, mates or girls like other 22-year-olds. Rather, he\u2019s stressed that Sudanese parents don\u2019t understand what their kids are going through. That \u201cthey don\u2019t take the time to listen\u201d. He\u2019s stressed that African refugees don\u2019t have a voice in Australia, because \u201cno one else is speaking\u201d.</p> <p>He says the same isolationist mindset that protected his family in Kenya, harms them in Australia. \u201cOnce we step out of our homes, we have to adapt to Australian culture,\u201d he says. \u201cParents don\u2019t understand what we\u2019re going through, because they grew up in African cultures. It\u2019s completely different. For me, it\u2019s about trying to help these kids survive in this world.</p> <p>\u201cAt home, our parents are quite strict. They control the things we do very heavily, they don\u2019t want us to hang out or go out much. It creates a massive issue because wherever their kids are in the community, parents can\u2019t understand what they\u2019re going through. I\u2019m trying to help guide the younger generation because I came from the same neighbourhoods and worked through the same problems coming to Australia, trying to adapt to a society with different views.\u201d</p> <p>Australia\u2019s views are also adapting to South Sudanese refugees, who are evolving the sporting landscape. Long the domain of Italian, Greek and eastern European migrants, the simultaneous Socceroos\u2019 debuts of Deng and childhood friend, Awer Mabil, are changing the face of Australian football.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/16/a-dream-come-true-refugees-deng-and-mabil-make-socceroos-debuts\">'A dream come true': refugees Deng and Mabil make Socceroos debuts together</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The duo\u2019s journey, which began \u201cplaying in Adelaide parks together\u201d reached its pinnacle when they combined for Australia\u2019s final goal in a 4-0 rout of Kuwait in October. Football writer and fellow South Sudanese refugee, Ann Odong, called footage of the two embracing in green and gold \u201ca visual representation of our acceptance as Australians\u201d.</p> <p>If Australian sport\u2019s eagerness to draw from this wealth of talent symbolises acceptance, then it bodes positively for Deng\u2019s longing for a South Sudanese-Australian identity. But convincing the community\u2019s elders to accept this new identity may be the largest challenge. </p> <p>Deng hopes that by using his status to mentor the path that was set for him, he can lead this change himself. \u201cMy family was different,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were fairly understanding. They understood that we have a new society and we need to let our kids live their lives.</p> <p>\u201cGive them a bit of trust. It\u2019s not the same as it is back home.\u201d</p> <p>\ufeff</p>",

      "bodyText": "Thomas Deng doesn\u2019t remember the year his father died. He can\u2019t recall the feeling of leaving Kenya, where his father stayed to continue his work as a doctor assisting disabled children, and joining a growing community of South-Sudanese refugees in Adelaide\u2019s northern suburbs. Nor does he remember afternoons playing football down discarded Nairobi alleyways with roving neighbourhood kids; rabonas, feints and step-overs shadowed beneath the leering sunset. He heard of his father\u2019s death years later, but to this day, the hardships his family endured in Africa remain a remote topic, bursting with unanswered questions \u201ctoo emotional\u201d to ask. The challenges they face today, however, are a different story. Deng has just finished filming a promotion for one of the numerous community organisations he is an ambassador for \u2013 domestic-violence campaigners The Line. His wide-set, striking grin provides the video\u2019s click-bait and, standing formidably on the turf of AAMI Park, he gently encourages teenage boys to \u201cnever follow\u201d in the footsteps of domestic violence perpetrators. \u201cGrowing up, I thought to be a man was to put on an act and never show weakness,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I think it\u2019s better to show your vulnerability. People respect you more.\u201d Soon before Deng signed for Melbourne Victory, his aunt\u2019s husband struck his infant nephew in the head during a family argument, leaving the child permanently disabled with a severe acquired brain injury. Deng shudders as he recounts the \u201cassault on the whole family\u201d, detailing the trauma of holding his nephew as a baby and watching him grow into an incapacitated child. \u201cSeeing my aunty go through this was heartbreaking,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s one stupid decision that ends someone\u2019s life.\u201d His aunt and her family moved to Sydney shortly after, where she eventually escaped the relationship, but the impact never left the Deng household. Since he earned his first professional contract, before going onto becoming an A-League champion, FFA Cup winner and Socceroo, Deng has resolutely leveraged his status to publicise social issues close to his heart. \u201cIt\u2019s our time,\u201d he says. \u201cThe right time for someone to speak out and be a voice for Africans in Melbourne. We need to show ourselves more.\u201d In many ways, Deng is just like any other 22-year-old. He grew up on Spiderman and loves crime thrillers, Kanye West and Kendrick Lamar. He describes himself as \u201cpretty good\u201d at hip-hop dancing and still blushes at the memory of falling over in front of his teammates on his first day of training. He finds the rigour of professional football difficult and acclimatising to the constant training and travel had to be \u201cdrilled\u201d into him. And during his short career, he has faced similar obstacles to every young defender \u2013 from game-losing errors, embarrassing slips and own-goals, to getting \u201cdragged off\u201d against Adelaide, his petulance broadcast on national television. But he has also overcome challenges unique to a refugee. When he was selected for the Young Socceroos in 2015, he had no passport and little proof of identity. He was forced to retrieve signed documents from every school he had ever attended and every football club he\u2019d ever played for, just to become eligible. He even had to receive clearance to travel overseas. Having overcome this kind of obstacle has given Deng a unique sense of perspective, compelling him to forfeit downtime for a greater cause. Now splitting his time off between numerous volunteer roles and maintaining an active voice in his community, he also regularly speaks to the detainees at Parkville youth detention centre in Melbourne\u2019s CBD, where his older brother, Peter, works. He grew up among some of the teenagers he visits and during one recent trip, encountered a childhood friend. He believes without his family\u2019s guidance growing up, he could have easily succumbed to the same \u201cwrong decisions\u201d. \u201cMy teenage years were crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cYou see a lot of violence, your friends doing drugs, committing crimes. It\u2019s easy to be manipulated because you\u2019re always around the same peer group. My housemates work in youth services and we speak about it every day. They love that I\u2019m talking to kids about their issues because the trouble in our community is a massive problem nowadays.\u201d As Deng speaks about the challenges South Sudanese refugees face, his voice sharpens, and it becomes clear that he\u2019s \u201cstressed\u201d. He repeats the word often, although never in relation to money, mates or girls like other 22-year-olds. Rather, he\u2019s stressed that Sudanese parents don\u2019t understand what their kids are going through. That \u201cthey don\u2019t take the time to listen\u201d. He\u2019s stressed that African refugees don\u2019t have a voice in Australia, because \u201cno one else is speaking\u201d. He says the same isolationist mindset that protected his family in Kenya, harms them in Australia. \u201cOnce we step out of our homes, we have to adapt to Australian culture,\u201d he says. \u201cParents don\u2019t understand what we\u2019re going through, because they grew up in African cultures. It\u2019s completely different. For me, it\u2019s about trying to help these kids survive in this world. \u201cAt home, our parents are quite strict. They control the things we do very heavily, they don\u2019t want us to hang out or go out much. It creates a massive issue because wherever their kids are in the community, parents can\u2019t understand what they\u2019re going through. I\u2019m trying to help guide the younger generation because I came from the same neighbourhoods and worked through the same problems coming to Australia, trying to adapt to a society with different views.\u201d Australia\u2019s views are also adapting to South Sudanese refugees, who are evolving the sporting landscape. Long the domain of Italian, Greek and eastern European migrants, the simultaneous Socceroos\u2019 debuts of Deng and childhood friend, Awer Mabil, are changing the face of Australian football. The duo\u2019s journey, which began \u201cplaying in Adelaide parks together\u201d reached its pinnacle when they combined for Australia\u2019s final goal in a 4-0 rout of Kuwait in October. Football writer and fellow South Sudanese refugee, Ann Odong, called footage of the two embracing in green and gold \u201ca visual representation of our acceptance as Australians\u201d. If Australian sport\u2019s eagerness to draw from this wealth of talent symbolises acceptance, then it bodes positively for Deng\u2019s longing for a South Sudanese-Australian identity. But convincing the community\u2019s elders to accept this new identity may be the largest challenge. Deng hopes that by using his status to mentor the path that was set for him, he can lead this change himself. \u201cMy family was different,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were fairly understanding. They understood that we have a new society and we need to let our kids live their lives. \u201cGive them a bit of trust. It\u2019s not the same as it is back home.\u201d \ufeff",

But the punches thrown last Wednesday have placed the university, and its links to China, in the spotlight.</p> \n<p>Last Friday, the <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/geopolitics/article/3020168/university-queensland-faces-heat-naming-chinese-diplomat\">South China Morning Post </a><a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/geopolitics/article/3020168/university-queensland-faces-heat-naming-chinese-diplomat\">revealed</a> that the Brisbane Chinese consul-general, Xu Jie, who had praised the \u201cpatriotic behaviour\u201d of the violent counter-protest, had been made an adjunct professor of language and culture by the university on 15 July.</p> \n<p>The debate over foreign influence at universities is not new, and not limited to China. It has been previously reported that some Chinese international students studying in Australia <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/chinese-spies-at-sydney-university-20140420-36ywk.html\">are monitored by the state </a>and punished back home.</p> \n<p>Recently, the focus has turned to the presence of Confucius Institutes, government-sponsored organisations that are hosted by universities and promote Chinese culture and teach Mandarin. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/25/government-to-assess-regulation-of-chinese-influence-at-universities\">recent legislative change</a> means universities with the centres must now register them as potential sources of foreign influence.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/01/hong-kong-protests-china-military-breaks-silence-to-warn-unrest-will-not-be-tolerated\">Hong Kong protests: China releases dramatic army propaganda video</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This also affects groups such as the United States Studies Centre, at the University of Sydney, which is part-funded by a US-based group that aims to strengthen the Australia-US relationship.</p> \n<p>Ji Davis, one of the organisers of the most recent protest, told Guardian Australia that UQ had become the focal point because of links between the vice-chancellor, Peter H\u00f8j, and Hanban \u2013 part of China\u2019s education ministry that oversees Confucius Institutes globally. In 2015, H\u00f8j was named Hanban\u2019s \u201coutstanding individual of the year\u201d.</p> \n<p>Davis said he believed the university\u2019s agreement with Hanban is more restrictive than at other institutions and influences what is being taught. In July, the Sydney Morning Herald revealed <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/universities-must-accept-china-s-directives-on-confucius-institutes-contracts-reveal-20190724-p52ab9.html\">that UQ was one of only four universities</a> whose Confucius Institute contract had a clause that allowed headquarters to assess the teaching quality of the Australian branches.</p> \n<p>A spokeswoman for UQ told the SMH the contract had already expired in April and they were negotiating a new version. \u201cThe draft specifies that the agreement does not limit UQ\u2019s autonomy in any way,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>The union representing the university\u2019s teachers, the National Tertiary Education Union, says it is all external influence \u2013 not just foreign, and not just China \u2013 that is the issue.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat is critical is that this is not used as a China-bashing exercise,\u201d says Michael McNally, the NTEU Queensland division secretary.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/31/fresh-unrest-in-hong-kong-after-44-protesters-charged-with-rioting\">Hong Kong protesters charged with rioting as violence flares</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThe [second] rally at UQ, which was very poorly attended, questioning the Confucius Institutes and Chinese influence in Australian universities, seems to focus on one aspect of influence in Australian universities, ignoring all the other corporate or international interests.\u201d</p> \n<p>Just two months ago, UQ students <a href=\"https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/university-of-queensland-students-to-echo-1971-with-schonell-theatre-ramsay-centre-protest-20190527-p51rq1.html\">turned out in huge numbers</a> to protest the Ramsay Centre \u2013 a much-criticised degree program that would<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/29/ramsay-foundation-may-cut-ties-with-centre-for-western-civilisation\"> teach the achievements of \u201cwestern civilisation\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>The Australian National University had previously rejected the degree over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/26/ramsay-centre-for-western-civilisation-wouldnt-guarantee-academic-autonomy-anu-says\">concerns it would override and influence teaching</a>, and academics at the University of Sydney said it would turn the university <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/13/nearly-half-of-sydney-university-staff-oppose-deal-with-ramsay-centre\">into an \u201cintellectual backwater\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>The issue at UQ, says McNally, goes bigger than China.</p> \n<p>\u201cUnfortunately, UQ doesn\u2019t have a good track record in mitigating the impacts of external influence. Compared to what the Ramsay Centre is trying to do, I think the Confucius Institute is pretty tame by comparison.

We are not out of sight of China\u2019s government. They have made that clear.\u201d Last week, the Brisbane campus of the 110-year-old university became a flashpoint for the ongoing international backlash against the Chinese state, its influence on Hong Kong and its mass detention of its Muslim Uighur population. A protest last Wednesday, organised by Hong Kong international students against the controversial extradition law, turned violent. Pro-Chinese government students interrupted the sit-in, tearing down banners, punching and shoving. But it\u2019s the fallout from that protest, the quiet intimidation that followed \u2013 death threats, surveillance \u2013 that has many Hong Kong students, particularly those with family connections to mainland China, scared to show their faces. Attendees, who believe they were identified by videos of the protest, were subsequently targeted online in doxxing attacks; in one case a Hong Kong student had his driver\u2019s licence, marriage certificate, student ID and other identifying information published on Chinese social media site Weibo. On Wednesday this week, a second protest was held. Smaller, more focused on the university\u2019s links to China, and organised by Australian students, there was an undercurrent of fear among those who \u2013 unlike their domestic counterparts \u2013 were most vulnerable to the state\u2019s capacity for retaliation. A masked woman, who did not give her name, addressed the crowd. She said she was from Hong Kong and feared for the safety of her family. \u201cAll in all, we are just protesters forced by an authoritarian government to protect ourselves,\u201d she said, her voice trembling and then booming into the microphone. \u201cSome protestors whose identities are disclosed will be stopped by police at the Hong Kong airport. So why am I now hiding my identity? Because I don\u2019t want to be disappeared after showing up on this stage.\u201d Why UQ? As the situation in Hong Kong becomes more fraught, unrest continues and fears grow that the Chinese military might intervene, the sprawling riverfront campus of the University of Queensland is an unlikely focal point for questions about China\u2019s actions and its influence. But the punches thrown last Wednesday have placed the university, and its links to China, in the spotlight. Last Friday, the South China Morning Post revealed that the Brisbane Chinese consul-general, Xu Jie, who had praised the \u201cpatriotic behaviour\u201d of the violent counter-protest, had been made an adjunct professor of language and culture by the university on 15 July. The debate over foreign influence at universities is not new, and not limited to China. It has been previously reported that some Chinese international students studying in Australia are monitored by the state and punished back home. Recently, the focus has turned to the presence of Confucius Institutes, government-sponsored organisations that are hosted by universities and promote Chinese culture and teach Mandarin. A recent legislative change means universities with the centres must now register them as potential sources of foreign influence. This also affects groups such as the United States Studies Centre, at the University of Sydney, which is part-funded by a US-based group that aims to strengthen the Australia-US relationship. Ji Davis, one of the organisers of the most recent protest, told Guardian Australia that UQ had become the focal point because of links between the vice-chancellor, Peter H\u00f8j, and Hanban \u2013 part of China\u2019s education ministry that oversees Confucius Institutes globally. In 2015, H\u00f8j was named Hanban\u2019s \u201coutstanding individual of the year\u201d. Davis said he believed the university\u2019s agreement with Hanban is more restrictive than at other institutions and influences what is being taught. In July, the Sydney Morning Herald revealed that UQ was one of only four universities whose Confucius Institute contract had a clause that allowed headquarters to assess the teaching quality of the Australian branches. A spokeswoman for UQ told the SMH the contract had already expired in April and they were negotiating a new version. \u201cThe draft specifies that the agreement does not limit UQ\u2019s autonomy in any way,\u201d she said. The union representing the university\u2019s teachers, the National Tertiary Education Union, says it is all external influence \u2013 not just foreign, and not just China \u2013 that is the issue. \u201cWhat is critical is that this is not used as a China-bashing exercise,\u201d says Michael McNally, the NTEU Queensland division secretary. \u201cThe [second] rally at UQ, which was very poorly attended, questioning the Confucius Institutes and Chinese influence in Australian universities, seems to focus on one aspect of influence in Australian universities, ignoring all the other corporate or international interests.\u201d Just two months ago, UQ students turned out in huge numbers to protest the Ramsay Centre \u2013 a much-criticised degree program that would teach the achievements of \u201cwestern civilisation\u201d. The Australian National University had previously rejected the degree over concerns it would override and influence teaching, and academics at the University of Sydney said it would turn the university into an \u201cintellectual backwater\u201d. The issue at UQ, says McNally, goes bigger than China. \u201cUnfortunately, UQ doesn\u2019t have a good track record in mitigating the impacts of external influence. Compared to what the Ramsay Centre is trying to do, I think the Confucius Institute is pretty tame by comparison. I think the focus should be on a code of conduct for all Australian universities that limits the extent of all external influence.\u201d The day of the second rally proved McNally\u2019s concerns valid. Organisers formally disinvited a speaker at the last minute after criticism the event was veering into anti-Chinese racism. Andrew Cooper, the Australian organiser of CPAC, the conservative conference featuring Nigel Farage and former editor-in-chief of Breitbart Raheem Kassam, had been slated to speak. On the ground, the attendants circulated, from Tibetan and Uighur Australians, Falun Gong members, Socialist Alliance activists and young Liberals. One man held up a sign about Xi Jinping that said he had \u201cpooped his big boy pants\u201d. And for many, the issue is not just the Confucius Centre, or the university or their education. It\u2019s the actions of the Chinese counter-protestors and, by extension, the state itself. H\u00f8j tells Guardian Australia that he wants his campus to be a place where all students can protest and share their views, without violence or racism. \u201cBy their nature, universities bring people with differing views together to exchange ideas and learn from one another\u201d. \u201cUQ, like other Australian universities, encourages the respectful and lawful expression of views, and makes every effort to provide a safe environment for mature debate. \u201cWe do not tolerate hate speech, racism, violence and intimidation, and it would be disappointing if the unacceptable actions of a few detracted from the open and inclusive nature of our university communities.\u201d On Friday, H\u00f8j has just returned from Papua New Guinea, in a neat coincidence that highlights again how everything is not just China. Former international UQ students include the PNG finance minister. \u201cIn a climate of declining federal funding as a share of total university funding, international students subsidise our universities, especially our research programs,\u201d he says. \u201cThey also deepen our regional and international links, broaden the horizons of domestic students, and strengthen Australia\u2019s own \u2018soft power.\u2019\u201d \u2018Basic human rights\u2019 Guardian Australia spoke to Chinese students among the 9,000 studying at the university and including those who were involved in courses run by the Confucius Institute, who did not want to be named. One student said he did not believe those involved in the pro-China counterprotest last week were students. \u201cNo, I have not seen them,\u201d the engineering student said. \u201cThey\u2019ve come from somewhere, I don\u2019t know. I do not protest, I am here to study.\u201d Many said they believed protesters had misunderstood the nature of programs at the Confucius Institute. \u201cIt helps us to have a focus on Chinese culture here. It makes us settle quickly,\u201d one woman said. Jason, an Australian IT student, said he participated in a Confucius Institute program during high school and was advised by his teacher \u201cdon\u2019t talk about\u201d subjects that might be sensitive to China. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a subtle censorship, where basically they\u2019re making us self-censor,\u201d Jason said. \u201cThey don\u2019t tell us to censor, we do it ourselves. We are accepting that.\u201d His friend, Sam, a dual Australian-Hong Kong national who wore a mask, said the university needed to be transparent about its relationship to the institute, including how it was funded. \u201cYou have to understand, that American and Canadian universities banned the Confucius Institute for a reason,\u201d Sam said. \u201cIn light of the events that happened last week, how pro-democracy and peaceful protesters who support Hong Kong were attacked by pro-Chinese nationalists, we feel this trampling of our basic rights, our basic Australian rights, basic human rights of freedom of speech have been encroached on by this foreign institute that has been receiving money form the Chinese Communist Party. This is the sort of foreign interference that we cannot tolerate in Australia.\u201d Davis said he felt the university had attempted to silence further protests, telling organisers to move to a quiet part of the campus and threatening that students would be held liable for any unruly behaviour. But that seemed only to compound anger towards the university; a further attempt to mask dissent, at a time when many of its Kong Hong foreign students have been emboldened to participate, but remain too scared to show their faces. Standing on four milk crates, wearing a black mask and a black cap, the student from Hong Kong speaks about the recent experiences of people there, who she says have met with consequences after they shared experiences from the protests on social media. \u201cIt is no longer a political issue about extradition. It\u2019s a moral issue now. However, I\u2019m not truly able to say any of this. Between you and I, this can just be a dream, or a story. \u201cAnd why am I so emotional? Because Hong Kong is my home.\u201d",

The department has limited levers to address these risks. We are heavily dependent on the actions of major suppliers and other government departments to ensure continued provision.\u201d</p> <p>Listing the actions the department would take in the event of food shortages affecting schools, the document says: \u201cIn light of any food shortages or price increases we will communicate how schools can interpret the food menu standards flexibly. DfE may make exceptional payments \u2013 or submit a prepared bid to HM Treasury for additional funding.

It appears to have been written very recently as it refers to \u201cshort lead in time due to new PM\u201d .</p> <p>The leak was seized on last night by the Labour party.

      "bodyText": "Schools may have to close, exams could be disrupted and fresh food for pupils\u2019 meals could run short because of panic buying with prices soaring by up to 20%, according to a secret Department for Education analysis of the risks of a no-deal Brexit obtained by the Observer. The five-page document \u2013 marked \u201cOfficial Sensitive\u201d and with the instruction \u201cDo Not Circulate\u201d \u2013 also raises the possibility of teacher absences caused by travel disruption, citing schools in Kent as particularly at risk. On the dangers of food shortages to schools, it suggests that informing the public of the risks could make matters even worse. In a section entitled School Food, it talks of the \u201crisk that communications in this area could spark undue alarm or panic food buying among the general public\u201d. And it adds: \u201cWarehousing and stockpiling capacity will be more limited in the pre-Xmas period. The department has limited levers to address these risks. We are heavily dependent on the actions of major suppliers and other government departments to ensure continued provision.\u201d Listing the actions the department would take in the event of food shortages affecting schools, the document says: \u201cIn light of any food shortages or price increases we will communicate how schools can interpret the food menu standards flexibly. DfE may make exceptional payments \u2013 or submit a prepared bid to HM Treasury for additional funding. Worst case scenario estimate of the increased costs \u2013 \u00a340 to \u00a385m a year for schools in relation to free school meal provision based on price increases of 10-20%.\u201d Under a heading School Travel, the analysis makes clear that the potential problems are \u201cnot countrywide\u201d, and cites Dover in Kent as at the highest risk of disruption, stating: \u201cRisk of travel disruption could result in school and early years settings closures, pupil and staff absence and exam disruption (though to a lesser extent in Oct due to limited exams being sat).\u201d Entitled \u201cDfE No Deal Programme \u2013 Schools\u201d, the document was drawn up by Lord Agnew, reappointed by Boris Johnson as parliamentary under-secretary for schools last week. It appears to have been written very recently as it refers to \u201cshort lead in time due to new PM\u201d . The leak was seized on last night by the Labour party. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner called on Johnson to rule out a no-deal Brexit, which she said would pile more misery on a school system that had already suffered from years of Tory austerity cuts. \u201cThis document lays bare the potential consequences of a disastrous no-deal Brexit for our schools and nurseries, and the parents and children who rely on them. By the government\u2019s own admission, head teachers may be left unable to feed their pupils or forced to close their doors entirely. \u201cWith our education system already at breaking point after years of Tory budget cuts, being forced to prepare for this kind of chaos is the last thing that schools and nurseries need. Boris Johnson must abandon his irresponsible and expensive obsession with no deal,\u201d she said. The analysis ranks the level of risks under a colour-coded system: green (where the department is confident the risks can be dealt with and delivery of services maintained as normal); amber (where delivery is \u201cfeasible but significant issues already exist requiring management attention\u201d); and red (where delivery of normal services \u201cappears to be undeliverable\u201d). The issues relating to school food and travel disruption that could lead to school closures and exam disruption are given amber warnings. The document mentions a risk of shortages of medical supplies and equipment, particularly to special educational needs schools, but classifies the risk as green. With Johnson insisting he will take the UK out of the EU \u201cdeal or no deal\u201d on 31 October, the government announced plans last week to set aside an extra \u00a32.1bn for no-deal preparations, including stockpiling of medicines, an extra 500 border officials and a public awareness campaign about possible disruption to travel and services. The prime minister is ramping up preparations for a no-deal Brexit, although he insists he still wants to leave the EU with a new agreement. A DfE spokesperson said: \u201cWhile we don\u2019t comment on leaked documents, our \u2026 guidance to schools and other stakeholders already provides advice on EU exit preparations for schools, including food provision, medical supplies and guidance for EU nationals. We are confident provision for schools will be protected in the event of the UK having to leave the EU without an agreement and there are robust contingency plans in place to ensure schools are prepared in all eventualities.\u201d Ian Watts, area education officer at Kent county council, said: \u201cWe have a duty to families to ensure schools do all they can to ensure provision, even in times of emergency.\u201d Other government documents obtained by Sky News last week warned of \u201cconsumer panic\u201d and gaps in security within weeks of leaving the EU without a deal.",

Johnson\u2019s Commons majority was cut to one last Thursday when the Lib Dems ousted the sitting Tory MP, Chris Davies, in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection. The Lib Dems were helped over the line by the Greens and Plaid Cymru, who did not put up candidates so as not to split the Remain vote. While similar Remain alliances are likely to be formed in some areas at a general election, neither Labour nor the SNP is prepared to stand down candidates, meaning such agreements will be limited in number, and decided informally according to local circumstances.",

Asked if Pogba will feature on the opening day, Solskj\u00e6r replied: \u201cHe should be OK. I hope so, anyway.\u201d Harry Maguire could also feature for United next weekend, with the Leicester defender\u2019s \u00a385m move edging closer. Solskj\u00e6r said \u201cthe last little details\u201d of the transfer are being completed after the England defender underwent a medical at Carrington, United\u2019s training ground, on Saturday morning.

Daniel Maldini, the 17-year-old son of the former Italy and Milan defender Paolo, missed the only penalty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7dea9a43466de129ab482031b298d0922b302b48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7dea9a43466de129ab482031b298d0922b302b48/0_148_3666_2200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel James scores from the spot to earn a shooutout victory over Milan in Cardiff.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel James scores from the spot to earn a shooutout victory over Milan in Cardiff.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The United teenager Mason Greenwood scored for United from 12 yards and James, the former Swansea winger, scored the winning spot-kick after Jesse Lingard equalised in normal time following a fine Marcus Rashford opener. Of James, Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cDan is ready to go, he\u2019s had a great pre-season. He\u2019s fitted straight into the group, both as a player and a personality.\u201d</p> <p>It was a carnival atmosphere in Cardiff whereby Fred the Red posed for photos and Zombie Nation\u2019s thumping Kernkraft 400 greeted all four goals but the match itself will have also whet supporters\u2019 appetite, with summer signings Aaron Wan-Bissaka and James both on show.</p> <p>Wan-Bissaka, a \u00a345m arrival from Crystal Palace, impressed at right-back and a trademark sliding challenge on Ricardo Rodriguez garnered a hearty ovation from fans.</p> <p>James was given an inevitably warm reception when Solskj\u00e6r opted to make five second-half changes, with Axel Tuanzebe also among those introduced.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been a very good five weeks and now we have another week to prepare,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r added. \u201cI think we have shown our intentions and hopefully we can carry that on to the league when the points are handed out. These five weeks have given the boys good confidence. I think it was a great experience for the kids coming on at the end, taking a penalty helped them. Some parts of the game we were not happy with and we will have to eradicate when it comes to the league but we are ready for next weekend.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is convinced Paul Pogba wants to stay at Manchester United and is hopeful the midfielder will feature in their Premier League opener against Chelsea at Old Trafford next Sunday, providing the Frenchman returns to training problem-free. Solskj\u00e6r also confirmed he spoke to Romelu Lukaku about his conduct after the striker divulged confidential details of a training sprint session on social media. The striker has since removed a tweet he posted on Friday, of which Solskj\u00e6r took a dim view, but the United manager now considers the \u201ccase closed\u201d. Pogba and Lukaku, both of whom have been heavily linked with moves away from the club, were absent as United rounded off pre-season in style in Cardiff, beating Milan on 5-4 penalties to maintain their 100% record this summer. Pogba said \u201cit could be a good time for a new challenge\u201d in June, while Lukaku is keen on a move to Serie A, with Juventus and Internazionale interested. Solskj\u00e6r said he had \u201cno doubts at all\u201d over Pogba\u2019s commitment to the club and clarified that the midfielder felt discomfort in his back but is not injured and could return to training on Monday. Asked if Pogba will feature on the opening day, Solskj\u00e6r replied: \u201cHe should be OK. I hope so, anyway.\u201d Harry Maguire could also feature for United next weekend, with the Leicester defender\u2019s \u00a385m move edging closer. Solskj\u00e6r said \u201cthe last little details\u201d of the transfer are being completed after the England defender underwent a medical at Carrington, United\u2019s training ground, on Saturday morning. Solskj\u00e6r also confirmed Ashley Young will replace the departed Antonio Valencia as club captain this season. David de Gea wore the armband here but Solskj\u00e6r said Young will lead the team when he begins matches. \u201cDavid is obviously in contention,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cAsh when he is on the pitch will carry the armband. When Ash starts, he will be the captain.\u201d United capped preparations for the new campaign by maintaining their 100% pre-season record this summer with Daniel James, the Wales winger, scoring the winning penalty in a 5-4 shootout victory over Milan before a crowd of more than 65,000 in the Welsh capital. Daniel Maldini, the 17-year-old son of the former Italy and Milan defender Paolo, missed the only penalty. The United teenager Mason Greenwood scored for United from 12 yards and James, the former Swansea winger, scored the winning spot-kick after Jesse Lingard equalised in normal time following a fine Marcus Rashford opener. Of James, Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cDan is ready to go, he\u2019s had a great pre-season. He\u2019s fitted straight into the group, both as a player and a personality.\u201d It was a carnival atmosphere in Cardiff whereby Fred the Red posed for photos and Zombie Nation\u2019s thumping Kernkraft 400 greeted all four goals but the match itself will have also whet supporters\u2019 appetite, with summer signings Aaron Wan-Bissaka and James both on show. Wan-Bissaka, a \u00a345m arrival from Crystal Palace, impressed at right-back and a trademark sliding challenge on Ricardo Rodriguez garnered a hearty ovation from fans. James was given an inevitably warm reception when Solskj\u00e6r opted to make five second-half changes, with Axel Tuanzebe also among those introduced. \u201cIt has been a very good five weeks and now we have another week to prepare,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r added. \u201cI think we have shown our intentions and hopefully we can carry that on to the league when the points are handed out. These five weeks have given the boys good confidence. I think it was a great experience for the kids coming on at the end, taking a penalty helped them. Some parts of the game we were not happy with and we will have to eradicate when it comes to the league but we are ready for next weekend.\u201d",

Paine has done a fine job in reshaping that since this team met disaster, and when his tenure ends it will be time to look to the future, not recreate the past. Smith can leave other people to keep those things in line. He can carry on being Smith. He can lead with the bat, lead on the field, and in doing so keep working to make up for what he called a failure of his leadership in South Africa last year. It has been less than one match back, and that\u2019s already exactly what he\u2019s doing. No more, no less.",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for joining me. Especially to any Baggies fans in Spain. I am off. Bye. The report is coming. Bilic says his side showed character after an indifferent start. He then goes off a number of tangents which I can\u2019t really follow. Bilic adds that he had told Edwards to go make a difference in the box, which he certainly did. West Brom should probably invest in a new striker as Zohore was the big disappointment to day. They don\u2019t even have much of a second choice, which is an even bigger worry. Ferguson describes the experience of his debut as \u201csurreal\u201d. He seems like a nice chap as he thanks the fans. The goals might have come from two goalkeeping mistakes but West Brom were worthy victors at the City Ground. Forest were pretty pitiful in the final third, justifying the fact they came away with nothing. 90+2 mins: A deep cross finds Grabban at the back post but it basically hits him on the head and slowly bounces into the arms of Johnstone. 90 mins: Five minutes added on. Can Forest pull something out of the bag? 89 mins: Brennan Johnson, sorry of ex-Forest striker David, comes on for his debut. Lovely stuff. 87 mins: Adomah smashes a cross into the box which finds it way to Dawson who turns on it and hits a low, goal-bound shot but it\u2019s blocked before it can cause any damage. 85 mins: Edwards is the one who is withdrawn in the end, meaning captain Livermore will have to see out the game with his crampy legs. He sprays a 30-yard pass out to the left and then hobbles after it. Down the other end, Mir whacks a shot which is deflected wide for a corner. 83 mins: Two West Brom players are treated for cramp. Livermore wanders off but Edwards is also off at the same time with a calf issue. At one point West Brom have just nine men on the pitch. 81 mins: Forest have been pretty woeful in the final third, summed up by Cash bursting onto a throw-in and then jabbing the ball straight out of play when trying to find a through pass. 79 mins: Dawson looks like he\u2019s pulling his hair out while trying to set Forest up to defend a corner. It looks as the ball is headed clear. 77 mins: A lovely run from Semedo sees him ride a couple of challenges, before cutting in and whacking a shot from 20 yards just over the bar. 75 mins: Adomah chips a cross which Grabban can\u2019t get on the end of and Ferguson just about forces it behind under pressure from Ameobi. Cash takes a couple of corners in quick succession but West Brom clear the danger. 73 mins: West Brom have plenty of pressure in the final third but nothing comes of it. 71 mins: Gibbs goes off with an injury and is replaced by Conor Townsend. 69 mins: Forest are yet to have a shot in the this half, which means it\u2019s time for Sammy Ameobi!!! 67 mins: Dawson whacks a 40-yard pass out to Adomah on the left and his dangerous cross causes problems but it\u2019s turned behind for a corner which is eventually cleared. 65 mins: Adomah pings a cross from the left into the box but it is easily header clear by Bartley. Forest really lacking any form of ingenuity. 63 mins: Leading shithouse Silva is taken off and Mir is brought on. Forest will have to change things here seeing as Mir is a striker. Forest are almost punished when Phillips players a low corner into the box for Sawyers to run onto but his shot is deflected over. Ex-Forest man Burke replaces Zohore, looking pretty muscly in the green and yellow. 61 mins: Silva once again gets away with a foul. He cleans out a West Brom player pretty late for a free-kick but the referee is not interested. Silva seems like he is a proper shithouse. Edwards almost gets his second by getting in down the left and whack one towards goal but Muric gets things right and blocks the shot. It\u2019s a shame he then and comes to flap at the corner. 59 mins: Grabban has so far had just one touch in the West Brom area, a sign of how badly Forest are doing in the final third. 57 mins: West Brom are still chucking bodies forward, which makes Edwards smashing a cross over the top of them even more infuriating for them. 55 mins: A relatively quiet start to the half. Forest are trying to force the issue but are yet to really achieve anything on that front. 53 mins: While I watch Jack Robinson smash a clearance into the stand my brother is at Old Trafford closely monitoring Neil Fairbrother eating a pie. Will keep you updated. 51 mins: Phillips makes a dart into the box, finding some space on the right but his shot from an acute angle flies well over the bar. 49 mins: Lolley swings in a corner from the left but West Brom head clear and break through Krovinovic who once again can\u2019t find the right pass at the crucial moment. 47 mins: A few long balls have been lumped down the field but not much else. Here we go again! The first error ... Maybe Lamouchi will just bring off Muric at half-time ... JR rightly points out: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who West Brom has up front. If the opposing goalkeeper every week plays like Muric the Baggies are going undefeated!\u201d You\u2019d hope other goalkeepers won\u2019t make as many mistakes. Get your Football League fix with John Brewin\u2019s roundup: An incredible swing in the the first-half from Forest dominating to looking meek, not to mention Muric looking like a Sunday league goalkeeper. 45 mins: Chants of \u201cSlaven Bilic\u201d are going around the away end. Two minutes added on. 44 mins: No more dropballs! In my day we use to scrap for the ball with the opponent until we were covered in blood and mud. 42 mins: West Brom calmly pass the ball inside the box from a goal-kick like it\u2019s the most normal thing in the world. Edwards gets some treatment after a heavy fall to the ground when attempting to jump for a header. 40 mins: Krovinovic misses the chase to slip either Phillips or Zohore through on goal, much to the West Brom pair\u2019s annoyance. 38 mins: The home fans are not very pleased about the fact Livermore is holding onto Semedo\u2019s shirt just inside the box for 10 seconds or so. The referee watches the whole incident but does nothing to appease those in red. 36 mins: Forest have been pretty awful since they opened the scoring. Can they can their early rhythm back? Grabban is yet to do much, so maybe Mir could be worth a go. 34 mins: Adomah tries to take on the rookie Ferguson but the debutant shows he is up to the task, perfectly timing a sliding challenge to dispossess the winger. He then shows a bit of naivety by taking a poor touch into the area, resulting in him bundling Adomah over but the referee is not interested. 32 mins: Due to the awfulness of Muric\u2019s debut, Phillips whacks an optimistic low drive from 30 yards but even the Forest stopper can\u2019t make a shot going 20 yards wide end up in the back of the net. 30 mins: Lolley cuts in from the left and then smashes a shot roughly 20 yards high and wide. Lamouchi applauds the effort but not the execution. 28 mins: Maybe Forest should have asked to take Claudio Bravo or Eike Immel on loan - it might have worked out better. Muric will not be watching this hame back in a hurry. Phillips whacks a hopeful cross into the box from the right flank but it ends up looping over the goalkeeper and into the top corner. Muric seemed to pull out of trying to save it, too, which makes it look worse. What an awful debut. 24 mins: Silva whips in a free-kick from the right, forcing Ferguson to head the ball behind his own goal to avert any further danger. 22 mins: A very late challenge from Sawyer takes down Dawson are a loose pass in the middle of the park. The referee plays on but only has a quick word with the Baggies midfielder. 20 mins: Edwards forces his way through down the left but his cross only makes it to the front post and is cleared. Down the other end Adomah chips a ball across the box where he almost finds Grabban but Bartley flicks it clear. 18 mins: Forest taking the sting out of the game by passing the ball around the back. This game cannot stay at the same tempo, to be fair. 16 mins: Edwards looks lively and can use both feet, which might worry makeshift right-back Cash. He certainly does not lack confidence. Another goalkeeping mistake ensures the scores are level. Edwards shows some trickier in the box to get sufficient space to fire a shot across Muric with his left foot. It\u2019s close to the goalkeeper but goes through his hands and into the bottom corner. 14 mins: Sawyers tries to make something happen for West Brom on the edge of the Forest area but all he succeeds in doing is chip the ball into Muric\u2019s hands. 12 mins: West Brom have offered almost nothing in the game so far. Forest are playing at a high tempo, while the visitors are just finding their feet. 10 mins: Lamouchi enjoyed the goal on the sidelines. His job is now to keep the Forest players calm while the City Ground bounces. He might be playing right-back but Cash gets forward to exchange passes with Adomah, before letting the ball to bounce perfectly, allowing him to drive a low shot into the corner. Johnstone will be disappointed not to stop it, though. 6 mins: Bartley takes a needless risk at the back by turning on the edge of his area but rather than being dispossessed a Forest forward fouls him instead. 4 mins: Lolley seems to be of the impression that Phillips has elbowed him in the face, so stays on the ground for far too long after coming together on the touchline. It\u2019s been a pretty lively start overall, though. 2 mins: I\u2019ll be honest, I am not completely sold on this version of the yellow and green away kit from West Brom. It seems a bit horrible. Cash whips over a cross from the right, which lands at the feet of Robinson, following a pitiful overhead kick attempt from Adomah, whose fearsome shot is blocked by debutant Ferguson. Peep! Peep! Peep! Let\u2019s get ready to rumble! I am very pleased that West Brom go against the tide by being sponsored by Ideal Boilers rather than some random betting company. I do hope their legendary mascot is in attendance. Don Goodman has thrown out roughly 15 cliches in about 30 seconds of speech. Lovely stuff. I did the minute-by-minute for Luton v Middlesbrough last night, so if it\u2019s another six-goal thriller I might not survive the day. Bilic spends a minute bigging up the Championship and then explains his team are good at football, claiming \u201cwe couldn\u2019t be in better shape\u201d. JR emails in to ask: \u201cWhat do you make of the Throstles chances this season? Please feel free to say they\u2019ll be mid-table because it seems pretty much everyone who tries to predict the Championship is wrong. Last season I was assured that Stoke would coast to the title and Norwich were no great shakes. \u201cI\u2019m really liking the looks of this squad. A bunch of nice additions have almost entirely erased the Pulis era from my memory.\u201d Can I let you know at full-time? At the moment I don\u2019t think they have enough up top with Zohore leading the line to challenge the top two. But who knows? Lamouchi says: \u201cThe first game, the stadium will be full, so it will be fantastic. We must make them proud with our players and our team\u201d. I went to university in Nottingham but have no affinity for Forest as every time I went to watch them play they were bloody rubbish. Including in a goalless draw with Oldham, which involved no shots on target. I\u2019ll be honest, I know nothing about Filip Krovinovi\u0107, so watching him will be good fun. He\u2019s on loan from Benfica, meaning he should be able to pass it a bit. A couple of West Brom arrivals have made this list of the best Championship signings ... Manchester City\u2019s Aro Muric starts his first game for Forest after his loan move. He impressed in the League Cup last season but will be aiming to show what he can do over the course of an entire season. This the first game of the Lamouchi era. Daniel Taylor explains where it all went wrong for Martin O\u2019Neill ... Lots of debuts around but Nathan Ferguson seems the happiest ... Sabri Lamouchi is up for the challenge. Forest: Muric, Cash, Worrall, Dawson, Robinson, Semedo, Watson, Lolley, Silva, Adomah, Grabban Subs: Smith, Ribero, Figueiredo, Mir, Ameobi, Johnson, Richardson West Brom: Johnstone, Ferguson, Bartley, Ajayi, Gibbs, Livermore, Sawyers, Krovinovic, Phillips, Edwards, Zohore Subs: Bond, O\u2019Shea, Townsend, Furlong, Harper, Burke, Leko There is no doubting that football has returned to our bosom for us to hold and cherish. Like last night\u2019s frenetic 3-3 draw between Luton and Middlesbrough, this clash also involves two managers enjoying their first match in charge of their respective clubs. Sabri Lamouchi has turned up in an attempt to bring back the glory days to the City Ground but he has the tough challenge of utilising a squad of 3384 players in order to do so. Slaven Bilic, on the other hand, will bring his good guy persona to West Brom in order to get his traditional new manager bounce before the wheels come off. Let\u2019s see how wrong I am.",

      "bodyText": "Bernie Sanders has defended his rival for the Democratic presidential 2020 nomination, Elizabeth Warren, after her policy against pre-emptive use of America\u2019s nuclear weapons was attacked by the daughter of one of the architects of the Iraq war. Warren reiterated her support for a \u201cno first use\u201d policy on nuclear weapons during the second round of Democratic presidential debates this week. \u201cIt makes the world safer,\u201d the Massachusetts senator said during the debate. \u201cThe United States is not going to use nuclear weapons pre-emptively, and we need to say so to the entire world.\u201d Liz Cheney, a Republican congresswoman from Wyoming, attacked Warren\u2019s policy on Twitter, asking \u201cwhich American cities and how many American citizens are you willing to sacrifice with your policy of forcing the US to absorb a nuclear attack before we can strike back?\u201d Cheney is the daughter of former vice-president Dick Cheney, a key advocate of the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States and its allies. The Bush administration\u2019s primary justification for the pre-emptive war, that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and that his regime presented an escalating threat, was discredited after the invasion. The war in Iraq, now in its 16th year, has resulted in an estimated 200,000 documented civilian deaths from violence, according to Iraq Body Count, although estimates vary widely, particularly estimates that factor in hundreds of thousands of additional war-related civilian deaths. More than 4,000 members of the US military have been killed. \u201cTaking national security advice from a Cheney has already caused irreparable damage to our country,\u201d Sanders wrote on Friday, in response to Cheney\u2019s attack on Warren. The Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who was 13 years old when the Iraq war began in 2003, also responded to Cheney\u2019s attack on Warren, criticizing Cheney for offering hawkish foreign policy advice \u201cas if an entire generation hasn\u2019t lived through the Cheneys sending us into war since we were kids\u201d. Liz Cheney\u2019s response to the criticism of her father\u2019s push for pre-emptive war was to call Sanders a \u201ccommie\u201d with \u201cdaddy issues\u201d. Cheney\u2019s attack on Warren echoed the response of one of Warren\u2019s Democratic rivals during the debate, the Montana governor, Steve Bullock, who said he did not support a \u201cno first use policy\u201d because, \u201cI don\u2019t want to turn around and say, \u201cWell, Detroit has to be gone before we would ever use that.\u201d The Washington Post columnist Elizabeth Bruenig also argued \u201cyou can\u2019t have daddy issues with someone else\u2019s daddy.\u201d During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly expressed some reluctance to use nuclear weapons first, but also said he did not \u201cwant to rule out anything\u201d. At a debate in September of that year, Trump said, \u201cI would certainly not do first strike\u201d but in the sentence that followed that statement, he said: \u201cI can\u2019t take anything off the table.\u201d As Slate\u2019s Fred Kaplan noted, the Trump administration\u2019s 2018 Nuclear Posture Review maintained the Obama administration\u2019s language on first use policy \u2013 not ruling it out completely, but suggesting it would be only used in limited circumstances. \u201cIt remains the policy of the United States to retain some ambiguity regarding the precise circumstances that might lead to a U.S. nuclear response,\u201d the 2018 review notes.",

This year, the company is on track to have 3,000 participants go through its program at more than 50 gyms, which have licensed it in eight countries \u2013 and it is growing exponentially. In the past three financial years, says Langton, revenue has increased by 100% year-on-year. The business currently turns over more than $6m annually. Langton says that if Wimp2Warrior meets its target of 1,000 gyms within five years it will be looking at revenues in the hundreds of millions of dollars. </p> <p>Mixed martial arts, by its own estimation, is the fastest growing sport in the world.

Eventually he opened his own gym and, in an effort to bring in new clientele to the sport, offered to train a civilian for six months for free, under the condition they would have an MMA fight at the end.

      "bodyText": "Julia Schaefer\u2019s fight name is Bruiser. \u201cBecause I bruise easily,\u201d she qualifies. \u201cNot because I cause bruises.\u201d But that\u2019s probably not true. In early July, before a crowd of hundreds at Norths Leagues Club in Sydney, a cheerful chant of \u201cBruiser! Bruiser! Bruiser!\u201d rises as she enters the room. A camera trails Schaefer as she half-bounces, half-swaggers down an aisle, stopping to wave at her school-mum friends and blow a kiss to her husband. She is patted down (\u201cpresumably for knives \u2013 I don\u2019t know\u201d), her face smeared with Vaseline, and then the 40-year-old marketing consultant and mother of six-year-old twins walks up the stairs and into her first cage fight. \u201cI was like: \u2018Right. This is it,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThe whole first round I just felt like I was in a parallel universe almost. It\u2019s not me \u2013 to fight. That\u2019s so unlike who I am. But I was loving it so much. Whether she hit me or not, I have no idea. I couldn\u2019t feel it.\u201d Her opponent did hit her. Again, and over again. Schaefer had the better of her in the first round, got her opponent on her back \u2013 and while the woman then duly kicked Schaefer in the stomach until she was able to right herself, Schaefer felt nothing. Watching the video of the fight, Schaefer\u2019s heart is palpitating. But on the night, she says, she was fine. Schaefer has limited interest in mixed martial arts, or MMA. Even now, she doesn\u2019t like to watch UFC professional fights \u2013 there\u2019s too much blood. Her fight was the culmination of a 20-week program of waking at 4.30am, travelling to an inner Sydney gym, training for an hour and a half, then returning home in time for the morning alarm to make breakfast for her children. She was a participant in Wimp2Warrior, an Australian MMA fitness program trying to bring the sport to new, lucrative audiences around the world. For about $2,500 a course, Wimp2Warrior promises \u201cThe Ultimate Human Transformation\u201d which ends with participants fighting each other in the cage. The tagline used to be \u201cThe Ultimate Human Experiment\u201d but the founders say the hypothesis has been proved: anyone can be a cage fighter. The course was founded by MMA coach Richie Cranny and ex-private wealth and stockbroking firm manager Nick Langton. This year, the company is on track to have 3,000 participants go through its program at more than 50 gyms, which have licensed it in eight countries \u2013 and it is growing exponentially. In the past three financial years, says Langton, revenue has increased by 100% year-on-year. The business currently turns over more than $6m annually. Langton says that if Wimp2Warrior meets its target of 1,000 gyms within five years it will be looking at revenues in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Mixed martial arts, by its own estimation, is the fastest growing sport in the world. Over the past two decades its image has evolved from one of \u201chuman cockfighting\u201d to a multibillion dollar professional sport, with global superstar coaches and fighters and a concerted push for inclusion in the Olympic Games. When Cranny emigrated to Australia in 2003 from the UK, he spent years trying to establish amateur or recreational MMA programs in existing gyms, with no success. Eventually he opened his own gym and, in an effort to bring in new clientele to the sport, offered to train a civilian for six months for free, under the condition they would have an MMA fight at the end. Four hundred people applied. He took 25, and documented their progress online. After a few seasons in his own gym, he licensed the program to gyms in Melbourne, London and Brisbane. It started spreading more rapidly after Irish supercoach John Kavanagh brought the program into his gym and became a partner. \u201cThe vision behind it was to try to get regular people into the sport \u2013 people you wouldn\u2019t expect,\u201d says Cranny. \u201cMMA naturally attracts a cohort of guys in their 20s that think it\u2019s cool, but I\u2019ve been in this sport for a long time and I can see what it can do for everyday people. The frustration was, it was almost impossible to get these people through the door.\u201d Wimp2Warrior presents itself as a \u201cfamily\u201d, a friendly consumer face for entry into MMA. In Australia the average age for male participants is 30 and female 31. The team say they have had people in their 60s complete the course, and they are focused on increasing female participation.

      "bodyText": "Big miner BHP is again reviewing its membership of the Minerals Council of Australia lobby group following disagreements over environmental policy. Last month, BHP chief executive Andrew Mackenzie described global heating as indisputable and called for drastic action in response, including but not limited to carbon pricing. The Minerals Council moderated some of its policies after BHP announced a 12-month review of its membership in December 2017 but the Guardian understands that, despite the changes, and the resignation of its then CEO, Brendan Pearson, senior BHP executives believe the council needs to do more. BHP pulled out of the World Coal Association last year but decided to remain a Minerals Council member after objecting to its advocacy on energy policy, including calling for government support for new coal-fired power plants in Australia. The council is trying to hold its members together amid divisions over climate and energy policy. Its members include multinationals BHP and Rio Tinto, which provide the lion\u2019s share of its funding, and smaller specialist miners less concerned about attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Rio also put pressure on the council last year over its anti-climate policy advocacy but it is understood the company is no longer considering pulling out. BHP\u2019s climate pledge, announced by Mackenzie in a speech in London a fortnight ago, includes a promise to spend US$400m (about $590m) to develop technologies to reduce emissions from its own operations and the \u201cscope 3\u201d emissions that result downstream from the companies that buy its resources. It says it will limit its 2022 pollution at 2017 levels and have net-zero emissions by 2050. Mackenzie said the company would strengthen the link between emissions performance and executive pay from 2021. The Minerals Council chair, former Liberal government minister Helen Coonan, told the Guardian she did not know if BHP was reviewing its membership of the body. \u201cThe vice-chair of the MCA is Mike Henry from BHP. We\u2019ve had many conversations about challenges right across the spectrum in the sector but I\u2019ve not had any conversations of the kind that you allude to,\u201d she said. She said there had been tensions with the company in the past over issues including the use of money from another industry body, Coal21 \u2013 which shares some directors with the council \u2013 on advertisements extolling the virtues of coal. \u201cBut I have a very clear understanding that some of those tensions, if not all of them, have been resolved, at least for the time being, and none of them have been raised with me,\u201d Coonan said. The former MP called on the industry to stick with the council and not splinter into separate lobby groups. \u201cA united voice is a much more effective way to deal with government, to deal with regulators, to deal with interest groups, than if you had a fragmented voice.\u201d The council\u2019s emphasis has shifted under Pearson\u2019s replacement, Tania Constable, to saying that coal has a strong future as part of a \u201ctechnology neutral\u201d approach. Pearson is now an adviser to the prime minister, Scott Morrison. Constable welcomed Mackenzie\u2019s speech, saying it was in line with the Minerals Council\u2019s support of the Paris climate agreement. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, limiting global heating to 1.5C, a goal referenced in the Paris agreement, would require coal use for energy to fall 59-78% below 2010 levels by 2030. Coonan said the council believed there was a place for \u201ccompeting technologies\u201d, listing renewables with storage, coal, gas, carbon capture and storage and \u201cpossibly even nuclear energy\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t see that we\u2019re completely out of step with BHP and we don\u2019t see that we\u2019re out of step with the coal interests either, because of our technology neutral approach,\u201d she said. Climate groups said there was a clear divide between BHP\u2019s goals and the Minerals Council\u2019s public advocacy. The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, a shareholder activist group, said the council had recently called for investment in new coal-fired power plants, and had run more than 40 pro-coal advertisements on Facebook and campaigned for the approval of the Adani Carmichael mine. Dan Gocher, the centre\u2019s director of climate and environment, said these steps were \u201ccompletely inconsistent\u201d with BHP\u2019s position. Matt Rose, an economist with the Australian Conservation Foundation, said the council was taking a destructive approach on public policy and called on BHP to withdraw its membership. \u201cBHP cannot keep walking both sides of the street, talking up climate action on one hand and funding the minerals council to trash it on the other,\u201d he said. The director of policy with the Investor Group on Climate Change, Erwin Jackson, declined to comment on the BHP case, but said institutional investors were increasingly interested in whether industry associations were supporting or undermining climate action. He said critics had tried to dismiss concerns from institutional investors as the work of a few activists. In reality, he said, hundreds of investors controlling trillions of dollars were working with companies to minimise risks associated with climate change. \u201cTo try to portray investors as activists demonstrates a failure to understand that climate change is a core financial risk for investors and a systemic risk to the financial system and the economy,\u201d he said.",

Shibuno\u2019s 67 gives the 20-year old from Japan a two-shot lead going into the final round. Buhai, five clear at one point, trails her partner after a 72. What a turnaround.

A couple of soft bounces, and it comes to rest three feet past the cup.

The 20-year-old from Japan is the new leader of the British Open! She\u2019s been smiling and laughing with the crowd, stopping to pat a small lad on the head, pose for a selfie and give him a signed glove. She is, to borrow a famous compatriot\u2019s phrase, sparking joy. Buhai looks as though the weight of the world is resting on her shoulders. She must be wondering how she\u2019s let her lead slip.

The ball nearly topples into the bunker, but sticks near the lip. She\u2019d have liked to have seen that fall in.

      "bodyText": "Hinako Shibuno is sparking joy all right! In goes the putt, and that\u2019s her sixth birdie on the back nine. She came back in 30! By contrast Ashleigh Buhai - who got up and down from the fringe for par - stumbled home in 38. Shibuno\u2019s 67 gives the 20-year old from Japan a two-shot lead going into the final round. Buhai, five clear at one point, trails her partner after a 72. What a turnaround. What a performance by the Smiling Cinderella. What a final day lies in store for us! Make sure to join us tomorrow at midday. Thanks so much for reading. -14: Shibuno -12: Buhai -11: SH Park -10: Pressel, JY Ko, Salas -9: Ciganda, Hull, Law Ashleigh Buhai and Hinako Shibuno both crash big drives down the 18th. Buhai\u2019s a fair distance behind her partner, though, and requires a fairway wood to reach the green. It\u2019s a fine shot, pin high, just on the fringe to the right. But she\u2019s upstaged by Shibuno, who cracks a 6-iron straight at the flag from 160 yards. A couple of soft bounces, and it comes to rest three feet past the cup. Whatever happens from here on in - whether she misses this putt, falls away tomorrow, or ends up winning the British Open on her first competitive outing outside Japan - a major new talent has announced itself to the world this week. Bronte Law could hardly make a putt today. Another birdie effort stops one turn short on 18. But that\u2019s a 70. She goes into the final round at -9 ... and she\u2019s yet to make a bogey this week! That is a quite astonishing run. Lizette Salas pars too, and she\u2019ll be delighted with her 70 after going out in 37. She\u2019s -10. Hinako Shibuno and Ashleigh Buhai send a couple of lovely tee shots into 17. Both leave themselves eight footers for birdie. But the momentum\u2019s only with one of these players. Buhai\u2019s effort slides by, but Shibuno\u2019s finds the middle of the cup. The 20-year-old from Japan is the new leader of the British Open! She\u2019s been smiling and laughing with the crowd, stopping to pat a small lad on the head, pose for a selfie and give him a signed glove. She is, to borrow a famous compatriot\u2019s phrase, sparking joy. Buhai looks as though the weight of the world is resting on her shoulders. She must be wondering how she\u2019s let her lead slip. She was going along so steadily on the front nine. She must feel shaken to the core. -13: Shibuno (17) -12: Buhai (17) -11: SH Park (F) Birdie for Lizette Salas on 17! A fine tee shot drawn in to 12 feet, and a left-to-right curler carefully teased into the cup. She moves to -10, and has fought her way right back into contention since the turn. A brilliant performance. Up on 18, Park Sung-hyun pars for a blemish-free 68. She\u2019s perfectly poised at -11. Yep! In it goes! And she punches the air, knowing that she\u2019s rescued her British Open hopes with a stunning back nine of 32. Out in 38, that adds up to a very topsy-turvy round of 70. She\u2019s -9. A wonderful fightback. And she\u2019s only three off the lead now. Because after going 36 holes without dropping a shot, Ashleigh Buhai has now shipped three bogeys in five holes. She leaves her chip from the side of 16 well short, then leaves a 15-foot par effort high on the right. Her partner Hinako Shibuno pars, and that five-shot lead is gone, gone, gone. -12: Shibuno (16), Buhai (16) -11: SH Park (17) -10: Pressel (F), JY Ko (F) -9: Ciganda (F), Hull (F), Law (17), Salas (16) A wee spot of bother for Charley Hull at 18, as she drives into the bunker to the left of the fairway. She lashes a fine second towards the back of the green, just off. But her putt from the fringe stops six feet short. This is a huge par putt coming up. After her sensational back-nine surge, will she lose a little momentum at the very end? Ariya Jutanugarn\u2019s hopes of winning a second British Open at Woburn look remote now, after a round that unfurled with bogeys at 13, 16 and 18. She ended up with a 72, slipping from a high of -9 to -6. Ashleigh Buhai is also threatening to unravel. Her five-stroke lead having been whittled down to one, she carves an iron from the centre of the fairway at 16 into thick rough to the right of the green. The ball nearly topples into the bunker, but sticks near the lip. She\u2019d have liked to have seen that fall in. She made a huge up and down at 14; what she\u2019d pay in cash money for another one here. Neither Buhai nor Shibuno reach the 15th green in two. But both fizz glorious wedges towards the pin. Buhai leaves herself a six-footer for birdie, Shibuno is perhaps six inches inside. Buhai prods in rather fidgety fashion at her effort, which squirts off to the right. Just a par. But Shibuno makes her birdie! Suddenly she\u2019s just one shot off the lead, and the Smiling Cinderella is having a ball. This is a fantastic leaderboard! -13: Buhai (15) -12: Shibuno (15) -11: SH Park (16) -10: Pressel (F), JY Ko (F) -9: Ciganda (F), Hull (17), Salas (15), Law (15) Park Sung-hyun bashes a 300-yard drive down 16. A wedge pin high, leaving a straight 18-footer across the green for a birdie that\u2019d take her to within one shot of Ashleigh Buhai. One more joule of energy, and she\u2019d make it. She remains -11. Up on 18, a 74 for Georgia Hall, and at -4 her grip on the title is all but loosened. Birdie putts for both Bronte Law and Lizette Salas on the par-five 15th. Neither can make theirs. They both remain at -9. Back down the fairway, the final pairing of Hinako Shibuno and Ashleigh Buhai wait for the green to clear after clattering big drives down the track. Ko Jin-young nearly curls in a 30-foot birdie putt from the back of 18. But that\u2019s par, and a 68 that springs her up the leaderboard to -10. Her bid to become only the fourth player to win three majors in a year, after Ben Hogan, Tiger Woods and Inbee Park, is still on. Meanwhile Ciganda takes two putts for a closing double bogey. A farcical end to an otherwise fine round of golf. A third 69 of the week, but it should have been so much better. Hinako Shibuno\u2019s recovery continues apace! Her tee shot at 14 was delicious, over the flag to 12 feet. And in goes the birdie putt! She\u2019s -11. She closes further on Ashleigh Buhai, who clips a delightful sand shot to three feet, and saves her par. That showed such moxie in the circumstances. A third consecutive birdie would have really meddled with her mind. But as things stand she\u2019s still got a two-shot lead at the top. She\u2019s -13, two clear of Carlota Ciganda, who won\u2019t be staying at -11 very much longer. But Park Sung-hyun will be there. She nearly drains a monster eagle putt, but a third birdie in four holes will do. She\u2019s -11. Ashleigh Buhai is rocking. She pulls her hybrid at the par-three 14th into a deep bunker on the left. She looks really flustered at the minute. What she\u2019d give for a ship-steadying sandy save. But she doesn\u2019t have a lot of green to play with. And she\u2019s not the only one in trouble. Second-placed Carlota Ciganda slices her tee shot at 18 into the bushes down the right. She should take an unplayable, but attempts to hack it out instead. She\u2019s got hardly any backswing, and can\u2019t punch her ball out. Now she takes an unplayable. So she\u2019s hitting four into the green. She finds the putting surface, but it\u2019ll be a long two putts for double bogey. Ashleigh Buhai was five shots clear of the field not so long ago. But now her lead is just two. She faces a slippery downhill chip from the side of 13, and sends a lovely soft-handed effort rolling slowly towards the hole. But the green is fast, and her ball ends eight feet past the cup. She pulls the one coming back uphill, and this championship is suddenly on. And there\u2019s a fourth birdie in five holes for Charley Hull, this time at 15. She looked way out of this, but one back-nine charge later, and she\u2019s only four off the lead! She\u2019s soon joined by Bronte Law, who finally makes a birdie putt, draining one across 14. They\u2019re both at -9. -13: Buhai (13) -11: Ciganda (16) -10: Pressel (F), JY Ko (17), SH Park (13), Shibuno (13) Ko\u2019s tee shot at 17 is straight at the flag. But 20 feet short. She very nearly makes the right-to-left curler for another birdie, but fails to give it enough juice. A tap-in for par. Ciganda misses a birdie putt from half the distance, failing to set it far enough out to the right. Meanwhile the US Open champion Jeongeun Lee6 signs for a blemish-free 69 featuring birdies at 2, 10 and 17. She\u2019s nicely placed at -8. The world number one Ko Jin-young nearly finds a bunker to the side of the 16th green. But her ball snags on the bank, and she pops a wedge up onto the green. The ball twangs off the flagstick and drops! Her first birdie on the back nine. She joins the group at -10. Par for her partner Carlota Ciganda. If Ashleigh Buhai stumbles on the way home - and she looks a little concerned as she misses to the right of 13 - this is wide open. -14: Buhai (12) -11: Ciganda (16) -10: Pressel (F), JY Ko (16), SH Park (13), Shibuno (12) Hinako Shibuno is back in business! Her mood lifted, she wedges to ten feet at 12, trots elegantly after the divot, replaces it with a smile, then makes the putt to move to -10. And suddenly she\u2019s only four off the top, because Ashleigh Buhai makes her first error since the 11th on Thursday. She trundles a 30-foot birdie putt six feet past, and shoves the one coming back. Only her second bogey of the week, and suddenly the lead is back to just three. No fourth birdie in a row for Hull, sadly, as she sends her curling putt too far out to the right. -14: Buhai (12) -11: Ciganda (15) -10: Pressel (F), SH Park (13), Shibuno (12) -9: JY Ko (15), Boutier (13), Salas (12) Park Sung-hyun took a while to get going. But suddenly she\u2019s made back-to-back birdies, firing an iron straight at the flag on 13 and rolling in the 20-foot right-to-left slider. She\u2019s suddenly -10. Celine Boutier birdies the hole too, and she\u2019s -9/ And this is beginning to cook up nicely, because Charley Hull has just lashed a majestic long iron towards the pin at the long par-three 14th. An eight feet putt for a fourth birdie in a row! Three birdies in a row for Charley Hull! The latest at 13. She\u2019s been bang on it since the turn. She\u2019s -8, alongside Bronte Law who misses yet another short-range birdie putt, this time at 12. Her game has been in fine nick today, but her putter\u2019s stone cold. One of those days. Morgan Pressel finishes her round with four birdies in the last five holes! She creams her second at 18 to four feet, and deservedly makes it three in a row. She\u2019s back in 32, and it\u2019s a round of 66! She allows herself a quiet, satisfied smile. The new clubhouse leader. Back-to-back birdies for Lizette Salas, incidentally, at 10 and 11, as she reinserts herself into the story. -15: Buhai (11) -11: Ciganda (14) -10: Pressel (F) -9: JY Ko (14), Masson (12), SH Park (12), Salas (11), Shibuno (11) Park Sung-hyun has been extremely quiet today. Just the one birdie up until now, at 4. But now the recently deposed world number one goes for the green at the short par-four 12th. She finds a bunker, but splashes out to five feet and makes her second birdie of the day. She\u2019s moved stealthily into the group at -9. Another birdie for Charley Hull! This one comes at 12, and she\u2019s -7 again. Back where she started, after those front-nine bogeys at 2 and 8. And there\u2019s more belated good news for English fans, as Bronte Law - who had missed a short birdie putt on 10 and stormed off absolutely fuming - finally makes one at the par-five 11th. She raises both arms in ironic celebration, and this time she walks off smiling and laughing. She\u2019s -8 and far from out of this ... providing Ashleigh Buhai gives some succour to the field. Which at the moment looks far from likely. Ashleigh Buhai just keeps on trucking! Her approach into 10 isn\u2019t particularly close, but her flat stick is red hot, and she guides in a right-to-left slider for another birdie. There\u2019s a much-needed birdie for her partner Hinako Shibuno, who hasn\u2019t cracked her trademark smile for some time. For a second, it looks as though she\u2019s not going to respond to this boost, ground down by her earlier misfires. But she can\u2019t help herself. A smile plays around the side of her mouth. The professional within tries to fight it, but eventually she gives in, letting it spread across her face. The gallery respond to her infectious joy. Welcome back, Smiling Cinderella, we\u2019ve missed you. -15: Buhai (10) -11: Ciganda (14) -9: Pressel (17), JY Ko (14), A Jutanugarn (12), Masson (12), Shibuno (10) You\u2019ll have noticed Morgan Pressel creeping onto the bottom of the leaderboard. Well, she hasn\u2019t stopped there! The Floridian made her name as the 18-year-old winner of the ANA Inspiration back in 2007, in those pre-Lydia-Ko days becoming the youngest-ever women\u2019s major champion. Now 31, she\u2019s looking to banish the ghosts of 2013, when she led this event at St Andrews after 54 holes, only to shoot a final round of 76. Out in 34 today, she\u2019s just birdied 14, 16 and now 17, the latest deserved reward for a lovely iron landed softly to the right of the pin at the par-three, her ball gathering round to 12 feet. She\u2019s right in the mix now! -14: Buhai (9) -10: Ciganda (13) -9: Pressel (17), JY Ko (13), A Jutanugarn (12), Masson (11) Jung Yan pars the last for her 67. She\u2019s the new clubhouse leader at -8. In the meantime, Charley Hull makes her first birdie of the day, raking in a long birdie putt across 12. She\u2019s back to -6, and the crowd give her an encouraging roar. But it\u2019s a poor three-putt bogey for Hinako Shibuno on 9. She turns in 37, head bowed, the effervescent figure of yesterday afternoon a distant memory right now. She slips to -8. A fairytale win for the Smiling Cinderella will soon become a pipe dream if she doesn\u2019t rediscover her mojo soon. The 20-year-old debutant looks extremely deflated. It\u2019s a real shame. -14: Buhai (9) -10: Ciganda (12) -9: JY Ko (12), A Jutanugarn (11), Masson (11) -8: Yang (F), Pressel (16), SH Park (10), Shibuno (9) Bounce-back birdie for Carlota Ciganda! She responds to that yip on 11 with two careful, easy irons down 12. In goes the 12-footer, and the lead at the top is cut to four. Par for her partner Ko Jin-young. Another birdie Jing Yan, meanwhile, at the par-three 17th. If she makes it up the last without dropping a shot, the 33-year-old from China will be signing for a 67. -14: Buhai (8) -10: Ciganda (12) -9: JY Ko (12), A Jutanugarn (11), Masson (10), Shibuno (8) -8: Yan (17), SH Park (10) A miserable and frustrating end to Anna Nordqvist\u2019s excellent round. She sends her second at 18 bounding towards the flag. It nearly clatters the stick, in which case she could be waltzing off the green with an outrageous eagle. But the ball misses and topples off the back. A hot putt from the fringe ends eight feet past the hole, and the par saver coming back lips out. That\u2019s still a marvellous 68, but every shot counts with Ashleigh Buhai romping away at the top, and she walks off looking as disappointed as you\u2019d imagine. She\u2019s the new clubhouse leader at -7. Ko Jin-young looks to have made a right-to-left 20-footer on 11 for birdie. The ball\u2019s heading for the hole, dead on line. But then gravity does a number on her, the ball somehow riding the wall of death, making a u-turn around the back of the cup, stubbornly refusing to drop, then sitting up on the lip. That\u2019s outrageous. So unlucky for the ANA and Evian champ. She remains at -9, now alongside Caroline Masson, who birdies 10 with a celebratory air punch, and Carlota Ciganda, who bogeys 11 after yipping a short par putt. Ashleigh Buhai now has a five-shot lead! It was nearly six, but she lets a 12-foot birdie putt on 8 tail off to the right. -14: Buhai (8) -9: JY Ko (11), Ciganda (11), A Jutanugarn (10), Shibuno (8) A beauty sent into the par-three 8th by Bronte Law. Her ball bounces up the green, resting pin high, 12 feet to the left of the flag. But her birdie effort is never going in, always heading right the second it leaves the face of the putter. Extreme frustration for Law, who shakes her head in bewilderment. That wasn\u2019t a confident stroke. She stays at -7, just off the pace. She\u2019s joined there by her partner Lizette Salas, who went long and left with her tee shot and couldn\u2019t get up and down. The Smiling Cinderella looks a little down on herself right now. The sensational approaches aren\u2019t going quite so close today. Shibuno\u2019s 15 feet from the flag at the par-five 7th, but the birdie putt doesn\u2019t drop. But her playing partner Ashleigh Buhai rolls in another fine putt from similar distance. Birdie. She looks so cool right now, so calm, it\u2019ll send a chill through the rest of the field. -14: Buhai (7) -10: Ciganda (10) -9: JY Ko (10), A Jutanugarn (10), Shibuno (7) -8: Nordqvist (17), Masson (9), SH Park (8), Salas (7) We have a new clubhouse leader in Sakura Yokomine. The 33-year-old from Japan doesn\u2019t have a stellar record in the majors - top-ten finishes at the US Open in 2010 and 2014, and that\u2019s it - but a 67 today has propelled her up to -6. Meanwhile on 10, the 2016 champ Ariya Jutanugarn sends a wedge over the flag at 10, nearly spinning it back into the cup for eagle. The ball rolls a further couple of feet past, but that\u2019s another birdie and she\u2019s -9. And bogey for Celine Boutier at 8, a short putt pushed right of the cup. She\u2019s back to -7. It\u2019s beginning to look as though any faint hope of a home victory will be down to Bronte Law. She\u2019s level par through 6, and remains at -7. But hot on the heels of Georgia Hall\u2019s double at 9 comes bogey at 8 for Charley Hull, who slips to -5 as well. Hall and Hull have eight shots to make up on Ashleigh Buhai, a player who so far has dropped one shot all week. A lovely tee shot into 6 by the leader Ashleigh Buhai. Pin high, 12 feet to the left. She\u2019s a bit tentative with the birdie putt, though, and it dies off to the left. A good chance to extend her healthy lead at the top even further goes by the wayside. Meanwhile we were spared the sight of Georgia Hall\u2019s head poking out the top of the wild nonsense she drove into. But we do witness the misery of double bogey. She clatters down the standings to -5, and the chance of her becoming the first player since Yani Tseng in 2011 to retain the British Open may have just gone, right there. Bother here for the defending champion Georgia Hall. She sends a hook towards the gallery down the left of 9. It clears the punters, bounces on a path, and disappears into waist-high vegetation. That\u2019s some mutant cabbage. Meanwhile the smile still hasn\u2019t returned to Hinako Shibuno\u2019s face: an underhit chip from the side of 5 leads to her first bogey since the 4th yesterday. Here\u2019s the latest leaderboard, now featuring no English players at all. -13: Buhai (5) -10: Ciganda (9) -9: JY Ko (9), Shibuno (5) -8: Nordqvist (15), A Jutanugarn (8), Masson (7), Boutier (6), SH Park (6), Salas (5) Ariya Jutanugarn isn\u2019t far from eagle at 7. But birdie will suffice. She joins the group at -8. Lizette Salas repairs the damage of 3 with birdie at 5. She\u2019s -8 again. Caroline Masson rolls in a 25-foot birdie putt on 5, and she\u2019s back to -8 too. And Charley Hull pulls a eight-footer for birdie at 8. The home charge is stalling on the easier front nine. England\u2019s dreaming as Bronte Law and Georgia Hall line up birdie putts. Law first. She\u2019d sent her second at 5 over the flag, leaving a relatively straight 12 footer coming back. But she underhits it, the ball dying to the left and stopping one dimple short. Georgia Hall meanwhile clips her tee shot at 8 to eight feet ... but she underhits her putt too, her effort dying right. Both players take turns to look pained, a little bit of frustration creeping in. Back-to-back birdies for Ko Jin-young! A tee shot at 8 to 15 feet, and a putt guided nervelessly into the hole. Back-to-back majors as well? You wouldn\u2019t bet too much money against it. Meanwhile they call Hinako Shibuno \u201cSmiling Cinderella\u201d back home in Japan, her sunny demeanour beloved by fans. She\u2019s not smiling right now, though, a lesser-spotted cloud of misery gently hovering over her head after she sent a sensational approach at 4 to six feet, only to misread the right-to-left break on the birdie putt. I doubt she\u2019ll wallow for too long. Another long putt at 7. It\u2019s sunk by Carlota Ciganda\u2019s playing partner Ko Jin-young from 25 feet for birdie. The world number one rises to -8. Meanwhile China\u2019s Jing Yan is going along very nicely: birdies at 3, 6, 8 and now 11, and she\u2019s -7. Yan, Ciganda and Nordqvist are showing that it\u2019s possible to score low today. The English charge isn\u2019t going to plan, though. Only Georgia Hall is under par for her round at the moment, with birdie at 2 her only prize through the first seven holes. She\u2019s -7, as is Bronte Law, who has parred the opening three. And Charley Hull is still one over for her round, -6 overall through six. Scrub \u201cever-expanding\u201d from that last entry, will you? Masson hits a second poor approach in a row, this time at 5. Her ball apologetically squeaks onto the front of the green, but well away from the flag. She leaves the first putt well short, then pulls the par saver. Bogey. Meanwhile Ciganda finds the par-five 7th in two, then curls in a 40-foot right-to-left breaker for eagle! Ciganda\u2019s been in the mix so often at the majors in recent times. She may be due one. This could be it! Shibuno can\u2019t make her birdie putt on 3, meanwhile, so she\u2019s now got company in second spot. -13: Buhai (3) -10: Ciganda (7), Shibuno (3) -8: Nordqvist (12), Boutier (4), SH Park (4) It\u2019s easy to forget that Hinako Shibuno is playing in her first major championship this week. The 20-year-old Japanese sensation makes it all look so simple. She gently swishes a 6-iron pin high at 3. She\u2019ll have another look at birdie, this time from 15 feet. Meanwhile a first birdie of Park Sung-hyun\u2019s round, the reward for an approach to three feet at 4. She joins the ever-expanding group at -8. A three-putt bogey for Salas at 3. Maybe not technically, the first was from the fringe at the back, but you get the gist. She slips to -7, and her four-birdie blitz at the start of yesterday\u2019s round seems an awfully long time ago. Moving the other way: Celine Boutier, who birdies 4 and joins the group at -8. Carlota Ciganda nearly slam-dunks her tee shot at 6 into the cup! It pitches six inches from the hole, then scoots four feet past. Wow. We\u2019ve come close to a hole-in-one already this week, Marina Alex nearly acing 8 yesterday. But a birdie is more than acceptable. Meanwhile on 4, Masson doesn\u2019t panic, and sends a lovely wedge to three feet, and tidies up to scramble her par. And back on 2, Shibuno very nearly bumps a wedge across the big green and into the cup for eagle. Birdie, though she\u2019s still three back because Buhai makes a 20-footer to maintain her cushion at the top. -13: Buhai (2) -10: Shibuno (2) -8: Nordqvist (12), Ciganda (6), Masson (4), Salas (2) Just a birdie for Nordqvist at 11, then. Apologies for getting y\u2019all excited. And to further dampen the mood, belated news of Charley Hull, who couldn\u2019t scramble her par at 2, the Woburn member dropping back to -6. Meanwhile Shibuno has cracked two lovely woods down 2 and she\u2019s near the front of the green, hunting down a birdie. But trouble for Masson at 4, as her approach clatters into overhanging branches down the right and leaves her ball 50 yards short of the green. -12: Buhai (1) -9: Shibuno (1) -8: Nordqvist (11), Masson (3), Salas (2) Bronte Law lines up a six-foot birdie chance on the par-five 2nd. She shoves it right, and storms off the green in a hot funk. She\u2019s yet to make a birdie this week on this very accommodating hole, which could explain her immense irritation. Her playing partner Lizette Salas misses a short birdie chance as well, racing it four feet past. She nails the one coming back. Neither player in the penultimate group are exuding rays of sunshine right now. They remain at -7 and -8 respectively. Hmm, Nordqvist at 11. There\u2019s been no televised footage, and depending on which source you believe, she made either eagle or just (just!) birdie. In case of the latter, she\u2019ll be -8, in a share of third with Salas and Masson. We\u2019ll keep you posted on that. Caroline Masson curls in a 30-footer for birdie at 3. She joins Lizette Salas at -8. The world number one Ko Jin-young is in hot pursuit: having started shakily with bogey at 2, she\u2019s bounced back with birdies at 3 and 4, the latter the result of an obnoxiously good second shot sent to a couple of feet tops. Thanks John. Now then! The two-time major-winning Swede Anna Nordqvist appears to be on a qvest for number three. Having turned in 33 with those early birdies at 2, 3 and 5, she\u2019s taken it up a notch further. Birdie at 10, followed now by eagle at the par-three 11th! They\u2019ve moved the tee boxes up in the hope of a little more positivity on the par fives, and there we have it. She\u2019s six under for her round already, and has a share of second. This is why they call it Moving Day. Meanwhile opening pars for Buhai and Shibuno in the final group. -12: Buhai (1) -9: Nordqvist (11), Shibuno (1) -8: Salas (1) Georgia Hall has a long, speedy putt to play on the third, while Hull\u2019s attempt to rescue par is off to a bad start with an undercooked first putt from the fringe of the green. Right, here comes the leading pair. Shibuno, second on -9, has the honour. A broad smile as her name is read out, and she clatters her drive down the middle. Ashleigh Buhai\u2019s first shot is hit with what looks like an almost casual deportment but it bumps and runs to safety. And, with all the leading protagonists on the course, Scott Murray is back... Jutanugarn and Hall are on the third, and within touching distance of each other on the fairway. Charley Hull has work to do on the second after a shot that lands in the no-mans land between sand and rough. How did it go? Badly, is the answer. Topped it and faces a race to make par on a very birdie-able par five. Ko claims back that bogey on the first with a birdie on the second. Salas\u2019s second shot to the first green is safe enough, what can Bronte Law conjure with a nine-iron? It was a fine effort but she wasn\u2019t aided by a rather deadened surface. Bronte Law, the leading Brit on -7, takes to that opening tee. And is safe as houses on the first fairway. Lizette Salas, the other member of the penultimate pairing, fades her drive to a similar sense of safety. Just Buhai and Shibuno to come now. Minjee Lee hits the crossbar - the flag, to be precise - with a pitch from a raised fringe of the fifth. Jutanugarn has an eagle chance on the second, and goes for it. That leaves her seven feet to make birdie, and seven she feet she deals with. Georgia Hall, on that par-5 second, has her own birdie chance. And she reads it perfectly, giving the ball just a nudge and letting the ridges take the strain. Up to -7 she goes. Charley Hull\u2019s bunker shot is a beauty, and lands her with a decent birdie chance, though her attempt falls short. Marina Alex sinks a birdie putt on the fourth to wipe out a bogey on the third. Sung Hyun Park is underway with a straight - and true - drive. It flies down the fairway, around 290 yards. Celine Boutier begins her round with far less of a thump but her shot is safe on the fairway. She will be taking the next, as her opponent is one of the game\u2019s biggest hitters. Ko makes a mess of her putting and three-putts to suffer a bogey on the second. Up on the first tee, Caroline Masson, on -7, gets her round underway, and hits her shot to the right of the fairway. Up steps Charley Hull to loud applause, but a few groans as she whacks it 240 yards into the bunker. She is followed by a large crowd. Another home favourite, Hall, seems to have misread the green completely. Jutanugarn makes her par while Nordqvist\u2019s birdie putt falls short. Her charge is slowing somewhat. Ariya Jutanugarn, her shot delayed by someone\u2019s mobile bleeping, plays her second to the lip of the green. Georgia Hall follows up by hitting hers up and to the left of the hole, closer than her playing partner. Their birdies will be some task. Ciganda, at the second after making birdie on the first, has to lay up from a bunker, and may struggle to make par. Anna Nordqvist is at the eighth, and has a birdie chance. The defending champion Georgia Hall takes to the 1st tee. A huge roar as she tees it up. Pin-drop silence as she hits her drive. Another roar as her ball splits the fairway. She\u2019s going round today with Ariya Jutanugarn, who won this tournament on this very course three years ago. Thailand\u2019s first major champion sends her ball down the road too. The third round just got real. And with that, I\u2019m going to have a quick break. John Brewin will treat you right in the meantime. See you again soon. Hannah Green is so close to raking in a long birdie effort on 18. But she\u2019s more than happy to kick in for par, and that\u2019s a fine 68 that moves the PGA champ all the way up to -4. There\u2019ll be no second major this year, but having threatened to miss the cut, she\u2019s now in the process of turning an average week into a more impressive (and lucrative) one. She was going round today with Jessica Korda, who shot 69. She\u2019s -3, and pretty much all of the above applies to her as well. It\u2019s been a feelgood pairing. Brooke Henderson finds tree-bound trouble off the tee at 2. Always out of position, she ends up making bogey. A huge disappointment on a hole that offers birdie on a plate. She drops to -3. Her playing partner Minjee Lee is on the dancefloor in two, but trundles her long eagle putt 12 feet past, and she fails to make the one coming back. She trudges off the green as well, having made a par that will feel like a bogey. She\u2019s -5. Another birdie chance for Nordqvist, who sends her tee shot at 6 straight at the flag. A little short, but it\u2019s an uphill left-to-right curler from 20 feet. A chance to have a good run at it, but she leaves a very tentative effort three feet short. Par, and she remains at -6. Her playing partner Lexi Thompson has hit her tee shot pin high. In goes a lovely birdie putt from 15 feet, and she\u2019s back to -3. Her putter works just fine from medium to long range; it\u2019s the tiddlers that get her nerves jangling and addle the head. But low scores are out there, and someone\u2019s going to make a run at the leaders. It may well be Anna Nordqvist, who cards her third birdie of the day after sending a lovely approach at 5 to four feet. She\u2019s -6, though she walks off the green with the sort of stern look most players wear when they\u2019ve just four putted from three feet. Typical Scandi supercool. -12: Buhai -9: Shibuno -8: Salas -7: Law, Boutier, SH Park, Hull, Masson -6: Nordqvist (5), A Jutanugarn, Hall, JY Ko, Ciganda, Kang -5: Gillman (F), S Kim (12), M Lee (1), N Korda, Alex, Lee6 It would be fair to describe Brooke Henderson as swashbuckling. Will you take a look at this swing. All online dictionaries should replace their definition of no-holds-barred with that clip. Marvellous devil-may-care lashing. It\u2019d be tempting to try to copy her, out on the range, but you\u2019d tie your spinal cord up in a pretty bow. Leave it to the experts. Anyway, the 21-year-old Canadian - who already has the 2016 PGA to her name - has had a relatively quiet year in the majors. Her first without at least a top-ten finish since she competed in the 2013 US Open as a 15-year-old. She\u2019s probably too far behind to challenge this week, starting the day at -4, but she\u2019s threatened to click in to top gear several times this week without ever quite finding it. Should she get there and shoot low today, you never know. She unfurls a huge drive down the 1st, then sets up a straight 15-foot birdie chance. But she doesn\u2019t quite hit the putt, and there\u2019s to be no super-fast start. Last year\u2019s runner-up Pornanong Phatlum finishes round three with at 69. Ditto the 2018 Evian champ Angela Stanford. Both are -2 going into Sunday. Back on 4, Anna Nordqvist passes up a good chance for a third birdie in a row, setting a gently breaking ten-footer too far out to the right. She remains at -5. Back-to-back birdies for Anna Nordqvist. Shots picked up at 2 and 3 send the two-time major winning Swede up to -5. Meanwhile the reigning PGA champ Hannah Green, having just survived the cut, is flying up the leaderboard. Birdies at 8 and 14 sandwiching an eagle at the short par-four 12th. No footage of this yet, but a wild stab in the dark suggests a chip-in from the fairway. She\u2019s -4. Kristen Gillman finishes with three pars and signs for a 66. That\u2019s the joint second-best round of the week, and she\u2019s the very early clubhouse leader at -5. Meanwhile Xiyu Lin and Kim Sei-young are threatening to put together similarly impressive rounds. Both have hit the turn in 33 strokes, rising to -4. Lin has a couple of European Tour wins to her name, both at the Sanya Open back home in China, while Kim\u2019s CV includes top-ten finishes at all the majors. Just a little too far back to covert their work into a maiden major title. Lexi can\u2019t take advantage of her big break. Having sent her second up the fairway on the par-five 2nd, she wedges for the pin, tucked away to the left. She takes up a massive divot, roughly half of the historic county of Buckinghamshire, as her ball sails too far left. She faces a tricky up and down from a tight lie with little green to play with. A gorgeous soft-handed stab sets her up for par from two feet ... but she yips it. Her fourth bogey of the week, and she\u2019s back to -2. This is becoming a huge mental problem for Thompson. The number of short putts she misses is off the scale. A big factor not converting her huge talent into more major championships, right there. Up on the green, Moriya Jutanugarn strokes in a birdie putt from 12 feet and rises to -4. Yesterday\u2019s first 11 holes, played in four over par, have proved so expensive. Meanwhile her Thai compatriot Pornanong Phatlum, who ran Georgia Hall so close last year at Lytham, is putting together a round in the free-flowing style of someone happy to have avoided the cut by the skin of their teeth. A late run of birdies, at 13, 14 and 17, have boosted last year\u2019s runner-up to -2. It beggars belief that Lexi Thompson just has the one major to her name. The 2014 ANA Inspiration, and that\u2019s it so far for the super-talented 24-year-old from Florida. Going into the weekend at -3, she needs something special today if she\u2019s to improve on her best British Open finish of a tie for eighth here at Woburn in 2016, never mind win the thing. But a birdie putt from 15 feet slips by the left on the 1st. She\u2019ll need a bit of good fortune too, and she gets it on the par-five 2nd, hooking her tee shot towards the tall trees down the left. A massive cannon off a trunk sends her ball sailing back in the correct direction. She\u2019s in the semi-rough. She\u2019s got away with that big-style. Angela Stanford finally won that elusive maiden major last year at the age of 40. The Texan was a runner-up at the 2003 US Open, tied for third at the 2011 Dinah Shore, tied for fourth at the PGA in 2004, and tied for fifth in this event in 2014. She got over the line at last year\u2019s Evian Championship in dramatic style. Eagle at 15, double bogey at 16, birdie at 17. And even then she needed her compatriot Amy Olsen to double bogey the last and fall short of a play-off. Stanford won\u2019t be winning major number two this week, but she\u2019s putting together a fine round today. Birdies at 7, 12, 13 and now 17 have zipped her up the standings to -3. The weather at Woburn is much the same as it\u2019s been for the first two days. Lovely and calm. So it\u2019s conducive to low scoring yet again. Kristen Gillman - on her rookie year as a pro, but already with a top-ten finish at the ANA Inspiration under her belt - is proving that already. The 21-year-old US Amateur champion is tearing it up today. Birdies at 1, 5, 6, 11, 14 and now 15. One more before she gets home, and she\u2019ll be matching Ashleigh Buhai\u2019s best-of-week 65. She\u2019s -5. Here are some of the big names who didn\u2019t make the cut. Shanshan Feng (2012 PGA). Ryu So-yeon (2011 US Open and 2017 ANA). Karrie Webb (Career slam). Paula Creamer (2010 US Open). Catriona Matthew (2009 British Open). Inbee Park (Career slam). Pernilla Lindberg (2018 ANA). Stacy Lewis (2011 ANA and 2013 British Open). Lydia Ko (2015 Evian and 2016 ANA). And Laura Davies (two PGAs, a US Open, the du Maurier Classic when it was a major, the British Open when it wasn\u2019t). The depth of the field illustrated, right there.

The 30-year-old South African - a teenage prodigy who has taken a while to realise her potential - played the back nine in 32 strokes yesterday evening. That established a three-stroke 36-hole lead over Hinako Shibuno, the infectiously exciting young Japanese talent making her major championship debut. With the relatively short-hitting Lizette Salas in third, it\u2019s safe to say the top of the leaderboard has a fresh, unexpected look about it. But there are some big names lurking. The defending champion Georgia Hall for one, leading an English charge with Bronte Law and Charley Hull. The world number one Ko Jin-young and the number two Park Sung-hyun. Ariya Jutanugarn, who won this event here in 2016. The US Open champion Jeongeun Lee6. We could go on, but time\u2019s a factor, and there\u2019s golf to be played. Let\u2019s get out there. It\u2019s on! -12: Buhai -9: Shibuno -8: Salas -7: Law, Boutier, SH Park, Hull, Masson -6: A Jutanugarn, Hall, JY Ko, Ciganda, Kang -5: M Lee, N Korda, Alex, Lee6 -4: Yoktuan, Cowan, Henderson, Pressel, IK Kim",

He used to explain the batsmen running between wickets as a sign of excitement or celebration.\u201d</p> <p>And on the same topic, Chris Thompson in Melbourne: Not quite a rule-based misunderstanding, but many years ago I was watching Steve Waugh\u2019s final test when my ex-girlfriend wandered in just as they were giving speeches. The announcer described him as \u201cone of those rare players who leaves the game in better shape than when he started\u201d.

I would have applauded myself because it was such a special innings, but when all\u2019s said and done, he blatantly cheated to try and win a match. How is the reaction of the crowd on Thursday different to those swimmers who refused to share a podium with Sun Yang? Reactions that were pretty favourably reported on from what I saw and the parallels seem pretty close to me.\u201d</p> <p>I respectfully disagree with your comparison but I\u2019ll leave this be.</p> <p>\u201cAfter yet another failure for Bairstow and Ali,\u201d notes Joe Cross. \u201cI\u2019m reminded of my view when the side was selected that their places shouldn\u2019t be considered secure.

He does the conventional thing for the rest of the over, keeping Lyon out when on his stumps and getting his blade and gloves out of the way when he was slightly outside his off-stump. <strong>Lunch it is! </strong>What a fascinating two hours that turned out to be.

As England\u2019s front row coach in 2003 he celebrated on the pitch in Sydney after England won the Rugby World Cup in another epic final. And as a 22 year old he was at Wembley in 1966 when Bobby Moore lifted the Football WC. Was anyone else at all three?\u201d</p> <p>Blimey. Can I interview him, please? <strong><br></strong></p> <p>\u201cSame old problem with England,\u201d writes Joe Cross. \u201cOnce you\u2019re through our rock solid top order the middle just melts away.\u201d Droll.</p> <p>On that topic from Kevin Wilson: \u201cI\u2019m far more disappointed in Bairstow than Mo. Mo\u2019s wicket was a misjudgement by a guy out of form when the offie is spinning it miles. Bairstow\u2019s shot was incredibly irresponsible as the last real batsman. What\u2019s Ben Foakes\u2019s form like?\u201d A question that needs asking, for mine. Let Bairstow bat. Let Buttler bat. Let Foakes keep. Not rocket science.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do we hate Stuart Broad so much again?\u201d asks Ben Mostyn in Australia. I don\u2019t think we actually do? It was definitely a thing for about five minutes in 2013, but I don\u2019t think so anymore.

This is a point about the laws that John Holder made in his TMS Ask the Umpire slot yesterday.\u201d I\u2019ll have a listen. Thanks. </p> <p>Hugh Maguire is on my team, by the looks. \u201cI quite like the potential for freakery that is a bails jostle not out. But the frequency is getting a bit much. And the recent lack of stump cartwheeling when a fast bowler hits the stumps makes me think the issue is not the bails, rather overly robust stumps. Could we not fiddle with the laws, but just make sure the stumps are not set in concrete as it seems they now are?\u201d Just use snicko, right? Keep the bails for run outs.</p> <p>\u201cIn response to Dave Adams question about not understanding a key rule,\u201d writes Habib Butt, \u201cback in 1990 when I first started following cricket as an eleven year old I thought the follow on was giving a side three innings in a match, I was baffled why any team would want to enforce the follow on.\u201d Outstanding.

Aside from bemoaning the slow scoring (he watched the World Cup Final), he\u2019s been constantly asking questions about the game. Again, explaining the laws and customs of the sport we all love is also a joy. It took my mind back, though, to when I first got into cricket. My first series watching was the 1989 Ashes and I had no parent around to ask all the questions of. As a result, whenever I saw an unsuccessful lbw appeal and heard the commentators say that it was \u2018worth a shout\u2019, I assumed that an extra run was awarded to the batting side.

In Australia, we now get a full-on press conferene with the curator before every Test Match. I feel for the new bloke at Lord\u2019s. </p> <p>Tim Sattertwaite isn\u2019t that worried about numbers on shirts but he sure doesn\u2019t like the advertsing on the stumps. I\u2019m more frustrated about the bails debate, but that\u2019s for another time. In short, we have the technology to know if the ball hit, let\u2019s use it!

The sun has successfully burned through the morning cloud cover here at Birmingham and we\u2019re in for what will probably be the day that defines the outcome of this First Ashes Test of 2019. What a lovely way to spend a Saturday? Welcome to you all. </p> <p>In 45 minutes from now we will pick up the action with Rory Burns and Ben Stokes some 17 runs away from banking a first innings lead, the former having batted through the duration of day two for his maiden Test ton. It wasn\u2019t pretty but do you think he cares? This isn\u2019t a beauty pageant. Stokes can do the pretty for both of them. </p> <p>The all-rounder was the most assured man at Edgbaston yesterday. Walking in at the moment Australia were threatening to ruin the afternoon for Joe Root and co, he picked up where he left off at Lord\u2019s a few weekends ago. If he can bat for a couple of hours this morning, Tim Paine\u2019s men are in a lot of trouble. </p> <p>To their credit, despite only taking four wickets yesterday, the Australian bowlers did very little wrong. Epecially James Pattinson, who was outstanding in his first Test since February 2016, and Pete Siddle landed it in a shoebox all day. Pat Cummims bounced back well late in the day and Nathan Lyon was Nathan Lyon. They will bowl a lot worse and bowl teams out. That\u2019s their job today: ripping through England\u2019s lower order and keeping the deficit in check. </p> <p>Righto, I\u2019ll leave it there for the time being as we make our way towards the first ball of morning three. Do <a href=\"mailto:adam.collins.casual@theguardian.com\">drop me a line</a> in the usual way, or ping me a <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/collinsadam\">tweet</a> if that\u2019s more your style.

It\u2019s great to be back playing Test cricket in front of a really boisterous crowd.\u201d Here\u2019s Chris Woakes \u201cWe are pleased to have taken three wickets, although we probably leaked a few too many runs. You\u2019d probably say we\u2019re slightly ahead in the game. The fields weren\u2019t overly attacking. We probably didn\u2019t quite get our lengths right. \u201c[How are you gonna get Steve Smith out?] You got any ideas?! On a slow wicket like that, you need to build pressure, build pressure, build pressure and hope the batsman makes a mistake. But he\u2019s a world-class player and he makes very few mistakes. It\u2019s a tricky one \u2013 if you bowl well outside off stump, you\u2019re taking bowled and LBW out of the game. You want two guys having two plans for him so you can test him both sides of the wicket.\u201d That was another intriguing day\u2019s play. The initiative changes hands a few times, and at the moment it\u2019s in the twitching hands of Steve Smith. If England don\u2019t get him before lunch, they will be in trouble. And if Smith makes two centuries to win a lowish-scoring Ashes Test, it will be a comeback for the ages. \u201cI think the catch to Michael Collins\u2019s perfectly sensible suggestion is that many folk like to have \u2018a few\u2019 drinks at the cricket whilst not getting totally \u2018tanked up\u2019 and spoiling other people\u2019s enjoyment,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cA three, sorry thirteen, sorry thirty-pint limit would work at most grounds, no?\u201d That\u2019s a bit rich coming from the man who\u2019s been running round the Hollies Stand dressed as Bobby Charlton all afternoon. And like that, the day\u2019s play is over. The crowd boo but it has become very dark at Edgbaston. Australia lead by 34 at the close; crucially, Steve Smith is still at the crease. He has batted with awesome certainty. 31st over: Australia 124-3 (Smith 46, Head 21) Smith drags a short ball from Stokes round the corner for four. Australia are scoring at more than four an over, a reflection of their intent and also some loose England bowling. They have really missed Jimmy Anderson - not just his wicket-taking threat but also his relentless accuracy. \u201cRob, I\u2019m mortified!\u201d says Emiel de Bont. \u201cBen Macintyre\u2019s interruption surely qualifies as the first ever mention of avocado toast in the context of a cricket match. Wait till the Aussies catch on. They\u2019ll be laughing themselves silly and believe England are toast now. Millennials...\u201d 30th over: Australia 119-3 (Smith 41, Head 21) A slick of luck for Head, who flashes Root over the left shoulder of Stokes at first slip and away for four. He nails the cut stroke next ball, timing it through backward point for four more. Australia lead by 29. \u201cThere is always an alcohol-free stand at the MCG which seems to work well,\u201d says Julie Wilson. \u201cHas the advantage of not so many people obscuring your view on their way to the bar.\u201d 29th over: Australia 111-3 (Smith 41, Head 13) Smith continues; of course he does. A maiden from Stokes. \u201cRob,\u201d says Romeo. \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting if they try and find a like-for-like concussion substitute for Smith.\u201d \u2018The new Australian batsman, Virat Kohli...\u2019 28.2 overs: Australia 111-3 (Smith 41, Head 13) A bouncer from Stokes hits Smith flush in the grille. He staggers away towards silly point, just about staying on his feet, and there\u2019s a break in play while he has a concussion test. He looks compos mentis, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll want to continue, but that little stagger away from the crease did not look good. He was very wobbly. 28th over: Australia 111-3 (Smith 41, Head 13) Joe Root replaces Moeen Ali, nothing much happens. I really feel for Moeen. He seemed to have cracked it as a Test spinner after his recall last summer, but now he\u2019s almost back where he was 18 months ago. \u201cThe answer to the problem caused by the tension that exists between those of us wanting to just watch the cricket and others just wanting to get tanked up and engage in hilarious (sic) banter is to have alcohol-free stands,\u201d says Michael Collins. \u201cLet those who enjoy beer snakes and yet-another-round-of-amusing-chanting all sit together and revel in each other\u2019s witty company.\u201d That\u2019s an extremely persuasive idea. What\u2019s the catch? 27th over: Australia 109-3 (Smith 40, Head 12) Smith survives a big LBW appeal from Stokes after getting in a bit of a tangle on the back foot. The ball hit him between the legs and was going over the top, though not by much. England didn\u2019t review. \u201cThose readers frustrated about the liveblog time stamps should consider themselves lucky to be only a few hours off,\u201d says Mac Millings, \u201cbecause here in South Carolina it appears to be the year 1953.\u201d 26th over: Australia 108-3 (Smith 40, Head 12) Smith laces Moeen emphatically through extra cover for four. What a brilliant stroke. It\u2019s only his second boundary, yet he is still scoring at almost a run a ball. It\u2019s the third day of the series and it already feels like he\u2019s broken England\u2019s will. I\u2019m starting to think England should pick Jack Leach at Lord\u2019s, partly because of Smith\u2019s record against left-arm spin. When Moeen\u2019s confidence goes, it goes quickly, and at the moment he is bowling in hope rather than expectation. Australia have gone after him, a sensible approach given his fragile confidence, and he has figures of 9-0-48-1. Australia lead by 18. 25th over: Australia 100-3 (Smith 34, Head 10) Head survives a run-out chance off the first ball after drinks. He would have been miles out had Burns\u2019 throw from short square-leg hit the stumps. Thanks, incidentally, for all your emails about the time zone problem. You\u2019ll be pleased to know they\u2019ve made things even muddier, because everyone\u2019s case seems to be different. 24th over: Australia 98-3 (Smith 33, Head 9) Jofra Archer is on the field as a substitute. It\u2019ll be fascinating to see how he tries to get Steve Smith out when he makes his Test debut. Moeen has an LBW shout against Smith turned down by Aleem Dar. It was a dangerous delivery which turned sharply and kept low, but it hit Smith well outside the line of off stump. \u201cNick Barlow doesn\u2019t speak for the silent majority but rather for the older contingent of cricket fans,\u201d says Ben Macintyre. \u201cNot saying alcohol is the answer to get young people into cricket, but I find it\u2019s the same people who sit around harking for the days of tea and polite applause who also wonder why cricket fans aren\u2019t getting younger and think that my generation (I\u2019m 21) is lazy because we eat avocado on toast. Not everyone has to be a part of the Barmy Army the same way not everyone has to restrict themselves to tea and polite applause.\u201d I\u2019m staying out of this one. 23rd over: Australia 94-3 (Smith 30, Head 8) Smith works a single off Stokes to put Australia in the lead. He is stockpiling runs, mainly ones and twos on the leg side, with intimidating ease. I say this genuinely, rather than in a half-arsed attempt to jinx Smith: I cannot see him getting out. \u201cNeil Golightly (19th over) is quite wrong,\u201d says Dan Jones. \u201cMy phone has never been out of the UK and it persists in showing the time in EDT (and indeed any other opponents\u2019 time zone). I therefore believe this *is* a conspiracy to annoy Heather Bartlett.\u201d And what about Heather Greenstreet? Or are they the same person? This is like a bloomin\u2019 John le Carr\u00e9 book. 22nd over: Australia 90-3 (Smith 27, Head 7) If Smith does have a weakness it\u2019s against left-arm spin, which may influence England\u2019s selection as the series develops, especially if he keeps scoring 150 in every innings. At the moment, absurd as it sounds, you\u2019d probably back Jack Leach to get as many runs as Moeen Ali, never mind wickets. 21st over: Australia 85-3 (Smith 23, Head 5) In his last 10 Test innings against England, Steve Smith has a preposterous average of 142.28. If anyone in this side can rip him from his bubble it\u2019s probably Stokes. But not in that over - five from it. 20th over: Australia 80-3 (Smith 20, Head 3) Moeen Ali replaces Joe Root, who replaced Moeen Ali for one over. Head flicks for three to get off the mark. Although he took the wicket of Bancroft, Moeen looks a bit low on confidence and has gone for 31 from six overs. \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cI effing LOVE cricket. And the OBO. I\u2019m not even drunk. Somethings just need saying sometimes.\u201d You\u2019re the one dressed as Bobby Charlton in the Hollies Stand, aren\u2019t you? 19th over: Australia 75-3 (Smith 19, Head 0) Head is beaten first ball by another cracker from Stokes, who looks pretty fired up. A wicket maiden to start what, knowing Stokes, could be a long spell. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t actually matter which edition of the website you\u2019re reading, the timestamps will be displayed as local to whichever time zone your device is set to,\u201d says Neil Golightly. \u201cIf you want BST, you\u2019ll have to change your device settings.\u201d I\u2019ll level with you - I haven\u2019t a clue how it works. But I do know it\u2019s not a conspiracy to irritate Heather Greenstreet. Ben Stokes has made something happen! He\u2019s dismissed Usman Khawaja second ball with a sizzling delivery that straightened sharply to cut him in half and shave the inside-edge on its way through to Bairstow. That\u2019s a big wicket for England, and a classic bit of Stokesian partnership-breaking. 18th over: Australia 75-2 (Khawaja 40, Smith 19) Joe Root turns to his second-change bowler, Joe Root. That\u2019s an interesting move. It might just be a single over so that Moeen Ali can change ends. Nothing much happens, with each batsman taking a single. I think England need to bring Ben Stokes on and set him to make-things-happen mode. Here\u2019s Philip Saunders. \u201cNick Barlow (15th over) speaks for the silent majority (pun intended!).\u201d I completely understand that view. I think years of watching darts has left me dead inside inured me to such crowds. 17th over: Australia 73-2 (Khawaja 39, Smith 18) Struggling to replicate the adrenaline rush of the World Cup final? Fear not: England are on course to provide another nerve-shredding runchase either tomorrow or Monday. Khawaja drives Woakes crisply through backward point for four, another shot of unobtrusive excellence, and waves another boundary through mid-on later in the over. This is an excellent spell for Australia and it\u2019s very quiet at Edgbaston. England need a wicket, or even a near miss to get the crowd going. 16th over: Australia 64-2 (Khawaja 31, Smith 17) \u201cHello Rob,\u201d says Geoff Wignall. \u201cRe: the England batting order, I know I\u2019m not alone in fancying Stokes at four. The suggestion of Bairstow at five astonishes me. Over the last year or so, aside from his outlier ton at Columbo his Test match performances suggest nine or ten would be about right. And of course they should be picking the best keeper since Taylor in Foakes, who\u2019s easily good enough to bat at seven.\u201d You may fancy Stokes at No4 but he doesn\u2019t \u2013 he asked to drop from five to six in the winter because he felt there was a hangover from his bowling and fielding. I agree that Bairstow has batted abysmally of late, but he\u2019s a much better player than that. If he\u2019s anywhere near his best I would bat him at No5, not that this is likely to happen. 15th over: Australia 61-2 (Khawaja 30, Smith 15) Khawaja, surprised by a bit of extra bounce from Woakes, does well to get over the ball and drop it on the off side. The next ball is too straight and flicked through midwicket for two by Khawaja. He\u2019s playing beautifully. \u201cHiya Rob,\u201d says Nick Barlow. \u201cJust watching the game and am getting seriously fed up with the football-style chants and general foolishness. I realise the halcyon days of yore are rare these days with polite applause sustaining the audience while cups of tea are served, but if I wanted pillocks chanting I\u2019d follow football. Can\u2019t we just ban the Barmy Army and make them watch the game in pubs? Yes, I am fun at parties.\u201d Is it actually the Barmy Army, though? I always assumed it was isolated groups of banterers. I don\u2019t mind them, personally, if the jollity is coupled with an appreciation of decent cricket. The booing of Smith and Warner feels like wackiness for the sake of it, the kind of thing Colin Hunt would do. The drunken gaeity doesn\u2019t bother me so much, though I probably wouldn\u2019t be as equable if I was at the ground and had a fat bloke in a ballerina dress belching in my face every couple of overs. 14th over: Australia 58-2 (Khawaja 28, Smith 14) Khawaja has stealthily moved to 28 from 30 balls and looks comfortable against Moeen, which hasn\u2019t always been the case. This is really excellent stuff; England lead by 32. \u201cWhen,\u201d says Gary Naylor, \u201cdo England start giving Smith the single?\u201d 13th over: Australia 55-2 (Khawaja 27, Smith 12) Woakes replaces Broad, who bowled a slightly loose opening spell of 6-0-26-1. This is such an important spell, because if Smith gets in England are in trouble. Woakes hits him on the thigh or pad three times during a fine over; all too high for LBW appeals, but challenging bowling nonetheless. \u201cRemember,\u201d says Glenn Brazier, \u201cwhen our top four consisted of Tresco, Strauss, Vaughan and Thorpe? Insanity looking at today\u2019s batting line-up.\u201d I cannot tell you how much I loathe myself for what I\u2019m about to do, but \u2026 they were never England\u2019s top four. Thorpe batted at No5 in the twilight of his career. The pedant in me is caged by frail and fragile bars. 12th over: Australia 52-2 (Khawaja 27, Smith 9) His batting may have gone to seed, but Moeen has been a matchwinner with the ball since his recall a year ago. He should be England\u2019s biggest wicket-taking threat on this dusty surface. For now, though, England could use a maiden or two. Khawaja flicks four more to fine leg - both he and Smith are scoring at a run a ball or better. 11th over: Australia 45-2 (Khawaja 21, Smith 9) Khawaja hits consecutive boundaries off Broad, a flick through midwicket followed by a shovel round the corner. Australia are scoring very freely just now, with 29 runs coming from the last four overs. \u201cNope I see EDT too, not just Heather Greenstreet,\u201d says James Governor. \u201cTo be fair you had weird time zones throughout the World Cup too.\u201d Are you sure you\u2019re reading the UK edition? It\u2019s fine on my browser. I\u2019ll ask the desk about it. 10th over: Australia 33-2 (Khawaja 12, Smith 5) Khawaja is dropped! It was a very sharp, low chance to Buttler in the gully off the bowling of Moeen; he couldn\u2019t get his hands down fast enough and the ball ran through his legs. Smith then gets his first boundary with a classy flick behind square. He looks in ominous touch. He\u2019s faced four balls. \u201cWonderful Test cricket we are witnessing,\u201d says Sam. \u201cThough not cricket, and to reverse the confusion back across the Atlantic, when I was around ten I believed that if you turned a baseball diamond into a straight line it would be a mile long. What incredible athletes they must be.\u201d Cameron Bancroft is put out of his misery by Moeen Ali. He shaped to come down the track, changed his mind and gave a simple bat-pad catch to short leg. It was good bowling from Moeen, who saw Bancroft coming and fired the ball flatter and straighter. Bancroft, in a bit of a tangle, could only deflect it onto the pad and into the hands of Jos Buttler. 9th over: Australia 27-1 (Bancroft 7, Khawaja 11) Bancroft is beaten, chasing a length outswinger from Broad. I\u2019m not sure England have made him play enough; when he does, he looks vulnerable. At the other end, Khawaja looks calmer and more secure. \u201cSir, if you do have a change take a glance at the Windies score in their T20I v India being played at Miami,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cDebutant teenager Saini took two consecutive wickets in his first over. They\u2019re 43/5 as I write this ... Some scenes, and some talent on display!\u201d Truly, you can never have enough scenes. If anything can save this world gone wrong, it will surely be scenes. This isn\u2019t the only live sport today. \u201cIt\u2019s not going so well for England at Woburn,\u201d says golfblog genius Scott T Murray, \u201cas birdie putt after birdie putt fails to drop for Georgia Hall, Charley Hull and Bronte Law.\u201d 8th over: Australia 26-1 (Bancroft 6, Khawaja 11) Moeen Ali does come into the attack. His second ball, to Bancroft, is an absolute jaffa that roars through the gate and just misses the off stump. Khawaja then edges wide of slip for four. Nine from the over but that was a promising start from Moeen. \u201cSat at Mombasa airport,\u201d says Mike Harding. \u201cI have got your commentary in one ear of the Test match and watching a live stream of my club Wilmslow Cc playing Woodford CC in Cheshire. It is tea at Edgbaston and tea at the Rectory Field Wilmslow. The wonder of the internet.\u201d I especially love that it enables you to hear the written word. 7th over: Australia 17-1 (Bancroft 6, Khawaja 3) Joe Root must be tempted to have an early look at Moeen Ali against Khawaja, although Broad and Woakes are bowling well. Bancroft edges a good delivery from Broad along the floor to third slip before flicking a single to long leg. \u201cOn Curran, and this is meant seriously, not provocatively!\u201d begins Andrew Hurley. \u201cWho would you fancy to get more runs, he or Denly?\u201d I know what you mean, but I don\u2019t think Curran is ready to bat No4 against Australia. And Jos Buttler certainly isn\u2019t. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if, come the winter, Jason Roy bats at No4 and Rory Burns opens with somebody else. 6th over: Australia 15-1 (Bancroft 5, Khawaja 2) Bancroft is beaten, fencing away from his body at Woakes. This is a million miles from the hord and forst wickets he bats on in Perth, and you can see how desperate he is just to get through this new-ball spell. \u201cFaced with a dilemma,\u201d says Colum Fordham. \u201cWhether to watch the fascinating prospect of Broad and Woakes trying to dismiss the Australian batsmen or go out and get a bit of net practice with Sri Lankans in makeshift nets created on a former 5-a side football pitch surrounded by brambles (good blackberries by the way). Part of me says that I\u2019m crazy even to contemplate the latter option. I suppose I can always follow the Guardian OBO while in the scorching afternoon heat of Naples wondering why I made the wrong decision.\u201d Do as I say, not as I would do: go and play cricket. 5th over: Australia 14-1 (Bancroft 5, Khawaja 1) England would love to get Steve Smith in against the new ball. Broad strays onto the pads of Khawaja, who flicks a single to get off the mark. Nothing else to report from a pretty quiet over. \u201cYou are a UK paper,\u201d says Heather Greenstreet. \u201cWe are UK listeners. Match is being played in the UK. PLEASE use BST.\u201d Listen, we are using BST. I suspect you\u2019re reading the US edition. 4th over: Australia 13-1 (Bancroft 5, Khawaja 0) Woakes keeps the pressure on with a maiden to Bancroft. That\u2019s only the third time in Warner\u2019s Test career, and the first against England, that he has been out in single figures in both innings. 3rd over: Australia 13-1 (Bancroft 5, Khawaja 0) That\u2019s a huge wicket. Warner has started busily and had hit Broad for two fours earlier in the over. \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Kim Thonger. \u201cCan I be the first to predict that rarest of outcomes, a draw? Australia, after a Smith double hundred, set England 401 to win, which they politely decline to attempt, and a fifth day filled with obdurate blocking, Mexican waves, streakers, and elderly members failing to stay awake.\u201d That\u2019s Stuart Broad\u2019s 450th Test wicket. It was a mighty delivery that lifted and straightened dramatically from around the wicket; Warner tried to leave at the last minute but was too late and the ball kissed the edge on its wasy through to Bairstow. The not-out decision looks a bit of a shocker from Joel Wilson, because there was a fairly big deflection, but in his defence Broad also wasn\u2019t sure. That\u2019s out! ENGLAND REVIEW FOR CAUGHT BEHIND AGAINST WARNER! I think this out, purely because Warner\u2019s head snapped round the moment the ball went past the bat. 2nd over: Australia 5-0 (Bancroft 5, Warner 0) James Anderson is off the field, so Chris Woakes will share the new ball. After a good start, he ends the over with a dreadful delivery on leg stump that Bancroft flicks through midwicket for four. \u201cI suggested to the OBO last year that perhaps Bairstow could keep for one of the innings, depending on the toss and Buttler (or Foakes or Burns) keep for the other,\u201d says Mark Slater. \u201cThat way you can have him bat at No5, and pander to his preference.\u201d I think his preference is to bat No7 and keep. Either way, I\u2019m not sure Test cricket is ready for such funky tactics just yet. 1st over: Australia 1-0 (Bancroft 1, Warner 0) A superb start to the innings from Stuart Broad. Bancroft survives a big LBW appeal (too high), is beaten outside off and takes a quick single to get down the other end. \u201cRemember when Dominic Cork made a half century at the Oval in 2002?\u201d says Chris Fryer. \u201cHe held up seven defiant fingers to show he was up to batting that high in the order. England made 515, so it might have been a bit of a flat track.\u201d That went well; it was his last Test innings. Tea-time chit chat \u201cWhen we were kids,\u201d says Paul Metcalfe, \u201cbig brother Andy had us all convinced that there was a rule called \u2018Last Man Stands\u2019 whereby the eleventh batsman could, in special circumstances, soldier on alone. I\u2019ve never been sure whether he actually believed it himself.\u201d \u201cNice to see a TV sports producer with a sense of mischief,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cWarne comes on commentary and the camera switches to Steve Waugh. Silence ensues.\u201d The innings break means the players will take an early tea. There are still 44 overs remaining, so the evening session could be a cracker. Although he batted, I don\u2019t think Anderson is fit enough to bowl. We\u2019ll soon find out. The third bowling change in as many overs. Lyon replaces Pattinson who replaced Cummins who replaced Lyon - and the move has the desired effect when Anderson slog-sweeps straight up in the air. That\u2019s Lyon\u2019s third wicket, all left-handers of course. Chris Woakes is left unbeaten on 37, and England lead by 90. 135th over: England 373-9 (Woakes 36, Anderson 3) Cummins has changed ends in an attempt to end this nonsense. No dice, at least not yet. Anderson squirts two through point and plays out the remainder of the over. England lead by 89. 134th over: England 371-9 (Woakes 36, Anderson 1) Woakes has a big drive at the new bowler Pattinson and edges it wide of the solitary slip for four. His numbers in home Tests are quite spectacular \u2013 43 with the bat, 22 with the ball. \u201cThis could be a lot worse,\u201d says Lee Calvert. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so long ago that Ryan Sidebottom batted at 8 for England. Ryan Sidebottom. At eight.\u201d I\u2019ll see that and raise you the Oval 1999. 133rd over: England 367-9 (Woakes 32, Anderson 1) \u201cIs there an unsentimental argument that, given that Buttler keeps, that Curran brings more value to the Test team as a lower-order counter-puncher than World Cup hero Young Jonny Bairstow?\u201d asks Christian Cummins. \u201cCurran must have outperformed him with the bat in the past 18 months.\u201d I think it\u2019s a bit too early for that, especially as it would be a relatively seismic change. But Bairstow\u2019s Test form has been a worry for a while. In the last two years he averages 29, which is absurd for a player of his ability. I\u2019d love him to bat No5 and not keep wicket, but it seems that isn\u2019t going to happen. As for Curran, if he plays I think it needs to be as the third seamer, certainly for the time being. 132nd over: England 365-9 (Woakes 31, Anderson 0) I think I would promote Woakes above Moeen in the oder; he\u2019s in much better form and has a higher Test average. He can\u2019t add any runs in that over, with Cummins bowling a very wide short ball to ensure Anderson is on strike for the next over. \u201cWas in England for glorious World Cup campaign,\u201d says Mark Davies. \u201cNow back in my newly built house in the Ecuadorian Andes at 2,600metres of altitude. There are folks here from the subcontinent who play cricket at weekends. Not enough Brits to get a team out though. My Ecuadorian partner actually enjoys watching cricket when we are in the UK, but not sure if she is on top of all the rules!\u201d Oh, so she\u2019s an umpire? Honkety-honk. 131st over: England 365-9 (Woakes 31, Anderson 0) James Anderson plays out a maiden from Lyon, including a reverse sweep for no run that prompts lusty cheers from the crowd. 130th over: England 365-9 (Woakes 31, Anderson 0) \u201cFollowing on from Dave Adams\u2019 email...\u201d begins Joseph Hutchison. \u201cI was watching the TV highlights with my wife a few years ago when suddenly she turned to me and exclaimed, \u2018How can that not be out?\u2019 I explained that the ball had hit the ground before the fielder caught it. \u2018Yes,\u2019 she said, indignantly. \u2018But one hand, one bounce.\u2019 Thanks Adam, hello everyone. Stuart Broad has gone, roughed up emphatically by Pat Cummins. Every ball in the over was short, and eventually Broad jumped across his stumps to flick one high in the air towards fine leg. Pattinson got in position and crouched to take a comfortable catch. That ends his and Chris Woakes\u2019 second excellent partnership of the game. 129th over: England 365-8 (Woakes 31, Broad 29) The Smith Experienment has been shelved in favour of Nathan Lyon. Woakes plays out a maiden defending off both the front and back foot. That brings the third hour of the day to an end with drinks on the field. An excellent session so far for England, this partnership now worth 65 with the lead climbing to 81. With that, I\u2019m out of here. Thanks for your company and excellent emails. Over to the master of the genre, Rob Smyth. Bye! 128th over: England 365-8 (Woakes 31, Broad 29) Woakes is right in behind Cummins until the penultimate delivery, which is gets down nicely to third man for a single. Paine changes the field for Broad, a short leg into the mix for the one ball he has to negotiate. Of course, the bouncer is coming but he manages to get out of the way. Just. 127th over: England 364-8 (Woakes 30, Broad 29) Smith has Broad miscuing a sweep off the bottom of his bat but it runs away for four past the gloves of Paine! With three more singles to the sweepers, these two have now put on 64 in 22 overs together. We saw a partnership for the ninth wicket define Australia\u2019s innings, we\u2019re seeing another critical one here. This is nearly Sam Curran stuff. 126th over: England 357-8 (Woakes 28, Broad 24) Cummins is doing what a fast bowler must in this situation: keeping it tight. And he\u2019s still flinging it down as well. Oh, the short one has Broad trying to get out of the way but he can\u2019t - the ball landing where short leg would be. But not at this stage of the innings with the lead now 73. Some housekeeping as I move towards the end of my stint. Robert Wilson is back in my inbox - he has news on his knees. \u201cGlen Hatrick is absolutely bang dead to rights on the money on all things kneecappish (although it was Musgrave Park rather than the Royal). Knows his stuff, this G Hatrick, if only he were real... When I later got to Cambridge, I used to roll up my trouser legs in college bars and tell wispy girls I had been kneecapped (I hadn\u2019t). I thought it would be thrillingly effective (it wasn\u2019t). I haven\u2019t kneeled down since I was sixteen.\u201d Of course you did... \u201cPS. Re. early rules and regs ignorance. For the first two or three years of my cricket loving life, I thought the pitch was about 12 feet long due to TV camera foreshortening. I used to get my brothers to bowl golf balls at me on strips of concrete that long. Ignorance is not always bliss.\u201d A mate of mine growing up was insistent that the TV broadcasters slowed the deliveries down so that we were able to see the ball. 125th over: England 356-8 (Woakes 27, Broad 24) Steve Smith! For the first time in this innings. You can imagine what the response is from the fired-up Hollies Stand. He\u2019s actually turned into a better bowler since the ban - we\u2019ll see. The leggie lands them throughout the over but neither player is going to take the bait and have a pop. Broad\u2019s outside edge is beaten by the final delivery - with a topspinner, by the looks, Paine taking the bails - but he\u2019s safe. 124th over: England 354-8 (Woakes 26, Broad 23) He turns to Pat Cummins, replacing Pattinson. Two more singles start the over as the attack-leader works into it before dotting up Woakes, angling in at his stumps trying to find any movement. Nothing doing, though. 123rd over: England 352-8 (Woakes 25, Broad 22) The Hollies Stand are involved here now. To begin, Lyon is no-balled, I think, because Bancroft at short leg is behind square making three fielders to the right of the umpire? You don\u2019t see that often. With a Woakes single down the ground the England 350 is up, which also makes a partnership of 50 between this pair. They have done so well, coming together when England were collapsing. With Broad on strike, Warner is sent out to the boundary in front of the Hollies Stand at deep square leg and they give it big again. Warner, of course, blows them a kiss. Two more singles to finish. Your move, Tim Paine. 122nd over: England 348-8 (Woakes 23, Broad 21) The Australians try to get their ball changed between overs but it gets through the ring. Back to Pattinson, two singles start his over with Woakes and Broad both using the pace to deflect. The quick replies with an outswinger, beating the blade nicely. He then finds the edge, but on the bounce to the cordon, skipping through for a run that will frustrate them. The crowd are going WILD; the loudest they have been all week. 121st over: England 345-8 (Woakes 21, Broad 20) Lyon changes it up to go around the wicket at Woakes, who gets him down the ground. Sticking with that angle to Broad he nearly bowls him around his legs! Hands on heads around the bat and from the bowlers. Broad nearly gets runs on the sweep again but can\u2019t beat the man at backward square, getting well forward to defend the rest. 120th over: England 344-8 (Woakes 20, Broad 20) Anderson update: the England camp say that he has bowled in the nets during the lunch break. Wouldn\u2019t that be something if he got on and picked up some second-innings wickets? Who knows, it might be the final time he bowls in an Ashes Test if he hurts himself again. What a great match this is in terms of storylines. Three more singles off Pattinson, all without fuss, both players now into the 20s. The lead is 60. 119th over: England 341-8 (Woakes 18, Broad 19) Broad is playing Lyon well off the front foot, making contact with soft hands as required, pushing a single to point. Woakes plays with the spin as well, tucking one around the corner. The lead is 57. 118th over: England 339-8 (Woakes 17, Broad 18) This is getting slightly problematic for Australia now, the pace of Pattinson not bothering the set England pair as they hoped. Granted, Broad was beaten early in the over, but another three runs were added - each cheered enthusiastically by the crowd. Paine must remain patient. Tim Stappard \u201cjust exited a Nazi submarine base on the outskirts of Bordeaux\u201d to check the OBO. As you do! 117th over: England 336-8 (Woakes 15, Broad 17) Lyon beats the bat with one that spins big at Broad but it is well outside the off-stump. Going straighter with the next ball, Broad is down into his slog sweep and nails it for four out to the Hollies Stand! That moves the lead beyond 50. Broad get another single around the corner. Good batting. Ooh, not far away to finish, Woakes beaten when cutting too close to his body. This pair have put on 36. There was confirmation at the lunch break too that Jimmy Anderson will bat. But will he bowl? 116th over: England 330-8 (Woakes 14, Broad 12) Pattinson takes a couple of balls to get going - he\u2019ll be a tired boy by now. Onto Broad\u2019s pads, he takes an easy single. He\u2019s back on the money to Woakes, getting a ball to seam way from Woakes and finding his edge but away from the catchers for one down to third man. \u201cI prefer following The Ashes on The Guardian rather than television as watching live is so stressful,\u201d reports Graham Hand. \u201cWhy? Because as a Pom living in Sydney, everyone else wants the Aussies to win, and I know I will be mercilessly bagged at work if England does badly. You folk living in England, watching in your mutual apprehension and perhaps misery, console each other together. But when you\u2019re alone, the consequences of a bad day can be dire. I often watch until tea then go to bed, and nervously check the score when I wake up. It\u2019s painful. I wouldn\u2019t mind if it rained for two months. On the other hand, watching the World Cup Final all night until 5am was wonderful.\u201d Thanks for being part of it! \u201cI for one would love to read an interview with Orlando\u2019s uncle,\u201d says Dave Jackson. Okay, good call: I\u2019ll get on it. Orlando, hit me up. That went fast... the players are back on the field. Pattinson to Broad. PLAY! A few more before we return. On Bob\u2019s knees? Davy Given: \u201cI would guess that Paris Bob was recovering at Belfast\u2019s Musgrave Park hospital, which - for various reasons - housed the world\u2019s foremost experts for knee reconstruction during the 1980s.\u201d And Glen Hatrick: \u201cMy money\u2019s on the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast \u2013 the Venn diagram of joyriders and kneecapping victims would show a substantial degree of overlap. The fact that they all hated cricket was also a bit of a giveaway. On the plus side, Bob couldn\u2019t have picked a better place to have a knee injury \u2013 due to the kneecappings, Belfast is the world leader for knee surgery. We\u2019re very proud.\u201d We wait for Bob\u2019s reply. \u201cI note that Ed Smith is wearing the same tie as yesterday,\u201d Romeo reports. \u201cIs this his lucky tie, or has he spilt his dinner down all his others?\u201d Or he might have been out with Beefy (see much earlier today a note saying he is in the same shirt as yesterday) This is a corker from Kanishk Srinivasan on the topic of misunderstood laws and quirks of cricket: \u201cDave Adams raised a great question about not understanding certain rules in cricket, and I couldn\u2019t help but think of a friend (who shall remain anonymous) who used to think that the 30-yard circle was a mini-boundary, and that if you got the ball past it, you\u2019d get 2 runs be default, and three if you got it past without a bounce. He used to explain the batsmen running between wickets as a sign of excitement or celebration.\u201d And on the same topic, Chris Thompson in Melbourne: Not quite a rule-based misunderstanding, but many years ago I was watching Steve Waugh\u2019s final test when my ex-girlfriend wandered in just as they were giving speeches. The announcer described him as \u201cone of those rare players who leaves the game in better shape than when he started\u201d. A pause from the ex, then... \u2018did he used to be really fat or something?\u2019\u201d Too good. Nothing but net. Ben Mimmack is currently flying over Greenland and pondering. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about the reaction to Steve Smith\u2019s century on day 1. All I\u2019ve seen in the press is universal condemnation of the people who booed it. I would have applauded myself because it was such a special innings, but when all\u2019s said and done, he blatantly cheated to try and win a match. How is the reaction of the crowd on Thursday different to those swimmers who refused to share a podium with Sun Yang? Reactions that were pretty favourably reported on from what I saw and the parallels seem pretty close to me.\u201d I respectfully disagree with your comparison but I\u2019ll leave this be. \u201cAfter yet another failure for Bairstow and Ali,\u201d notes Joe Cross. \u201cI\u2019m reminded of my view when the side was selected that their places shouldn\u2019t be considered secure. May seem harsh but after the Ireland debacle I would have dropped both for this one. Would we really have been worse off with Foakes and Leach? Or Curran and Leach? The latter especially with Anderson\u2019s fitness concern in mind.\u201d Remember that Moeen\u2019s main job (at the moment) is what he does later today. But yes, this is far from a settled side. Lunchtime emails. Shall we do a few? \u201cThank you to the OBO team for helping me through yesterday,\u201d says Richard Exworthy. \u201cThanks also to Aneurin Bevan (Labour\u2019s Minister for Health,1945-51) and the wonderful, amazing, stupendously brilliant staff at the Heath Hospital in Cardiff for removing my kidney stones, a procedure which basically involved passing a camera, a laser and a collection basket, up what the surgeon euphemistically referred to as my \u2018water pipe\u2019.\u201d Blimey! I\u2019m glad we were able to see you through that. I had to go to hospital yesterday as well and, goodness me, I love the NHS. I\u2019m not sick or anything like that, before you ask! \u201cThe first Test series I got in to was England v Pakistan in 2006,\u201d says Zoe Belk. \u201cRadio coverage of cricket had only recently arrived in Canada via the BBC online, and TV coverage was non-existent. Actually, I\u2019m not sure much has changed. Along with giving me a somewhat skewed view of the high drama that cricket offers, it meant that, when I moved to London five years later, I was completely unable to tell a yorker from a googly or third man from a slip. The shame!\u201d Love this stuff. I often wonder whether I would have found cricket I was brought up in a country where it isn\u2019t traditional? Hope so. \u201cMy Venezuelan girlfriend asked if \u201cthe Australians were, still there (ie England)?\u201d says Tom Morgan. \u201cThe concept of five-day matches and six-week series eludes her. When I explained the, Ozzies would be in UK from may to September just for cricket she malfunctioned. Funny game.\u201d Tell her about the nine-month tours of the old days! What an entertaining session. Australia picked up four of the six wickets they required to end this England innings, giving up just 61 runs along the way. Tim Paine will definitely be happy with that. Granted, they had the chance to roll through them before the break when taking three wickets in four balls via Nathan Lyon then Pete Siddle, but they now eat knowing that the deficit should be manageable. For England\u2019s part, they\u2019ve missed an opportunity but now have two players capable of really frustrating Australia. Who would want to be doing anything other than following this Test Match? I\u2019m going to take a break and grab a bite to eat. Back soon! 115th over: England 328-8 (Woakes 13, Broad 11) Last over before lunch, to be bowled by Lyon. Just block it out, right? Naaah! Chris Woakes goes BIG with a heeeeave over midwicket, timing the pants off it over the rope for SIX. As you do. He does the conventional thing for the rest of the over, keeping Lyon out when on his stumps and getting his blade and gloves out of the way when he was slightly outside his off-stump. Lunch it is! What a fascinating two hours that turned out to be. These two have put on 28 and the lead is 44. 114th over: England 322-8 (Woakes 7, Broad 11) The lead moves to 38 with two singles off Siddle, Broad picking one up past point and Woakes a single off his inside edge. Frustrating for Siddle. I\u2019m asked what consitutes a \u201chandy lead\u201d by Graeme Burton. I don\u2019t think they are quite there yet but these two have stopped the collapse and just about got them to lunch. That\u2019ll do as a start. 113th over: England 320-8 (Woakes 6, Broad 10) Broad sweeps Lyon again; it\u2019s working for him. Woakes also scores through midwicket to the sweeper - good batting. Oh yes, thanks for the emails saying that I had Woakes\u2019 score wrong - it happens. All fixed now. Extras to finish! Four of them, of the byes variety, when Woakes is beaten close to his woodwork and Paine doesn\u2019t get to it. He\u2019ll hate that. \u201cHello.\u201d Hi Orlando Ames-Lewis. \u201cMy uncle Phil was at Lord\u2019s for England\u2019s victorious World Cup final in July. As England\u2019s front row coach in 2003 he celebrated on the pitch in Sydney after England won the Rugby World Cup in another epic final. And as a 22 year old he was at Wembley in 1966 when Bobby Moore lifted the Football WC. Was anyone else at all three?\u201d Blimey. Can I interview him, please? \u201cSame old problem with England,\u201d writes Joe Cross. \u201cOnce you\u2019re through our rock solid top order the middle just melts away.\u201d Droll. On that topic from Kevin Wilson: \u201cI\u2019m far more disappointed in Bairstow than Mo. Mo\u2019s wicket was a misjudgement by a guy out of form when the offie is spinning it miles. Bairstow\u2019s shot was incredibly irresponsible as the last real batsman. What\u2019s Ben Foakes\u2019s form like?\u201d A question that needs asking, for mine. Let Bairstow bat. Let Buttler bat. Let Foakes keep. Not rocket science. \u201cWhy do we hate Stuart Broad so much again?\u201d asks Ben Mostyn in Australia. I don\u2019t think we actually do? It was definitely a thing for about five minutes in 2013, but I don\u2019t think so anymore. Right? 112th over: England 313-8 (Woakes 5, Broad 8) It\u2019s Siddle replacing Cummins rather than Pattinson. Once again, he starts a spell with a maiden, keeping Woakes in defence throughout. Oh, as I type that he tries to crash the final ball to the rope at cover - a nice stroke - but it is stopped well by Bancroft in the covers moving to his right. 111th over: England 313-8 (Woakes 5, Broad 8) Broad again sweeps Lyon to get off strike first up. Woakes is beaten on the inside edge, the ball lobbing to slip. The appeal is turned down, there\u2019s no edge. Broad has a couple of balls to handle to finish off and he does well. 13 minutes until lunch, which will be extended if Australia take another wicket between now and then. An OBOers nightmare. 110th over: England 311-8 (Woakes 4, Broad 7) Woakes then Broad score off Cummins behind square, using the pace pretty well. Might we see Pattinson back from our pavilion end next over? Peter Cave has some intel on the bails debate: \u201cTo my mind, the problem with the argument that the laws re bails should be changed to reflect the availability of technology is that the laws have to be applicable for cricket at all levels. In village cricket etc, the kind of technology you have at international level isn\u2019t available. This is a point about the laws that John Holder made in his TMS Ask the Umpire slot yesterday.\u201d I\u2019ll have a listen. Thanks. Hugh Maguire is on my team, by the looks. \u201cI quite like the potential for freakery that is a bails jostle not out. But the frequency is getting a bit much. And the recent lack of stump cartwheeling when a fast bowler hits the stumps makes me think the issue is not the bails, rather overly robust stumps. Could we not fiddle with the laws, but just make sure the stumps are not set in concrete as it seems they now are?\u201d Just use snicko, right? Keep the bails for run outs. \u201cIn response to Dave Adams question about not understanding a key rule,\u201d writes Habib Butt, \u201cback in 1990 when I first started following cricket as an eleven year old I thought the follow on was giving a side three innings in a match, I was baffled why any team would want to enforce the follow on.\u201d Outstanding. That\u2019s tough to top. 109th over: England 307-8 (Woakes 3, Broad 4) Lyon finds Woakes\u2019 inside edge! But instead of going to short leg it ends up around the corner where there now isn\u2019t a leg gully. I\u2019d have three men catching there with the spin he is generating at the moment. Between overs, Athers on the telly shows how Lyon\u2019s seam position was different for the Burns and Moeen Ali dismissals. \u201cDeliberate or not?\u201d he asks. If we get to talk to him tonight at stumps, I\u2019ll ask him. A giant Trump inflatable balloon is floating in the Hollies Stand. Gower jumps in, doing a Trump voice: \u201cFake news!\u201d Words I didn\u2019t expect to type. Broad swept Lyon for three earlier in the over, I should add. 108th over: England 303-8 (Woakes 2, Broad 1) Pat Cummins is back to replace Siddle, which can only mean one thing. Yep, here\u2019s the bouncer - Woakes nearly making a complete meal of it; he wasn\u2019t keen at all. Understandbly so. He shares a laugh with Cummins, or at least that\u2019s what it looks like from where I\u2019m sitting. But he gets to the other end of the interrogation with his wicket in tact. \u201cI read that ECB was telecasting the Ashes live in the continent,\u201d emails Anand Kumar. \u201cIs that true? Anyone out there who can help a cricket fan with world cup withdrawal and need for live cricket?\u201d Ian Forth has a counterview in reply to my point about a boring Test: \u201cMelbourne 2017 was mint. It\u2019s the only test England haven\u2019t lost in Australia for the last 8 years, Cook got on the honours bar board and even Broad got a score. Also, my son got a nosebleed and the first aid staff were very nice to him. Fond memories.\u201d Mac Millings too, in reference to Paris Bob\u2019s point: \u201cWhat kind of terrifying town does he live in, that *all* the other knee-injury patients are \u201cjoyriders and kneecapping victims\u201d? How does a joyrider injure his or her knees, anyway? Bob said it was a childhood memory - so was he a childhood knecapping viictim or a junior carjacker And how did he, a kid in a room of (presumably) adult criminals, get to be in charge of the remote? Was *he* the one who kecapped the other patients?\u201d Bob, this is going to be a fun reply from you, isn\u2019t it? 107th over: England 301-8 (Woakes 1, Broad 0) Lyon is ripping them at Woakes from wide of the crease looking for an inside edge with two catchers in on the leg side but the Brummy Botham is up to the task, getting off the mark with one down the ground. Broad then keeps out the couple of deliveries he has to deal with. On lighter matters... \u201cRe lunchtime/teatime nourishment,\u201d writes John Starbuck, \u201cStuart Broad once confided that the quicker bowlers have fortified milkshakes and not much else. It probably doesn\u2019t make them full of cheese.\u201d I\u2019d insist on a Maccas thickshake. 106th over: England 300-8 (Woakes 0, Broad 0) From such a strong position, England now have two men in the middle yet to face a delivery. We spent so much time last night talking about how small England\u2019s lead would need to be for Australia to feel right back in the game. Well, that number is currently 16. With the visitors bowling last and England without Anderson later today (more than likely) this becomes a massive half an hour or so before lunch. Catching practice! England needed Bairstow but instead, he\u2019s steered a catch from too close to his body straight into the hands of Warner at first slip. Australia have taken three wickets in 11 balls. Moeen bowled off-stump shouldering arms! Two wickets in the over! We have ourselves a proper Test Match here. He can\u2019t believe it; Lyon has done him with his straight ball from around the wicket. That\u2019s such clever bowling from the Australian twirler. 105th over: England 300-7 (Bairstow 8) The end of a massive hand, Burns removed by Lyon after 312 balls at the crease. It\u2019s a classic off-spinners\u2019 wicket, turning away from the left-hander from around the wicket, the edge taken safely by Paine. Burns stops at the rope as they check for the no-ball (he wasn\u2019t far away from it!), but the third ump confirms that he has to go. Played. 104th over: England 296-5 (Burns 133, Bairstow 8) Bairstow clips Siddle behind square for a couple and is kept honest for the rest by the Australian first change. Drying it up, drying it up. That\u2019s his job. Michael Robinson has a potential solution for the numbers issue that might keep the purists happy: listing them 1-11. Don Wilson is happy that the Sky TV commentators have ditched the ties this summer. \u201cRegarding numbers on shirts,\u201d emails Tobias Peggs. \u201cI was high up in the stands for the first two days with my English father and Aussie father-in-law, and it certainly made identifying players easier - especially from the other teams, where you might not be so familiar with a particular gait or a nervous tick that marks a player out from distance. In a group where we wanted to talk about players both sides, it was super helpful. My only question is the apparently random number selection. Root 66, Jimmy pretending he\u2019s a striker for Burnley (number 9) and all that. Any other players have good back stories for their numbers?\u201d Shane Warne made a very big deal of the 23 back in 1994 when Australia first moved to the numbers. Indeed, he has a bar in the casino in Melbourne named after it. 103rd over: England 293-5 (Burns 132, Bairstow 6) Lyon is getting plenty of turn and even more bounce. In response, Bairstow is getting across his stumps before leaving, which is bold but effective - for now. \u201cIt is an obvious plan isn\u2019t it,\u201d says Isa Guha on the telly. 102nd over: England 293-5 (Burns 132, Bairstow 6) Shot! Rory Burns leans into a lovely cover drive off Peter Siddle, out to the rope in front of the Hollies Stand. He played and missed to begin the over, but as Sangakarra said earlier today, the best part of Burns\u2019 innings has been his ability to put those moments behind him. DRINKS! Time to quickly get through some of your emails... \u201cI am one of those people that, of a Saturday, are unable to follow the cricket EXCEPT via the hinderwebz,\u201d writes Mark Slater in Cornwall. \u201cBeing at work with no radio within this Sceptical Isles. Keep up the good work and greetings from Ye Ende of Ye World.\u201d Thanks for being with us, Mark. \u201cMorning Adam.\u201d Hi, Dave Adams. \u201cTo my surprise and delight, my nine year old has been avidly watching this match. Aside from bemoaning the slow scoring (he watched the World Cup Final), he\u2019s been constantly asking questions about the game. Again, explaining the laws and customs of the sport we all love is also a joy. It took my mind back, though, to when I first got into cricket. My first series watching was the 1989 Ashes and I had no parent around to ask all the questions of. As a result, whenever I saw an unsuccessful lbw appeal and heard the commentators say that it was \u2018worth a shout\u2019, I assumed that an extra run was awarded to the batting side. I have no idea when or how I discovered the truth. Have any other OBO readers been similarly unaware of a key rule of the game?\u201d The cricketing equivalent of Hold Me Closer Tony Danza! Great news about your kid. Everything crossed that the World Cup has the desired effect and the game can finally find a younger audience. \u201cJust settling down for a solid day doing nothing but watching, listening to, and reading about The Ashes.\u201d Lovely stuff, Kim Thonger. \u201cBut the two hours prior to this morning\u2019s first ball were spent pressure washing and manicuring the garden at the instruction of my wife, (or the senior umpire as I romantically refer to her), so I understand a little of what the ground staff go through every morning before the paying punters arrive and I think we should give them a round of hearty applause.\u201d They are certainly under more public scrutiny than ever before. In Australia, we now get a full-on press conferene with the curator before every Test Match. I feel for the new bloke at Lord\u2019s. Tim Sattertwaite isn\u2019t that worried about numbers on shirts but he sure doesn\u2019t like the advertsing on the stumps. I\u2019m more frustrated about the bails debate, but that\u2019s for another time. In short, we have the technology to know if the ball hit, let\u2019s use it! Another time. 101st over: England 289-5 (Burns 128, Bairstow 6) Lyon replaces Pattinson and turns is square at Burns who is lucky to miss it. Later, Bairstow has a couple to look at and is straight onto the front foot looking to score. Oh, England are now in the lead, by the way. I missed that a couple of overs ago. This is such an important period for the hosts with Lyon getting the chance to bowl last on this track. Alex Hargreaves writes me to report that he was trying to bring sandpaper into the ground today but it was confiscated on the way in by the stewards. He isn\u2019t pleased. \u201cIf we aren\u2019t allowed to mock the Aussies what is the point?\u201d I\u2019ll take that as a comment. 100th over: England 288-5 (Burns 127, Bairstow 6) Peter Siddle, welcome to the attack. And guess what? It\u2019s a maiden. A maiden where he nearly castles Bairstow when shouldering arms. A maiden where he finds Bairstow\u2019s inside edge. A maiden where he beats Bairstow\u2019s outside edge with a beauty. Superb bowling. 99th over: England 288-5 (Burns 127, Bairstow 6) A rapid bumper to begin! Pattinson nearly hits Bairstow on the lid, collecting his arm on the way through. It prompts the ground staff to come out to hammer the pitch where the footmarks are for the bowler - not sure if the two events are linked, but we lose a couple of minutes. Bairstow deals with the first ball back very nicely, clipping four to midwicket with lovely timing. That\u2019ll feel good. But in keeping of the theme of the morning, Pattinson bounces straight back to find the outside edge, falling a couple of metres short of Smith at second slip. Plenty going on out there at the moment. Fantastic Test Match cricket. \u201cI was about to write to you of what a cracking game this is when I realised that\u2019s all I ever do,\u201d writes Bob Wilson, who I owe a proper email to. \u201cAll Test matches are cracking. Have I ever seen a bad one? I eat up a snore-draw with four days of rain or two struggling minnows battling it out ineptly for the reputational wooden spoon. Can there be a truly bad Test? (That said, I have a dark childhood memory of knee-operation hospitalization, watching Sunny Gavaskar giving it the Existential short-handle for a three day double ton while every joyrider and kneecapping victim in the beds beside me sledged me for my viewing preferences - ah, good times).\u201d They\u2019re only bad when the tracks are trash. Thinking, for instance, Melbourne 2017. But yes - I truly love it. Especially days like this. 98th over: England 283-5 (Burns 127, Bairstow 1) Bairstow had a full day in the viewing room yesterday - I saw him on the treadmill last night at stumps doing his thing. Of course, he\u2019s coming off a pair at Lord\u2019s last week. Cummins is attacking the line of his body from the get-go, whacking him high on the pad with an off-cutter. He\u2019s off the duck from the final ball of the successful over with one to cover. Pat Cummins finds the edge and makes the BIG breakthrough! Stokes tried to flay the quick through point from the crease but it bounced a tad more than he thought, getting a tiny edge through to Paine. They really, really needed that. Cummins rewarded for a fine spell. 97th over: England 282-4 (Burns 127, Stokes 50) Burns deflects one off the back foot behind point for one giving the strike back to Stokes, who pushes a single to mid-off to raise a classy half-century. 95 balls to reach the mark with eight boundaries along the way. The feel of the game changed completely when he walked out yesterday. 96th over: England 280-4 (Burns 126, Stokes 49) Stokes gets four more but off the edge this time through about fourth slip. Cummins is drying it up nicely at his end, allowing Pattinson to attack. 95th over: England 275-4 (Burns 125, Stokes 45) Shot! Stokes crushes a glorious straight drive to the rope off Pattinton to begin his new over. Sure enough, the big quick responds with a good\u2019un, beating the edge for about sixth time already in this spell. The all-rounder defends the rest carefully. Great contest between these two. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d Hi @AndyinBrum on the tweet machine. \u201cWas in Birmingham centre this morning, respect to the England fans on the 8:30 bus who were well on their way through a six pack of Stella. Guessing they\u2019ll be asleep by lunch.\u201d Barney Ronay noted on twitter this morning that fans were getting their breakfast beers in at 8am where he is staying. I really can\u2019t judge and I won\u2019t. But I do wonder the extent to which the Saturday drink-a-thon is becoming a little bit of an issue at England Tests? 94th over: England 271-4 (Burns 125, Stokes 41) Cummins to Burns, who defends and leaves well before flashing; his outside edge beaten. How often did we see that pattern yesterday? But he\u2019s still there. The Australian quicks have to stay patient here. Maiden. \u201cWhy do they have those ridiculous numbers and names on the back of their shirts?\u201d asks Brendan Bolton from Lennox Head. \u201cWhat is the actual point? Apart from just more gimmicky shite?\u201d This is the sort of email I am going to put in then get 74 punchy replies, isn\u2019t it? Let\u2019s break it down. Why? Because they decided to try something new with the World Test Championship. The ICC\u2019s logic is that making it easier to identify the players is worthwhile. The counterview boils down to why does it need to be easier? Isn\u2019t the status quo fine? I\u2019m on the fence. Tried to write a column about it but I realised that I don\u2019t have a strong view. Boring, boring Adam. 93rd over: England 271-4 (Burns 125, Stokes 41) Stokes is driving hard again into the off side but can\u2019t beat mid-off. He does get runs on the pull shot though, climbing into a shorter Pattinson delivery and grabbing a couple to Trav Head fielding in front of the Hollies. What a job that is on a Saturday. Speaking of boozey Saturdays... \u201cReporting from deepest Jutland in Denmark whilst preparing for a gin tasting,\u201d says John Bruce. Have that! \u201cI don\u2019t know what was more nerve racking, Rory Burns anticipated maiden test ton or the imminent arrival of some seriously thirsty Danish gin fans. Thank the dear lord that all ended well and Mothers ruin didn\u2019t get the better of me. Congrats to Rory and I shall raise a big fish bowl glass of gin today.. Fantastic, witty and detailed OBO reporting.\u201d Thank you, John. Have a skinful for me. To finish the over, Pattinson beats Stokes and is up for caught behind because he heard a noise. But it is bat on ground. Good decision from Tim Paine not to send it upstairs with one referral left. 92nd over: England 269-4 (Burns 125, Stokes 39) Stokes gets the first run from the bat on day three, driving Cummins to cover - well slowed down by Bancroft. They take one. Burns deals with the rest. \u201cCan you please enlighten me as to what the players have to eat during the lunch break of a Test?\u201d asks Phil Murnane. \u201cAre they all finely tuned specimens with strict dietary and macronutrient needs, or is it a case of Jammy Dodgers and Jaffa Cakes all round?\u201d They get a proper feed, as I understand it. But the bowlers have their intake measured through the day - especially when it is hot. Tim Murtagh spoke last week of the double desserts at Lord\u2019s. Old school. 91st over: England 268-4 (Burns 125, Stokes 38) Pattinson wins an early false stroke from Stokes, who chases a ball he should have left, beating his outside edge by quite a distance. WHOA, the next delivery has gone to first slip! I don\u2019t think that was the pitch either, it has just swung a MILE. They take a bye. Burns\u2019 turn, and he is beaten first ball of his morning too. Gorgeous delivery. \u201cThis is the life of a batsman in England,\u201d observes Kumar Sangakkara on TV. \u201cYou will play and miss a lot. You need to put it behind you.\u201d The players are on the field! Well, one team at least. That\u2019s quite unusual: Australia are set and in their positions for a good minute before Burns and Stokes leave the dressing room and make their way to the middle. But they\u2019re there now. James Pattinson has the ball in his hand, he will be starting the day from the City End. Stokes (38) is facing the first delivery, Burns (125) up the other end. PLAY! Before we get going, Barney on Rory last night. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d Morning, Paul Baalham. \u201cWhen was the last time an English batsman batted for three consecutive days in the *same* innings in a Test Match?\u201d It has to be Cookie. Maybe his double ton in India? Or the UAE? \u201cEngland to get to 420 as Stokes goes nuts,\u201d says Dean Bainbridge in Cardiff. (More like blaaaaze 420, ayyy. Sorry, I can\u2019t help myself) Dean continues with his prediction: \u201cBroad rips through the Aussie top order, Moeen wipes up the tail &amp; England win by an innings with a day to spare. Sorry, Sunday ticket holders.\u201d As a freelancer, curse you for saying such a heinous thing! The push for four-day Tests might be strong, but I want them to go TIMELESS. \u201cI notice on Sky that Sir Ian\u2019s wearing the same shirt as yesterday,\u201d observes Simon Richards. \u201cMust\u2019ve been a good night in Birmingham!\u201d It was loose on Broad Street last night, I can tell you that much. Cricket punters from both nations mixed with the usual, predicably wild, Friday night crew. And yes, I stayed out of the Walkabout. \u201cGood morning, Adam.\u201d G\u2019day, Geoff Wignall. \u201cI\u2019d be interested to know what single thing others would most like to occur today. My choice would be for Modern to find some form and make a decent (60+) score; simply because it would make the world a better and happier place. Except perhaps for Australian fans and I can live with that.\u201d Moeen\u2019s role is crucial later today - with the ball. Given that Anderson surely won\u2019t actually bowl, they need to set-and-forget with him from the City End and rotate the quicks. He can\u2019t afford to have a bad day. But yes, runs first. He needs those quite a lot. Today\u2019s global TMS link. For overseas listeners only. If you\u2019re in the UK, grab their coverage in the usual BBC places. Here it is, with thanks to Peter Haining for sending it through. Jimmy Anderson update. From the England camp: he will bat if required and do some running before play today. They will \u201ctake a view later\u201d on whether he will bowl in Australia\u2019s second innings. Clears throat for a necessary clich\u00e9. Big first hour, innit? Isn\u2019t it ever. The sun has successfully burned through the morning cloud cover here at Birmingham and we\u2019re in for what will probably be the day that defines the outcome of this First Ashes Test of 2019. What a lovely way to spend a Saturday? Welcome to you all. In 45 minutes from now we will pick up the action with Rory Burns and Ben Stokes some 17 runs away from banking a first innings lead, the former having batted through the duration of day two for his maiden Test ton. It wasn\u2019t pretty but do you think he cares? This isn\u2019t a beauty pageant. Stokes can do the pretty for both of them. The all-rounder was the most assured man at Edgbaston yesterday. Walking in at the moment Australia were threatening to ruin the afternoon for Joe Root and co, he picked up where he left off at Lord\u2019s a few weekends ago. If he can bat for a couple of hours this morning, Tim Paine\u2019s men are in a lot of trouble. To their credit, despite only taking four wickets yesterday, the Australian bowlers did very little wrong. Epecially James Pattinson, who was outstanding in his first Test since February 2016, and Pete Siddle landed it in a shoebox all day. Pat Cummims bounced back well late in the day and Nathan Lyon was Nathan Lyon. They will bowl a lot worse and bowl teams out. That\u2019s their job today: ripping through England\u2019s lower order and keeping the deficit in check. Righto, I\u2019ll leave it there for the time being as we make our way towards the first ball of morning three. Do drop me a line in the usual way, or ping me a tweet if that\u2019s more your style. This should be fun.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s turning into the greatest environmental challenge of our age \u2013 how do we transport celebrities safely and responsibly to global eco-summits, so that they can do a better job of lecturing the rest of us about carbon emissions?</p> <p>The world has been agog at <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7311015/Google-splashes-20million-Italian-climate-change-party.html\" title=\"\">Camp Google</a>, the three-day mass gathering at the luxury Verdura resort in Sicily, of 300 or so celebrity environmental activists, including Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Leonardo DiCaprio, Bradley Cooper, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, Chris Martin and more \u2013 too many to list, even a rumoured (but unseen) Barack Obama. Not forgetting <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7309805/Backlash-barefoot-Prince-Harry-hypocrite-celebrities.html\" title=\"\">Prince Harry</a>, who reportedly gave a stirring speech about the environment \u2013 barefoot! A startling image springs to mind of a Google aide shrugging off the carbon footprint of Harry\u2019s journey (private jet and helicopter), but saying: \u201cUh, prince-dude, you need to lose the offensive shoes.\u201d</p> <p>Presumably the \u00a316.5m eco-knees-up was at least partly enabled by Google\u2019s ongoing tax avoidance, but let\u2019s not spoil a beautiful moment with facts and stuff. A total of 114 private jets ferried the celebrities to Italy, releasing hundreds of tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. As they arrived in Sicily, they transferred to Camp Google in luxury vehicles and/or helicopters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e230c6b97900b50ab4beb175b6b1a5da52a503b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e230c6b97900b50ab4beb175b6b1a5da52a503b2/570_158_2384_1430/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katy Perry was one of 300 guests at Camp Google.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Kropa/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There followed what must surely have been intellectually invigorating A-list debates about how \u201cwe\u201d (they mean us, not them) must conserve the Earth\u2019s resources. After that, the celebrity activists retired to relax in their gratis \u00a3730-a-night-plus rooms, perchance haunted by the spectres of global eco-catastrophe and Coldplay agreeing to perform. Perhaps, like me, you\u2019re thinking: \u201cIf only self-awareness could be solar-powered\u201d? I mean, did anyone at Google realise how all this starry eco-activism might look to the outside world? The tiny disconnect between what Google and its guests were saying and what they were doing? Apparently not.</p> <p>However, and this is a serious question: how do people expect eco-celebs to get around? When they lend support, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/06/emma-thompson-extinction-rebellion-hypocrisy\" title=\"\">Emma Thompson</a> did for the recent Extinction Rebellion rally in London, they risk being roasted under the hot sun of public and media condemnation. Is this fair \u2013 presumably the publicity a celebrity generates justifies the carbon? Should the famous stick to local events and videolinks or just not bother? It\u2019s not as if Harry could have micro-scooted to Sicily or descended in a hot-air balloon, like a woke, royal Phileas Fogg.</p> <p>Not that this excuses the gargantuan excess and repellent insincerity of Camp Google. (Note to Silicon Valley: if you want to throw grotesquely smug A-list beanos, spare us the ghastly faux-worthiness.)</p> <p>However, it\u2019s worth asking if mocking the motivations-cum-emissions of eco-celebs is fast turning into a socially acceptable bloodsport. While A-list hypocrisy is always great fun, our own isn\u2019t entirely without its amusements.</p> <h2>Damn right I\u2019m steamed up about this \u2018beauty spa\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b5ff0215bc8c496945e3bd533777f28f9c55aa2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b5ff0215bc8c496945e3bd533777f28f9c55aa2/0_170_5089_3054/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gwyneth Paltrow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wot?

Treatments could include vaginal steaming (I\u2019ve always presumed this must be akin to crouching knickerless over a steaming kettle, but even better); \u201cV-tightening\u201d with a laser (a fun day out for all the family); and a mysterious herb-infused vagina \u201cfacial\u201d. They do realise this isn\u2019t where a lady\u2019s face is, right?</p> <p>This is serious. Like labial surgery, popularised by pornography, it sends out the message that female genitals are unacceptable left alone and need to be prettified. That something very wrong is going on \u201cdown there\u201d and should be fretted about and attended to. Never mind that medical people point out that the vagina is self-cleaning and doesn\u2019t require such treatments. Also, that steaming might not only burn the vaginal walls, but alter the heathy balance of bacteria, leading to infections. Astonishing, isn\u2019t it? Who\u2019d have thought that going boil-in-the-bag with genitals would be a bad idea? Trust qualified gynaecologists to ruin a relaxing spa day.</p> <p>Another major alarm bell is that Gwyneth Paltrow appears to have no involvement in this company. Wasn\u2019t Paltrow one of the intrepid pioneers of steaming vaginas? Didn\u2019t she also champion inserting jade eggs until, again, some spoilsport gynaecologists said something about toxic shock syndrome and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-jade-eggs-vaginas-gynaecologist-doctor-jen-gunter-a7541301.html\" title=\"\">bacterial vaginosis</a>?</p> <p>Sorry, but I can\u2019t take anything in the arena of vagina maintenance seriously unless Gwynnie\u2019s face is attached.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s turning into the greatest environmental challenge of our age \u2013 how do we transport celebrities safely and responsibly to global eco-summits, so that they can do a better job of lecturing the rest of us about carbon emissions? The world has been agog at Camp Google, the three-day mass gathering at the luxury Verdura resort in Sicily, of 300 or so celebrity environmental activists, including Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Leonardo DiCaprio, Bradley Cooper, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, Chris Martin and more \u2013 too many to list, even a rumoured (but unseen) Barack Obama. Not forgetting Prince Harry, who reportedly gave a stirring speech about the environment \u2013 barefoot! A startling image springs to mind of a Google aide shrugging off the carbon footprint of Harry\u2019s journey (private jet and helicopter), but saying: \u201cUh, prince-dude, you need to lose the offensive shoes.\u201d Presumably the \u00a316.5m eco-knees-up was at least partly enabled by Google\u2019s ongoing tax avoidance, but let\u2019s not spoil a beautiful moment with facts and stuff. A total of 114 private jets ferried the celebrities to Italy, releasing hundreds of tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. As they arrived in Sicily, they transferred to Camp Google in luxury vehicles and/or helicopters. There followed what must surely have been intellectually invigorating A-list debates about how \u201cwe\u201d (they mean us, not them) must conserve the Earth\u2019s resources. After that, the celebrity activists retired to relax in their gratis \u00a3730-a-night-plus rooms, perchance haunted by the spectres of global eco-catastrophe and Coldplay agreeing to perform. Perhaps, like me, you\u2019re thinking: \u201cIf only self-awareness could be solar-powered\u201d? I mean, did anyone at Google realise how all this starry eco-activism might look to the outside world? The tiny disconnect between what Google and its guests were saying and what they were doing? Apparently not. However, and this is a serious question: how do people expect eco-celebs to get around? When they lend support, as Emma Thompson did for the recent Extinction Rebellion rally in London, they risk being roasted under the hot sun of public and media condemnation. Is this fair \u2013 presumably the publicity a celebrity generates justifies the carbon? Should the famous stick to local events and videolinks or just not bother? It\u2019s not as if Harry could have micro-scooted to Sicily or descended in a hot-air balloon, like a woke, royal Phileas Fogg. Not that this excuses the gargantuan excess and repellent insincerity of Camp Google. (Note to Silicon Valley: if you want to throw grotesquely smug A-list beanos, spare us the ghastly faux-worthiness.) However, it\u2019s worth asking if mocking the motivations-cum-emissions of eco-celebs is fast turning into a socially acceptable bloodsport. While A-list hypocrisy is always great fun, our own isn\u2019t entirely without its amusements. Damn right I\u2019m steamed up about this \u2018beauty spa\u2019 British women with hideous, unsightly vaginas, rejoice \u2013 help is at hand! New York company VSPOT plans to open a \u201cvaginal spa\u201d in London\u2019s Knightsbridge this autumn. Treatments could include vaginal steaming (I\u2019ve always presumed this must be akin to crouching knickerless over a steaming kettle, but even better); \u201cV-tightening\u201d with a laser (a fun day out for all the family); and a mysterious herb-infused vagina \u201cfacial\u201d. They do realise this isn\u2019t where a lady\u2019s face is, right? This is serious. Like labial surgery, popularised by pornography, it sends out the message that female genitals are unacceptable left alone and need to be prettified. That something very wrong is going on \u201cdown there\u201d and should be fretted about and attended to. Never mind that medical people point out that the vagina is self-cleaning and doesn\u2019t require such treatments. Also, that steaming might not only burn the vaginal walls, but alter the heathy balance of bacteria, leading to infections. Astonishing, isn\u2019t it? Who\u2019d have thought that going boil-in-the-bag with genitals would be a bad idea? Trust qualified gynaecologists to ruin a relaxing spa day. Another major alarm bell is that Gwyneth Paltrow appears to have no involvement in this company. Wasn\u2019t Paltrow one of the intrepid pioneers of steaming vaginas? Didn\u2019t she also champion inserting jade eggs until, again, some spoilsport gynaecologists said something about toxic shock syndrome and bacterial vaginosis? Sorry, but I can\u2019t take anything in the arena of vagina maintenance seriously unless Gwynnie\u2019s face is attached. She is our queen of down-below quackery and female genitalia spruce-ups. She should be alerted that someone is trying to steal her vaginal thunder. In the meantime, I\u2019ll continue to feel thrilled that women are being encouraged to worry about the actual insides of their bodies. Next week: women, are you satisfied with the shape of your kidneys? This iron age woman seems strangely familiar... Not to get all \u201cjudgey\u201d on iron age women, but at least one was a lazy, sweet-munching fashion victim, say Swiss archaeologists. They discovered a hollowed-out, tree-trunk coffin in the Aussersihl district in Zurich bearing the body of a well-to-do Celtic woman, wearing fine clothes and jewellery, with indications that she had a sweet tooth and did little physical work. Could this be an ancestor of mine? There are eerie similarities, if you take away the upper-class bling, replace sweet with savoury and add \u201cevidence\u201d of entire weekends sprawled on the sofa watching boxsets of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race All Stars, with no movement visible to the naked eye. How did they get all this information from a 2,200-year-old corpse? And surely she could not have imagined that, in a couple of millennia, the world would be raising a censorious eyebrow over her amber necklaces and sweet-toothed indolence. Perhaps the trend will catch on and henceforth people will be buried judgmentally with their consumer detritus \u2013 mobile phones, KFC buckets and Amazon vouchers. \u201cIt\u2019s what she would have wanted \u2013 I mean, seriously, she really did want that Accessorize bracelet.\u201d Modern people are criticised for sedentary, over-indulgent lifestyles, but it would appear we are merely following tradition. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 August 2019 to omit a reference to Bono being at the Google event.

      "body": "<p>Like an enraged bull charging a matador, the British right is putting its head down and stampeding towards a no-deal Brexit. It has to keep moving. Were it to stop and consider where it was heading, it would never take the risks it is taking with Britain\u2019s future.</p> <p>The left fails so often because it thinks it is enough to hate Conservatives and say they are wicked, rather than understand Conservatives and show them to be dangerous. I cannot emphasise strongly enough that on its own terms the right ought to know that a no-deal Brexit is an act of epic folly and that Boris Johnson\u2019s talk of a new golden age for merrie England is as much bullshit as bullish: the drivel of a man and a movement that have nothing but empty bravado to sustain them.</p> <p>If Tories meant what they said, they would not govern as they do. They believe that the civil service has failed the country. Yet they assure the public that same civil service can complete the most complicated operation Britain has attempted since D-Day. They believe that markets possess more knowledge than the state. Yet they ignore the warnings from the currency markets that Brexit could push us into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/jul/17/brexit-fears-pound-lows-uk-inflation-house-prices-business-live\" title=\"\">sterling crisis</a>. They deride the conformism of millennial snowflakes and the mindlessness of the Corbyn cult.

Thinkers in the Cummings style are performers who play to their audiences\u2019 prejudices. They cover the play-acting with a cloak of learned references so their listeners can pretend they are hearing something more substantial than pub talk.</p> <p>Cummings appeals to two Conservative prejudices: EU membership cripples Britain and the state bureaucracy is filled with incompetent time-servers. \u201cDuff people are promoted to the most senior roles and the thousands of able people leave,\u201d <a href=\"https://dominiccummings.com/2014/10/30/the-hollow-men-ii-some-reflections-on-westminster-and-whitehall-dysfunction/\" title=\"\">Cummings says of Whitehall</a>. Although many find it possible to damn Brussels in one breath and the public sector in the next \u2013 indeed, if you add the damning of immigration, you have the sum of what passes for conversation in Tory circles \u2013 it is impossible for a serious man or woman to hold both beliefs simultaneously.</p> <p>Brexit must lead to an explosion of investment in and reliance on the Whitehall bureaucrats the right despises as time-wasters. The Institute of Government <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/preparing-brexit-no-deal\" title=\"\">reports</a> that at least 16,000 officials will be working on Brexit by the autumn and numbers are likely to rise after no deal. Whitehall will have to impose direct rule on Northern Ireland as the dilettantes of the right unravel the Irish peace process. A long-term shift towards corporatism seems to me to be inevitable. The answer to the question: \u201cSo what should we do?\u201d can only be to increase the power of the state to help struggling businesses, manage the tensions in the union and strike a trade deal with the EU that will be far harder to negotiate once we are pleading for help from the outside.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is not the time to recruit and train staff if the British bull is to crash into the Halloween deadline</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As it is, Tories who once said there was no magic money tree behave as if they have discovered an enchanted forest where notes flutter down to the state\u2019s coffers like autumn leaves. For propaganda purposes, they are conning the country that the hundreds of millions they are spending on no-deal preparations are an emergency measure. They pretend Brexit is like a freak storm. If we are prepared, we can \u201cget through it\u201d and then stride on to the bright Johnsonian uplands. It\u2019s not just that Conservatives and Faragists don\u2019t tell the public Brexit will trap Britain in a rolling crisis that will continue well into the 2020s \u2013 and that the harder the Brexit is the deeper the crisis will be. It\u2019s that, as the chair of the public accounts committee <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/parliaments-spending-watchdog-to-probe-boris-johnsons-brexit-cash-splurge-with-92-days-until-uk-a4202181.html\" title=\"\">said</a>, the spending splurge is all for show. There is not the time to recruit and train staff if the British bull is to crash into the Halloween deadline.</p> <p>The pieces Cummings wrote between working for Michael Gove, running the Vote Leave campaign and going to Downing Street are peppered with references to every authority from Homer to Einstein. The displays of erudition conceal the contradictions in his thought. For <a href=\"https://dominiccummings.com/2014/10/30/the-hollow-men-ii-some-reflections-on-westminster-and-whitehall-dysfunction/\" title=\"\">Cummings</a>, science and markets have mechanisms that governments lack, \u201cto build reliable knowledge\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Like an enraged bull charging a matador, the British right is putting its head down and stampeding towards a no-deal Brexit. It has to keep moving. Were it to stop and consider where it was heading, it would never take the risks it is taking with Britain\u2019s future. The left fails so often because it thinks it is enough to hate Conservatives and say they are wicked, rather than understand Conservatives and show them to be dangerous. I cannot emphasise strongly enough that on its own terms the right ought to know that a no-deal Brexit is an act of epic folly and that Boris Johnson\u2019s talk of a new golden age for merrie England is as much bullshit as bullish: the drivel of a man and a movement that have nothing but empty bravado to sustain them. If Tories meant what they said, they would not govern as they do. They believe that the civil service has failed the country. Yet they assure the public that same civil service can complete the most complicated operation Britain has attempted since D-Day. They believe that markets possess more knowledge than the state. Yet they ignore the warnings from the currency markets that Brexit could push us into a sterling crisis. They deride the conformism of millennial snowflakes and the mindlessness of the Corbyn cult. Yet they are the upholders of an ideology in which reasonable doubt has become as heretical as denying the divinity of Christ. Like Jordan Peterson or Noam Chomsky, Dominic Cummings specialises in sweeping assertions that fall apart when you ask that simplest of questions: \u201cSo what should we do?\u201d You won\u2019t find coherent answers in the series of polemics he wrote before he joined Johnson in Downing Street. Thinkers in the Cummings style are performers who play to their audiences\u2019 prejudices. They cover the play-acting with a cloak of learned references so their listeners can pretend they are hearing something more substantial than pub talk. Cummings appeals to two Conservative prejudices: EU membership cripples Britain and the state bureaucracy is filled with incompetent time-servers. \u201cDuff people are promoted to the most senior roles and the thousands of able people leave,\u201d Cummings says of Whitehall. Although many find it possible to damn Brussels in one breath and the public sector in the next \u2013 indeed, if you add the damning of immigration, you have the sum of what passes for conversation in Tory circles \u2013 it is impossible for a serious man or woman to hold both beliefs simultaneously. Brexit must lead to an explosion of investment in and reliance on the Whitehall bureaucrats the right despises as time-wasters. The Institute of Government reports that at least 16,000 officials will be working on Brexit by the autumn and numbers are likely to rise after no deal. Whitehall will have to impose direct rule on Northern Ireland as the dilettantes of the right unravel the Irish peace process. A long-term shift towards corporatism seems to me to be inevitable. The answer to the question: \u201cSo what should we do?\u201d can only be to increase the power of the state to help struggling businesses, manage the tensions in the union and strike a trade deal with the EU that will be far harder to negotiate once we are pleading for help from the outside. As it is, Tories who once said there was no magic money tree behave as if they have discovered an enchanted forest where notes flutter down to the state\u2019s coffers like autumn leaves. For propaganda purposes, they are conning the country that the hundreds of millions they are spending on no-deal preparations are an emergency measure. They pretend Brexit is like a freak storm. If we are prepared, we can \u201cget through it\u201d and then stride on to the bright Johnsonian uplands. It\u2019s not just that Conservatives and Faragists don\u2019t tell the public Brexit will trap Britain in a rolling crisis that will continue well into the 2020s \u2013 and that the harder the Brexit is the deeper the crisis will be. It\u2019s that, as the chair of the public accounts committee said, the spending splurge is all for show. There is not the time to recruit and train staff if the British bull is to crash into the Halloween deadline. The pieces Cummings wrote between working for Michael Gove, running the Vote Leave campaign and going to Downing Street are peppered with references to every authority from Homer to Einstein. The displays of erudition conceal the contradictions in his thought. For Cummings, science and markets have mechanisms that governments lack, \u201cto build reliable knowledge\u201d. You cannot respect his intellectual integrity when he and the wider right have nothing to say to the overwhelming majority of British scientists who think Brexit is a national disaster and take no notice of the panicking markets. Cummings took TS Eliot\u2019s poem The Hollow Men as the title for his musings on the failures of Westminster and Whitehall. \u201cWe are the hollow men. We are the stuffed men. Leaning together. Headpiece filled with straw.\u201d Our hollow governing class \u201cruthlessly weeds out people who are dissenters\u201d, Cummings said as he implied that the radical right would allow freedom of speech. It\u2019s a joke and a sick joke at that. The right has forced out ambassador to the EU Sir Ivan Rogers and chief Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins for speaking truth to power. Johnson has built a cabinet of sycophants and helped push our ambassador to Washington to resign for offering his frank opinions.

I wanted to see more stories about awkward, nerdy black people, and black people who were the only ones in a particular space, and what it meant to navigate the many different kinds of identity construct.

      "bodyText": "Championship Neil Warnock\u2019s Cardiff returned to the division with a 3-2 defeat at Wigan. Joe Ralls\u2019 expert finish put the Bluebirds into a 20th minute lead before Wigan\u2019s Josh Windass missed a penalt. Undeterred, Wigan equalised and then took the lead after goals from Michael Jacobs and Windass. Omar Bogle equalised against his former club, but Lee Evans\u2019 whipped finish settled a hugely entertaining match. Fulham also came back to the Championship with a bump, losing 1-0 to Barnsley at Oakwell. QPR started their season in scintillating form while Stoke manager Nathan Jones will have worries about their performance in a 2-1 home defeat. Jordan Hugill scored an eighth-minute opener before Eberechi Eze\u2019s calm finish doubled the advantage. When Sam Clucas scored 12 minutes from time, a Stoke comeback looked on but never materialised. Newly-promoted Charlton\u2019s 2-1 win at Blackburn came via goals from Ben Purrington and Lyle Taylor, either side of an own goal from Dillon Phillips. Sheffield Wednesday had goalkeeper Keiren Westwood dismissed for clattering into Reading winger Mo Barrow, but escaped with a 3-1 away win. Their final goal, scored in injury time by Lucas Jo\u00e3o, came as Reading chased a second equaliser after Yakou M\u00e9\u00eft\u00e9 had earlier levelled Kadeem Harris\u2019s opener. Sam Hutchinson, scoring on his birthday, had headed Wednesday into the lead. Steve Cooper\u2019s reign as Swansea manager started with victory despite Hull\u2019s Kamil Grosicki scoring a third-minute goal. The match turned around after half-time when Borja Baston and Mike van der Hoorn got on the scoresheet. An 18th minute header by Birmingham\u2019s Kristian Pedersen from outside the box was enough to secure victory against Brentford, while Jed Wallace\u2019s 33rd minute goal meant Millwall beat Preston 1-0 at the Den. In the late game, Aro Muric endured a nightmare Nottingham Forest debut, with the goalkeeper at fault for both goals as they lost 2-1 at home to West Brom. League One While Bury\u2019s troubles prevented their game with MK Dons going ahead, this week\u2019s financial rescue allowed Bolton to play. They had six debutants in their starting XI at Wycombe, including James Weir, Preston loanee Josh Earl and Harry Brockbank, whose signings were announced after the starting team had been named at Adams Park. The visitors\u2019 unfamiliarity with each other was betrayed by Paul Smyth\u2019s 56th minute goal, which followed chaotic defending. Adebayo Akinfenwa set up Fred Onyedinma for Wycombe\u2019s second. Coventry\u2019s tenancy at Birmingham\u2019s ground, St Andrew\u2019s, opened with a 1-0 victory over Southend. Zain Westbrooke scored the winner in the 51st minute. Ipswich\u2019s first match in the third tier since 1957 began with a 1-0 win at Burton, courtesy of an 11th minute goal from Luke Garbutt, on loan from Everton. Promotion favourites Sunderland could not manage more than a 1-1 draw with Oxford, and required a Lynden Gooch penalty to level Tariqe Fosu\u2019s goal on debut for his new club. Rochdale surged into a 3-0 lead at Tranmere but had to hang on for their 3-2 win, a comeback halted by Aston Villa loanee Rushian Hepburn-Murphy\u2019s 90th-minute red card. League Two Leyton Orient fans paid tribute to the late Justin Edinburgh, the manager who led them to promotion last season, throughout their home game with Cheltenham. Josh Wright\u2019s 68th minute goal was celebrated with a shirt bearing Edinburgh\u2019s name. Cheltenham striker Luke Varney was dismissed for a second bookable offence soon after that and he was followed into the showers by Rohan Ince, red-carded for foul and abusive language. Salford City got life as an EFL club underway with an impressive 2-0 home defeat of Stevenage. Emmanuel Dieseruvwe got both goals in front of a crowd that included co-owner Paul Scholes, the first coming after a Scott Wiseman cross set up Dieseruvwe for a close-range finish. Forest Green\u2019s green zebra-print home kit, made from bamboo hemp, may well have dazzled Oldham into submission during their 1-0 defeat. Ryan Bowman\u2019s late goal earned victory for Exeter and denied last season\u2019s escapees, Macclesfield. Ryan Lowe\u2019s Plymouth sit top of the table after winning 3-0 at Crewe, while the only goalless game of the day came as Bradford fought out a stalemate with Cambridge.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me. It\u2019s been an action-packed opening day of the season \u2013 just 10 months to go! Bye! The football hasn\u2019t stopped: Will Unwin is your man for all Nottingham Forest/West Brom news: In fact only one just-promoted team has lost in the League this weekend, though two of them \u2013 Bury and MK Dons \u2013 had their game postponed. In League One Lincoln beat Accrington Stanley 2-0 but Tranmere went down 3-2 at home to Rochdale \u2013 they were 3-0 down in the 89th minute before threatening a ludicrous comeback; Rochdale scored with their only three shots on target. In League Two, Salford beat Stevenage and Leyton Orient beat Cheltenham. Momentum, innit? Meanwhile none of the three teams promoted from League One last season have lost \u2013 Luton drew with Middlesbrough last night, while Charlton and Barnsley earned excellent wins over Blackburn and Fulham today. Two of the three teams relegated from the Premier League last season made losing returns to life in the Championship, Fulham losing at Barnsley and Cardiff at Wigan. The third, Huddersfield, get their campaign under way at home to Derby on Monday. And the final scores in the Scottish Premiership: Celtic 7-0 St Johnstone Hibernian 1-0 St Mirren Livingston 0-0 Motherwell Ross County 3-0 Hamilton Today\u2019s final scores in the English Football League: Championship Barnsley 1-0 Fulham Blackburn 1-2 Charlton Brentford 0-1 Birmingham Millwall 1-0 Preston North End Reading 1-3 Sheff Wed Stoke 1-2 QPR Swansea 2-1 Hull Wigan 3-2 Cardiff League One AFC Wimbledon 1-2 Rotherham Blackpool 2-0 Bristol Rovers Burton Albion 0-1 Ipswich Coventry 1-0 Southend Doncaster 1-1 Gillingham Lincoln City 2-0 Accrington Stanley Peterborough 1-3 Fleetwood Town Shrewsbury 1-0 Portsmouth Sunderland 1-1 Oxford Utd Tranmere 2-3 Rochdale Wycombe 2-0 Bolton League Two Bradford 0-0 Cambridge Utd Carlisle 2-1 Crawley Town Colchester 1-1 Port Vale Crewe 0-3 Plymouth Exeter 1-0 Macclesfield Forest Green 1-0 Oldham Leyton Orient 1-0 Cheltenham Morecambe 0-2 Grimsby Newport County 2-2 Mansfield Northampton 0-1 Walsall Scunthorpe 0-2 Swindon Final score: Bradford 0-0 Cambridge Remarkable only for being the only goalless draw in the Football League this afternoon. GOAL! Reading 1-3 Sheffield Wednesday! Wednesday, a man down since their goalkeeper Kieren Westwood was sent off in the 80th minute, have wrapped up the win, Lucas Joao with a 97th-minute clincher! No penalty! Stoke insist they should have had a chance to equalise from the spot, but it\u2019s not to be! Performance of the day: Dundee United\u2019s Lawrence Shankland has had a home debut to remember: he scored all four goals in a 4-1 win (it hasn\u2019t finished, so there may yet be more goals, but Shankland has been substituted) over Inverness Caley Thistle! Final whistles are going across the country, but at Stoke there will be five minutes\u2019 stoppage time and they\u2019ve only just started. Crystal Palace\u2019s final pre-season fixture hasn\u2019t gone so well: the final whistle has just blown on a 4-0 home defeat to Hertha Berlin, 11th in the Bundesliga last season. GOAL! Wycombe 2-0 Bolton! Bolton\u2019s band of strangers look doomed to opening-day defeat. Fred Onyedinma, who signed for Wycombe for the third time last month \u2013 having previously had two loan spells there \u2013 has doubled his new/old side\u2019s advantage. The good news for St Johnstone is that it\u2019s over, and they don\u2019t have to play Celtic again for a while. This is getting silly now. Leigh Griffiths with the latest. GOAL! Stoke 1-2 QPR! Having been comprehensively outplayed for most of the game, Stoke now might not lose it \u2013 Sam Clucas has pulled a goal back. Red card! Cheltenham go down to nine! Leyton Orient took the lead against 11 men in the 68th minute, but within four minutes their opponents have had two men sent off. Luke Varney got a second booking, and now Rohan Ince has got a straight red! This sounds like an absolute cracker of a match. Cardiff were 1-0 up, then 2-1 down, then equalised, and now they\u2019re losing once again, Lee Evans having scored the goal of the game, a curler from the corner of the area into the top far corner! Having reported on the five previous goals I might as well keep going. Omar Bogle, once of Wigan, has come off the bench to equalise for Cardiff! GOAL! Leyton Orient 1-0 Cheltenham! It\u2019s been an emotional day at Leyton Orient, who held a minute\u2019s silence for Justin Edinburgh before kick-off, and they might now mark the occasion with a win after Josh Wright game them a 68th-minute lead! Olivier Ntcham came on for the hat-trick hero Ryan Christie in the 71st minute, and he\u2019s made it five for the Scottish champions in the 72nd! In today\u2019s least competitive friendly, Wolfsburg have just gone 8-1 up against Nice. Since missing that penalty Josh Windass has turned the game, setting up one and now scoring a second! GOAL! Wycombe 1-0 Bolton! Bolton\u2019s unfamiliar side, packed with debutants, teenagers and teenage debutants, held out for 56 minutes but Paul Smyth has just scored for Wycombe, tapping into the empty net after beating Remi Matthews to the ball. Ryan Christie completes his hat-trick with a left-footed thunderbolt that goes in off the bar. Michael Jacobs equalises for Wigan, from recent penalty-fluffer Josh Windass\u2019s free kick! GOALS! Reading 1-2 Sheffield Wednesday! Yakou Meite equalised for Reading in the 54th minute, and Sam Hutchinson gave Wednesday their lead back two minutes later! Easy does it! Well, Eberechi Eze does it. According to his club\u2019s Twitter feed, he \u201cslalomed his way through the Stoke backline before cooly sliding into the bottom corner\u201d. Scored penalty! Sunderland 1-1 Oxford! Lynden Gooch has converted from the spot to equalise for the home side! Wigan are given the chance to equalise at home to Cardiff, but Josh Windass hits the post! GOAL! Swansea 2-1 Hull! Mike van der Hoorn complets the Swans\u2019 comeback! 1-0 down at the start of the 48th minute, they\u2019re 2-1 up by the end of the 49th! GOAL! Swansea 1-1 Hull! Borja Baston has equalised for Swansea, literally as his performance was being roundly criticised on Sky. Into the second half, and Blackpool have doubled their lead over Bristol Rovers a minute after the restart, Armand Gnandullet with their second. Meanwhile here are the half-time scores in the Scottish Premiership: Celtic 3-0 St Johnstone Hibernian 0-0 St Mirren Livingston 0-0 Motherwell Ross County 2-0 Hamilton This time with added teams. In all three divisions combined, there are three games in which both teams have scored. Championship Barnsley 1-0 Fulham Blackburn 0-1 Charlton Brentford 0-1 Birmingham Millwall 1-0 Preston North End Reading 0-1 Sheff Wed Stoke 0-1 QPR Swansea 0-1 Hull Wigan 0-1 Cardiff League One AFC Wimbledon 0-1 Rotherham Blackpool 1-0 Bristol Rovers Burton Albion 0-1 Ipswich Coventry 0-0 Southend Doncaster 1-1 Gillingham Lincoln City 1-0 Accrington Stanley Peterborough 0-2 Fleetwood Town Shrewsbury 0-0 Portsmouth Sunderland 0-1 Oxford Utd Tranmere 0-1 Rochdale Wycombe 0-0 Bolton League Two Bradford 0-0 Cambridge Utd Carlisle 2-1 Crawley Town Colchester 1-1 Port Vale Crewe 0-2 Plymouth Exeter 0-0 Macclesfield Forest Green 0-0 Oldham Leyton Orient 0-0 Cheltenham Morecambe 0-0 Grimsby Newport County 2-0 Mansfield Northampton 0-1 Walsall Scunthorpe 0-0 Swindon The half-time scores in today\u2019s 3pm kick-offs in the Championship all look a bit similar: 1-0 0-1 0-1 1-0 0-1 0-1 0-1 0-1 It is half-time in most games: full interval scorelines to follow shortly. Here for now. In friendly news, Newcastle United have taken the lead against St Etienne, with new signing Joelinton capping what has apparently been an impressive display so far with a goal, from Fabian Sch\u00e4r\u2019s lofted through ball. On Sky, Andy Hinchcliffe is singing the praises of QPR, who continue to lead 1-0 at Stoke City. Little was expected of Rangers this season, and we shouldn\u2019t rush to judgement, but Mark Warburton appears to be working some magic. Another goal for Ryan Christie! Apparently it came from something of a goalkeeping howler from Zander Clark, who shovelled a shot back into trouble. There are of course some new laws in play this season, one of which is that \u201ca team official guilty of misconduct will be shown a yellow card\u201d. And we\u2019ve had our first one of those, Wigan\u2019s manager Paul Cook getting a first-half caution. Celtic double their advantage, Ryan Christie with a curler from the edge of the area. Neil Warnock\u2019s mastery of the Championship doesn\u2019t seem to have dimmed during a less successful season in the top flight, and Joe Ralls has given Cardiff the lead at Wigan! GOAL! Brentford 0-1 Birmingham City! The stats show that Birmingham have so far had a meagre 21% of possession and are on the receiving end of an absolute hammering \u2013 but they\u2019re the first to have a shot on target, and it goes in! Kristian Pedersen scores it, with an apparently sublime header in the 18th minute. GOAL! Peterborough 0-2 Fleetwood Town! The first team to a two-goal lead today is Fleetwood, for whom Josh Morris has added a second in the 13th minute. Fulham, the bookmakers\u2019 second-favourites for the Championship title, are behind at Barnsley, where Luke Thomas has scored a 13th-minute goal. GOAL! Stoke 0-1 QPR Jordan Hugill, who signed for QPR on a season-long loan from West Ham this week, has scored in the eighth minute, from what was apparently the visitors\u2019 first attack of the game. Michael Johnston, against St Johnstone, gives the Scottish champions an early lead. Port Vale are apparently unbeaten on the opening day of the season since 2004, as astonishing record. And they\u2019re 1-0 up today, Tom Pope giving them the lead from the penalty spot at Colchester after five minutes. GOAL! Swansea 0-1 Hull! Hull take a third-minute lead at Swansea! There\u2019s some debate about the scorer, with the Press Association giving it to Kamil Grosicki but Hull themselves crediting Dan Batty, who ran in front of the shot and may or may not have got a touch. BONG! It\u2019s 3pm! Football! One of the season\u2019s new signings: Wigan have a new mascot, Crusty the Pie, designed by local schoolchildren Cayden, aged 8, and Neve, aged 9. I don\u2019t like laughing at foreign-sounding player names, which is at the very best childish and disrespectful. However, I still feel the need to mention Celtic\u2019s new signing Boli Bolingoli. Crisis-hit Bolton have six debutants in their starting XI today at Wycombe. For what it\u2019s worth: Matthews, Earl, Edwards, Zouma, Brockbank, Weir, Lowe, Murphy, Politic, Brown, Oztumer. Subs: Alnwick, Darcy, Boon, Senior, Graham, King-Harmes, White. The final whistle has now blown at Salford, who have indeed won 2-0 and thus top the very first League Two table. In today\u2019s early League Two match, Salford have taken a 2-0 lead against Stevenage and appear to be enjoying a fine introduction to league football. I suppose in the end you get what you Dieseruvwe. Ahem. There can be no better place to start than with today\u2019s fixtures, which looks like this. I\u2019ve also tucked in Ben Fisher\u2019s season previews for each division, for a little added reading: Championship Barnsley v Fulham Blackburn v Charlton Brentford v Birmingham Millwall v Preston North End Nottm Forest v West Brom (5.30pm) Reading v Sheff Wed Stoke v QPR Swansea v Hull Wigan v Cardiff League One AFC Wimbledon v Rotherham Blackpool v Bristol Rovers Burton Albion v Ipswich Bury v Milton Keynes Dons (postponed) Coventry v Southend Doncaster v Gillingham Lincoln City v Accrington Stanley Peterborough v Fleetwood Town Shrewsbury v Portsmouth Sunderland v Oxford Utd Tranmere v Rochdale Wycombe v Bolton League Two Bradford v Cambridge Utd Carlisle v Crawley Town Colchester v Port Vale Crewe v Plymouth Exeter v Macclesfield Forest Green v Oldham Leyton Orient v Cheltenham Morecambe v Grimsby Newport County v Mansfield Northampton v Walsall Salford City v Stevenage (12.30pm) Scunthorpe v Swindon There are also some friendlies involving Premier League clubs: Bournemouth v Lyon (3.30pm) Borussia M\u2019gladbach v Chelsea (4pm) Crystal Palace v Hertha Berlin Dordrecht v Norwich (1.30pm) Man Utd v AC Milan (5.30pm) Newcastle v St Etienne Norwich XI v Toulouse (4pm) RB Leipzig v Aston Villa (2.30pm) Reims v Sheff Utd (4.30pm) Southampton v Cologne Watford v Real Sociedad Werder Bremen v Everton West Ham v Athletic Bilbao Parma v Burnley And also some fun and games in Scotland: Scottish Premiership Celtic v St Johnstone Hibernian v St Mirren Livingston v Motherwell Ross County v Hamilton Scottish Championship Alloa v Partick Arbroath v Queen of South Ayr v Morton Dundee Utd v Inverness CT",

      "body": "<p>Haider Warraich is a cardiologist at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina. His medical training began in his native Pakistan, and this autumn he will join the faculty of <a href=\"https://www.brighamandwomens.org/\" title=\"\">Brigham and Women\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.brighamandwomens.org/\" title=\"\">hospital</a> at Harvard Medical School and the VA Boston (Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities). In his book <em>State of the Heart</em>, he looks at the history, science and future of cardiac disease, and argues that it has become an overlooked condition.</p> <p><strong>People are more likely to survive a heart attack today, but heart disease is still the biggest killer worldwide. Why is that? </strong><br>In the last few decades we\u2019ve changed a heart attack from an almost certainly fatal diagnosis to one the vast majority of patients can recover from. However, those advances mean people live long enough that they develop other conditions, including heart failure, which is a chronic condition in which the heart is unable to get blood to the entire body.</p> <p>What kills people today is chronic disease. Unless we change our health system to focus on chronic diseases, and have contact with patients throughout their lives rather than just waiting for them to get sicker, we\u2019re going to keep having this disconnect. </p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the biggest advance in heart health you think has </strong><strong>gone unnoticed? </strong><br>Until recently, open heart surgery was the only way that you would treat a condition called aortic stenosis. The aortic valve is the last valve in the heart that blood has to flow through to be able to get to the rest of the body. As we get older, it starts to thicken and harden. That increases the amount of pressure the heart has to beat against to force blood into the body, and can cause a lot of strain on the heart.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People have anticipated that we will be transhuman. Patients who have had LVADs fitted are\u00a0a\u00a0living\u00a0example of\u00a0that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the last decade has seen the development of a new procedure called transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Cardiologists are able to replace the valve through a minimally invasive procedure. They insert this valve through the veins in your leg and snake it up all the way to your heart. Recently Mick Jagger got this procedure done and just days after he was back touring, he was dancing \u2013 you would have no idea that he\u2019d had this performed.</p> <p><strong>You suggest that one reason people don\u2019t take heart disease seriously is because they think that when someone gets heart disease</strong><strong> it\u2019s their own fault. How much does diet feed into our heart health? </strong><br>For many patients it\u2019s not something they have any control over. For example, if a woman who gave birth develops postpartum cardiomyopathy, there\u2019s nothing she could have done to avoid it.</p> <p>At the same time, there\u2019s a lot of heart disease for which you can reduce the risk by instituting lifestyle changes. We do everything in our modern lifestyle to hurt the heart: there\u2019s very little aerobic exercise in our daily routines, the food we eat is highly processed, the salt we consume is so much more than we need, and there\u2019s so much stress we experience. It seems like every fact of life has been designed to add fuel to this fire.</p> <p><strong>What action do you take in your own life to maintain a healthy heart? </strong><br>One thing I try to do is run maybe once or twice a week, although I could probably do more. The diet we have the best evidence for is probably the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/31/mediterranean-diet-old-age-longer-life-study\">Mediterranean diet</a>, so I use a lot more olive oil, nuts and healthy fats. That\u2019s something that I changed based on my reading of the evidence.</p> <p>But one important factor as far as my risk is concerned is that I\u2019m a south Asian male, and south Asians are at an incredibly high risk for heart disease. That really hasn\u2019t been recognised much until recently.</p> <p><strong>Research has linked endurance sports with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (A</strong><strong>Fib)</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> a type of irregular heartbeat that 1 million people in the UK live with. Is there a chance that too much exercise could actually be bad for our hearts? </strong><br>What we have seen is that it\u2019s mostly a J-shaped curve: very little exercise is bad, and there\u2019s some evidence that there is such a thing as too much exercise. But I\u2019ve rarely ever been in a situation where I\u2019ve asked a patient to reduce the amount of exercise they do. Our challenge is really trying to get people to exercise as much as possible. The benefits of exercise are so widespread.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rich people can\u00a0afford healthy lifestyles. Heart disease could transform from\u00a0a medical ailment to an\u00a0economic one</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Do you think totally artificial hearts will ever become a reality? </strong><br>I think they could. But right now we have done better with a mechanical pump sewn into the heart, called a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). These patients\u2019 experiences are unlike any other human beings who have ever lived. Most of them don\u2019t have a pulse. Listening to their chest, you actually hear the pump running. If they run out of batteries, they could die, sometimes instantaneously. But they also represent the dawn of a new age. People have always anticipated that one day, we will be transhuman, but that time has already arrived. Patients who have LVADs, who there are tens of thousands of around the world, are a living example of that.</p> <p><strong>Heart attacks are often missed in women because they look different </strong><strong>from those in men. What can we do to fix that? </strong><br>One false belief that still persists for many is that heart disease is a man\u2019s disease. Women can have later onset of heart disease than men because they do get some protection from female hormones, but really, if you look at the entire span of life, heart disease kills as many women as it does men.</p> <p>Not only do a lot of women not pay attention to their hearts, this is also true of clinicians. A lot of times we incorrectly think that women with heart disease may have something else going on.

      "bodyText": "Haider Warraich is a cardiologist at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina. His medical training began in his native Pakistan, and this autumn he will join the faculty of Brigham and Women\u2019s hospital at Harvard Medical School and the VA Boston (Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities). In his book State of the Heart, he looks at the history, science and future of cardiac disease, and argues that it has become an overlooked condition. People are more likely to survive a heart attack today, but heart disease is still the biggest killer worldwide. Why is that? In the last few decades we\u2019ve changed a heart attack from an almost certainly fatal diagnosis to one the vast majority of patients can recover from. However, those advances mean people live long enough that they develop other conditions, including heart failure, which is a chronic condition in which the heart is unable to get blood to the entire body. What kills people today is chronic disease. Unless we change our health system to focus on chronic diseases, and have contact with patients throughout their lives rather than just waiting for them to get sicker, we\u2019re going to keep having this disconnect. What\u2019s the biggest advance in heart health you think has gone unnoticed? Until recently, open heart surgery was the only way that you would treat a condition called aortic stenosis. The aortic valve is the last valve in the heart that blood has to flow through to be able to get to the rest of the body. As we get older, it starts to thicken and harden. That increases the amount of pressure the heart has to beat against to force blood into the body, and can cause a lot of strain on the heart. But the last decade has seen the development of a new procedure called transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Cardiologists are able to replace the valve through a minimally invasive procedure. They insert this valve through the veins in your leg and snake it up all the way to your heart. Recently Mick Jagger got this procedure done and just days after he was back touring, he was dancing \u2013 you would have no idea that he\u2019d had this performed. You suggest that one reason people don\u2019t take heart disease seriously is because they think that when someone gets heart disease it\u2019s their own fault. How much does diet feed into our heart health? For many patients it\u2019s not something they have any control over. For example, if a woman who gave birth develops postpartum cardiomyopathy, there\u2019s nothing she could have done to avoid it. At the same time, there\u2019s a lot of heart disease for which you can reduce the risk by instituting lifestyle changes. We do everything in our modern lifestyle to hurt the heart: there\u2019s very little aerobic exercise in our daily routines, the food we eat is highly processed, the salt we consume is so much more than we need, and there\u2019s so much stress we experience. It seems like every fact of life has been designed to add fuel to this fire. What action do you take in your own life to maintain a healthy heart? One thing I try to do is run maybe once or twice a week, although I could probably do more. The diet we have the best evidence for is probably the Mediterranean diet, so I use a lot more olive oil, nuts and healthy fats. That\u2019s something that I changed based on my reading of the evidence. But one important factor as far as my risk is concerned is that I\u2019m a south Asian male, and south Asians are at an incredibly high risk for heart disease. That really hasn\u2019t been recognised much until recently. Research has linked endurance sports with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AFib), a type of irregular heartbeat that 1 million people in the UK live with. Is there a chance that too much exercise could actually be bad for our hearts? What we have seen is that it\u2019s mostly a J-shaped curve: very little exercise is bad, and there\u2019s some evidence that there is such a thing as too much exercise. But I\u2019ve rarely ever been in a situation where I\u2019ve asked a patient to reduce the amount of exercise they do. Our challenge is really trying to get people to exercise as much as possible. The benefits of exercise are so widespread. Do you think totally artificial hearts will ever become a reality? I think they could. But right now we have done better with a mechanical pump sewn into the heart, called a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). These patients\u2019 experiences are unlike any other human beings who have ever lived. Most of them don\u2019t have a pulse. Listening to their chest, you actually hear the pump running. If they run out of batteries, they could die, sometimes instantaneously. But they also represent the dawn of a new age. People have always anticipated that one day, we will be transhuman, but that time has already arrived. Patients who have LVADs, who there are tens of thousands of around the world, are a living example of that. Heart attacks are often missed in women because they look different from those in men. What can we do to fix that? One false belief that still persists for many is that heart disease is a man\u2019s disease. Women can have later onset of heart disease than men because they do get some protection from female hormones, but really, if you look at the entire span of life, heart disease kills as many women as it does men. Not only do a lot of women not pay attention to their hearts, this is also true of clinicians. A lot of times we incorrectly think that women with heart disease may have something else going on. We\u2019re better than where we were a few years ago but there\u2019s still a long way to go. Do you foresee a future in which we all wear a heart monitor that will report to our doctors when something irregular starts happening? The Apple Watch already gets similar information, and there are other devices that are even better at assessing the heart \u2013 so this is not just something that\u2019s going to happen in the future, it\u2019s being vigorously studied now. To me what this represents is the democratisation of the EKG [electrocardiogram]. I think it\u2019s going to be very good for many patients. But I also worry it may create a lot of false alarm. The other thing this highlights is that heart disease is increasingly becoming a disease of socially disadvantaged people. People who are affluent can afford lifestyles that are healthy, healthier food and access to technologies that can monitor their own health. Heart disease could transform from a medical ailment to an economic ailment, in which just having heart disease becomes a synonym for poverty. Can you die from a broken heart? It\u2019s possible \u2013 but you\u2019d be surprised by what breaks people\u2019s hearts.

Chinese authorities told a diplomat in Beijing in late July that a decision had been made to halt all cooperation after Grace Meng was awarded political asylum in May, the newspaper reported. Increasingly assertive internationally, Beijing has made the decision to suspend a key aspect of the diplomatic and security relationship with Paris at a time when it is already in the global spotlight over protests in Hong Kong and an escalating trade dispute with the US. Meng first hit headlines last year, when she decided to go public about her husband\u2019s sudden disappearance during a trip home to China in September. Interpol had not been given any information about the whereabouts of Meng Hongwei, who had been elected president of the body in 2016, leading to the bizarre spectacle of the global police body pleading with China for information about its chief. In October, under international pressure, China finally admitted that Hongwei had been detained. He was not seen in public again until June, when he appeared in court in the north-eastern port city of Tianjin, confessed to accepting more than $2m in bribes and expressed regret for his crime, a court statement said. A confession assures a conviction but it was not immediately clear when a verdict and sentence would be handed down. Confessions in corruption cases, often televised, have become a hallmark of President Xi Jinping\u2019s rule; he has put a very public crackdown on official graft at the heart of his rule.

Vanya is an unfulfilled man, only just squeezing a profit out of the family estate for the past 25 years. Now 50-ish, he is hopelessly infatuated with Yelena, the beautiful young wife of his late sister\u2019s husband, a once feted, now retired professor, come to live on the estate for reasons of economy. Vanya\u2019s helpmate, his niece Sonya (the professor\u2019s daughter), is also hopelessly in love \u2013 with an occasional visitor, the district doctor Astrov. Astrov, like Vanya, is a frustrated character. Overwhelmed by the impossibility of tending the needs of the peasants, he finds solace in reforesting the area to save its ecology for future generations. He, too, is hopelessly in love, also with Yelena.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/30/rupert-everett-uncle-vanya-theatre-royal-bath\">Rupert Everett: 'I'd have done anything to be a Hollywood star'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As so often in Chekhov, this appears to be a play about a privileged section of society in late 19th-century Russia. But Chekhov, although famously associated with the naturalists, is also a symbolist writer, exploring universal inner realities. Everett\u2019s direction sensitively develops this aspect of the drama. His period production slowly builds up a sense of human experience as part of the cycle of nature. Real-world sounds instil a feeling of place: owls hoot, crickets chirrup, thunder crashes. The play of light creates an impression of diurnal time and the passing of the seasons. Charles Quiggin\u2019s set suggests the permeability of nature and human life, especially in the opening scenes where the impression is of an outdoors that is also an indoors, with leaves draping the walls of the family house outside of which furniture is set on carpets as in a drawing room. Later, the back wall will disappear and an interior will merge with a seemingly endless, mist-shrouded vista.</p> <p>Another (notoriously tricky) aspect of Chekhov\u2019s plays that Everett \u2013 as actor and director \u2013 gets just right is the humour. He is aided in this by David Hare\u2019s sharp adaptation and by the beautifully pitched and perfectly timed performances of his ensemble cast (special mention to Katherine Parkinson\u2019s Sonya and the injured John Light, incorporating a crutch into his performance as Astrov). Situations and lines are laugh-aloud funny \u2013 segueing seamlessly into tears, anger and despair; as much a part of life as birdsong and snow. On the evidence of this production, Everett and Chekhov are made for one another.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"acf5d063cf71df32315d1c48135c8da2479dc54a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acf5d063cf71df32315d1c48135c8da2479dc54a/0_0_3750_5000/750.jpg\" alt=\"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out at the Royal Exchange.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There Is a Light That Never Goes Out at the Royal Exchange.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The setting of <strong><a href=\"https://www.royalexchange.co.uk/whats-on-and-tickets/there-is-a-light-that-never-goes-out\" title=\"\">There Is a Light That Never Goes Out</a> </strong>is also historical: Lancashire, 1811-12, time of trouble at the mills (the play is subtitled Scenes from the Luddite Rebellion). The treatment, however, is contemporary. Moving on and about the raised scarlet platform that dominates the centre of the Royal Exchange\u2019s theatre-in-the round, actors in modern dress deploy microphones like wizards\u2019 wands, conjuring sounds to swirl around the stage (Pete Malkin\u2019s sound design). Rhythmically percussive clangs and clatters shape relentless factory looms (\u201cYou may tire but they never do\u201d); sliverings of tinkling glass \u201cshow\u201d us shattering windows and chandeliers in the Royal Exchange\u2019s dining rooms during a protest (a site-specific moment).</p> <p>This adroit use of technology to illustrate the story of people mainly remembered as machine-wreckers is just one striking feature of this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/15/kandinsky-theatre-luddism-there-is-a-light-that-never-goes-out-luddite-rebellion\" title=\"\">devised show</a>, created by James Yeatman, Lauren Mooney and members of the company (seven quicksilver performers). With sound and lights creating scenery and atmosphere, the visual emphasis is always on the human body (movement evokes images, including, harrowingly, a worker trapped in a machine). The action connects disparate classes and individuals: mill workers unionising and taking action; an informer-agitator; the colonel who unleashes soldiers against protesters; a pseudo-reformist factory owner; the dissipated Prince Regent and his partying entourage; Ludd, mythic figure of encouragement to the workers and threat to the establishment. Documentary sources, threaded together, provide multiple, contrasting viewpoints (\u201clower classes\u201d to one observer are \u201cworkers\u201d to another).</p> <p>Events shuttle machine-fast through time and space (sometimes too fast for comprehension). Little by little, people, places and situations patchwork into drama. In the process, we start to thread links between then and now.

      "bodyText": "Uncle Vanya is Rupert Everett\u2019s first attempt at stage direction; also his first Chekhov as an actor (he plays the title role). Vanya is an unfulfilled man, only just squeezing a profit out of the family estate for the past 25 years. Now 50-ish, he is hopelessly infatuated with Yelena, the beautiful young wife of his late sister\u2019s husband, a once feted, now retired professor, come to live on the estate for reasons of economy. Vanya\u2019s helpmate, his niece Sonya (the professor\u2019s daughter), is also hopelessly in love \u2013 with an occasional visitor, the district doctor Astrov. Astrov, like Vanya, is a frustrated character. Overwhelmed by the impossibility of tending the needs of the peasants, he finds solace in reforesting the area to save its ecology for future generations. He, too, is hopelessly in love, also with Yelena. As so often in Chekhov, this appears to be a play about a privileged section of society in late 19th-century Russia. But Chekhov, although famously associated with the naturalists, is also a symbolist writer, exploring universal inner realities. Everett\u2019s direction sensitively develops this aspect of the drama. His period production slowly builds up a sense of human experience as part of the cycle of nature. Real-world sounds instil a feeling of place: owls hoot, crickets chirrup, thunder crashes. The play of light creates an impression of diurnal time and the passing of the seasons. Charles Quiggin\u2019s set suggests the permeability of nature and human life, especially in the opening scenes where the impression is of an outdoors that is also an indoors, with leaves draping the walls of the family house outside of which furniture is set on carpets as in a drawing room. Later, the back wall will disappear and an interior will merge with a seemingly endless, mist-shrouded vista. Another (notoriously tricky) aspect of Chekhov\u2019s plays that Everett \u2013 as actor and director \u2013 gets just right is the humour. He is aided in this by David Hare\u2019s sharp adaptation and by the beautifully pitched and perfectly timed performances of his ensemble cast (special mention to Katherine Parkinson\u2019s Sonya and the injured John Light, incorporating a crutch into his performance as Astrov). Situations and lines are laugh-aloud funny \u2013 segueing seamlessly into tears, anger and despair; as much a part of life as birdsong and snow. On the evidence of this production, Everett and Chekhov are made for one another. The setting of There Is a Light That Never Goes Out is also historical: Lancashire, 1811-12, time of trouble at the mills (the play is subtitled Scenes from the Luddite Rebellion). The treatment, however, is contemporary. Moving on and about the raised scarlet platform that dominates the centre of the Royal Exchange\u2019s theatre-in-the round, actors in modern dress deploy microphones like wizards\u2019 wands, conjuring sounds to swirl around the stage (Pete Malkin\u2019s sound design). Rhythmically percussive clangs and clatters shape relentless factory looms (\u201cYou may tire but they never do\u201d); sliverings of tinkling glass \u201cshow\u201d us shattering windows and chandeliers in the Royal Exchange\u2019s dining rooms during a protest (a site-specific moment). This adroit use of technology to illustrate the story of people mainly remembered as machine-wreckers is just one striking feature of this devised show, created by James Yeatman, Lauren Mooney and members of the company (seven quicksilver performers). With sound and lights creating scenery and atmosphere, the visual emphasis is always on the human body (movement evokes images, including, harrowingly, a worker trapped in a machine). The action connects disparate classes and individuals: mill workers unionising and taking action; an informer-agitator; the colonel who unleashes soldiers against protesters; a pseudo-reformist factory owner; the dissipated Prince Regent and his partying entourage; Ludd, mythic figure of encouragement to the workers and threat to the establishment. Documentary sources, threaded together, provide multiple, contrasting viewpoints (\u201clower classes\u201d to one observer are \u201cworkers\u201d to another). Events shuttle machine-fast through time and space (sometimes too fast for comprehension). Little by little, people, places and situations patchwork into drama. In the process, we start to thread links between then and now. Some of the luddites\u2019 aims we thought were achieved \u2013 fair pay, decent hours, the right to unionise \u2013 but, as a programme note points out, these same aims are still \u201cbeing advocated by Deliveroo riders, Uber drivers and Amazon \u2018associates\u2019\u201d. Malory Towers is a fictional boarding school for girls, the setting for a series of six novels launched by Enid Blyton in 1946. Her tales about the pupils who pass through this converted Cornish castle have been read and loved by generations of (mainly) girls (myself included). Their \u201cjolly hockey sticks\u201d tone, though, has been disliked and derided by almost as many, who feel her stories are based on, and endorse, elitism and privilege. Emma Rice\u2019s adaptation (which she also directs) opens in a contemporary school where unsupervised pupils bully a girl for reading Malory Towers. Knocked unconscious, the youngster dreams herself boarding a train at Paddington station and becoming, in the words of the school song, \u201cOne of the lucky girls to have the chance / To grow at Malory Towers\u201d. The framing device sets up a (to me, jarring) contrast between what is open to these \u201clucky\u201d few and what is available to the many. As in Blyton\u2019s books, the values Rice praises are powerfully expressed through friendships, conflicts and cliffhanger adventures (shadow projections on to the back of the set add to the thrills). Izuka Hoyle\u2019s fiery Darrell must rein in her temper; Sally (the ever-excellent Francesca Mills) must let go of her need to control. All come to realise they should have tried to understand why Rebecca Collingwood\u2019s deliciously dislikable Gwen has been behaving so badly. Live musical accompaniment \u2013 performed by the actors and pianist Stephanie Hockley \u2013 lends atmosphere to events but song-and-dance numbers do little more than pad out the evening, while the concluding excerpt from A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream feels worthy but dull. The interactions among the girls are Blyton\u2019s and Rice\u2019s strength: simple characters in clear situations with a strong moral message: enlightened education helps create \u201cwomen that the world can lean on\u201d.

And he\u2019ll go down as the worst prime minister since Theresa May, and she\u2019s the worst prime minister since David Cameron and he\u2019s the worst prime minister since Lord North. So he\u2019ll carry on that progression. Does music still excite you now? The kids hate it, of course, when anyone of a bygone generation likes their music, but I\u2019m afraid I do like St Vincent, Everything Everything, John Grant. And what are you reading? That book everyone\u2019s talking about, Fleishman Is in Trouble by Taffy Brodesser-Akner; it\u2019s very good. I\u2019m also reading a biography of Stalin at the same time \u2013 just so I understand the Labour party better! Alan Johnson\u2019s In My Life tour runs from 18 September to 30 November",

It is more gentrified now.\u201d Di, an author and historian, lives with her husband, the British artist, Patrick Hughes in Great Eastern street. The couple met in 1986 at the Chelsea Arts Club. Peer through the window at street level and you will be greeted with a pleasing vista: other people working. Number 72 is home to the atelier Reverspective. </p> <p>Inside, artists sit on swivel chairs surrounded by tables crammed with tubes of paint, brushes, rags and mixing palates. They are working on Patrick\u2019s optical-illusion 3D canvases, creating intricate details of familiar scenes: the canals of Venice, a library, or surrealist images, a rainbow escaping from a box, a never-ending maze. This is Patrick\u2019s business, making and selling his unique Reverspective artworks. Patrick and Di are old school: they live above the shop.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edb34eb26c5a275753976f8de912398e7a791c16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edb34eb26c5a275753976f8de912398e7a791c16/0_230_6053_7562/800.jpg\" alt=\"Mad hatters: Di Atkinson and Patrick Hughes.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mad hatters: Di Atkinson and Patrick Hughes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claire Worthy/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the 19th century, Hackney was famed for its furniture factories and warehouses. You can still locate their building\u2019s Edwardian roots in the elaborate wood-panelled entrance, polished to perfection to brandish the varnish the factory made. When they moved in, almost 25 years ago, the building was derelict office space. They bought the ground floor and first floor and had the basement thrown in as a bonus. The building had been divided up, but was presented to them with everything ripped out: vast empty rooms with wires dangling from the ceiling.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rainbows are a revelation: different wavelengths seen as colours. You can\u2019t order them like pizza</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The apartment, which is triple-glazed to stave off the constant hum of traffic outside, is in essence an enormous white box, but clever configuration with furniture, rugs and shelving breaks up the space, making it homely. Leave the studio and take the original wooden factory stairs up and a large entrance hall on the first floor ushers you in. An Arts and Crafts sideboard, with a Heal\u2019s Dali mirror above, displays the couple\u2019s hat collection. An image by their neighbour, the photographer <a href=\"https://timflach.com/\" title=\"\">Tim Flach</a>, from his \u201cMore Than Human\u201d series decorates one wall while contemporary maze rugs by <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/anni-albers\" title=\"\">Anni Albers</a>, produced by Christopher Farr, line the floor.</p> <p>Outside, life is hectic. Great Eastern Street is edgy and constantly switched on. Thanks to Hackney Council backing a night-time economy, the streets throng at night when people pour in to revel in the proliferation of bars. They come to feel radical, though in truth, it\u2019s anything but.

From that moment he has embraced the surreal.</p> <p>\u201cI prize the imagination,\u201d he says. His early work focused on rainbows (he was known as the rainbow man) and were surrealist concoctions created in primary colours. \u201cRainbows are a revelation: different wavelengths that are seen as colours. It is pure magic. You can\u2019t order them like a pizza, so it is fun to nail it down. I have done 100 rainbows and 1,000 Reverspectives.

      "bodyText": "It has become less ravey since we moved in,\u201d says Di Atkinson of Shoreditch back in the mid-90s, when the former factories and warehouses were just that. \u201cBuildings were taken over for two-day raves and used as squats. It is more gentrified now.\u201d Di, an author and historian, lives with her husband, the British artist, Patrick Hughes in Great Eastern street. The couple met in 1986 at the Chelsea Arts Club. Peer through the window at street level and you will be greeted with a pleasing vista: other people working. Number 72 is home to the atelier Reverspective. Inside, artists sit on swivel chairs surrounded by tables crammed with tubes of paint, brushes, rags and mixing palates. They are working on Patrick\u2019s optical-illusion 3D canvases, creating intricate details of familiar scenes: the canals of Venice, a library, or surrealist images, a rainbow escaping from a box, a never-ending maze. This is Patrick\u2019s business, making and selling his unique Reverspective artworks. Patrick and Di are old school: they live above the shop. In the 19th century, Hackney was famed for its furniture factories and warehouses. You can still locate their building\u2019s Edwardian roots in the elaborate wood-panelled entrance, polished to perfection to brandish the varnish the factory made. When they moved in, almost 25 years ago, the building was derelict office space. They bought the ground floor and first floor and had the basement thrown in as a bonus. The building had been divided up, but was presented to them with everything ripped out: vast empty rooms with wires dangling from the ceiling. The apartment, which is triple-glazed to stave off the constant hum of traffic outside, is in essence an enormous white box, but clever configuration with furniture, rugs and shelving breaks up the space, making it homely. Leave the studio and take the original wooden factory stairs up and a large entrance hall on the first floor ushers you in. An Arts and Crafts sideboard, with a Heal\u2019s Dali mirror above, displays the couple\u2019s hat collection. An image by their neighbour, the photographer Tim Flach, from his \u201cMore Than Human\u201d series decorates one wall while contemporary maze rugs by Anni Albers, produced by Christopher Farr, line the floor. Outside, life is hectic. Great Eastern Street is edgy and constantly switched on. Thanks to Hackney Council backing a night-time economy, the streets throng at night when people pour in to revel in the proliferation of bars. They come to feel radical, though in truth, it\u2019s anything but. The majority of artists and free-thinkers have long gone, forced out by high rents \u2013 but not Patrick and Di. At 79, Patrick is probably the best-dressed man in Hackney, wearing a handmade pink and sky-blue checked suit for today\u2019s shoot: \u201cI am not in favour of dressing down. If everyone wears jeans and a T-shirt it is just not interesting.\u201d A self-confessed surrealist, he has been attracted to the unconventional since he was a teenager, when he was introduced to the notorious Colony Room Club and ran away from home aged 17. From that moment he has embraced the surreal. \u201cI prize the imagination,\u201d he says. His early work focused on rainbows (he was known as the rainbow man) and were surrealist concoctions created in primary colours. \u201cRainbows are a revelation: different wavelengths that are seen as colours. It is pure magic. You can\u2019t order them like a pizza, so it is fun to nail it down. I have done 100 rainbows and 1,000 Reverspectives. It is like being a miner trying to hack out gold from rock.\u201d This diverse design manifesto is central to the way they furnish their home. Each piece is chosen because \u201cIt makes us smile; we don\u2019t like to be sensible often. I have a wilful urge to muck about,\u201d says Di, whose taste in vintage clothes is exemplary. \u201cMy instinct is to go off on a tangent. We are eclectic with modern surrealism influences.\u201d They certainly are. Arts and Crafts chairs and tables sit in a corner neatly delineated by shelving filled with knitted suffragettes \u2013 a nod to Di\u2019s work \u2013 a plastic model of Disney\u2019s Snow White, copious books on British history and a tin of Liquorice Allsorts, all overseen by a vast oversized Anglepoise lamp, originally commissioned by the Roald Dahl Museum. On the windowsill a sculpture made entirely from teddies by their friend, the late Nancy Fouts, oversees all. A print of Meret Oppenheim\u2019s 1936 fur cup and saucer hangs above a table with stork legs, also designed by Oppenheim. Fornasetti is a firm favourite and trinket pots line the bathroom. Glen Baxter and Philippe Starck are also popular with the couple. Starck designed the pissoir in the bathroom and his horn lights and gnomes also feature heavily. Monochrome curtains, by their friend Sue Timney, become theatrical drapes when pulled together, and her cushions fill their 1920s wooden settles. Following advice, they designed a space to retreat to and recreated the former varnish manager\u2019s boardroom, with its original cornicing and two doors (one for the secretary). Their collection of 20th-century Whitefriars glass is displayed on the mantel and in the kitchen. Escher\u2019s Night and Day print and Nancy Fout\u2019s Match Tulip contribute to their penchant for the unusual. Patrick and Di may be old enough to enjoy free bus passes, but they\u2019re still the most stylish couple in Shoreditch.",

Coles said: \u201cThe treatment of terrorist victims is cruel and inhumane and is symptomatic of the dysfunctional and unfair process for funding family representation at inquests.\u201d Figures obtained from the Ministry of Justice via a freedom of information request show that, in 2017, the department spent \u00a34.2m representing prison officers at inquests, while bereaved families received only \u00a392,000 in legal aid. A ministry spokesman said: \u201cWe understand how distressing the inquest process will be for relatives of those who died in the Manchester Arena bombing, and we\u2019re making changes to ensure there is more legal support \u2026 Aid has always been means-tested and rightly counts not just a person\u2019s income or savings but expensive assets like sports cars, antiques and jewellery. It is possible for the Legal Aid Agency to waive the means test if appropriate.",

      "bodyText": "The new home secretary, Priti Patel, has been criticised after she said she wants criminals \u201cto literally feel terror\u201d once she begins her law and order reforms. Patel indicated a sharp rightward turn in the government\u2019s approach to crime, which comes after Boris Johnson, the prime minister, announced plans to recruit 20,000 new police officers. \u201cI fundamentally think the Conservative party is the party of law and order. Full stop,\u201d Patel told the Daily Mail, in her first interview since Johnson appointed her home secretary. She vowed to \u201cempower [police] to stop criminality.\u201d \u201cMy focus now is restating our commitment to law and order and restating our commitment to the people on the frontline, the police,\u201d Patel said. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt the Conservative party is the party of the police and police officers \u2026 quite frankly, with more police officers out there and greater police presence, I want [criminals] to literally feel terror at the thought of committing offences.\u201d Responding on Saturday, the shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Patel\u2019s \u201ctough rhetoric\u201d would not end \u201csoaring crime\u201d. \u201cWe need more officers and resources for the police to work with our communities, not to risk alienating them with draconian powers,\u201d she said. The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Ed Davey called Patel, the MP for Witham, Essex, \u201cout of touch\u201d. \u201cPriti Patel\u2019s notion that making people terrified of the police will cut crime shows just how out of touch she is with what\u2019s leading some young people into crime in the first place,\u201d Davey said. \u201cSo often, young people say they carry knives because they are afraid of other young people in gangs. We need more police so these young people can feel less afraid as they now trust the police to be there, not because the police add to their fears.\u201d The appointment is a reversal of fortunes for Patel, who was sacked from the government two years ago after breaking the ministerial code by secretly and unofficially meeting Israeli ministers, businesspeople and a senior lobbyist. One of 30 Tory Brexit ultras who voted against the former prime minister Theresa May\u2019s EU deal at every opportunity, Patel\u2019s elevation to the Home Office is regarded as a key component of what political commentators are calling the most rightwing cabinet since the Thatcher years. Patel indicated a return to a hard line on drugs offences after some forces had apparently not been taking action on possession. \u201cAny form of drug use \u2013 you don\u2019t turn a blind eye to it at all. It has a corrosive impact on people and communities,\u201d she said. The Lib Dems accused Patel of \u201crank hypocrisy\u201d over the zero-tolerance approach, considering a series of admissions from senior Tory colleagues. Johnson promoted Michael Gove to the cabinet after he was forced to admit using cocaine 20 years ago at social events. Dominic Raab was made the foreign secretary and Andrea Leadsom the business secretary after saying they had used cannabis as students. The Lib Dem MP Christine Jardine, who has worked for access to medicinal cannabis, called for a \u201cpragmatic, evidence-based approach\u201d to drugs. \u201cIt\u2019s rank hypocrisy for the home secretary to take such an archaic approach on cannabis given the recent admissions from members of the cabinet she sits around,\u201d she said. \u201cThe war on drugs has been an unmitigated failure. In reality, by decriminalising cannabis we can remove it from the criminal market and protect vulnerable young people.\u201d Human rights activists have reacted with alarm at Patel\u2019s new job, which puts her in charge of crime and policing, counterterrorism and drugs policy. Patel, whose Gujarati Indian parents migrated to the UK in the 1960s from Uganda just before Idi Amin\u2019s decision to deport all Asians, has voted for a stricter asylum system, stronger enforcement of immigration rules, and against banning the detention of pregnant women in immigration jails. However, she distanced herself from her past comments on the death penalty, despite telling a Question Time audience in 2011 that she would support its reintroduction. \u201cI have never said I\u2019m an active supporter of it and [what I said] is constantly taken out of context,\u201d she told the Mail, adding that her comments on Question Time \u201cmay have been clipped\u201d. She told the Question Time audience: \u201cI do actually think when we have a criminal justice system that continuously fails in this country and where we have seen murderers, rapists and people who have committed the most abhorrent crimes in society, go into prison and then are released from prison to go out into the community to then reoffend and do the types of crime they have committed again and again. \u201cI think that\u2019s appalling. And actually on that basis alone I would actually support the reintroduction of capital punishment to serve as a deterrent.\u201d",

It gives gruelling details of how generations of children, living in a climate of fear, were horrendously abused by predatory carers in homes and foster families while Nottingham city council and Nottinghamshire county council, as well as police, social workers and the Crown Prosecution Service, repeatedly failed to act.</p> <p>What can we learn from the messages these children send? How can <a href=\"https://www.iicsa.org.uk/publications/investigation/nottinghamshire-councils\" title=\"\">decades of abuse occur</a>, and why is so little invested in childhood?</p> <p>In 1985, 400 children absconded from a Nottinghamshire home, including 70 girls who had \u201cfled\u201d more than once. In 1989, an internal investigation into a 14-year-old girl who had sex with a number of boys in a home, incredibly reported: \u201cAt no time did this take part against her will.\u201d In one home, a 16-year-old sexual offender and suspected psychopath was placed in the same unit as an \u201cinadequate\u201d 11-year-old. One care worker had a conviction for grievous bodily harm. \u201cWe sort people out,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYou were almost made to feel they were objects,\u201d reported another residential care worker of the fragile children in need of nurture and protection. Instead, they were beaten, raped \u2013 vaginally, orally and anally \u2013 and sexually assaulted, and when they sought help\u2026 \u201cI was told to stop lying\u201d; \u201cI felt very alone \u2026 sick, dirty and ashamed.\u201d</p> <p>Sixteen residential staff and 10 foster carers have been imprisoned. Professor Alexis Jay, the inquiry chairwoman, said: \u201cDespite decades of evidence and many reviews showing what needed to change, neither of the councils learned from their mistakes, meaning more children suffered unnecessarily.\u201d</p> <p>November marks the <a href=\"https://www.childrightsconnect.org/30th-anniversary-of-the-un-convention-on-the-rights-of-the-child/\" title=\"\">30th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>, ratified by 196 countries. Its 54 articles demand that we uphold the best interests of the child, right to life, children\u2019s development and respect for their views. In the UK, the convention is still not incorporated into domestic law. As a result, we have no statutory duty for government to consider the impact on children of decision-making. We have no children\u2019s minister in cabinet. Instead, last month <a href=\"https://schoolsweek.co.uk/kemi-badenoch-childrens-minister-nadhim-zahawi/\" title=\"\">Kemi Badenoch became the fifth children\u2019s minister in four years</a>, a junior appointment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the UK, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is still not incorporated into domestic law</p> <footer> <cite>Yvonne Roberts</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The report card on UK children living in what is an affluent country is pitiful: <a href=\"https://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/child-poverty-facts-and-figures\" title=\"\">four million in poverty</a>; a punishing benefits cap; poor housing; rising rates of mental ill health; inadequate funding for schools and childcare. The list goes on. And, as the IICSA\u2019s investigation underlines, when children speak out, too often they are disbelieved and discredited. The police\u2019s unequivocal response to claims of serial abuse by Carl Beech is not the norm.</p> <p>The IICSA investigated Nottinghamshire councils not because the credibility of survivors had suddenly been validated but as a result of the number of allegations, then 350, now at 418.

      "bodyText": "In his book The Disappearance of Childhood, the American writer and educator Neil Postman wrote: \u2018\u2018Children are the living messages we send to a time we will not see.\u201d Last week, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) published its damning investigation into children in care in Nottinghamshire. It gives gruelling details of how generations of children, living in a climate of fear, were horrendously abused by predatory carers in homes and foster families while Nottingham city council and Nottinghamshire county council, as well as police, social workers and the Crown Prosecution Service, repeatedly failed to act. What can we learn from the messages these children send? How can decades of abuse occur, and why is so little invested in childhood? In 1985, 400 children absconded from a Nottinghamshire home, including 70 girls who had \u201cfled\u201d more than once. In 1989, an internal investigation into a 14-year-old girl who had sex with a number of boys in a home, incredibly reported: \u201cAt no time did this take part against her will.\u201d In one home, a 16-year-old sexual offender and suspected psychopath was placed in the same unit as an \u201cinadequate\u201d 11-year-old. One care worker had a conviction for grievous bodily harm. \u201cWe sort people out,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were almost made to feel they were objects,\u201d reported another residential care worker of the fragile children in need of nurture and protection. Instead, they were beaten, raped \u2013 vaginally, orally and anally \u2013 and sexually assaulted, and when they sought help\u2026 \u201cI was told to stop lying\u201d; \u201cI felt very alone \u2026 sick, dirty and ashamed.\u201d Sixteen residential staff and 10 foster carers have been imprisoned. Professor Alexis Jay, the inquiry chairwoman, said: \u201cDespite decades of evidence and many reviews showing what needed to change, neither of the councils learned from their mistakes, meaning more children suffered unnecessarily.\u201d November marks the 30th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified by 196 countries. Its 54 articles demand that we uphold the best interests of the child, right to life, children\u2019s development and respect for their views. In the UK, the convention is still not incorporated into domestic law. As a result, we have no statutory duty for government to consider the impact on children of decision-making. We have no children\u2019s minister in cabinet. Instead, last month Kemi Badenoch became the fifth children\u2019s minister in four years, a junior appointment. The report card on UK children living in what is an affluent country is pitiful: four million in poverty; a punishing benefits cap; poor housing; rising rates of mental ill health; inadequate funding for schools and childcare. The list goes on. And, as the IICSA\u2019s investigation underlines, when children speak out, too often they are disbelieved and discredited. The police\u2019s unequivocal response to claims of serial abuse by Carl Beech is not the norm. The IICSA investigated Nottinghamshire councils not because the credibility of survivors had suddenly been validated but as a result of the number of allegations, then 350, now at 418. What triggered the disclosures is an extraordinary alliance between David Hollas MBE, a retired army lieutenant colonel, and two survivors of childhood abuse, Mickey Summers and Mandy Coupland, who persuaded others to come forward. Hollas had met an ex-squaddie, a survivor from a children\u2019s home, who was protesting in the street about his experiences. Five years ago, it prompted Hollas to campaign for a national inquiry. Council officials were obstructive but, with the support of others, the result is last week\u2019s report. Advocacy and counselling for survivors are also now established, but shamefully the funding runs out next year. In 2018, Jon Collins, then leader of Nottingham city council, said he would only apologise \u201cwhen there is something to apologise for\u201d. Apologies have now been made, however inadequate, but still, Hollas points out, accountability and punishment for profound neglect of duty is absent \u2013 as is so often the case (Rotherham, Rochdale, Islington). \u201cIt won\u2019t stop until those happy to take the big bucks take the big fall,\u201d he says. The two councils have six months to conduct an independent evaluation of risk and provide an action plan. \u201cThen what?\u201d Hollas asks. The reply would be so much more convincing if it was anchored in a society in which children are believed and properly protected, and their rights robustly upheld.",

      "body": "<p>Unexpectedly last week, a 42-year-old BBC Two vox pop featuring an East End <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCArchive/status/1156522620399095808\" title=\"\">woman in a red raincoat</a> broke the internet. We don\u2019t know her name, but this unassuming star has been watched by millions, decades after stopping to talk to a reporter on a London street. She trounced all the social media competition, including Kylie Minogue performing <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/calendar/2019-08-02/watch-kylie-minogue-performs-locomotion-at-scarborough-north-bay-railway/\" title=\"\">Do The Locomotion</a> on a miniature railway in Scarborough.</p> <p>The clip was filmed for a 1977 BBC Two series of 28 programmes marking the Queen\u2019s silver jubilee. It was intended for a show called <em>Thanks for the Memory</em>, then billed as the BBC\u2019s biggest vox pop to date, that would ask citizens, \u201cfrom crofters to judges\u201d, for their views on TV of the previous 25 years. Tweeted by the BBC Archive last week for a contemporary audience, there was one standout star.</p> <p>In her headscarf and raincoat, she resembles the social stereotypes that Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie lampooned in the vox pop sections of their sketch show. But those characters held reactionary views, couldn\u2019t stop looking down the lens and offered non sequiturs such as: \u201cThey\u2019ve got hotter pavements, I know that.\u201d However, this woman was a natural communicator, displaying a witty, easy eloquence. What she delivered was more of a social and historical soliloquy that included asides about \u201chighbrow\u201d plays and bad acting. If you haven\u2019t seen it, just watch. A star is born, albeit 42 years after the event. Today, she\u2019d be signed up for <em>Goggle</em><em>box</em>.</p> <p>It\u2019s remarkable because no one did this well in a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46946442\" title=\"\">vox pop</a> before. Used as a device to democratise news, their use is on the rise, especially in broadcast news. But the BBC in particular has received complaints that it has used them to propagate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/26/vox-pops-journalists-brexit-will-of-the-people\" title=\"\">false balance over Brexit</a> and they can be something of an unsuccessful TV trope.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://repository.uantwerpen.be/desktop/irua\" title=\"\">University of Antwerp study</a> asked what reporters make of the vox pop and concluded that most of us dislike them. As a vox veteran, I can confirm that trudging along a high street in February, waving a fluffy mic and begging people to stop and give you a soundbite as the light fades is challenging.</p> <p>Every reporter has stories. My favourite is when I jumped out from behind a pillar box to ask an elderly couple: \u201cWhat\u2019s your favourite scary movie?\u201d \u201cMy dear,\u201d one replied witheringly, \u201cwe are Islington intellectuals, we don\u2019t watch scary movies.\u201d But this one, well it works and is probably the only example endorsed by the vox populi.</p> <h2>Jia Tolentino, raising the barre on working out<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c275ede9dca6e54350239811aa2761c93e1c4023\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c275ede9dca6e54350239811aa2761c93e1c4023/0_120_6537_3922/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jia Tolentino\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jia Tolentino: revealing you to be a patsy in expensive sportswear.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Mudd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The writer Jia Tolentino is exceptionally good at decoding these febrile times.

Tolentino\u2019s central conceit is that women \u201care genuinely trapped at the intersection of capitalism and patriarchy\u201d and the \u201chard labour of self-optimisation\u201d is part of that.</p> <p>So, while you might imagine you\u2019re doing great work on your abs and socking it to The Man by visiting boutique exercise studios and becoming physically strong, she reveals you to be a patsy in expensive sportswear. Nobody said this was going to be easy.</p> <p>If, like me, you have succumbed to a barre-based exercise system at a boutique gym, it\u2019s time to face your \u201cpragmatic self-delusion\u201d.

But barre-based exercise has recently experienced a surge in popularity, partly due to its perceived effectiveness; classes are described by Tolentino as \u201ca manic and ritualised activity\u201d.</p> <p>Classes are certainly not for the fainthearted. Then there\u2019s the accessories \u2013 mesh-panelled leggings and kale smoothies \u2013 all of which bump up the cost while simultaneously exposing you as an agent of late-stage capitalism.

      "bodyText": "Unexpectedly last week, a 42-year-old BBC Two vox pop featuring an East End woman in a red raincoat broke the internet. We don\u2019t know her name, but this unassuming star has been watched by millions, decades after stopping to talk to a reporter on a London street. She trounced all the social media competition, including Kylie Minogue performing Do The Locomotion on a miniature railway in Scarborough. The clip was filmed for a 1977 BBC Two series of 28 programmes marking the Queen\u2019s silver jubilee. It was intended for a show called Thanks for the Memory, then billed as the BBC\u2019s biggest vox pop to date, that would ask citizens, \u201cfrom crofters to judges\u201d, for their views on TV of the previous 25 years. Tweeted by the BBC Archive last week for a contemporary audience, there was one standout star. In her headscarf and raincoat, she resembles the social stereotypes that Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie lampooned in the vox pop sections of their sketch show. But those characters held reactionary views, couldn\u2019t stop looking down the lens and offered non sequiturs such as: \u201cThey\u2019ve got hotter pavements, I know that.\u201d However, this woman was a natural communicator, displaying a witty, easy eloquence. What she delivered was more of a social and historical soliloquy that included asides about \u201chighbrow\u201d plays and bad acting. If you haven\u2019t seen it, just watch. A star is born, albeit 42 years after the event. Today, she\u2019d be signed up for Gogglebox. It\u2019s remarkable because no one did this well in a vox pop before. Used as a device to democratise news, their use is on the rise, especially in broadcast news. But the BBC in particular has received complaints that it has used them to propagate false balance over Brexit and they can be something of an unsuccessful TV trope. A University of Antwerp study asked what reporters make of the vox pop and concluded that most of us dislike them. As a vox veteran, I can confirm that trudging along a high street in February, waving a fluffy mic and begging people to stop and give you a soundbite as the light fades is challenging. Every reporter has stories. My favourite is when I jumped out from behind a pillar box to ask an elderly couple: \u201cWhat\u2019s your favourite scary movie?\u201d \u201cMy dear,\u201d one replied witheringly, \u201cwe are Islington intellectuals, we don\u2019t watch scary movies.\u201d But this one, well it works and is probably the only example endorsed by the vox populi. Jia Tolentino, raising the barre on working out The writer Jia Tolentino is exceptionally good at decoding these febrile times. She has been described as the new Joan Didion and in a period when the centre doesn\u2019t feel to be holding at all well, her new collection of essays, Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion, offers a welcome intervention. However, don\u2019t expect go-get-\u2019em affirmations and tips on optimising your time \u00e0 la Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s Lean In. Tolentino\u2019s central conceit is that women \u201care genuinely trapped at the intersection of capitalism and patriarchy\u201d and the \u201chard labour of self-optimisation\u201d is part of that. So, while you might imagine you\u2019re doing great work on your abs and socking it to The Man by visiting boutique exercise studios and becoming physically strong, she reveals you to be a patsy in expensive sportswear. Nobody said this was going to be easy. If, like me, you have succumbed to a barre-based exercise system at a boutique gym, it\u2019s time to face your \u201cpragmatic self-delusion\u201d. The original barre system, based on the strength and flexibility training that dancers endure, was devised by the late Lotte Berk. But barre-based exercise has recently experienced a surge in popularity, partly due to its perceived effectiveness; classes are described by Tolentino as \u201ca manic and ritualised activity\u201d. Classes are certainly not for the fainthearted. Then there\u2019s the accessories \u2013 mesh-panelled leggings and kale smoothies \u2013 all of which bump up the cost while simultaneously exposing you as an agent of late-stage capitalism. As a precaution, I\u2019m taking the rest of the summer off. Ren\u00e9e Tirado, no more fashion faux pas? Best of luck to Ren\u00e9e E Tirado, who joins luxury fashion house Gucci as the brand\u2019s first ever head of diversity, equity and inclusion. She joins fashion from baseball, which I\u2019m sure has its own complexities, but at least there aren\u2019t design teams immortalising their prejudice by turning it into a luxury good and offering it up on a plinth in a major retail space. The recent output of some of the world\u2019s biggest brands includes Gucci\u2019s own $890 (\u00a3689) balaclava jumper, which was accused of transposing blackface to knitwear (naturally, it was released during Black History Month in the US) and Prada\u2019s $550 handbag keychain, described as \u201cSambo-esque\u201d by critics. Most recently, Gucci sent a $790 turban down the runway on a white model. Objectively, it\u2019s hard to comprehend how these items went into production, never mind into shops. This isn\u2019t just one lone designer and a secret sketchpad. Entire committees review designs to make sure they are on trend enough, samples get made and checked, press teams decide how to message new launches. But no one noticed? Tirado\u2019s appointment is welcome, but there\u2019s definitely work to be done. \u2022 Lucy Siegle is a journalist who writes about ethical living",

      "bodyText": "Sequins, like dogs, are not just for Christmas. The essential element of festive dressing has jumped season this year to put the sparkle into summer. But not everyone is happy to see plastic making a comeback just as the fashion industry is trying to become more sustainable. \u201cI love a sparkly dress, but covering a dress in plastic cannot be justified if its worn once and discarded,\u201d says Natalie Fee, founder of City to Sea, which campaigns to stop plastic pollution. \u201cIt needs to be a wardrobe staple.\u201d This summer sequins have been everywhere, from the catwalk to the TV screen. In the recent Love Island finale, two of the four female finalists opted for sequin dresses.

      "body": "<p>There isn\u2019t a taxi driver in Newcastle who doesn\u2019t have something to say about <a href=\"https://www.samfender.com/\" title=\"\">Sam Fender</a>, local lad done good. There\u2019s the one who confides, as if revealing an insider secret, that he\u2019s \u201ca nice kid, and a star for the future.\u201d Another, who says: \u201cWe\u2019ve got him, Ant and Dec and Cheryl Cole who feel proud to be geordie \u2013 not like Alan Shearer, he\u2019s arrogant.\u201d Everyone seems to have seen him play in the<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thelowlightstavern/\" title=\"\"> Low Lights Tavern</a>, where the singer-songwriter fairytale goes that he was spotted by Ben Howard\u2019s manager, scored a deal with Polydor Records, and then a lot more people were hearing about \u201cboy racers tearing down the Beehive Road\u201d (a line from his song Leave Fast). They like that Fender hasn\u2019t forgotten his roots.</p> <p>I\u2019m hoofing it across town because tomorrow Fender is playing his biggest show yet, for 4,000 people at Tynemouth Castle, five minutes from where he lives with his mum in North Shields, half an hour outside the city centre on a cliff edge overlooking the sea. As Fender tells it, these majestic ruins are supposedly where Sting lost his virginity, but they will now also be known as the venue that the 25-year-old singer-songwriter sold out in just 40 minutes. Come the gig, hundreds more people who don\u2019t have tickets snake around the bay with picnics and pints, watching from afar. He makes jokes about egging the local shop and calls out schools (Kings, the private one, gets the biggest boo).</p> <p>His appeal, however, is resonating far beyond his home town \u2013 a spikier version of the pallid, relatable, boy-next-door troubadours who have continually bothered this decade\u2019s charts. You\u2019ve heard them. They are the doughy, well-spoken everymen with guitars, singing emotionally incontinent songs. And they are everywhere, a post-Ed Sheeran contagion of careerist charisma vacuums, ready to croon a bluesy yarn about how they want you just the way you are, girl, before dashing off to play a royal family function.</p> <p>Fender has the guitar, but also the cheekbones of a supermodel and songs about male suicide, the spice epidemic and fear of nuclear disaster. The only songs in his repertoire that are in any way romantic are about drunken casual sex. His foamier lager anthems recall Liam Gallagher, if Liam was in any way woke. But Fender really can write songs. His singles, such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDsFKOrLWhU\" title=\"\">Hypersonic Missiles</a> (also the name of his forthcoming debut album), are lethally catchy \u2013 like a more brooding Killers coupled with a boyish, brass-loving Bruce Springsteen, albeit more Newcastle than New Jersey. And his voice is nothing like the pigeon-warble of his peers, often high-vaulting to Jeff Buckley levels of vulnerability. Elton John is a fan. So is Stormzy, who recently left him a nine-minute voice message about how much he loved his song Dead Boys, a title that leaves little to the imagination.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d13240bedccf58846e85699d7b2339bded8e388c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d13240bedccf58846e85699d7b2339bded8e388c/0_0_1841_1227/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fender performing at the Mouth of the Tyne festival last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fender performing at the Mouth of the Tyne festival last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Newcastle Chronicle</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fender says he feels uncomfortable being lumped in with the Toms, Jameses and Georges of guitar pop. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself as part of that, because I\u2019m from Shields, and up here is a very different world,\u201d he says. It exasperates him a little that most people \u201ccan\u2019t see that \u2013 they probably assume that I\u2019m privately educated\u201d. Or, worse, manufactured.</p> <p>We meet the evening before Fender\u2019s homecoming show, at the studio he built in a former garage with his first music paycheck. It\u2019s late, and someone is still hand-rolling T-shirts in kebab wrappers to sell on his merch stand. A stone\u2019s throw away is the pub where he used to pull pints and perform and where got his break with manager Owain Davies, who spotted him and offered to take him on. \u201cI went to the toilet and burst into tears because suddenly I felt like this is the moment I can change things,\u201d he says, although the journey from there to a record deal was by no means instant. \u201cGranted,\u201d he laughs, \u201cit took seven years.\u201d</p> <p>This is the cheeky chappie I\u2019d read about in past interviews, self-effacing and not afraid of making the odd Ed Sheeran jibe. And yet, while the musician I meet is sweet and sailor-sweary, the guy you\u2019d prop up the bar with, he is also, in his own words, \u201ca bit of an anxious mess\u201d.</p> <p>This is, to be fair, possibly the worst time Fender could be doing an interview. Tomorrow\u2019s show is the first since his voice went on strike a month ago. The following day he is due to support <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/13/bob-dylan-and-neil-young-review-age-has-not-withered-them\" title=\"\">Neil Young and Bob Dylan</a> in Hyde Park. Last month, his voice problems meant he had to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-48783905\" title=\"\">cancel</a> his scheduled Glastonbury appearance; until yesterday, he didn\u2019t know whether he\u2019d be able to sing this week at all, let alone do a press interview. \u201cI did too much and haemorrhaged my vocal cord on the right side,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve not stopped touring for two years, and then I crashed and burned. I realised that you can\u2019t maintain that high. And now I\u2019ve got myself back on my feet and I\u2019m naturally a bit scared. Because this thing, it can destroy you, it really can.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My mum was ill\u00a0and being pushed to work when she wasn\u2019t\u00a0fit to. I\u00a0saw what it was like to struggle</p> <footer> <cite>Sam Fender</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The month off to recuperate gave Fender time to reflect on how fast his career is moving. Last November he released his debut EP. A month later he won the 2019 Brits critics\u2019 choice, the award for breakthrough musicians, previously won by Adele and Sam Smith. He\u2019s now at the stage where he\u2019s appearing on <em>The Graham Norton Show</em> and can\u2019t walk down the street without being asked for a selfie. \u201cNothing feels the same any more,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve spent my entire life wanting to be successful, trying to get away from hardship, or from seeing my mum sad. And I\u2019ve got that now and it\u2019s very strange. So many amazing things have happened in this last year \u2013 it\u2019s no wonder people turn to drugs because it\u2019s bonkers. And there\u2019s a lot of paranoia.\u201d</p> <p>For Fender, music was a way to get out of his situation. His father and brother were local gigging musicians but when his parents separated he moved in with his mum on a council estate and abandoned his A-Levels while trying to look after her and bring in money. \u201cMe and my mum were below the breadline. She was mentally ill and didn\u2019t work full-time and she was constantly going to tribunals about having to go to work again. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve got a thing against the DWP and the Tories, \u2019cause they were always breathing down her neck and pushing her to work when she wasn\u2019t fit to. I saw what it was like to struggle.\u201d</p> <p>He stops himself. \u201c[I sound like] I\u2019m playing the whole \u2018poor northerner boy\u2019 sympathy card. I hate that. You don\u2019t want to cling on to the whole \u2018I\u2019m a class hero\u2019 thing, because it can seem not genuine at all, like. Technically, I started off quite comfortable. I lived in a council estate for half of my life, but not the beginning of it. Before my parents split up, we lived in one of them terraced houses, which was quite nice.

If you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to live [it makes you] want to write songs that actually mean something to us.\u201d</p> <p>Some of those song titles do come across as if they were chosen from a social issues randomiser. If the kids want someone authentic to tackle the big themes, Fender has them cued up: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdeXq-txCd0\" title=\"\">Millennial</a> (social media addiction), <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEGzj2Pc2mE\" title=\"\">Poundshop Kardashians</a> (more social media addiction) and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L12ORqw6R7A\" title=\"\">Play God</a> (faceless politicians). But he also writes convincingly about the bleak scenes in his backyard, kitchen-sink songs like<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSbxqLM92iY\" title=\"\"> Leave </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSbxqLM92iY\" title=\"\">Fast</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVSIhm7rvjo\" title=\"\">Friday Fighting</a> and a new one, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd3QClLF7_U\" title=\"\">The Borders</a>. He says, seriously, that he can\u2019t divulge details about the last one \u201cbecause I don\u2019t want to get my head kicked in\u201d but it\u2019s broadly about feeling guilty that his life turned out well while some of his peers got left behind. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcO8uV2n3Ys\" title=\"\">Dead Boys</a>, meanwhile, was written after two friends from Tynemouth killed themselves (the suicide rate in the north-east is the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/suicidesintheunitedkingdom/2017registrations#suicides-in-2017-by-english-region\" title=\"\">highest in </a><a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/suicidesintheunitedkingdom/2017registrations#suicides-in-2017-by-english-region\" title=\"\">England</a>).

For <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE4WkDA6FE\" title=\"\">Greasy Spoon</a>, a song about \u201ca girl who was being sexually abused\u201d, he was criticised for trying to embody the female experience. Then Poundshop Kardashians, his takedown of <em>Geordie Shore</em> wannabes, with biting lines such as: \u201cBeautiful people devoid of emotion\u2026 thick as fuck and soulless\u201d, was seen by some as too simplistic, even nasty. Tellingly, it will not appear on his debut album (due in September).</p> <p>\u201cWith hindsight, I think I was quite naive,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe that came across a bit too heavy-handed.\u201d But he does feel that some of it has been taken out of context. \u201cThe song is about my home town and then it starts to talk about celebrity culture, but it\u2019s been perceived by a select few as having a pop at girls for wearing makeup, which is just ludicrous. I\u2019m talking about people being famous for nothing.\u201d</p> <p>It is perhaps for this reason that he says he\u2019s already distrustful of journalists. \u201cDo you reckon they drafted you in to annihilate me?\u201d he says bashfully, before asking what I think of the album. He reckons that cynics will \u201cprobably slate it because I\u2019m on a major label and I write pop songs\u201d, even though he eschewed an expensive London studio to work with his usual producer, the bizarrely monikered Bramwell Bronte, in sheds and his mum\u2019s front room, before moving into his own studio. He seems gently perplexed that, while the bands he admires like <a href=\"https://www.idlesband.com/\" title=\"\">I</a><a href=\"https://www.idlesband.com/\" title=\"\">dles</a> and Fontaines DC are signed to independent labels and praised for being authentic, he is sometimes treated with suspicion. \u201cEverybody sees you\u2019re on a major label and they just assume that you\u2019re mass produced,\u201d he says.</p> <p>At least he is attempting to put songs like new album track White Privilege on Radio 1 \u2013 a song on which he \u201cspewed out\u201d our conflicted political discourse, and \u201cmy bipolar thoughts about it all as well\u201d. Brexit, of course, has an honorary mention. Says Fender: \u201cOne minute I consider myself leftwing, but then I feel like there\u2019s also a lot of really condescending people on the left that alienate working class people.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f244265134361e4ba144c1d774cba3c5c9e73073\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f244265134361e4ba144c1d774cba3c5c9e73073/0_0_3712_5568/667.jpg\" alt=\"Winning the Brits critics\u2019 choice award in February.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Winning the Brits critics\u2019 choice award <br> in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the song also acknowledges his own entitlement. \u201cI can\u2019t ever escape being a white boy with a guitar, and that is privilege in itself,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not doubting that I can write a little bit of a tune here and there, but I do think that it would have been harder if I wasn\u2019t [a white man], you know what I mean? There was a list of <a href=\"https://charts.radiox.co.uk/2019/\" title=\"\">Radio X\u2019s top 100 British songs</a> the other day and, of those, there were three female artists in that entire list and I had three songs on it alone. How fucked up is that?\u201d</p> <p>Fender says that while he writes politically minded songs, he doesn\u2019t have any answers. He is, like his hero Springsteen, just saying what he sees \u2013 except when it comes to dating. \u201cNobody wants to hear about my horrendous love life,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m soppy and boring. If I write about stuff that grinds my gears or something that actually affects our country, then it becomes something worth singing. I\u2019m not clever enough to fix these problems, or lead the charge. I just write about something that\u2019s stirred me up enough on a Tuesday afternoon while I\u2019m battling my way through a pack of chocolate digestives, drinking tea, watching daytime telly.\u201d</p> <p>He is, perhaps, selling himself a bit short. At the Tynemouth show, a group of local lads, all 23, are cracking open tinnies and bantering. I ask what they like about Sam, and two of them, Declan and Adam, are so sincerely on-message that they could have been planted by a marketing executive (they haven\u2019t).</p> <p>\u201cThe northeast has got a lot of things to say but no one wants to listen,\u201d Adam says. Which is why, continues Declan, \u201cthe Dead Boys song means a lot. We connect with that because we\u2019re all north-east boys. He knows the battles that we\u2019ve been through. Up here, people top themselves on a daily basis\u201d, which means it\u2019s even more powerful to see thousands of fans at the gig sing along to it.</p> <p>Fender, they say, is helping to change perceptions. \u201cA lot of people here are portrayed as a bit thick,\u201d says Adam. \u201cSeverely working class, nothing going on. But there\u2019s a lot of really eloquent, intelligent people with a lot of things to say, like Sam Fender. He\u2019s giving our generation a voice \u2013 and not just our generation but the area on the whole.\u201d</p> <p><em>Hypersonic Missiles is released on 13 September on Polydor</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "There isn\u2019t a taxi driver in Newcastle who doesn\u2019t have something to say about Sam Fender, local lad done good. There\u2019s the one who confides, as if revealing an insider secret, that he\u2019s \u201ca nice kid, and a star for the future.\u201d Another, who says: \u201cWe\u2019ve got him, Ant and Dec and Cheryl Cole who feel proud to be geordie \u2013 not like Alan Shearer, he\u2019s arrogant.\u201d Everyone seems to have seen him play in the Low Lights Tavern, where the singer-songwriter fairytale goes that he was spotted by Ben Howard\u2019s manager, scored a deal with Polydor Records, and then a lot more people were hearing about \u201cboy racers tearing down the Beehive Road\u201d (a line from his song Leave Fast). They like that Fender hasn\u2019t forgotten his roots. I\u2019m hoofing it across town because tomorrow Fender is playing his biggest show yet, for 4,000 people at Tynemouth Castle, five minutes from where he lives with his mum in North Shields, half an hour outside the city centre on a cliff edge overlooking the sea. As Fender tells it, these majestic ruins are supposedly where Sting lost his virginity, but they will now also be known as the venue that the 25-year-old singer-songwriter sold out in just 40 minutes. Come the gig, hundreds more people who don\u2019t have tickets snake around the bay with picnics and pints, watching from afar. He makes jokes about egging the local shop and calls out schools (Kings, the private one, gets the biggest boo). His appeal, however, is resonating far beyond his home town \u2013 a spikier version of the pallid, relatable, boy-next-door troubadours who have continually bothered this decade\u2019s charts. You\u2019ve heard them. They are the doughy, well-spoken everymen with guitars, singing emotionally incontinent songs. And they are everywhere, a post-Ed Sheeran contagion of careerist charisma vacuums, ready to croon a bluesy yarn about how they want you just the way you are, girl, before dashing off to play a royal family function. Fender has the guitar, but also the cheekbones of a supermodel and songs about male suicide, the spice epidemic and fear of nuclear disaster. The only songs in his repertoire that are in any way romantic are about drunken casual sex. His foamier lager anthems recall Liam Gallagher, if Liam was in any way woke. But Fender really can write songs. His singles, such as Hypersonic Missiles (also the name of his forthcoming debut album), are lethally catchy \u2013 like a more brooding Killers coupled with a boyish, brass-loving Bruce Springsteen, albeit more Newcastle than New Jersey. And his voice is nothing like the pigeon-warble of his peers, often high-vaulting to Jeff Buckley levels of vulnerability. Elton John is a fan. So is Stormzy, who recently left him a nine-minute voice message about how much he loved his song Dead Boys, a title that leaves little to the imagination. Fender says he feels uncomfortable being lumped in with the Toms, Jameses and Georges of guitar pop. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself as part of that, because I\u2019m from Shields, and up here is a very different world,\u201d he says. It exasperates him a little that most people \u201ccan\u2019t see that \u2013 they probably assume that I\u2019m privately educated\u201d. Or, worse, manufactured. We meet the evening before Fender\u2019s homecoming show, at the studio he built in a former garage with his first music paycheck. It\u2019s late, and someone is still hand-rolling T-shirts in kebab wrappers to sell on his merch stand. A stone\u2019s throw away is the pub where he used to pull pints and perform and where got his break with manager Owain Davies, who spotted him and offered to take him on. \u201cI went to the toilet and burst into tears because suddenly I felt like this is the moment I can change things,\u201d he says, although the journey from there to a record deal was by no means instant. \u201cGranted,\u201d he laughs, \u201cit took seven years.\u201d This is the cheeky chappie I\u2019d read about in past interviews, self-effacing and not afraid of making the odd Ed Sheeran jibe. And yet, while the musician I meet is sweet and sailor-sweary, the guy you\u2019d prop up the bar with, he is also, in his own words, \u201ca bit of an anxious mess\u201d. This is, to be fair, possibly the worst time Fender could be doing an interview. Tomorrow\u2019s show is the first since his voice went on strike a month ago. The following day he is due to support Neil Young and Bob Dylan in Hyde Park. Last month, his voice problems meant he had to cancel his scheduled Glastonbury appearance; until yesterday, he didn\u2019t know whether he\u2019d be able to sing this week at all, let alone do a press interview. \u201cI did too much and haemorrhaged my vocal cord on the right side,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve not stopped touring for two years, and then I crashed and burned. I realised that you can\u2019t maintain that high. And now I\u2019ve got myself back on my feet and I\u2019m naturally a bit scared. Because this thing, it can destroy you, it really can.\u201d The month off to recuperate gave Fender time to reflect on how fast his career is moving. Last November he released his debut EP. A month later he won the 2019 Brits critics\u2019 choice, the award for breakthrough musicians, previously won by Adele and Sam Smith. He\u2019s now at the stage where he\u2019s appearing on The Graham Norton Show and can\u2019t walk down the street without being asked for a selfie. \u201cNothing feels the same any more,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve spent my entire life wanting to be successful, trying to get away from hardship, or from seeing my mum sad. And I\u2019ve got that now and it\u2019s very strange. So many amazing things have happened in this last year \u2013 it\u2019s no wonder people turn to drugs because it\u2019s bonkers. And there\u2019s a lot of paranoia.\u201d For Fender, music was a way to get out of his situation. His father and brother were local gigging musicians but when his parents separated he moved in with his mum on a council estate and abandoned his A-Levels while trying to look after her and bring in money. \u201cMe and my mum were below the breadline. She was mentally ill and didn\u2019t work full-time and she was constantly going to tribunals about having to go to work again. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve got a thing against the DWP and the Tories, \u2019cause they were always breathing down her neck and pushing her to work when she wasn\u2019t fit to. I saw what it was like to struggle.\u201d He stops himself. \u201c[I sound like] I\u2019m playing the whole \u2018poor northerner boy\u2019 sympathy card. I hate that. You don\u2019t want to cling on to the whole \u2018I\u2019m a class hero\u2019 thing, because it can seem not genuine at all, like. Technically, I started off quite comfortable. I lived in a council estate for half of my life, but not the beginning of it. Before my parents split up, we lived in one of them terraced houses, which was quite nice. And my dad was working, and my mum was a nurse. But if I\u2019m honest about it, the past 10 years of my life were tough. It wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d It\u2019s why he grew up having \u201ca chip on my shoulder\u201d when it came to music. \u201cA lot of the bands that I knew around town were kids from the private schools. I used to hear about the Tom Odells of the world and be like: \u2018It\u2019s easy for you.\u2019\u201d And it wasn\u2019t just a class thing: even when he started \u201ctouring with the Nick Mulveys and George Ezras\u201d he says he couldn\u2019t shake the \u201cfeeling like I didn\u2019t belong\u2026 I used to feel so thick\u201d. Still, when he was 18, he says he desperately tried to write the \u201cbluesy crappy songs\u201d they did, because he assumed that\u2019s what you needed to sound like to make it. \u201cI saw what the George Ezras and James Bays had achieved and I was like, \u2018I need to try and write some love songs that connect,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI hated my job, I hated being in the flat with my mam where we lived at the time. I was desperate to get out of that. I did everything I could to write the songs that I thought would get us there.\u201d But then he had a health scare, quite a serious one. He isn\u2019t ready to discuss it publicly because, he says, \u201cI don\u2019t want to become a charity case, or for it to look like I\u2019m capitalising on it as a way to make people like my tunes\u201d, adding: \u201cI\u2019ll probably talk about it eventually, just not now.\u201d But it was, he says, a \u201ccrazy traumatic experience\u201d and that his recovery refocused his songwriting efforts. \u201cI started writing for myself, as opposed to what I thought people wanted to hear. If you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to live [it makes you] want to write songs that actually mean something to us.\u201d Some of those song titles do come across as if they were chosen from a social issues randomiser. If the kids want someone authentic to tackle the big themes, Fender has them cued up: Millennial (social media addiction), Poundshop Kardashians (more social media addiction) and Play God (faceless politicians). But he also writes convincingly about the bleak scenes in his backyard, kitchen-sink songs like Leave Fast, Friday Fighting and a new one, The Borders. He says, seriously, that he can\u2019t divulge details about the last one \u201cbecause I don\u2019t want to get my head kicked in\u201d but it\u2019s broadly about feeling guilty that his life turned out well while some of his peers got left behind. Dead Boys, meanwhile, was written after two friends from Tynemouth killed themselves (the suicide rate in the north-east is the highest in England). After his gig, Fender tells me shakily that he could see their houses and workplaces from the stage. While people have got in touch to say that songs like Dead Boys have saved their lives, he has also faced some backlash. For Greasy Spoon, a song about \u201ca girl who was being sexually abused\u201d, he was criticised for trying to embody the female experience. Then Poundshop Kardashians, his takedown of Geordie Shore wannabes, with biting lines such as: \u201cBeautiful people devoid of emotion\u2026 thick as fuck and soulless\u201d, was seen by some as too simplistic, even nasty. Tellingly, it will not appear on his debut album (due in September). \u201cWith hindsight, I think I was quite naive,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe that came across a bit too heavy-handed.\u201d But he does feel that some of it has been taken out of context. \u201cThe song is about my home town and then it starts to talk about celebrity culture, but it\u2019s been perceived by a select few as having a pop at girls for wearing makeup, which is just ludicrous.

He reckons that cynics will \u201cprobably slate it because I\u2019m on a major label and I write pop songs\u201d, even though he eschewed an expensive London studio to work with his usual producer, the bizarrely monikered Bramwell Bronte, in sheds and his mum\u2019s front room, before moving into his own studio. He seems gently perplexed that, while the bands he admires like Idles and Fontaines DC are signed to independent labels and praised for being authentic, he is sometimes treated with suspicion. \u201cEverybody sees you\u2019re on a major label and they just assume that you\u2019re mass produced,\u201d he says. At least he is attempting to put songs like new album track White Privilege on Radio 1 \u2013 a song on which he \u201cspewed out\u201d our conflicted political discourse, and \u201cmy bipolar thoughts about it all as well\u201d.

Which is why, continues Declan, \u201cthe Dead Boys song means a lot. We connect with that because we\u2019re all north-east boys. He knows the battles that we\u2019ve been through. Up here, people top themselves on a daily basis\u201d, which means it\u2019s even more powerful to see thousands of fans at the gig sing along to it. Fender, they say, is helping to change perceptions. \u201cA lot of people here are portrayed as a bit thick,\u201d says Adam. \u201cSeverely working class, nothing going on. But there\u2019s a lot of really eloquent, intelligent people with a lot of things to say, like Sam Fender. He\u2019s giving our generation a voice \u2013 and not just our generation but the area on the whole.\u201d Hypersonic Missiles is released on 13 September on Polydor",

I hadn\u2019t been looking to add another child to the family. We had our son at home, also 14, and my older son, aged 25, from a previous relationship was finally moving out. Suddenly, at 52, right when I thought I was done with mothering, I had a brand new teenage daughter.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The social workers asked me the most prying questions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was plunged into a world that had previously been unknown to me: social workers, foster training, adoption panels, mental health professionals, monthly supervision\u2026 and that\u2019s not to mention the pets that our foster daughter brought to the household: three rats, Becky the gecko, Eliza the lizard, two guinea pigs and latterly a corn snake (this one is a very beautiful iridescent lemon colour, of fascinating muscularity. Like so many things about this experience: not at all what I expected).</p> <p>I had an exhausting number of interviews after I made the decision to apply for a long-term foster placement for our daughter. Actually, it was jointly agreed, my husband is very involved, and our other son, too, but in the early formal dealings it felt to me to be much more about me, and my fitness or lack of it for the task.</p> <p>It is bizarre to recount your life from birth to the present to a stranger who is taking notes and trying to decide if he can recommend you to be a foster parent to a panel of experts. I found myself saying, more than once, \u201cI did want kids yes, but um actually, what I really wanted was to be a writer\u2026\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Although the social</strong></em> workers asked me the most prying and startling questions (\u201cAre there any sex toys in the house?\u201d \u201cCan you guarantee that there is no porn on any of the devices that anyone in the household owns?\u201d \u201cHave you ever terminated a pregnancy?\u201d), they were singularly uninterested in any discussion of my life outside the home: the things that matter immensely to me and are probably the greatest indicator of who I am.</p> <p>Given that my foster daughter is conscientious and clever and had from the first time we met said that she hoped to work in politics, I assumed it relevant to mention my professional life, because it might offer her some kind of role model. But no. We might have been in the 1950s: their entire definition of me was as a mother. It was a sensation I hadn\u2019t felt in a while. For 25 years, to be exact, since my first son was born.</p> <p>I remember his tiny little form, squirming and yelling, placed in my arms at Homerton hospital in Hackney, and me thinking, \u201cI guess I\u2019m not the maternal type \u2013 blimey! Can I do this?\u201d</p> <p>Where do we get the idea from that there\u2019s a type? Back then, I consoled myself by reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jun/15/featuresreviews.guardianreview6\" title=\"\">Adrienne Rich\u2019s</a> fabulous <em>Of Woman Born</em> and decided that this was the only guide to motherhood I needed. Rather than being defined as mothers, or by their status as childless, women should be defined in terms of themselves, as all humans should be, claimed Rich. Nor should becoming a mother mean women are isolated and not allowed to participate in the social and professional world. Instead, Rich called for \u201ca world in which every woman is the presiding genius of her own body\u201d.</p> <p>The qualities needed as a foster parent (commitment, a sense of humour, empathy, kindness, imagination, resilience, advocacy skills, flexibility) are just as likely to be intrinsic personality traits or skills gained in working life than acquired by the mysterious route of becoming a mother. I was asked, during one of the most searching and tiring of my social worker interviews, had I ever cared for a child who wasn\u2019t my own? A stepchild for instance, which is, after all, a very common experience. I shook my head.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I learned that I could indeed feel love for a\u00a0child that wasn\u2019t mine</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And then suddenly I remembered Connor \u2013 a child I looked after on graduating from university, years before my own son was born. I worked as an au pair in the early 1980s for two different families in London and in one of them, I found myself taking care of a five-year-old boy whose mother had recently died. He was very lovable, blond and cuddly, but he would sometimes stop mid-sentence to ask, heart-breakingly: \u201cWhere is Mummy?\u201d Once, he told me: \u201cI have a film running in my head and Mummy is in it.\u201d He would rock himself to sleep, bashing his head from side to side in his bed, and then abruptly sit up and stare and scream that Mummy was in the room with us. Although I hadn\u2019t thought about Connor in a long time, that experience, of being invited into the imaginative world of a grief-stricken five-year-old, had been sad and indelible.</p> <p><em><strong>My latest novel,</strong></em> set 10 years earlier in the 1970s, inspired by the murder of Sandra Rivett, nanny to Lord and Lady Lucan, tells the story of two young women coming to London to work as nannies. Like me, their main motivation was to escape their boring lives in a small village, ironically to escape, too, the prescribed route of wife and mother, and have independence, adventures and romance in the big city. One of the girls is a Norland nanny, but the other, Mandy, probably hadn\u2019t thought that hard about the huge responsibility for the emotional wellbeing of the children in her care that foster parents are quite rightly grilled about.</p> <p>For young women, being a nanny has the added appeal of being provided with a room in a home, perhaps a car, too, as well as an income. What many don\u2019t anticipate is how intimate the experience will be; how you will be dunked at once into the emotional soup of the family you work for. A foster parent, meanwhile, is offered ongoing supervision by a social worker and some training, but I think real support comes from the networks you have already set up by the time you reach my age. How glad I was to be older, with all that genuine experience under my belt. Energy, a partner I can talk things over with, sharing the emotional ups and downs, good health and good friends have proved more useful than any \u201ctraining\u201d or preparation for the role.</p> <p>These days I also know how to ask for help where needed from others \u2013 mental health professionals or friends \u2013 something I was reluctant to do when younger.</p> <p>Five years along, the emphasis in supervision on \u201cindependence\u201d and preparing my foster daughter for adulthood has made me more conscious of doing the same for my teenage son, too. This means they both do their own washing, can cook a decent meal, budget for a weekly shop and get themselves to places by bike (him) or car (her) without asking us for lifts or money. We are no longer deemed foster carers but \u201csupported lodgings providers\u201d under an excellent local authority scheme which provides young people aged between 16 and 21 with a room in a friendly home and the support and guidance of an adult living there.</p> <p><em><strong>Anyone who has</strong></em> reached adulthood knows the veering between adult and child that happens during adolescence and how many things can go wrong. Those in the care system are hugely disadvantaged by this lack of a home, support or safety and the outcomes for such young people reflect that vulnerability, with a shocking 25% of the homeless population having been in care as children. My daughter, now 19, is among only 6% of care leavers who will go to university. Getting a place at university is all her own doing \u2013 she\u2019s determined, clever and hard working \u2013 and our pride in her is intense.</p> <p>Still, looking after a child who is asking questions you don\u2019t have answers for, or has experienced loss or trauma, will always be a testing experience. A child\u2019s nightmares sometimes seep into yours, too. That first little charge of mine, Connor, did teach me that I had some mettle I could draw on in emergencies. He taught me \u2013 as I discovered with my daughter, too \u2013 that I could indeed feel love for a child who wasn\u2019t mine.</p> <p>But of all the probing questions the interviewer asked me to determine my suitability as a foster parent, love, the most important word, was not mentioned at all. </p> <p><em>Jill Dawson\u2019s novel, The Language of Birds, inspired by the sensational Lord Lucan case, is published by Sceptre at \u00a318.99.

My latest novel, set 10 years earlier in the 1970s, inspired by the murder of Sandra Rivett, nanny to Lord and Lady Lucan, tells the story of two young women coming to London to work as nannies. Like me, their main motivation was to escape their boring lives in a small village, ironically to escape, too, the prescribed route of wife and mother, and have independence, adventures and romance in the big city. One of the girls is a Norland nanny, but the other, Mandy, probably hadn\u2019t thought that hard about the huge responsibility for the emotional wellbeing of the children in her care that foster parents are quite rightly grilled about. For young women, being a nanny has the added appeal of being provided with a room in a home, perhaps a car, too, as well as an income. What many don\u2019t anticipate is how intimate the experience will be; how you will be dunked at once into the emotional soup of the family you work for. A foster parent, meanwhile, is offered ongoing supervision by a social worker and some training, but I think real support comes from the networks you have already set up by the time you reach my age. How glad I was to be older, with all that genuine experience under my belt. Energy, a partner I can talk things over with, sharing the emotional ups and downs, good health and good friends have proved more useful than any \u201ctraining\u201d or preparation for the role. These days I also know how to ask for help where needed from others \u2013 mental health professionals or friends \u2013 something I was reluctant to do when younger. Five years along, the emphasis in supervision on \u201cindependence\u201d and preparing my foster daughter for adulthood has made me more conscious of doing the same for my teenage son, too. This means they both do their own washing, can cook a decent meal, budget for a weekly shop and get themselves to places by bike (him) or car (her) without asking us for lifts or money. We are no longer deemed foster carers but \u201csupported lodgings providers\u201d under an excellent local authority scheme which provides young people aged between 16 and 21 with a room in a friendly home and the support and guidance of an adult living there. Anyone who has reached adulthood knows the veering between adult and child that happens during adolescence and how many things can go wrong. Those in the care system are hugely disadvantaged by this lack of a home, support or safety and the outcomes for such young people reflect that vulnerability, with a shocking 25% of the homeless population having been in care as children. My daughter, now 19, is among only 6% of care leavers who will go to university. Getting a place at university is all her own doing \u2013 she\u2019s determined, clever and hard working \u2013 and our pride in her is intense. Still, looking after a child who is asking questions you don\u2019t have answers for, or has experienced loss or trauma, will always be a testing experience. A child\u2019s nightmares sometimes seep into yours, too. That first little charge of mine, Connor, did teach me that I had some mettle I could draw on in emergencies. He taught me \u2013 as I discovered with my daughter, too \u2013 that I could indeed feel love for a child who wasn\u2019t mine. But of all the probing questions the interviewer asked me to determine my suitability as a foster parent, love, the most important word, was not mentioned at all.

Bad Behaviour nags very nicely in the ear, bang on trend in its admixture of US R&amp;B and diffuse Caribbean stylings.</p> <p>There\u2019s no shortage of hits-in-waiting on this tracklisting either. FML might pose problems as a single release (its chorus is \u201cfuck my life\u201d), but you couldn\u2019t imagine such a catchy trap-pop bagatelle failing.</p> <p>But with the exception of OK (Anxiety Anthem), produced unmemorably by the usually excellent MNEK, these 14 tunes could have been made by anyone with a well-oiled larynx. Even as Mabel\u2019s voice stands proudly without Auto-Tune, <em>High Expectations</em> is just disappointingly all right, lacking any playfulness, or top spin, or a sense of who Mabel is. Her own emotional truths seem scarce. OK, which probes Mabel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/03/one-to-watch-mabel-r-and-b-singer-bedroom-ep-neneh-cherry\" title=\"\">anxiety</a>, presents a series of worn phrases for lyrics, the production bereft of either nerve-jangle or succour.</p> <p>Ultimately, <em>High Expectations</em> trades in well-appointed, British-tilting genericness that ticks Spotify playlist boxes, promising party vibes and availability, then wallowing in non-specific romantic dismay. The prospect of lots of hot sex is no bad thing, but songs about it abound; you could imagine any one of pop\u2019s reigning female front-people being very grateful to have bagged <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY1tULEr4-4\" title=\"\">Mad Love</a> from a bidding round: Dua, Rita, Ariana.

You\u2019re reminded of Lauryn Hill\u2019s advice in Doo Wop (That Thing), all those years ago, but evergreen: \u201cDon\u2019t be hard rock when you really are a gem.\u201d If chart hits and playlist ubiquity are the metrics, then Mabel has got High Expectations exactly right. The songs that have preceded this 14-track album are currently accreting streams hand over fist. Don\u2019t Call Me Up \u2013 in which Mabel declares herself over her former lover \u2013 has more than 101m YouTube views and over 250m plays on Spotify. Just out, the video for Bad Behaviour is closing in on 1.5m views on YouTube. None of these tunes lacks lustre. Don\u2019t Call Me Up holds up well in pop\u2019s kiss-off subgenre (Icona Pop\u2019s I Don\u2019t Care, Dua Lipa\u2019s IDGAF). Bad Behaviour nags very nicely in the ear, bang on trend in its admixture of US R&amp;B and diffuse Caribbean stylings. There\u2019s no shortage of hits-in-waiting on this tracklisting either. FML might pose problems as a single release (its chorus is \u201cfuck my life\u201d), but you couldn\u2019t imagine such a catchy trap-pop bagatelle failing. But with the exception of OK (Anxiety Anthem), produced unmemorably by the usually excellent MNEK, these 14 tunes could have been made by anyone with a well-oiled larynx. Even as Mabel\u2019s voice stands proudly without Auto-Tune, High Expectations is just disappointingly all right, lacking any playfulness, or top spin, or a sense of who Mabel is. Her own emotional truths seem scarce. OK, which probes Mabel\u2019s anxiety, presents a series of worn phrases for lyrics, the production bereft of either nerve-jangle or succour. Ultimately, High Expectations trades in well-appointed, British-tilting genericness that ticks Spotify playlist boxes, promising party vibes and availability, then wallowing in non-specific romantic dismay. The prospect of lots of hot sex is no bad thing, but songs about it abound; you could imagine any one of pop\u2019s reigning female front-people being very grateful to have bagged Mad Love from a bidding round: Dua, Rita, Ariana. Here, as everywhere, Rihanna\u2019s husky, catch-in-the-throat R&amp;B is the model: fine when she does it, just overdone when everyone from Anne-Marie to Zara Larsson affects the same sexpot weariness. Rewind, and Mabel had a personality. Thinking of You (2016) channelled Jessie Ware. Mabel showed some backbone too, with lyrics that seemed to have been written by a sentient human, not an automated come-hither generator. Bedroom, back in May 2017, found Mabel fuming: \u201cI broke your guitar up against your television and I smashed every glass that you had in your kitchen.\u201d But however classy Jessie Ware is, she has not had massive worldwide hits to date. The road on which sweet-natured, retro-tinged emotional soul-pop runs is short. The stuff made from trap beats, tropical breezes and a little lubriciousness opens up a vast highway. And that\u2019s the road Mabel is travelling.",

But women, we\u2019re told, even if we profess to be ambivalent about kids, are biologically wired for motherhood. When British journalist Holly Brockwell tried to get sterilized in her 20s she couldn\u2019t find a doctor who would agree to do the procedure. \u201cI\u2019ve probably put more thought into my decision not to have children than many people put into their decision to have them,\u201d Brockwell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/28/why-wont-nhs-let-me-be-sterilised\">wrote in a 2015 Guardian op-ed</a>. Nevertheless, people kept on knowingly telling her she would change her mind. Brockwell didn\u2019t change her mind and got her tubes tied at the age of 30 after, she tells me via Twitter direct message, \u201cmany, many doctor\u2019s appointments pleading\u201d. This she says, \u201cwas a waste of everyone\u2019s time and energy, and in the meantime I got accidentally pregnant and had a traumatic miscarriage that could have been completely avoided if I\u2019d just been listened to. I\u2019m now 33, and tying my tubes is the best thing I ever did. Not a smidge of regret \u2026 I\u2019m very happy.\u201d</p> <p>You don\u2019t need to have children to have a happy, fulfilling life. That shouldn\u2019t need to be said in 2019 but the constant pressure to procreate means that, unfortunately, it does. Indeed, there\u2019s evidence that women are actually happier without kids. \u201cThe healthiest and happiest population subgroup are women who never married or had children,\u201d Paul Dolan, a professor of behavioural science, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/may/25/women-happier-without-children-or-a-spouse-happiness-expert\">told an audience at the Hay </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/may/25/women-happier-without-children-or-a-spouse-happiness-expert\">festival earlier this year</a>. Dolan noted that traditional markers of measuring success, like marriage and children, no longer correlate with happiness. This is particularly true if you live somewhere like America, which loves fetuses, but is incredibly hostile to motherhood. <a href=\"https://qz.com/708438/the-parenting-happiness-gap-is-real-new-research-confirms/\">Research shows that parents in America are significantly less happy than non-parents</a>; this happiness gap is due to a dearth of family-friendly policies such as subsidized child care and paid sick leave.</p> <p>After receiving a lot of flack for his tweet, Molyneaux doubled down on it and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StefanMolyneux/status/1157307086415519744?s=20\">wrote</a>: \u201cWOMEN HAVE BEEN BULLIED BY PROPAGANDA INTO NOT HAVING CHILDREN. I\u2019m just countering the narrative so younger women can be reminded of a real choice.\u201d Quite the opposite is true of course. Women have been bullied into thinking we\u2019ve got to race against our biological clocks and have children lest we regret it forever. It\u2019s always worth being reminded, I think, that we can choose to ignore the tyranny of our \u201cbiological clocks\u201d and reclaim our time.</p> <h2>Our women on the ground</h2> <p>Arab women are often portrayed as oppressed, silenced victims in the western media. So I\u2019m ridiculously excited about <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/books/review-women-on-the-ground-arab-women-reporting-zahra-hankir.html\">Our Women on the Ground: Essays by Arab Women Reporting From the Arab World</a>, a new anthology edited by the Lebanese-British journalist Zahra Hankir that amplifies badass voices from the Arab world. \u201cThe Arab women journalists in this collection of essays take control of the narrative by telling their own stories about the region\u2019s many conflicts and how they\u2019ve affected them personally, without holding back,\u201d Hankir told me. \u201cTogether, their stories demonstrate why it\u2019s important to include more native voices in mainstream media newsrooms as we seek to better understand the region and its many nuances.\u201d</p> <h2>India bans instant divorce</h2> <p>India\u2019s parliament has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/31/triple-talaq-india-hails-historic-day-as-parliament-outlaws-islamic-instant-divorce\">criminalized the practice of \u201ctriple-talaq</a>\u201d, which allows a Muslim man to instantly divorce his wife by saying \u201c<em>talaq</em>\u201d (which means divorce in Arabic) three times. \u201cThis is a historic day, the injustice that was going on with Muslim women, India\u2019s parliament has given them justice,\u201d law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said in Delhi. While the new law is certainly good news I have a feeling it may have been motivated by the Modi government\u2019s rampant Islamophobia rather than a genuine concern for women.</p> <h2>Saudi Arabia relaxes guardianship laws</h2> <p>Huge news from Saudi Arabia, which has just revised its archaic laws and will let women travel without <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/01/saudi-women-can-now-travel-without-a-male-guardian-reports-say\">the permission of a male guardian</a>.

So I\u2019m ridiculously excited about Our Women on the Ground: Essays by Arab Women Reporting From the Arab World, a new anthology edited by the Lebanese-British journalist Zahra Hankir that amplifies badass voices from the Arab world. \u201cThe Arab women journalists in this collection of essays take control of the narrative by telling their own stories about the region\u2019s many conflicts and how they\u2019ve affected them personally, without holding back,\u201d Hankir told me. \u201cTogether, their stories demonstrate why it\u2019s important to include more native voices in mainstream media newsrooms as we seek to better understand the region and its many nuances.\u201d India bans instant divorce India\u2019s parliament has criminalized the practice of \u201ctriple-talaq\u201d, which allows a Muslim man to instantly divorce his wife by saying \u201ctalaq\u201d (which means divorce in Arabic) three times. \u201cThis is a historic day, the injustice that was going on with Muslim women, India\u2019s parliament has given them justice,\u201d law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said in Delhi. While the new law is certainly good news I have a feeling it may have been motivated by the Modi government\u2019s rampant Islamophobia rather than a genuine concern for women. Saudi Arabia relaxes guardianship laws Huge news from Saudi Arabia, which has just revised its archaic laws and will let women travel without the permission of a male guardian. While this is a great step forward, please let\u2019s not forget that a number of women\u2019s rights activists who fought for this change are still detained without charge and have reportedly been subject to torture and sexual abuse. Kids think bearded men are strong \u2026 but unattractive \u201cA new study suggests that, until they reach puberty, kids are strongly anti-beard \u2013 although children with bearded fathers did feel more warmly toward facial hair,\u201d NPR reports. The Republican party\u2019s woman problem Politico Playbook reports: \u201cA fun stat that\u2019s making its way around GOP circles: there are more men named Jim in the House than Republican women running for re-election.\u201d Gee I wonder why there aren\u2019t more women running to represent an incredibly misogynistic party? The weird cult of \u2018face gains\u2019 \u201cOn fitness Instagram, men are obsessed with gaining muscle or losing weight in their face,\u201d writes Hussein Kesvani for Mel magazine. Sadly it seems that the biggest gains we\u2019re making when it comes to gender equality are around body image insecurity.",

It is dangerous territory and only one man in the audience tentatively raised a hand. \u201cSo, are you happy now?\u201d Nelson asked caustically. This year\u2019s month-long festival is set to play out against a fast-changing political backdrop in Westminster and Holyrood, and many of the topical standup acts that dominate the fringe will struggle to keep up. Alongside Nelson, who professes bewilderment about how \u201cthe worst qualified man ever\u201d has suddenly become prime minister, the award-winning political comic Matt Forde has brought up his show, Brexit, Pursued by a Bear, while for the first time the radio broadcaster Iain Dale will be hosting a succession of evenings with guests including Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, the Liberal leader Jo Swinson and Sadiq Khan, mayor of London. The speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, is to appear in a show called Speaking Out; Al Murray\u2019s pub landlord will be parodying the nostalgic urge to recreate an imagined country of the past; while the standup Phil Nichol is promising to give in to despair in his show Too Much. Leading impressionists Ronni Ancona and Lewis MacLeod have opted to tackle Melania and Donald Trump in their new show, Just Checking In, but inside many of the pop-up venues that fan out around the city\u2019s Royal Mile during the festival the strain of reacting quickly to Britain\u2019s divisive leadership contest is almost audible. At a gala opening for the Assembly group of venues, the fringe impresario William Burdett-Coutts spoke of the need for the official arts festival and the fringe to project an image of Britain as a welcoming place in the face of anti-immigrant feeling. \u201cAt a time like this, that is a particularly important message,\u201d he said.

I learned a lesson that day: life gives, but it also takes away.</p> <p><strong>My route into </strong>cooking was unconventional. When I was at my college open day, I only signed up for catering because there was a huge swarm of girls around that part of the room.</p> <p><strong>I found my upbringing</strong> difficult.

      "bodyText": "My parents gave me my work ethic. When I was a kid my dad owned shops, so I worked for him from 13. Being from an Asian family it was expected. One Christmas my old man bought me a bike \u2013 a Raleigh. I was over the moon. Then he told me he\u2019d sacked three of his paper lads and I was going to do their rounds. I learned a lesson that day: life gives, but it also takes away. My route into cooking was unconventional. When I was at my college open day, I only signed up for catering because there was a huge swarm of girls around that part of the room. I found my upbringing difficult. My parents came over from India in the 60s, but me and my three sisters were born here. I went to India for the first and last time when I was 14. I\u2019d love to go back. I struggled with the pressure of being the only son. For years I was put to bed at 6pm on a Sunday so I could get up and work early the following morning. My friends would come around and say, \u201cIs Sat coming out to play?\u201d And my parents would say, \u201cNo, he\u2019s in bed\u201d and they\u2019d all laugh at me.

The pick of the results from the AFL was no doubt Fremantle\u2019s stunning 34-point win over table-toppers Geelong. Stunning stuff from the Dockers, with the Power also winning big, and the Giants edging a classic Sydney derby.</p> <p>In the NRL, the Sharks have leapt back into the eight at the expense of the Panthers, who were surprise losers to a resolute Bulldogs side, playing for their veteran Aidan Tolman in his 200th game.</p> <p>The pick of the action came from the Super Netball however - where the NSW Swifts gave up a healthy lead late on to allow the reigning champs, Sunshine Coast Lightning to clinch a thrilling top-of-the-table battle. World Cup hero, coach Noeline Taurua, with a final-quarter tactical tweak to help her side home on a night on which the Vixens also won big to cement a runaway top three in this season\u2019s competition.</p> <p>We\u2019ve still got Ashes action, so keep an eye across that. From us on Sportwatch - that\u2019s all folks.

A huge last quarter from the home team - coach Noeline Taurua brought on her Ugandan star Peace Proscovia at GS and it opened up their attack end. Karla Pretorius was everywhere in the last quarter, pulling turnovers from everywhere, with the attackers converting them much more easily. Sophie Garbin had the opportunity to level the match with 30 seconds remaining and her team\u2019s centre pass to come, but the shot rolled out and Lightning brought it down the other end for Steph Wood to score a long bomb from a penalty after the bell.</p> </blockquote> <p>Wowee.

      "bodyText": "So a fair mix of upsets on another full day of Saturday Sportwatch. The pick of the results from the AFL was no doubt Fremantle\u2019s stunning 34-point win over table-toppers Geelong. Stunning stuff from the Dockers, with the Power also winning big, and the Giants edging a classic Sydney derby. In the NRL, the Sharks have leapt back into the eight at the expense of the Panthers, who were surprise losers to a resolute Bulldogs side, playing for their veteran Aidan Tolman in his 200th game. The pick of the action came from the Super Netball however - where the NSW Swifts gave up a healthy lead late on to allow the reigning champs, Sunshine Coast Lightning to clinch a thrilling top-of-the-table battle. World Cup hero, coach Noeline Taurua, with a final-quarter tactical tweak to help her side home on a night on which the Vixens also won big to cement a runaway top three in this season\u2019s competition. We\u2019ve still got Ashes action, so keep an eye across that. From us on Sportwatch - that\u2019s all folks. Thanks again for your company and comments! A much-needed win for the Crows - who keep their necks there or abouts in the eight. Good goal returns for Betts (3) and Walker (4) - they need their big names to fire, Adelaide, but all said and done it wasn\u2019t too much of a spectacle over in South Australia. Laird and Crouch getting through an absolute power of work, while Tim Membrey was the pick of the Saints kicking 3.1 with eight marks. They\u2019ll need to lift, Adelaide, if they\u2019re to shake up the bigger teams come season\u2019s end. Still, it\u2019s a W. They roll on. Cycling: Lucy Kennedy wins inaugural Cl\u00e1sica de San Sebasti\u00e1n women\u2019s race! Great news for fans of Australian cycling - coming off a super team effort at the Tour de France Mitchelton-Scott can claim another feather in its cap, and what an effort from Australian rider Lucy Kennedy. If you don\u2019t know the name, Kieran Pender wrote a lovely profile on this gutsy rider a while back. Looks like the prep for Tokyo 2020 is tracking nicely: AFL: Listening to the post-match post-mortem on the Dees\u2019s season on ABC radio, I have to say it, it wasn\u2019t pretty listening. Just to add insult to injury for Demon\u2019s fans (if there are still any - there didn\u2019t appear to be many inside the MCG tonight) - how long does anyone think it will be before somebody comes knocking for Gawn? Now that he\u2019s (largely) put injuries behind him, could the jewel in the Melbourne crown get a guernsey somewhere else? Discuss. It wasn\u2019t a thumping in the end, but they simply couldn\u2019t go with them once the rain set in over the MCG, the Demons. Richmond make it six on the spin. It wasn\u2019t a classic from the Tigers, but they were more than good enough to get it done. Bachar Houli growing in influence after a quiet-ish first quarter to finish with 32 touches - Edwards, Prestia and Martin also breaking the 30+ mark. Lynch the best of the kickers with 3.0, while for the Dees it was the Max Gawn show, with Bayley Fritsch also shining with 3.2. Shoutout to ground umpire Shane McInerney who posts 500 games - a terrific landmark, and the players give him a guard of honour off the field. Lovely touch. AFL - 3/4 time: Adelaide 10.7 (67) lead St Kilda 7.7 (49) They\u2019re getting it done, incrementally, the Crows. Another see-sawing quarter, Adelaide again striking early, only for the Saints to bring it back. Two late goals to Crouch and Betts making the margin flatter the home side - but it\u2019s an elastic band that hasn\u2019t quite snapped yet. Matt Crouch running the show with 29 touches, five marks and two goals - Tom Lynch also lively with 19 disposals, eight marks and 1.1 on the scoreboard. Can the Saints pull a big final quarter? It\u2019s a high-scorer at Shark Park (or PointsBet Stadium, because we all love the prevalence of gambling inside sports these days). They huffed and puffed tonight, the Rabbits - every time they looked utterly down they rustled something, but it was nowhere near enough. Wade Graham imperious with a hand in at least three of the Sharks\u2019 tries on a night that Adam Reynolds and various Burgesses just didn\u2019t come to the party. With the Panthers losing, does this see Cronulla leap into the eight? Big movers from 11th, but yes - this could be the spark of a late run for finals football after a horror run of narrow losses (and a visit from the Storm) for the Sharks. Season on. Wicket! Wicket! And speaking of dreams - how\u2019s this for a sentence to light up your evening, Australia: \u201cAustralia have taken three wickets in 11 balls.\u201d Moeen and Bairstow back in the pavilion - the former shouldering arms to a well-deceived Lyons delivery for a quacker. Ouch! AFL - 3/4 time: Melbourne 7.4 (46) trail Richmond 11.9 (75) Well, dreams are free. For just a moment it looked like the Dees could follow Freo\u2019s lead and pull off a remarkable upset - but I\u2019m prepared to bury this one now. Richmond lifting after rain spattered the MCG, tearing away five goals to one in the third. That\u2019s more like the team that\u2019s won five on the spin - Dusty no longer looking rusty with a game-leading 29 touches, and five marks. When they\u2019re on, they\u2019re on, the Tiges - surely theirs from here. Wicket! There was plenty of speculation over whether a Burns could do a job for Australia, but there\u2019s now no doubt that one has for England - a terrific innings but it comes to an end, courtesy Lyons. Let\u2019s be into the tail now, please bowlers: NRL - 60\u2019 gone: Sharks 26-12 Rabbitohs They\u2019ve only added two extra since the break, but they\u2019ve been a grade above, Cronulla. Even some Burgess boof can\u2019t lift the Rabbitohs, they\u2019re just not at the races tonight. And now Damien Cook - one of their few decent performers is down with a suspected elbow injury. It\u2019s not looking good. Wade Graham causing havoc for Cronulla in his return to the side, this could get ugly for Bunny supporters in the dying stages. My oh my. What a remarkable final quarter! It was a top-of-the-table clash and it delivered in spades. Not for the first time in the past month it\u2019s a Noeline Taurua-inspired miracle! Swifts with all the momentum in those middle two quarters, but they\u2019ve found a way, the Lightning. How important could this win prove, come season\u2019s end? Again, here\u2019s Megan Maurice, who\u2019s provided some fascinating insights for Sportswatch tonight: A two goal win for the Lightning up on the Sunshine Coast in a thriller. A huge last quarter from the home team - coach Noeline Taurua brought on her Ugandan star Peace Proscovia at GS and it opened up their attack end. Karla Pretorius was everywhere in the last quarter, pulling turnovers from everywhere, with the attackers converting them much more easily. Sophie Garbin had the opportunity to level the match with 30 seconds remaining and her team\u2019s centre pass to come, but the shot rolled out and Lightning brought it down the other end for Steph Wood to score a long bomb from a penalty after the bell. Wowee. They\u2019ll be smarting after that one, the Swifts. What a game. AFL - half-time: Adelaide 6.4 (40) lead St Kilda 5.5 (35) It\u2019s the same margin at the major break with both sides kicking 2.3 - again it was the Crows making the early running before the Saints pinned them back. Adelaide absolutely monstering the disposals (214-163) and marks (80-46) stats but seemingly not quite doing enough with it. Laird and Crouch getting the handball game moving for the Crows, with skipper Tex grabbing a pair of goals for his side. Still very much in the balance though. Wicket! And a breakthrough at Edgebaston - it\u2019s the danger man Ben Stokes who is out to Cummins having just notched his 50. Can Australia rip into the tail and stem the first-innings bleeding? Remember, we\u2019ve got Adam Collins on the case there: AFL - half-time: Melbourne 6.2 (38) trail Richmond 6.5 (41) Plenty to like about this Dees performance (something we\u2019ve not had to write too much this season) with the Tigers looking a little flat. Nevertheless they edge a few points further in front, despite goals to Brayshaw and Fritsch pulling the Demons back into the contest. Clayton Oliver leading the touches with 19 for Melbourne, Prestia and Short having lively quarters for the Tigers with 16 and 15 touches respectively. Super Netball - 3/4 time: Lightning 35-39 Swifts A fascinating turn around in the top-of-the-table clash, where the Swifts have pulled ahead, winning that quarter by four. Wallace shooting like a near-perfect swiss clock, posting 32/33. Again, here\u2019s Megan Maurice: The Swifts take the third quarter as well - their defence is really troubling the Lightning at the moment. Rore has slotted in like she has played with them all her life and appears to have no trouble adjusting to the Australian one-on-one defensive style. Garbin looks to be tiring for the Swifts and I\u2019m not sure she can keep up the intensity at GA for another quarter. Lightning will look to their home crowd to get them over the line, but they may also need to look to their bench for another WA option as Scherian is being shut down. NRL - half-time: Sharks 24-12 Rabbitohs This one is swinging like a pendulum do, no sooner had I predicted a Wayne Bennett rocket (see earlier), the Rabbits took it upon themselves to nearly lock it up through Gagai (a name which can only be read with the pronunciation of Rabs Warren firmly in mind) and Murray. But to the delight of the PM (I\u2019ll spare you the vision) ScoMo\u2019s Sharkies bounced back again - fine work this to send them into the sheds with a healthy two-try margin. AFL - quarter-time: Adelaide 4.1 (25) leads St Kilda 3.2 (20) It\u2019s in the balance nicely over in Adelaide, where the Crows lead their visitors by just under a goal. It\u2019s nominally 8th hosting 14th but they\u2019ve been in scratchy form, the Crows, which makes this one interesting. Betts with two, Lynch and Crouch the other scorers for Adelaide - Membrey, Long and Hind the kickers for the Saints. NRL - 25\u2019 gone: Sharks 14-0 Rabbitohs Hello. What\u2019s happening here, is it a \u201cJohnson on\u201d day? It\u2019s 11th hosting 3rd, but it\u2019s been all Cronulla so far, who lead through tries to Mulitalo and Dugan. Big fifteen minutes here - if they don\u2019t get on the board Wayne Bennett might be chewing wasps at half-time. Expect the Bunnies to feel his sting. Super Netball - half-time: Lightning 25-25 Swifts Hey-o! Big second quarter turnaround for the Swifts, who but for a late Lightning equaliser might have gone in ahead at the major break. They take the bonus point for winning the quarter though, and handsomely at 15-12. Again, here\u2019s Megan Maurice: This game features three of the gold-medal winning Silver Ferns - Katrina Rore makes her Super Netball debut for the Swifts, while Laura Langman leads the Lightning along with coach Noeline Taurua. The Swifts have been plagued with injuries but just have a never-say-die attitude. Bringing Rore on this quarter made a big difference for the Swifts, she has been instrumental in bringing the ball out of defence and her height is troubling Lightning WA Laura Scherian, who stands at only 167cm to Rore\u2019s 187cm. A thrilling second half to come! AFL - quarter-time: Melbourne 3.1 (19) trail Richmond 3.2 (20) It was the Tigers out of the blocks with the first of the day, but three straight had the Dees looking unlikely leaders. Majors to Chol and Graham has seen it come back for Richmond, who have even had the luxury of Dusty missing one. No individual standouts thus far, Gawn doing well for the Demons, Vlastuin, Martin and Houli looking lively in the Tigers\u2019 midfield. Super Netball - quarter-time: Lightning 13-10 Swifts With one of our two resident Guardian netball experts in the house, I\u2019ve drafted Megan Maurice back onto Sportwatch for some well-informed insights (Adam Smith, division of labour/comparative advantage and all that). Here\u2019s her appraisal of that first stanza: Lightning in control for most of the first quarter. Swifts closed the gap late in the quarter and looked like sneaking off the bonus point, but a big intercept from Karla Pretorius saved the day for Lightning. The Swifts\u2019 shooting circle is looking a little static and I\u2019m expecting to see Nat Haythornthwaite swing from WA into GA before too long. Koenen shooting 11/12 with Steph Wood a little more wayward (4/7) for the Lightning early into the second, while Garbin\u2019s hardly had a look in for the Swifts, with Sam Wallace ploughing a lone furrow at GS. Let\u2019s see how this one unfolds. Around the grounds: So plenty more in store tonight. We\u2019re just underway in the later AFL fixtures - Dees v Tigers and Crows v Saints are your last of the evening. In the NRL it\u2019s Sharks about to host the Rabbitohs, while in the Super Netball, as mentioned, it\u2019s a top-of-the-table clash between the Swifts and the Lightning. If you\u2019re in the mood for flagellation (and/or cricket), the sun is out in Birmingham and our eyes at the ground Adam Collins is up and on-board for day three of the first Test in the Ashes. Why not settle in to watch England amass five-hundred, no? Don\u2019t miss a ball of that one, here: It\u2019s not the halcyon days of 2014 (when the day-long carhorns around Belmore still haunt me) but for a club that\u2019s been in the doldrums lately, this is a great result. Aidan Tolman goes out a winner in his 200th appearance - they call him \u201cGarbo\u201d at the Dogs, because \u201che\u2019s always cleaning up everyone else\u2019s rubbish\u201d. A quiet, underrated achiever, and he and many more in blue and white have stood tall tonight. Tries to Smith, Meaney and Cogger - it wasn\u2019t safe until late after a tight first half. The Panthers with almost sixty percent possession, but the Dogs dug in well. Nearly 400 tackles - they\u2019re shattered, but relieved post-match. Super Netball - first centre pass! And we\u2019re underway on the Gold Coast, and there\u2019s no post-World Cup let up for either side, who have named some decent rosters. Wallace, Klau and co lead the Swifts, Wood, Pretorius and the indomitable Laura Langman lead the Lightning. A few early misses for the Lightning, but they\u2019re edging ahead 6-4 five minutes into the opening quarter. Crisis, what crisis! They\u2019ve pulled off one of the wins of the season, the Dockers and nobody is breathing easier than the beleaguered Ross Lyons. What an impressive team performance - they hunted as a pack, they did it across all four quarters, especially the last three, and the veterans, Nat Fyfe, David Mundy kicking two a piece - everyone stood up. One of the shock results of the season, and entirely well deserved. The Cats have walked unwittingly into a purple patch - they may not know what\u2019s just hit them! Kia ora! Hi all, and thanks Megan for another sterling shift. We\u2019ve plenty ahead still, so I will crack on. We\u2019re just about underway in the Super Netball where it\u2019s the table-topping NSW Swifts (I know!) locking horns with the reigning champs, the Lightning. But before that let\u2019s head West for AFL action, where just quietly - there\u2019s a bit of a boilover happening. More on that shortly. Well that\u2019s it from me friends, I\u2019m going to leave you in Richard Parkin\u2019s capable hands to finish off this huge night of sport. Thanks for your company, enjoy the football, netball and cricket! Great remark from ID9357571 in the comments on Shayna Jack - I wonder if this would have been so huge if not for the Australians\u2019 stand against Sun Yang? I suspect not. Whilst I\u2019m here amongst the adults - a 20 year old young women who has dedicated her life to a sport that demands otherworldly commitment from a vulnerable age has made a mistake, purposefully or not. The attention this mistake has drawn is disproportionate and damaging. I\u2019m standing alongside her as a sports lover. She\u2019s a member of our collective sporting family and our love is unconditional. NBA: Still on basketball - who can forget those heady days on Linsanity back in 2012? Unless you\u2019re an avid NBA fan you probably haven\u2019t kept up with Jeremy Lin\u2019s career after that - it was a tough start to live up to. But Hunter Felt has delved into his career and how he went from those incredible heights, to currently struggling as a free agent. Basketball: Ben Simmons may not be playing the Fiba World Cup or the upcoming series, but he\u2019s apparently looking pretty impressive at Boomers training. Fingers crossed for the team that he is available for next year\u2019s Olympics. From AAP: Simmons steals spotlight at Boomers camp While he\u2019s not playing in the Fiba World Cup, Ben Simmons still stole the show at the Boomers\u2019 first training session in Melbourne on Saturday. The NBA superstar last month pulled out of the World Cup and upcoming exhibition games against the USA but said he planned to still train with the Australian squad with an eye on next year\u2019s Olympics. Simmons was welcomed by his teammates at their training session, later joining the likes of Andrew Bogut to watch AFL sides Essendon and Port Adelaide square off. The Philadelphia 76ers guard said he pulled out of the World Cup warm-up games so the team could properly prepare their game-style for the tournament. Fellow NBA ace Patty Mills said the players respected and supported Simmons\u2019 decision. \u201cWe\u2019ve all respected his decision but him being still committed to being part of the group and our preparations is huge,\u201d Mills said. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to grow relationships with him and vice-versa - we\u2019re one big family and we want to go and create history.\u201d The San Antonio Spurs veteran was happy to have Simmons on deck, whatever his role, and opposing him at training could only be a good thing for the team. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously committed to being a valued part of our preparations for the World Cup ... he\u2019s part of our group, he will be for a long time,\u201d Mills said. \u201cThe best thing about it with Ben is, he\u2019s going to make us better at practice. The games are one thing but for him to go at us in practice is the best preparation for (the World Cup).\u201d NRL: Half-time at Parramatta and it\u2019s the Panthers with their noses in front, leading the Bulldogs by two, thanks to a Nathan Cleary penalty goal. It hasn\u2019t been the greatest of halves for Penrith, who are desperately clinging to their spot in the eight and will need to look more convincing in the second half to keep a hold on it. The recommendations for the Bulldogs? Try to remember which team you\u2019re on lads... Football: A very interesting profile of Brighton\u2019s manager Graham Potter. So many coaches these days are so caught up in their sport and live and breathe it every second. It\u2019s quite refreshing to read about someone with these unusual outside interests and how he brings those into his work. Cricket: Our day three Ashes live blog will kick off at 8pm, so read up on what went down overnight in the meantime. The Rory Burns century looked pretty unconvincing, but he got there. As our writer Vic Marks puts it \u201cIt was not an elegant innings but who cares? Elegance is unlikely to be a prime consideration for Burns \u2013 he may not consider it all \u2013 but his system worked wonderfully well.\u201d Boxing: A stunning photo series from during the week featuring former professional football player and amateur boxer Miguel Angel Ramirez\u2019s small gym under a vehicular bridge in Ecatepec, in the State of Mexico. He\u2019s aiming to keep children away from drugs, teach them a sport and prevent them enlisting in the ranks of organised crime. AFL: Half-time over in Perth and it\u2019s shaping up to be another tight match. A couple of late goals from Fremantle saw them take the lead at the main break, up by three points over Geelong, who were in control for much of the half. Tom Hawkins has been on fire for Geelong scoring three of their five first half goals. Super Netball: While we wait for tonight\u2019s top of the table clash between the NSW Swifts and Sunshine Coast Lightning, have a read of this great summary of last round and the effect of the rush back into Netball World Cup from the wonderful Erin Delahunty. Something to keep an eye on as the rest of the season unfolds. Swimming: It\u2019s not often we hear a lot about swimming outside of the Olympics, but Swimming Australia won\u2019t be loving the extra media attention this week. We\u2019ll watch with interest to see how Shayna Jack goes about clearing her name, but it\u2019s very tough to fight your way out of a positive drug test, even if her intentions were good. Football: After a brilliant Women\u2019s World Cup this year, it\u2019s clear that more resources need to go into the game to help grow and support the amazing women playing. Samantha Lewis took a look for us this week at why Fifa\u2019s plan to expand the number of teams in the World Cup might not be the perfect solution they think it is. A much improved second half for the Fever wasn\u2019t enough to come away with a desperately needed win. This loss ends their finals chances - a huge drop from the team that contested the grand final last year, especially after the loss of only one player in the off-season. The Vixens aren\u2019t quite at their best and they let the Fever into the game, struggling to adjust to Courtney Bruce\u2019s drive and contest when she moved out to GD. However they will play finals and will be looking at how they can continue to improve across the last few rounds to ensure they hit peak form by then. A good sign for them today with star shooter Mwai Kumwenda making her much anticipated return after an ACL injury. What a thriller out at Sydney Olympic Park! Despite the difference between two teams on the ladder it was an epic battle out there and the Giants held their nerve to come away with the two point win. Toby Greene was everywhere for the home team, with 34 disposals and eight marks. Jacob Hopper was delighted with the win and clearly loves the close battles. \u201cLast week was a thriller and this week was another tough one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was chaos there at the end - the structures go out the window and you just go for the pill. I love it.\u201d Well, that was not the second half the Knights would have been hoping for. That was less 2001 Knights and more 2015-17 Knights and no one asked for that. Manly swung the possession heavily in their own favour in the second half and while the Knights kept their completion rate high, they couldn\u2019t get enough ball or get close enough to the line to score. Reuben Garrick picked up with the boot for the Eagles after a slow start and scored two tries as well, just to hammer the advantage home. Daly Cherry-Evans was very pleased with the way his team came out after the break. \u201c8-6 at half-time, it could have gone either way,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought we controlled possession really well in the second half and the points flowed off the back of that.\u201d AFL: A great read during the week about the new documentary covering mental health issues in footy. I know hatred for Collingwood runs pretty deep with a lot of fans, but this sounds like a pretty fascinating look at life behind the scenes for an AFL player. Reader CoreyTrevor gives us a great match report from the over 35s division 8 competition - the results we\u2019ve all been waiting for! Hurlstone Park over 35s division 8 drew 3-3 with Five Dock this afternoon after leading 3-0 early in second half. In doing so, we\u2019ve avoided the wooden spoon. Two goals from yours truly wasn\u2019t enough to hold off the fast finishing Dockers. Long live park footy. Corey, I can only hope for your sake you\u2019re referring to the kind of footy some of us call soccer and not Aussie Rules, or that would have been a long game indeed with a 3-3 scoreline. While we\u2019re on the suburban sport train I did manage a thrilling 34-33 win with my Summer Hill Lakers A4 team earlier this afternoon. Please let us know your weekend warrior successes in the comments - whether they\u2019re wins or losses, they\u2019re all successes if you managed to drag yourself off the couch! It just wasn\u2019t Essendon\u2019s day today - Port Adelaide looked stronger and more efficient all over the park. Not to be outdone by the GWS Zacs, Essendon\u2019s Zach Merrett had a strong game for his team with 30 disposals and 17 kicks, but it wasn\u2019t enough to get them over a determined Port outfit. Possibly they need more Zacs in the team? Robbie Gray caused some controversy in our comments section today, but he was happy with his performance and that of his team. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a pretty up and down year and the last few weeks have been disappointing, so we needed to bounce back,\u201d he said. Our best footy stacks up there with the best, but we need to bring that form every week.\u201d Formula One: I admire the restraint of Carlos Sainz to just feel \u2018incredibly annoyed\u2019 at finishing seventh every time. I would personally feel a lot more strongly about it than that, but possibly that\u2019s why I\u2019m not a professional sportsperson. Well, that and the complete lack of talent. Anyway, this was a very interesting read about his aspirations and how is planning on achieving them. Cricket: Have you been staying awake for the men\u2019s Ashes this week? Bizarre situation last night when the ball hit the stumps yet Joe Root couldn\u2019t be given out because the bails stayed on. It seems to be happening more and more lately and Geoff Lemon thinks the law needs a rethink. Have a read and see if you agree. Super Netball: Half-time in Melbourne and the Vixens are looking clinical as they build a lead over the Fever, currently ahead 38-26 at half-time. The Fever aren\u2019t able to make as much use as they\u2019d like of shooting machine Jhaniele Fowler, as their feeding to her is not hitting the mark - the story of their season so far! The Vixens meanwhile are showing no signs of fatigue following the Netball World Cup, despite having all but two of their players travel to the UK for the tournament. NRL: A tight game out at Brookvale, with Manly leading the Knights 8-6 at half-time. The Knights have superior possession at this stage of the game, as well as a higher completion rate, but the Eagles were just able to get across the line when it counted. Big second half coming up. Cricket: Megan Schutt has given us this great summary of their Ashes campaign - the Australian team surprised even themselves with their dominance! It\u2019s interesting to hear about the way the team goes on after a successful series - we often think about bouncing back after a loss, but to pick up and go again after a win can be just as challenging, if not more - especially when it\u2019s something so hyped up for so long. Drugs in sport: Fascinating article from Ben Hill today on the doping saga surrounding Shayna Jack and how she would be feeling. The waters around the supplements that are legal and those that aren\u2019t can be a bit murky and it\u2019s easier than we might expect to end up taking the wrong thing due to an honest mistake. AFL: At half-time in Sydney, the Giants have the lead over the Swans, though not as big as they would have been hoping for. They lead by 13 points at the main break. The Zacs are doing the damage for the Giants so far - Zac Williams with 22 disposals and 16 kicks, while Zac Hopper has two goals for the men in orange. AFL: First up in the AFL, we\u2019ve just passed half time at Marvel Stadium and it\u2019s the Power leading the Bombers by 17. Possibly a little bit of an unexpected scoreline for the Bombers at this stage of the game, but it\u2019s a long game and they\u2019ll be hoping a strong home crowd can push them through to the end. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to a busy Saturday of sport. I\u2019m going to start you off today, but coming up later we\u2019ve got the always incredible Richard Parkin to guide you through the evening. We\u2019ve got the Sydney derby underway in the AFL, a top of the table clash this evening in the Super Netball and some intriguing battles in the NRL. So, no time to waste, let\u2019s get into it!",

Medium-sized vessels would go past Marghera and take the longer route through the Vittorio Emanuele canal before reaching the Marittima terminal.

Myth and Reality.</p> <p>\u201cBut Musolino\u2019s move was interesting. I think he\u2019s caught in the middle \u2026 the letter was obviously particularly aimed at the cruise ship companies, but in some ways it was a cry for help [to all parties]: \u2018Can we find some way of negotiating?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Protesters against big ships oppose the solution backed by Brugnaro and support the Fusina option, albeit temporarily. But with their ultimate desire to have cruise ships completely banned unlikely to be met anytime soon, they are planning their next protest on 7 September, the final day of the Venice film festival.</p>",

He previously suggested diverting the ships to Chioggia, a port south of Venice. \u201cVenice is an incomparable treasure chest of art and nature, a heritage that must be preserved by keeping together the needs of security, the environment, tourism and jobs,\u201d he recently wrote on Facebook. It has been noted that Luigi Brugnaro, the mayor of Venice, and Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto region, who were both involved in a committee set up by the previous government to resolve the dilemma, will be absent from Tuesday\u2019s meeting. Brugnaro has criticised Toninelli, a minister from the Five Star Movement, which often fights against major infrastructure projects, for not only rejecting a plan agreed by the former administration that would have closed off the canal to cruise ships, but for leaving him and Zaia out of discussions about alternative proposals. The project agreed in 2017 foresaw vessels weighing more than 96,000 tonnes entering the lagoon via the Malamocco canal to reach the mainland area of Marghera, where a passenger terminal would be built. Medium-sized vessels would go past Marghera and take the longer route through the Vittorio Emanuele canal before reaching the Marittima terminal. But the project would involve dredging canals, raising concerns over the environmental impact. \u201cI don\u2019t really have high expectations that any big decisions will be made on Tuesday, especially without the local administration\u2019s involvement,\u201d said Dominic Standish, a British academic and author of the book Venice in Environmental Peril? Myth and Reality. \u201cBut Musolino\u2019s move was interesting. I think he\u2019s caught in the middle \u2026 the letter was obviously particularly aimed at the cruise ship companies, but in some ways it was a cry for help [to all parties]: \u2018Can we find some way of negotiating?\u2019\u201d Protesters against big ships oppose the solution backed by Brugnaro and support the Fusina option, albeit temporarily. But with their ultimate desire to have cruise ships completely banned unlikely to be met anytime soon, they are planning their next protest on 7 September, the final day of the Venice film festival.",

Although it\u2019s tiring we must come out and fight for our freedom.\u201d Shops along the main road were closed and residents crowded the pavements watching demonstrators. Some handed out juice boxes and snacks while others cheered. Protesters distributed protective gear such as face masks, in the event of clashes with police, who have used teargas on demonstrators. The previously banned march was sanctioned by the police at the last minute and is one of several protests this weekend in Hong Kong. As the city enters its ninth consecutive week of protests, the movement shows few signs of abating, as public anger at the government spreads to more parts of Hong Kong society. Thousands of civil servants, medical workers and staff from the city\u2019s finance sector rallied on Thursday and Friday, while further protests were planned through the weekend. Demonstrators have also called for a citywide strike on Monday, which has already been backed by major businesses and unions. The protests, which began over a proposal to allow extradition to China, pose the most serious challenge to China\u2019s authority over the city since 1997, when it was returned from British to Chinese control. In recent days, Beijing has ramped up its condemnation of the protests, which it describes as \u201criots\u201d, and has accused the US and other western powers of instigating the unrest to hurt China. On Thursday, Chen Daoxiang, the head of the Chinese army garrison in Hong Kong, said the military was \u201cdetermined to protect [the] national sovereignty\u201d of Hong Kong and would help put down the \u201cintolerable\u201d unrest if requested. The army released a promotional video showing tanks and soldiers firing on citizens in an anti-riot drill. Hong Kong police on Thursday also charged 44 people linked to the protests with \u201crioting\u201d, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. On online forums there were claims that police decided to allow the previously banned protest in Mongkok in order to surround demonstrators and arrest them en masse. Others are increasingly worried about violence and escalating police tactics, which have included firing rubber bullets as well as teargas. Police were reportedly testing out water cannons. \u201cPeople are getting more scared,\u201d said Chan. \u201cBut it will not change what we do. We will not [stop] because of fear.\u201d \u201cEvery time I think it may be the last time but I try my best,\u201d said another protester who asked not to give her name. Despite the arrests and warnings, demonstrators appear to be escalating and shifting their tactics. Over the last week, dozens have surrounded police stations where the arrested are believed to be held. Others appear to be focused on gathering more support among the public, or targeting international audiences. \u201cIf peaceful marches that disrupt the road for an afternoon or so don\u2019t work, maybe it spills over to blockading more roads, maybe for long. If that doesn\u2019t work? Maybe next time people would besiege a government building ... It goes on and on,\u201d said one protester, who asked to only give his first name, Chris. \u201cIt\u2019s like a hydra \u2013 whether it grows more heads, or its feet have become more threatening, the whole hydra has become a bigger threat.\u201d Despite the interruptions, large swathes of the public appear sympathetic to the protesters, with many pledging to join the strike on Monday. Some residents have organised a donation drive, for clothes of any colour other than black, for protesters to quickly change out of their signature all black outfits and avoid being picked out by police. On Saturday, groups representing almost two dozen sectors, from retail to construction and engineering, issued a joint letter of their intention to strike on Monday. The statement condemned authorities for turning \u201ca deaf ear to peaceful protests from a wide section society\u201d and threatened more actions. \u201cIf the government does not respond \u2026 we shall launch more and larger strikes and non-cooperation movements. We shall never give up until we succeed,\u201d it said.",

      "bodyText": "The Community Shield is an octagon 58cm across, spun from 4.2kg of sterling silver. It is also whatever you want it to be. It is, as the cliche has it, the traditional curtain-raiser to the English season, a chance to experiment with new formats of penalty shootout. It\u2019s a fun day out at Wembley (although presumably increasingly less fun given how often the teams who habitually play in it have to get themselves to HA9 these days). If you\u2019re Jos\u00e9 Mourinho or Pep Guardiola, it\u2019s definitely a trophy. And if you\u2019re J\u00fcrgen Klopp, it\u2019s a very obvious waste of time. The Community Shield is highly polished and, as such, tends to reflect the person viewing it. Much of what the Liverpool manager said about the Community Shield, of course, was true. If you win it, nobody really cares. That David Moyes led Manchester United to Shield glory did little to mitigate the disappointment of his reign at Old Trafford. That Arsenal won it in three of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s final four seasons at the club could not dispel the sense of stagnation. What is remembered is what goes wrong. Few recall that Liverpool beat Leeds in Wembley\u2019s first penalty shootout in 1974, but the images of Kevin Keegan scrapping with Billy Bremner remain familiar to those of a certain vintage. David Seaman\u2019s missed penalty in 1993 is far more memorable than Manchester United\u2019s success. The 2015 Shield has its place in football history far less for Arsenal\u2019s win than for the early warning it provided of a sloppily dressed, unshaven Mourinho\u2019s imminent implosion. Lose the Community Shield and doubts can begin to assemble. In one sense, it is vaguely absurd that Liverpool should seem vulnerable. They are the European champions, in a better position now, in terms of ownership, management and squad, than at any point since they last won the title. But this has been a difficult summer. In the wider scheme of things it does not matter at all that Wednesday\u2019s victory over Lyon was their first in seven pre-season games. Nobody thinks that last weekend\u2019s 3-0 defeat against Napoli is any gauge of where Liverpool will be at the heart of the season.

In Deer Woman, actor Cherish Violet Blood satirises white liberal theatregoers for their willingness to be moved by a play (unnamed) that, to her, is not a true expression of lived experience. From the seemingly benign to the unquestionably brutal, Beagan asks us to draw parallels between all manifestations of colonialism.</p> <p>This is incendiary stuff, but a play born of defiance and hurt is disappointingly flat in execution. What sharpness the cause-and-effect narrative might have had is blunted by a meandering storyline, little of which seems to be what a woman recording her last confession in a straight-to-camera monologue would say. In a tonally uncertain production, the act of revenge seems gratuitous instead of cathartic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c45fe343e498e6bb4e2cc452141369b72f158bbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c45fe343e498e6bb4e2cc452141369b72f158bbd/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kiinalik: These Sharp Tools.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Personal and political \u2026 Kiinalik: These Sharp Tools.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Altogether more assured is Kiinalik: These Sharp Tools (<strong>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606</strong>), a fertile meeting of minds from north and south, as Laakkuluk Williamson Bathory of <a href=\"https://www.qaggiavuut.ca/en/about\">Nunavut\u2019s Qaggiavuut Society </a>shares perspectives with <a href=\"http://evalynparry.com/\">Evalyn Parry</a> of Toronto\u2019s queer theatre company <a href=\"http://buddiesinbadtimes.com/\">Buddies in Bad Times</a>.

Having enlisted in the military, she ensures she has the skills to complete the job properly \u2013 and gruesomely. Beagan appears to be responding to Colleen Murphy\u2019s Pig Girl, a play about a serial murderer, which drew criticism on its inaugural production in 2013 because neither the writer nor the performer was indigenous. In Deer Woman, actor Cherish Violet Blood satirises white liberal theatregoers for their willingness to be moved by a play (unnamed) that, to her, is not a true expression of lived experience. From the seemingly benign to the unquestionably brutal, Beagan asks us to draw parallels between all manifestations of colonialism. This is incendiary stuff, but a play born of defiance and hurt is disappointingly flat in execution. What sharpness the cause-and-effect narrative might have had is blunted by a meandering storyline, little of which seems to be what a woman recording her last confession in a straight-to-camera monologue would say. In a tonally uncertain production, the act of revenge seems gratuitous instead of cathartic. Altogether more assured is Kiinalik: These Sharp Tools (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606), a fertile meeting of minds from north and south, as Laakkuluk Williamson Bathory of Nunavut\u2019s Qaggiavuut Society shares perspectives with Evalyn Parry of Toronto\u2019s queer theatre company Buddies in Bad Times. In a performance somewhere between cabaret, ceilidh, gig and theatrical poem, they mix the personal and the political in what Bathory calls a \u201cstory about resistance\u201d. Melding western folk songs and Inuit poetry, they create an impressionistic vision of a vast northern landscape, realised by Elysha Poirier in icy images on the big screens behind them and accompanied by Cris Derksen\u2019s echoing cello. Taking a freeform approach to history and geography, they range widely and fluidly. The cultural expression of uaajeerneq, a Greenlandic mask dance, gives way to the political (\u201call these desperate white men nullifying the land in the name of capitalism\u201d) in a rich, thoughtful and impassioned fusion. Songs in the Key of Cree is at CanadaHub @ King\u2019s Hall, Edinburgh, until 18 August. Deer Woman is at CanadaHub @ King\u2019s Hall, Edinburgh until 24 August.

      "body": "<p>In the current febrile climate \u2013 meteorological and political \u2013 many questions are being raised about how to fight for and against causes. The alarming temperatures, the unaccountable rulers, the rise of extremism, rollback of rights, and self-evidently destructive policies that lead towards chaos: it has all created a cauldron of anger, dismay and rebellion. There are some interesting examples of women resisting. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greta-thunberg\" title=\"\">Greta Thunberg</a>, the schoolgirl standing up for her generation\u2019s right to an environmental future. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jacinda-ardern\" title=\"\">Jacinda Ardern</a>, prime minister of New Zealand, neutralising xenophobic violence in her country by aligning herself with the injured community, refusing to let divisive \u201cothering\u201d occur, and swiftly implementing gun legislation. These are brave confrontations. But what if a woman chooses a more literal fight?</p> <p>Earlier this year, the revocation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/shamima-begum\" title=\"\">Shamima Begum</a>\u2019s British citizenship and the labelling of her as an Islamic State \u201cjihadi bride\u201d exposed deep public and governmental discomfort around a woman\u2019s \u2013 or in this case a girl\u2019s \u2013 relationship with conflict. Was she a victim or had she agency? We can\u2019t know what Begum thought, chose or experienced, whether she considered herself \u201cat war\u201d or not. Her case is spotlit, but by no means anomalous. Many boys chose to join European wars in the early 20th century because of propaganda \u2013 victims or heroes of complex situations and motivations. A woman, however, still faces enormous societal disquiet, scrutiny and often penalty, if she gets too deliberately close to the violence, even if she doesn\u2019t pick up a gun.</p> <p>So where are the sanctioned borders between women and violence, between supporting roles and combat? When might a woman agree to taking up arms premeditatedly, as well as instinctively in defence of herself or her values? Are women inherently more peaceable? And can they be capable soldiers?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2195a97308d9629a39d112d258a3bdfc7563f47f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2195a97308d9629a39d112d258a3bdfc7563f47f/0_0_458_519/441.jpg\" alt=\"Catherine the Great.\" width=\"441\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman in charge of a country has often been seen as sexually unnatural \u2026 Catherine the Great.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These questions have long interested me. In 2005, on the back of several cataclysmic events \u2013 again meteorological and political \u2013 I began a short novel called <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/aug/18/featuresreviews.guardianreview18\" title=\"\">The Carhullan Army</a></em> (<em>Daughters of the North</em> in the US). It imagines Britain in the near future, restructured by a rightwing government after economic collapse, peak oil and resource wars, and suffering the effects of the climate crisis.</p> <p>Sister, the main character, narrates from prison. She becomes a survivalist, a paramilitary soldier who was trained in the Cumbrian mountains, taught guerrilla tactics and reconnaissance skills, and tortured to ensure she could withstand captivity. The society the army fights against is a despotic version of patriarchy; the resistance is female-led and operated.</p> <p>Fiction has great examples of altered societies, dystopias and utopias where women are either victims of brutal regimes and must escape, such as in Margaret Atwood, or are autonomous and remote, as in Charlotte Perkins Gilman\u2019s <em>Herland</em>. How women orchestrate networks, underground or executive, is key in such narratives. Feminism in relation to violence and male power is a common literary theme, but there are very few female occupational fighters.</p> <p>This might simply reflect reality. In <em>War and Gender</em>, Joshua Goldstein examines cross-cultural historical evidence relating to the participation of women in combat, and finds it to be consistently rare, \u201cfar fewer than 1% of all warriors in history\u201d. In today\u2019s standing armies, the vast majority of soldiers are male. War is a socially diverse phenomenon. So why does diversity disappear in relation to gender? Goldstein argues: \u201cKilling in war does not come naturally for either gender, yet the potential for war has been universal. To help overcome soldiers\u2019 reluctance to fight, cultures develop gender roles that equate \u2018manhood\u2019 with toughness under fire.\u201d</p> <p>We aren\u2019t reconciled to female warriors. A woman in charge of a country and its military, or active in battle, has often been seen as sexually unnatural: Elizabeth I, Catherine the Great, Margaret Thatcher. Women serving on the frontline create unease \u2013 the media report on how many children they have, rebuking a reckless lack of maternalism. Connections with fundamentalism vex even more. Much depends on which side you are on. It seems acceptable for a woman to have fought against fascism in the Spanish civil war. But what of a contemporary British citizen going to fight with Kurdish forces in Syria?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We see many depictions of 'girl power' in games, film and books where female characters have superhero status \u2013 but few realistic examples</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These questions relate not only to notions of masculinity, but forms of feminism, too. Does participating in war undermine a feminist ethic of being anti male violence? For some suffragettes, hurling missiles at parliament and disrupting traffic were deemed necessary, though the suffrage movement contained many pacifists. Defensive confrontation can still be regarded as conflict against a prejudicial or harmful system. The full spectrum of war\u2019s potentiality has always been available to women, including that most deadly human activity \u2013 premeditated killing. But why are there so few female soldiers on the page?</p> <p>We see many depictions of \u201cgirl power\u201d in games, film and books \u2013 almost mythical, superhero status allows female characters equality or superiority over men. In novels such as Naomi Alderman\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/02/the-power-naomi-alderman-review\" title=\"\">The Power</a></em>, where women evolve electrically and lethally, inversions of hierarchy are explored. But there are few realistic, terrestrial examples. Brian Van Reet\u2019s novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/10/spoils-by-brian-van-reet-review-iraq-war\" title=\"\">Spoils</a></em> is notable. It features Cassandra Wigheard, a soldier serving in Iraq in 2003. She is 19, working class and good at her job. Captured by Islamists, she is held \u2013 potentially for execution. The horror of war is refracted though her perspective. Van Reet served with a tank crew and no doubt encountered female combatants, as 7.5% of active officers in the US Marines are women.</p> <p>War consumes societies, affecting citizens of both genders. But war fiction by female writers is unusual \u2013 as if even the imagined domain isn\u2019t one to which women feel entitled. AL Kennedy wrote about a tail-gunner in a second world war bomber in her novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/apr/07/fiction.alkennedy\" title=\"\">Day</a></em>, and there were discussions about the very choice of subject matter.

      "bodyText": "In the current febrile climate \u2013 meteorological and political \u2013 many questions are being raised about how to fight for and against causes. The alarming temperatures, the unaccountable rulers, the rise of extremism, rollback of rights, and self-evidently destructive policies that lead towards chaos: it has all created a cauldron of anger, dismay and rebellion. There are some interesting examples of women resisting. Greta Thunberg, the schoolgirl standing up for her generation\u2019s right to an environmental future. Jacinda Ardern, prime minister of New Zealand, neutralising xenophobic violence in her country by aligning herself with the injured community, refusing to let divisive \u201cothering\u201d occur, and swiftly implementing gun legislation. These are brave confrontations. But what if a woman chooses a more literal fight? Earlier this year, the revocation of Shamima Begum\u2019s British citizenship and the labelling of her as an Islamic State \u201cjihadi bride\u201d exposed deep public and governmental discomfort around a woman\u2019s \u2013 or in this case a girl\u2019s \u2013 relationship with conflict. Was she a victim or had she agency? We can\u2019t know what Begum thought, chose or experienced, whether she considered herself \u201cat war\u201d or not. Her case is spotlit, but by no means anomalous. Many boys chose to join European wars in the early 20th century because of propaganda \u2013 victims or heroes of complex situations and motivations. A woman, however, still faces enormous societal disquiet, scrutiny and often penalty, if she gets too deliberately close to the violence, even if she doesn\u2019t pick up a gun. So where are the sanctioned borders between women and violence, between supporting roles and combat? When might a woman agree to taking up arms premeditatedly, as well as instinctively in defence of herself or her values? Are women inherently more peaceable? And can they be capable soldiers? These questions have long interested me. In 2005, on the back of several cataclysmic events \u2013 again meteorological and political \u2013 I began a short novel called The Carhullan Army (Daughters of the North in the US). It imagines Britain in the near future, restructured by a rightwing government after economic collapse, peak oil and resource wars, and suffering the effects of the climate crisis. Sister, the main character, narrates from prison. She becomes a survivalist, a paramilitary soldier who was trained in the Cumbrian mountains, taught guerrilla tactics and reconnaissance skills, and tortured to ensure she could withstand captivity. The society the army fights against is a despotic version of patriarchy; the resistance is female-led and operated. Fiction has great examples of altered societies, dystopias and utopias where women are either victims of brutal regimes and must escape, such as in Margaret Atwood, or are autonomous and remote, as in Charlotte Perkins Gilman\u2019s Herland. How women orchestrate networks, underground or executive, is key in such narratives. Feminism in relation to violence and male power is a common literary theme, but there are very few female occupational fighters. This might simply reflect reality. In War and Gender, Joshua Goldstein examines cross-cultural historical evidence relating to the participation of women in combat, and finds it to be consistently rare, \u201cfar fewer than 1% of all warriors in history\u201d. In today\u2019s standing armies, the vast majority of soldiers are male. War is a socially diverse phenomenon. So why does diversity disappear in relation to gender? Goldstein argues: \u201cKilling in war does not come naturally for either gender, yet the potential for war has been universal. To help overcome soldiers\u2019 reluctance to fight, cultures develop gender roles that equate \u2018manhood\u2019 with toughness under fire.\u201d We aren\u2019t reconciled to female warriors. A woman in charge of a country and its military, or active in battle, has often been seen as sexually unnatural: Elizabeth I, Catherine the Great, Margaret Thatcher. Women serving on the frontline create unease \u2013 the media report on how many children they have, rebuking a reckless lack of maternalism. Connections with fundamentalism vex even more. Much depends on which side you are on. It seems acceptable for a woman to have fought against fascism in the Spanish civil war. But what of a contemporary British citizen going to fight with Kurdish forces in Syria? These questions relate not only to notions of masculinity, but forms of feminism, too. Does participating in war undermine a feminist ethic of being anti male violence? For some suffragettes, hurling missiles at parliament and disrupting traffic were deemed necessary, though the suffrage movement contained many pacifists. Defensive confrontation can still be regarded as conflict against a prejudicial or harmful system. The full spectrum of war\u2019s potentiality has always been available to women, including that most deadly human activity \u2013 premeditated killing. But why are there so few female soldiers on the page? We see many depictions of \u201cgirl power\u201d in games, film and books \u2013 almost mythical, superhero status allows female characters equality or superiority over men. In novels such as Naomi Alderman\u2019s The Power, where women evolve electrically and lethally, inversions of hierarchy are explored. But there are few realistic, terrestrial examples. Brian Van Reet\u2019s novel Spoils is notable. It features Cassandra Wigheard, a soldier serving in Iraq in 2003. She is 19, working class and good at her job. Captured by Islamists, she is held \u2013 potentially for execution. The horror of war is refracted though her perspective.

      "body": "<p>Under the torrential rain of a fickle British summer, 25 soggy pilgrims gather in front of the Plough, an ancient oak-beamed pub in the West Sussex village of Rusper. Above the drone of planes bringing travellers into Gatwick, the walkers \u2013 variously devotees of trekking, folk music or wildlife \u2013 raise their voices to sing an old English folk song that is told from the point of view of a globetrotting visitor to these shores: \u201cFare you well, my dear, I must be gone / And leave you for a while / If I roam away, I\u2019ll come back again / Though I roam 10,000 miles, my dear / Though I roam 10,000 miles.\u201d</p> <p>The song, The Turtle Dove, was discovered by Ralph Vaughan Williams when the Plough\u2019s publican sang it to him more than 100 years ago. It is a forgotten lament for a bird that has inspired writers, musicians and country-dwellers for centuries. <a href=\"https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer/birds/pigeons-and-doves/turtle-dove\" title=\"\">This small, delicate wild dove</a>, with grey feathers blushed pink and ginger, is a symbol of renewal in the Old Testament and an emblem of love and constancy for Shakespeare. The romance embodied by the turtle dove has fluttered into countless songs, from The Twelve Days of Christmas to Elvis Presley\u2019s Baby If You\u2019ll Give Me All Your Love and Cliff Richard\u2019s Bachelor Boy. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/29/puffin-turtle-dove-extinction-uk-endangered-species\" title=\"\">this celebrated bird is slipping towards extinction in Britain</a>.</p> <p>The turtle dove is a global citizen, spending winter in the Sahel region of Africa before flying to Europe to breed. The Victorians observed great flocks of turtle doves assembling to begin their migration south. As recently as the 60s, there were 125,000 pairs in Britain. Between 1967 and 2016, their numbers plummeted by 98%. Each year, population estimates are revised downwards: there may be fewer than 2,000 pairs left. Most worryingly, there is no agreement about how we can reverse the decline.</p> <p>The pilgrims, led by the singer Sam Lee, are beginning a two-day walk from the Plough to one of the turtle dove\u2019s last strongholds, <a href=\"https://knepp.co.uk/turtle-doves\" title=\"\">the Knepp estate in West Sussex</a>. In a quixotic act of faith, they plan to sing the song to the doves. If we all paid more attention to this enigmatic bird, thinks Lee, perhaps we could save it from disappearing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>More than 40 million birds have vanished from this country in 50 years</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re casting a magical spell,\u201d says Lee. \u201cVaughan Williams was passing this pub on his bicycle 113 years ago and he popped in and said: \u2018Anyone know any songs?\u2019 The landlord sang him The Turtle Dove, which he\u2019d never heard before. He took it away to London and he made a global hit.\u201d Vaughan Williams\u2019 arrangement of the song has been recorded, in different forms and with different titles, by artists including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhAkNrelNbU\" title=\"\">Joan Baez</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dSZfEqOej4\" title=\"\">Marianne Faithfull</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjqIrKk1ozk\" title=\"\">Nic Jones</a>, yet the song\u2019s original meaning has been forgotten, explains Lee, especially in its Sussex heartland. \u201cWe\u2019re going to rewild this song,\u201d he says. \u201cThe amazing connection is that the song itself is about extinction.\u201d The turtle dove sings of its migration, its disappearance and its devotion to its unnamed love, which could be for a place as well as a person.</p> <p>The turtle dove is a symbol of the extinction crisis unfolding in Britain. Our intensively farmed, densely populated country can still look pretty, but experts agree that lowland Britain \u2013 the turtle dove\u2019s home \u2013 is one of the most nature-depleted landscapes in the world. More than half of Britain\u2019s plant and animal species are in decline and one in 10 is severely threatened. More than 40 million birds have vanished from this country in 50 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb2cb748c2f6e5d929709e24211c8341467183e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb2cb748c2f6e5d929709e24211c8341467183e6/0_421_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pilgrims on their two-day quest to find endangered turtle doves.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pilgrims on their two-day quest to find endangered turtle doves.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominick Tyler/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Victorians may have seen flocks of turtle doves, but today they are elusive; the best chance of encountering one is to hear a calling male, which makes the soft \u201ctur-turr\u201d that gives the dove its name. The sound is gentle, summery and somnolent \u2013 one of the most soothing in nature, according to Victorian admirers. When I search for it this summer, I hear it only beside the old walled courtyard at Pensthorpe, <a href=\"https://www.pensthorpe.com/pensthorpe-conservation-trust/our-projects/turtle-dove/\" title=\"\">a Norfolk nature reserve that has run a trial to breed the doves in captivity</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s so sad that the only place to hear them is in our aviary,\u201d says Chrissie Kelley, head of species management at Pensthorpe Conservation Trust. \u201cIt used to be a common sound.\u201d</p> <p>Kelley takes me through the turtle dove\u2019s troubled recent history. It has been affected badly by recent droughts in Africa and the Mediterranean penchant for shooting migrating birds each spring and autumn (traditionally for food, but now more for fun). It has been estimated that 3 million turtle doves are shot each year. While EU law bans the hunting of birds <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-06-879_en.htm\" title=\"\">during periods of breeding and migration</a>, the turtle dove is still shot in many countries during autumn. In addition, BirdLife International estimates that <a href=\"https://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/news/symbols-love-fidelity-brought-down-illegal-killing\" title=\"\">600,000 are </a><a href=\"https://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/news/symbols-love-fidelity-brought-down-illegal-killing\" title=\"\">killed illegally each year</a>.</p> <p>But these trends do not explain entirely the loss of British turtle doves. Although the bird is declining across Europe (down more than a third this century), only in the similarly intensively farmed Netherlands is there a decline to match Britain\u2019s. Turtle doves eat mostly grains, living on wild plant and weed seeds. Since the 50s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/18/losing-97-percent-britain-wildflower-meadows-matters-butterfly\" title=\"\">Britain has destroyed almost all its wildflower meadows</a>, while chemical pesticides have removed arable weeds. \u201cBack in the day, when turtle doves were very numerous, they\u2019d feed on farmers\u2019 grain spills,\u201d says Kelley. \u201cFifty years ago there was a lot more mess \u2013 stubble fields and open barns. We\u2019ve got so clean in our farming practices now, that there\u2019s no spillage, no waste.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd22fdaf2e33a2a2c0165c74fa03131620e1fc64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd22fdaf2e33a2a2c0165c74fa03131620e1fc64/0_27_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Knepp estate in West Sussex is one of the few places where turtle dove numbers are increasing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Knepp estate in West Sussex is one of the few places where turtle dove numbers are increasing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominick Tyler/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Britain has also lost dense hedgerows where the turtle dove likes to nest. \u201cThey need thick, scrubby hedgerows, because as far as turtle doves are concerned they think a couple of twigs is a nest,\u201d says Kelley, pointing out the feeble construction her captive doves have made in a thicket inside the aviary. \u201cThey need food and water fairly close by, sucking up water to make crop milk for their young.\u201d</p> <p>Pensthorpe is working with a group of mid-Norfolk farmers to preserve hedgerows, restore farm ponds and offer the birds supplementary food. It is a formula being repeated across the turtle dove\u2019s last strongholds in the south-east and Yorkshire, as part of <a href=\"https://www.operationturtledove.org/\" title=\"\">Operation Turtle Dove</a>, a partnership by charities including the RSPB and Natural England, the government\u2019s advisory body on the environment. But earlier, similar, schemes have not worked. One Norfolk farmer who planted field margins with wild seed mixes succeeded in boosting bird populations, but not turtle doves.</p> <p>Isabella Tree, the co-owner of the Knepp estate, is critical of recent attempts to provide the doves with additional food. Knepp is one of the few places where turtle doves are increasing: from none at the start of the century, the 1,400-hectare (3,500-acre) farm now has 20 calling males. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/28/wilding-isabella-tree-review-farm-return-nature\" title=\"\">the book Wilding</a>, Tree\u2019s account of how she and her husband, Charlie Burrell, returned their farm to nature over two decades, she argues that our categorisation of the turtle dove as a \u201cfarmland\u201d bird is misleading. What did it eat before there were farms? What does it eat in sub-Saharan Africa? Tree believes turtle doves that have been observed eating spilled arable grains in Britain are starving and desperate. Any dove breeder will tell you about the dangers of feeding wheat and corn to the birds: cracked grain can tear the throat, while in the gut it absorbs moisture and can cause fungal diseases.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc392074a446d1cc572a3c9f9eb3b94bd7fd594e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc392074a446d1cc572a3c9f9eb3b94bd7fd594e/0_256_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turtle dove\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Losing the turtle dove is to lose the intelligence of that creature, which understands the landscape around it.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Operation Turtle Dove launched in 2012, the RSPB wanted to scatter a mix of wheat, oilseed rape, millet and canary seed at sites including Knepp. Tree and Burrell politely refused. Knepp\u2019s farm produces no such seeds, yet their turtle doves are thriving. \u201cWhy can\u2019t modern conservationists go back to the meticulous records of the Victorians to find out what turtle doves were actually eating?\u201d asks Tree.</p> <p>While conservationists agree that turtle doves love weed seeds such as <a href=\"https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer/wildflowers/common-fumitory\" title=\"\">common fumitory</a> (which has returned to rewilded Knepp), most weeds do not produce seeds until the middle of summer; the turtle dove arrives in Britain, undernourished, in April and May. In fact, says Tree, there are old accounts of turtle doves eating snails. They may peck at hawthorn shoots, too. Ornithologists have observed continental turtle doves eating berries, fungi and invertebrates.</p> <p>One theory is that Knepp\u2019s turtle doves are thriving because they can easily find seeds on the bare ground created by the rootling of the wild pigs that Tree and Burrell have restored to their farm. \u201cWe know the turtle doves like bare earth, where their little legs aren\u2019t having to cope with anything too scraggy or long,\u201d says Tree. \u201cThey want areas where they can see what\u2019s coming and fly off quickly.\u201d Turtle doves at Knepp this summer are being caught and fitted with a radio tag that should help scientists identify where they have been feeding and deduce precisely what they need.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d00055017582d11d0e2789001487cac2a54d09e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d00055017582d11d0e2789001487cac2a54d09e/2216_0_3584_4480/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Lee says the decline is \u2018part of a greater silencing of the natural world\u2019.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sam Lee says the decline is \u2018part of a greater silencing of the natural world\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominick Tyler/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Increasingly, however, conservationists fear there are other, even more complicated causes for their demise. Carles Carboneras, an RSPB research scientist who specialises in migratory birds, says that global heating is causing quail, another migratory \u201cfarmland\u201d bird, to move further northwards. But the turtle dove is showing no sign of expanding its range. \u201cEverybody agrees the main cause for the decline is the transformation of landscape,\u201d says Carboneras. \u201cThe increase in monocultures is very, very bad for the species. In this country, you either have very intense agriculture or very dense woodlands \u2013 and neither of these is good for turtle doves.\u201d</p> <p>But Carboneras points out that this shift to a \u201csimplified\u201d landscape in Britain occurred 50 years ago. So why have turtle dove populations fallen so dramatically more recently? Carboneras fears that the rapid accumulation of nitrogen from farm fertilisers and traffic pollution in the soil is causing vegetation to grow too quickly for turtle doves. \u201cIf the grass is too high, they can\u2019t access the food. In the south-east, we\u2019re probably seeing the effect of nutrients, but it\u2019s a hunch. We don\u2019t have the evidence for that yet.\u201d</p> <p>It will be difficult to save the turtle dove without understanding the reasons for its decline but, some conservationists warn, endangered species have been \u201cstudied to extinction\u201d in the past. We cannot always afford to wait. At Pensthorpe, Kelley and her team have successfully demonstrated how to breed turtle doves in captivity. Here, turtle dove eggs are fostered by Barbary doves, because these common birds are less sensitive and happy to be kept inside smaller cages. Releasing captive-bred turtle doves into the wild, says Kelley, could be \u201can insurance policy for British wild birds before they go extinct\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s something calming about the turtle dove\u2019s song.

      "bodyText": "Under the torrential rain of a fickle British summer, 25 soggy pilgrims gather in front of the Plough, an ancient oak-beamed pub in the West Sussex village of Rusper. Above the drone of planes bringing travellers into Gatwick, the walkers \u2013 variously devotees of trekking, folk music or wildlife \u2013 raise their voices to sing an old English folk song that is told from the point of view of a globetrotting visitor to these shores: \u201cFare you well, my dear, I must be gone / And leave you for a while / If I roam away, I\u2019ll come back again / Though I roam 10,000 miles, my dear / Though I roam 10,000 miles.\u201d The song, The Turtle Dove, was discovered by Ralph Vaughan Williams when the Plough\u2019s publican sang it to him more than 100 years ago. It is a forgotten lament for a bird that has inspired writers, musicians and country-dwellers for centuries. This small, delicate wild dove, with grey feathers blushed pink and ginger, is a symbol of renewal in the Old Testament and an emblem of love and constancy for Shakespeare. The romance embodied by the turtle dove has fluttered into countless songs, from The Twelve Days of Christmas to Elvis Presley\u2019s Baby If You\u2019ll Give Me All Your Love and Cliff Richard\u2019s Bachelor Boy. But this celebrated bird is slipping towards extinction in Britain. The turtle dove is a global citizen, spending winter in the Sahel region of Africa before flying to Europe to breed. The Victorians observed great flocks of turtle doves assembling to begin their migration south. As recently as the 60s, there were 125,000 pairs in Britain. Between 1967 and 2016, their numbers plummeted by 98%. Each year, population estimates are revised downwards: there may be fewer than 2,000 pairs left. Most worryingly, there is no agreement about how we can reverse the decline. The pilgrims, led by the singer Sam Lee, are beginning a two-day walk from the Plough to one of the turtle dove\u2019s last strongholds, the Knepp estate in West Sussex. In a quixotic act of faith, they plan to sing the song to the doves. If we all paid more attention to this enigmatic bird, thinks Lee, perhaps we could save it from disappearing. \u201cWe\u2019re casting a magical spell,\u201d says Lee. \u201cVaughan Williams was passing this pub on his bicycle 113 years ago and he popped in and said: \u2018Anyone know any songs?\u2019 The landlord sang him The Turtle Dove, which he\u2019d never heard before. He took it away to London and he made a global hit.\u201d Vaughan Williams\u2019 arrangement of the song has been recorded, in different forms and with different titles, by artists including Joan Baez, Marianne Faithfull and Nic Jones, yet the song\u2019s original meaning has been forgotten, explains Lee, especially in its Sussex heartland. \u201cWe\u2019re going to rewild this song,\u201d he says. \u201cThe amazing connection is that the song itself is about extinction.\u201d The turtle dove sings of its migration, its disappearance and its devotion to its unnamed love, which could be for a place as well as a person. The turtle dove is a symbol of the extinction crisis unfolding in Britain. Our intensively farmed, densely populated country can still look pretty, but experts agree that lowland Britain \u2013 the turtle dove\u2019s home \u2013 is one of the most nature-depleted landscapes in the world. More than half of Britain\u2019s plant and animal species are in decline and one in 10 is severely threatened. More than 40 million birds have vanished from this country in 50 years. The Victorians may have seen flocks of turtle doves, but today they are elusive; the best chance of encountering one is to hear a calling male, which makes the soft \u201ctur-turr\u201d that gives the dove its name. The sound is gentle, summery and somnolent \u2013 one of the most soothing in nature, according to Victorian admirers. When I search for it this summer, I hear it only beside the old walled courtyard at Pensthorpe, a Norfolk nature reserve that has run a trial to breed the doves in captivity. \u201cIt\u2019s so sad that the only place to hear them is in our aviary,\u201d says Chrissie Kelley, head of species management at Pensthorpe Conservation Trust. \u201cIt used to be a common sound.\u201d Kelley takes me through the turtle dove\u2019s troubled recent history. It has been affected badly by recent droughts in Africa and the Mediterranean penchant for shooting migrating birds each spring and autumn (traditionally for food, but now more for fun). It has been estimated that 3 million turtle doves are shot each year. While EU law bans the hunting of birds during periods of breeding and migration, the turtle dove is still shot in many countries during autumn. In addition, BirdLife International estimates that 600,000 are killed illegally each year. But these trends do not explain entirely the loss of British turtle doves. Although the bird is declining across Europe (down more than a third this century), only in the similarly intensively farmed Netherlands is there a decline to match Britain\u2019s. Turtle doves eat mostly grains, living on wild plant and weed seeds. Since the 50s, Britain has destroyed almost all its wildflower meadows, while chemical pesticides have removed arable weeds. \u201cBack in the day, when turtle doves were very numerous, they\u2019d feed on farmers\u2019 grain spills,\u201d says Kelley. \u201cFifty years ago there was a lot more mess \u2013 stubble fields and open barns. We\u2019ve got so clean in our farming practices now, that there\u2019s no spillage, no waste.\u201d Britain has also lost dense hedgerows where the turtle dove likes to nest. \u201cThey need thick, scrubby hedgerows, because as far as turtle doves are concerned they think a couple of twigs is a nest,\u201d says Kelley, pointing out the feeble construction her captive doves have made in a thicket inside the aviary. \u201cThey need food and water fairly close by, sucking up water to make crop milk for their young.\u201d Pensthorpe is working with a group of mid-Norfolk farmers to preserve hedgerows, restore farm ponds and offer the birds supplementary food. It is a formula being repeated across the turtle dove\u2019s last strongholds in the south-east and Yorkshire, as part of Operation Turtle Dove, a partnership by charities including the RSPB and Natural England, the government\u2019s advisory body on the environment. But earlier, similar, schemes have not worked. One Norfolk farmer who planted field margins with wild seed mixes succeeded in boosting bird populations, but not turtle doves. Isabella Tree, the co-owner of the Knepp estate, is critical of recent attempts to provide the doves with additional food. Knepp is one of the few places where turtle doves are increasing: from none at the start of the century, the 1,400-hectare (3,500-acre) farm now has 20 calling males. In the book Wilding, Tree\u2019s account of how she and her husband, Charlie Burrell, returned their farm to nature over two decades, she argues that our categorisation of the turtle dove as a \u201cfarmland\u201d bird is misleading. What did it eat before there were farms? What does it eat in sub-Saharan Africa? Tree believes turtle doves that have been observed eating spilled arable grains in Britain are starving and desperate. Any dove breeder will tell you about the dangers of feeding wheat and corn to the birds: cracked grain can tear the throat, while in the gut it absorbs moisture and can cause fungal diseases. When Operation Turtle Dove launched in 2012, the RSPB wanted to scatter a mix of wheat, oilseed rape, millet and canary seed at sites including Knepp. Tree and Burrell politely refused. Knepp\u2019s farm produces no such seeds, yet their turtle doves are thriving. \u201cWhy can\u2019t modern conservationists go back to the meticulous records of the Victorians to find out what turtle doves were actually eating?\u201d asks Tree. While conservationists agree that turtle doves love weed seeds such as common fumitory (which has returned to rewilded Knepp), most weeds do not produce seeds until the middle of summer; the turtle dove arrives in Britain, undernourished, in April and May. In fact, says Tree, there are old accounts of turtle doves eating snails. They may peck at hawthorn shoots, too. Ornithologists have observed continental turtle doves eating berries, fungi and invertebrates. One theory is that Knepp\u2019s turtle doves are thriving because they can easily find seeds on the bare ground created by the rootling of the wild pigs that Tree and Burrell have restored to their farm. \u201cWe know the turtle doves like bare earth, where their little legs aren\u2019t having to cope with anything too scraggy or long,\u201d says Tree. \u201cThey want areas where they can see what\u2019s coming and fly off quickly.\u201d Turtle doves at Knepp this summer are being caught and fitted with a radio tag that should help scientists identify where they have been feeding and deduce precisely what they need. Increasingly, however, conservationists fear there are other, even more complicated causes for their demise. Carles Carboneras, an RSPB research scientist who specialises in migratory birds, says that global heating is causing quail, another migratory \u201cfarmland\u201d bird, to move further northwards. But the turtle dove is showing no sign of expanding its range. \u201cEverybody agrees the main cause for the decline is the transformation of landscape,\u201d says Carboneras. \u201cThe increase in monocultures is very, very bad for the species.

      "body": "<p>Do you like jeopardy, excitement, explosions, sexual frissons, car chases, drama and gunfire? Well, hmm, OK \u2013 we might run into a problem here. Because Celebrity 5 Go Barging (Fri, 8pm, Channel 5) contains absolutely none of that.</p> <p>You know the Celebrity 5 Go \u2026 format by now, surely. Five celebrities \u2013 of the very \u201cJane McDonald said no: are you free tomorrow? Well you didn\u2019t book any panto this year, Michael, so it\u2019s that or back to the factory\u201d variety \u2013 go somewhere and do something, often things reminiscent of a particular sub-niche of the classic old-fashioned British holiday: a heavy air of raincoats and squashed cheese sandwiches and your dad losing his rag at a blocked chemical toilet. So we\u2019ve had 5 Go Caravanning and 5 Go Camping. This is the second series of 5 Go Barging, because the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/11/celebrity-carry-on-barging-review\">previous one</a> was such a success. There is an extended sequence in the first episode where Amanda Barrie and Shaun Williamson do some very light banter in a provincial charity shop (\u201cA pink karaoke machine!\u201d Barry from EastEnders \u2013 Williamson\u2019s canonical name \u2013 says, brightly. \u201cShall we?\u201d). Stuff like that. You get the idea.</p> <p>And so to the new series, which has the aforementioned Barrie v Barry crossover event; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/16/actors-compassion-michael-buerk-benedict-cumberbatch\">Michael Buerk</a>, who is apparently at the stage in his career and life where he booms into every room and goes: \u201cWhere\u2019s the WINE?\u201d; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/apr/27/john-prescott-ive-only-ever-been-in-two-or-three-fights\">John \u201c81 years old\u201d Prescott</a>; and Anita Harris, who really is stretching the very limit of the word \u201ccelebrity\u201d there in the title. Together they all titter through the quiet canals of Staffordshire, cooing at grain storage buildings, bunking head-to-foot along the length of the barge before waking up for bacon sandwiches, steering their ships gracelessly into the banks. Every time a lock comes up, Barry from EastEnders (who \u2013 and I can\u2019t be sure \u2013 very much seems as if he sleeps in a cagoule) is issued to move it, because he\u2019s the youngest of the cast at 53. Halfway through episode one, he pumps a tank of John Prescott\u2019s faeces out through a tube and into a waste facility. Nothing actually happens.</p> <p>But then that, I suppose, is the point: sometimes you need something exceptionally mild to fall asleep to, which is exactly what this is. Amanda and Barry have a serene squabble about whether butter belongs in a bacon sandwich. John Prescott and Michael Buerk quietly repair a paddlewheel. Someone says \u201cmuggins, here\u201d and someone else says \u201cblinking\u201d instead of a swear word. And there, in the middle of every episode, they all stop for a drink at some weird canalside local \u2013 lots of adult ponytails among the people here, lots of all-weather fleeces, a near tangible air of outdoor smoking breath \u2013 while someone explains for slightly too long about how flint used to come through this mill until it didn\u2019t any more.</p> <p>Nothing happens, obviously \u2013 there is slightly more of a risk of contestant death than other reality TV shows, but that\u2019s only because John Prescott keeps threatening to shatter a hip by jumping between barges \u2013 but then why do things have to happen all the time anyway? Sometimes you just want to watch Barry from EastEnders, holding a pipe full of crap, quietly wondering what time the pubs shut.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Do you like jeopardy, excitement, explosions, sexual frissons, car chases, drama and gunfire? Well, hmm, OK \u2013 we might run into a problem here. Because Celebrity 5 Go Barging (Fri, 8pm, Channel 5) contains absolutely none of that. You know the Celebrity 5 Go \u2026 format by now, surely. Five celebrities \u2013 of the very \u201cJane McDonald said no: are you free tomorrow? Well you didn\u2019t book any panto this year, Michael, so it\u2019s that or back to the factory\u201d variety \u2013 go somewhere and do something, often things reminiscent of a particular sub-niche of the classic old-fashioned British holiday: a heavy air of raincoats and squashed cheese sandwiches and your dad losing his rag at a blocked chemical toilet. So we\u2019ve had 5 Go Caravanning and 5 Go Camping. This is the second series of 5 Go Barging, because the previous one was such a success. There is an extended sequence in the first episode where Amanda Barrie and Shaun Williamson do some very light banter in a provincial charity shop (\u201cA pink karaoke machine!\u201d Barry from EastEnders \u2013 Williamson\u2019s canonical name \u2013 says, brightly. \u201cShall we?\u201d). Stuff like that. You get the idea. And so to the new series, which has the aforementioned Barrie v Barry crossover event; Michael Buerk, who is apparently at the stage in his career and life where he booms into every room and goes: \u201cWhere\u2019s the WINE?\u201d; John \u201c81 years old\u201d Prescott; and Anita Harris, who really is stretching the very limit of the word \u201ccelebrity\u201d there in the title. Together they all titter through the quiet canals of Staffordshire, cooing at grain storage buildings, bunking head-to-foot along the length of the barge before waking up for bacon sandwiches, steering their ships gracelessly into the banks. Every time a lock comes up, Barry from EastEnders (who \u2013 and I can\u2019t be sure \u2013 very much seems as if he sleeps in a cagoule) is issued to move it, because he\u2019s the youngest of the cast at 53. Halfway through episode one, he pumps a tank of John Prescott\u2019s faeces out through a tube and into a waste facility. Nothing actually happens. But then that, I suppose, is the point: sometimes you need something exceptionally mild to fall asleep to, which is exactly what this is. Amanda and Barry have a serene squabble about whether butter belongs in a bacon sandwich. John Prescott and Michael Buerk quietly repair a paddlewheel. Someone says \u201cmuggins, here\u201d and someone else says \u201cblinking\u201d instead of a swear word. And there, in the middle of every episode, they all stop for a drink at some weird canalside local \u2013 lots of adult ponytails among the people here, lots of all-weather fleeces, a near tangible air of outdoor smoking breath \u2013 while someone explains for slightly too long about how flint used to come through this mill until it didn\u2019t any more. Nothing happens, obviously \u2013 there is slightly more of a risk of contestant death than other reality TV shows, but that\u2019s only because John Prescott keeps threatening to shatter a hip by jumping between barges \u2013 but then why do things have to happen all the time anyway? Sometimes you just want to watch Barry from EastEnders, holding a pipe full of crap, quietly wondering what time the pubs shut.",

Evacuated residents spent another night away from their homes on Friday and police warned it could be several days before they are allowed to return. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, visited the area on Friday and promised that the damaged reservoir would have a \u201cmajor rebuild\u201d as he met locals at nearby Chapel-en-le-Frith high school, which is being used as an evacuation centre. Describing the damage to the dam as \u201cpretty scary\u201d, he said: \u201cThe plan is to try and stop the dam breaking, clearly. And so a huge amount of effort is going into that.\u201d On Saturday the environment minister Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey said the situation was still critical and urged residents not to return home while there was still a threat to life. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI think we are still in that critical stage, that\u2019s why we still have the severe flood warning. \u201cThey are at risk if they are in that main town and I\u2019m glad that people have responded. I cannot emphasise enough how patient they need to be. \u201cOf course this is a distressing and worrying time for them, but if that dam were to breach it would lead to a loss of life if there were people there. There\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201d An RAF Chinook helicopter and around 150 firefighters using high-volume pumps appear to have partly stabilised the reservoir\u2019s spillway, with further pumps brought in by officials on Friday. Johnson, who arrived by helicopter, said he thought they had to get the level of the water down about eight metres, although there was some discussion with the surrounding officials about whether this was the exact figure. He added: \u201cI was talking to one of the villagers from Whaley Bridge who said that he remembered something like this happening 50 years ago. \u201cWe\u2019ve had an exceptional weather event, we must make sure that this dam can cope with it in the future. That will mean a major rebuild, clearly.\u201d Those evacuated from their homes were allowed to return briefly on Friday evening to pick up any vital items or pets. The operation allowed just one person from each household to return for a maximum of 15 minutes. Derbyshire police said any residents who re-entered Whaley Bridge would be doing so at their own risk and that the threat to life remained high. About 1,000 people were evacuated from the town but most found their own accommodation with family and friends, according to Derbyshire county council. Police have closed railway lines in the Whaley Bridge area over the risk of potential flooding, which is due to continue into the weekend. The reservoir is on the north-west edge of the Peak District national park and was built in 1831, according to experts, although the Environment Agency records it as being built in 1840-41. According to a 2011 Environment Agency report on national dam incidents, Toddbrook \u201chas a history of leakage\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>One day in May this year, Luigi Rimonti left his home in Gateshead to catch a ferry from North Shields, the first stage in a 1,000-mile drive across Europe to Italy. A dapper, energetic 81-year-old, Rimonti had grown up in a suburb of Rome before coming to the north-east of England as a young man. Often, over the years, he had driven back to Rome, insisting to his two adult sons, Gino and Valter, that he preferred to make this long journey by car. They worried about their father on these drives, and this spring, for the first time, they persuaded Rimonti to equip his car with a satellite-navigation device.</p> <p>Off the ferry in Amsterdam, Rimonti began to have difficulties with the satnav. He stopped in a petrol station: could someone there help him re-input his destination? A stranger obliged. Tap-tap-tap, enter. Rimonti thanked the stranger and drove on \u2013 south, he presumed, towards Rome.</p> <p>After a day\u2019s driving, Rimonti was looking forward to stopping somewhere for an overnight rest. The satnav hadn\u2019t taken him on a route he recognised, but he seemed to be making good progress. He was surprised, then, to be told by the smooth, computerised voice of the satnav that he\u2019d shortly be arriving at his destination. He had clocked hundreds of miles, though not yet the 1,000 he knew it would take to reach Rome. Rimonti\u2019s son, Gino, picks up the story: \u201cDad was like, \u2018This isn\u2019t Italy.\u2019 So he got out to check where he was. He must not have pulled the handbrake on properly.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2ade9f8f0d9940df7873a24291dec650ed1c5f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2ade9f8f0d9940df7873a24291dec650ed1c5f3/126_506_1870_2337/800.jpg\" alt=\"Luigi Rimonti\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luigi Rimonti was surprised to be told by the smooth, computerised voice of the satnav that he\u2019d shortly be arriving at his destination.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Knieps/BILD</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rimonti had stopped his car on a slight slope. When he clambered out, the better to read the nearest road sign, his car began to roll backwards. Struck by the open door of the car, Rimonti was knocked over and dragged along. When the car struck the very road sign he\u2019d been trying to read, it jolted, and Rimonti was able to tumble clear. He lay in shock on the road. His suitcases and belongings were now trapped in the boot of the car, which had been crunched shut by the collision. The car had also immobilised itself and would later be towed. Rimonti lay still, shaken and badly injured, too hurt to stand. He later told his sons: \u201c<em>Pensavo di essere morto</em>.\u201d I thought I was dead.</p> <p>The road sign he had been trying to read was on the ground beside him. \u201cRom,\u201d it said, identifying this location as a tiny hamlet in the hills of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in Germany, due east from Amsterdam and a good 600 miles from the Italian border. Rimonti would be in Pomerania for the better part of a week, recuperating. Rome would have to wait.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a655a1488e05bee46d406da3e1f83a08a9149e61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a655a1488e05bee46d406da3e1f83a08a9149e61/0_221_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luigi Rimonti\u2019s car in Rom, Germany, after he followed his satnav, which he thought was taking him to Rome, Italy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luigi Rimonti\u2019s car in Rom, Germany, after he followed his satnav, which he thought was taking him to Rome, Italy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CEN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We live in curious times, part-digital, part-manual. It\u2019s a hybrid era that presumably won\u2019t last for long, and in which we\u2019ve come to rely on code and algorithms to handle many of our affairs, though usually with a human hand setting everything in train. Miracle tech! Unimaginable automation! And so much of it conditional on an accurate animal prod at the outset, a finger landed correctly on a keyboard, a thumb touching the right quarter-inch of screen, a mouse button clicked just so.</p> <p>Things go wrong. Back in March 2015, a single misplaced digit (15 degrees 19.8 minutes east, entered into a cockpit computer, instead of 151 degrees 9.8 minutes east) led to a passenger jet bound from Sydney to Kuala Lumpur landing in Melbourne. In January 2018, an extraordinary clerical error led to a million Hawaiians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/13/hawaii-ballistic-missile-threat-alert-false-alarm\" title=\"\">being texted the news</a> that their destruction by ballistic missile was imminent. \u201cSeek immediate shelter,\u201d the message read, \u201cthis is not a drill.\u201d Not a drill, no: an inaccurate click, later tracked back to one computer, one drop-down menu, one government employee who was a few pixels off in their aim.</p> <p>In our almost-automated age, we tend to be asked to do our bit at the beginning of any enterprise, before a million digital processes occur quickly, incomprehensibly, out of sight. When things do go wrong, it can seem as if we\u2019ve pushed the first domino in a long run and then turned away, trusting the dominoes will fall neatly.

I made a note whenever a notable instance crept into the daily news cycle.

There have been hasty key presses that trigger even heavier state machinery. In March, members of the European parliament voted via touchscreen on whether to amend a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/mar/27/mep-errors-mean-european-copyright-law-may-not-have-passed\" title=\"\">crucial aspect of copyright law</a>. It was a close-run thing and, after the vote, more than a dozen MEPs \u2013 enough to have made a difference \u2013 admitted they\u2019d pressed the wrong option by accident. Parliamentary business had moved on, though. The law passed without amendment.</p> <p>In 2009, there was an extraordinary instance of one-click bedlam that could not be undone. An employee at Companies House was scrolling through a list of UK firms, trying to find a Manchester business called Taylor &amp; Son that had been issued with a winding-up order and would soon cease to exist. Then came the blunder. The employee wrongly selected the Cardiff-based Taylor &amp; Sons (note the plural) and began the process of liquidating <em>that</em> firm instead. Taylor &amp; Sons was a thriving engineering company that had been trading since the 1870s. It had been making about \u00a335m a year, according to Philip Davison-Sebry, who ran the business in 2009.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>A single-digit typo tied one man's computer, via its IP address, to someone else\u2019s who was accessing child abuse images</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bad-credit notices were issued.

Administrators came in, and centuries of reliable trading came to a halt overnight. Davison-Sebry was 52 at the time, and suddenly out of work. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find another job in your 50s, believe me,\u201d he says, now. \u201cEspecially when everyone thinks you\u2019re the guy who collapsed a 200-year-old business.\u201d </p> <p>Earlier this year, while researching this story, I took the train to Sheffield to meet a man called Nigel Lang. If there has been a world\u2019s worst typo, it may be the one that devastated Lang\u2019s life in the summer of 2011.</p> <p>A friendly, slightly wary man in his early 50s, Lang shows me around the home he shares with his partner, Clare, and their young son. Lang was 44 in 2011. He had a job he liked, as a drugs counsellor for Sheffield council. The family was just back from a summer holiday when, one Saturday morning, police officers rang the doorbell. Lang re-enacts the scene for me, standing up from the kitchen table where he had been having breakfast with his family, opening the door, and then reeling back when he was told why the police had visited.</p> <p>Lang was to be charged on suspicion of downloading child abuse images. He was told that an IP address, provided to South Yorkshire Police by Hertfordshire Constabulary, had led investigators to a laptop he owned. Could he come to the nearest police station for questioning? \u201cMy body just contorted,\u201d Lang tells me. \u201cMy legs went to jelly.\u201d</p> <p>After he\u2019d dressed and left with the police, his house was searched for computers and storage devices. At the time, according to Lang, he was not especially computer literate. There was one family laptop that he used to stream reggae music. Taken for questioning, he struggled to answer basic inquiries about the internet (\u201cWeb browser? You mean like Google?\u201d). When officers asked if he wanted a solicitor, Lang panicked. \u201cI don\u2019t need a fucking solicitor! I haven\u2019t done anything!\u201d</p> <p>Much later, <em>years</em> later, he would learn that a single-digit typo had tied his computer, via its IP address, to someone else\u2019s crime. But that first Saturday, waiting in a cell, Lang knew none of this. His brain was reeling. When he was told a forensic search of his computer could take up to six months, and that until it was complete he would remain in limbo, thoughts of suicide flashed through his mind, he says.</p> <p>Meanwhile, at home, Clare was going through her own difficulties. Social services had come, and Clare was told that although Lang would be released while his computer was searched, he could not come home to live with the family. As Clare recalls: \u201cI asked them: \u2018What would you do if I allowed him to come?\u2019 They said: \u2018We\u2019ll take your son off you.\u2019\u201d Hours earlier they\u2019d been eating toast together. Now Clare was being asked to choose between two members of her family. \u201cAn impossible situation, because if you believe your partner, you\u2019re thought to be putting your child at risk. I felt completely helpless.\u201d</p> <p>In the end, the family waited three weeks \u2013 \u201cLike a lifetime,\u201d Lang says \u2013 for the computer search to be completed. Lang was living with his parents when he was told the police had not found anything. The charge was dropped and he was free to move back home. Even then, Lang says, he found himself compulsively telling everyone he met what had happened, fearful they would hear about it in some other way. According to Clare, \u201cNigel was in bits.\u201d</p> <p>Later, Lang realised he was having a breakdown. \u201cYou think everyone is looking at you with scepticism. Suspicion,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can see people mulling things over in their minds, weighing it up. \u2018How\u2019s this happened? What were you looking at to make this happen?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Some disastrous typos are at least reparable. In the 1960s, Nasa operatives watched as one of their new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_1#Overbar_transcription_error\" title=\"\">Mariner space rockets veered off course over Florida</a>. Deep in the guidance software of the rocket, a lone dash had been left out of the code. On that occasion, engineers were able to explode the straying rocket in the sky before it could hurt anybody on the ground. </p> <p>After the accidental missile alert in Hawaii, there were about 20 minutes of civil panic before government workers got word out that the alert had been sent in error. When I contact the head of the government agency responsible, Vern Miyagi, he tells me that the accident might even have been beneficial for the islands, in that they will be better prepared for any real emergency.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The police owned up to the mistake that had led to the wrongful charge. 'There was a typing error'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In Wales, after struggling for years to get back on his feet, Philip Davison-Sebry took Companies House to court for the error that crushed Taylor &amp; Sons. He won damages of more than \u00a38m, and has since founded another company.</p> <p>The cruelty in Lang\u2019s case was that there seemed no thorough way of reversing what had gone wrong. Despite the charges being dropped, the fact that he\u2019d once been arrested on suspicion of downloading child abuse images remained on Lang\u2019s record: an unacceptable taint. Clare says: \u201cEmotionally, it was like Nigel wasn\u2019t there. I remember being at the kitchen table and he was blank, like he\u2019d left the room without leaving the room.\u201d Lang tells me: \u201cYour mind\u2019s constantly on clearing your name. You can\u2019t think of anything else.\u201d</p> <p>He fought a legal battle for years. In 2014, three years after the arrest, Lang received a letter from Hertfordshire Constabulary, in which the police unequivocally owned up to the mistake that had led to the wrongful charge. \u201cThere was a typing error,\u201d a detective inspector confirmed. \u201cAn extra digit added on the form\u2026 Cannot convey how sorry I am\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Lang thought: sorry? He\u2019d stopped working. He\u2019d alienated friends. The loyalty between him and his partner had been tested in the extreme. Now he felt a weird compulsion to know something else: exactly which wrong keystroke had started his troubles?</p> <p>There was further inquiry. Lang was told that Hertfordshire Constabulary had meant to track a person using an IP address ending in the number six. A number one had been added, and the rest was history, years of Lang\u2019s history. At his home, picking through documents related to the case, he sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things, isn\u2019t it? One you can\u2019t ever explain.\u201d</p> <p>Lang has been awarded a five-figure sum in compensation. But it is plain to see, while spending time with him, that the incident has scarred him. I feel doubly sorry for Lang, because in researching this story I also come across a woman from Missouri who is something like his polar opposite \u2013 a lottery winner on the spectrum of fat-fingered flukes. If lives can be \u201csmashed up\u201d, in Lang\u2019s words, by a single wrong keystroke, it stands to reason that lives can be made better by the same thing. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>She pressed in a chunky number six, not a zero. There had been a marriage as a result</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Happier events were set in train for Kasey Bergh, a 53-year-old divorcee from St Louis, thanks to some imprecise thumb-work back in 2006. She had bought one of the old Nokia phones with plastic buttons, and was hastily filling its address book with the numbers of friends and colleagues. Bergh must have wrongly input a number because, six years later, when she tried to text that colleague, her message went astray. It pinged on to the phone of a stranger who lived about 900 miles away, in Colorado.</p> <p>Henry Glendening, a man in his 20s, was driving to work at a hardware store when Bergh\u2019s text came through. He tapped out a pert, positive reply: \u201cSorry, you\u2019ve got the wrong number. But if I wasn\u2019t headed to work I\u2019d be down to hang.\u201d Bergh was charmed. They kept texting. After a while \u2013 despite the age difference, and the distance between their hometowns \u2013 the pair began dating. They married in 2015.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c94a72e8544272b77f0a4e96129a11d084abd7d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c94a72e8544272b77f0a4e96129a11d084abd7d3/0_11_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kasey Bergh and her husband Henry Glendening\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A misdirected text led Kasey Bergh to her future husband \u2013 and kidney donor \u2013 Henry Glendening.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: St Louis Post-Dispatch/TNS via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Telling me her story, Bergh realised that she hadn\u2019t properly got to grips with how that first cross-communication occurred. Her curiosity piqued, she went off to investigate, digging out the old Nokia and contacting the former colleague whose number she got wrong. It turns out she pressed in a chunky number six, not a zero \u2013 a difference of a few millimetres. There had been a marriage as a result of those millimetres; followed by other, potentially life-saving consequences.</p> <p>For decades Bergh suffered from a serious kidney illness. She had already received a transplant when she and Glendening met and, after their marriage, that donor kidney began to fail. Glendening offered one of his. Donor-compatibility tests were conducted and, this spring, the couple underwent the operation. When I last spoke to them, in May, they were in recovery, bleary and happy. Bergh sends a smiley emoticon, perhaps not trusting her shaky fingers to accurately type much. The surgery has gone well.</p> <p>Luigi Rimonti, who\u2019d been intent on Rome and landed in Rom, also required a stay in hospital. After an hour on the stony ground in Rom, an ambulance wound its way to the remote hilltop town to collect him. As the 81-year-old\u2019s suitcases were trapped in the boot of his car, he was admitted to hospital without fresh clothes. The car was a write-off. Rimonti\u2019s pride had taken a hit, too, and when he finally called his sons to tell them what had happened, he said brusquely: \u201cThere\u2019s been an accident. I\u2019m alive.\u201d Then he hung up. For days, this was all his worried relatives knew.</p> <p>Genuinely catastrophic typos, like the one that caused Rimonti so much trouble, tend to draw a crowd. People like me are queasily fascinated, perhaps because these incidents remind us that basic bad luck is something that hasn\u2019t yet been smoothed away or tamed by science. While Rimonti was lying in a Pomeranian hospital, his story became international news. A German journalist got wind of what had happened, and soon there were reports about the case on local television. The story spread around Europe. Before long, Rimonti\u2019s sons were being sent confusing clips of foreign-language news items about their father. One channel even put together an animated map of his journey. The English tabloids ran stories. All this before Rimonti\u2019s sons got him home.</p> <p>When he finally walked in the door in June, Rimonti was bruised, car-less, uncertain on his feet, bemused by the world\u2019s reaction to his escapade. What drama for one missing letter \u201cE\u201d! His son, Gino, blamed the satnav. Hadn\u2019t Rimonti always driven to Italy by his own devices, reading road signs, feeling his way, \u201clike a penguin going home. If we\u2019d just let him drive there, I think he\u2019d have made it.\u201d They should never have let technology interfere with something so primal, Gino jokes.</p> <p>Meanwhile, I have been thinking the opposite: that tech really has to get a lot better, so that voice commands, or even <em>thought</em> commands, can override our inherent bent for sloppiness.</p> <p>Luigi Rimonti takes the broader view. There is only one lesson from his misadventure: \u201c<em>La vita \u00e8 una merda</em>.\u201d I\u2019ll translate that one with a typo, for decency: in life, siht happens.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 August 2019 to remove text that contravened the Guardian\u2019s style guide.</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "One day in May this year, Luigi Rimonti left his home in Gateshead to catch a ferry from North Shields, the first stage in a 1,000-mile drive across Europe to Italy. A dapper, energetic 81-year-old, Rimonti had grown up in a suburb of Rome before coming to the north-east of England as a young man. Often, over the years, he had driven back to Rome, insisting to his two adult sons, Gino and Valter, that he preferred to make this long journey by car. They worried about their father on these drives, and this spring, for the first time, they persuaded Rimonti to equip his car with a satellite-navigation device. Off the ferry in Amsterdam, Rimonti began to have difficulties with the satnav. He stopped in a petrol station: could someone there help him re-input his destination? A stranger obliged. Tap-tap-tap, enter. Rimonti thanked the stranger and drove on \u2013 south, he presumed, towards Rome. After a day\u2019s driving, Rimonti was looking forward to stopping somewhere for an overnight rest. The satnav hadn\u2019t taken him on a route he recognised, but he seemed to be making good progress. He was surprised, then, to be told by the smooth, computerised voice of the satnav that he\u2019d shortly be arriving at his destination. He had clocked hundreds of miles, though not yet the 1,000 he knew it would take to reach Rome. Rimonti\u2019s son, Gino, picks up the story: \u201cDad was like, \u2018This isn\u2019t Italy.\u2019 So he got out to check where he was. He must not have pulled the handbrake on properly.\u201d Rimonti had stopped his car on a slight slope. When he clambered out, the better to read the nearest road sign, his car began to roll backwards. Struck by the open door of the car, Rimonti was knocked over and dragged along. When the car struck the very road sign he\u2019d been trying to read, it jolted, and Rimonti was able to tumble clear. He lay in shock on the road. His suitcases and belongings were now trapped in the boot of the car, which had been crunched shut by the collision. The car had also immobilised itself and would later be towed. Rimonti lay still, shaken and badly injured, too hurt to stand. He later told his sons: \u201cPensavo di essere morto.\u201d I thought I was dead. The road sign he had been trying to read was on the ground beside him. \u201cRom,\u201d it said, identifying this location as a tiny hamlet in the hills of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in Germany, due east from Amsterdam and a good 600 miles from the Italian border. Rimonti would be in Pomerania for the better part of a week, recuperating. Rome would have to wait. We live in curious times, part-digital, part-manual. It\u2019s a hybrid era that presumably won\u2019t last for long, and in which we\u2019ve come to rely on code and algorithms to handle many of our affairs, though usually with a human hand setting everything in train. Miracle tech! Unimaginable automation! And so much of it conditional on an accurate animal prod at the outset, a finger landed correctly on a keyboard, a thumb touching the right quarter-inch of screen, a mouse button clicked just so. Things go wrong. Back in March 2015, a single misplaced digit (15 degrees 19.8 minutes east, entered into a cockpit computer, instead of 151 degrees 9.8 minutes east) led to a passenger jet bound from Sydney to Kuala Lumpur landing in Melbourne. In January 2018, an extraordinary clerical error led to a million Hawaiians being texted the news that their destruction by ballistic missile was imminent. \u201cSeek immediate shelter,\u201d the message read, \u201cthis is not a drill.\u201d Not a drill, no: an inaccurate click, later tracked back to one computer, one drop-down menu, one government employee who was a few pixels off in their aim. In our almost-automated age, we tend to be asked to do our bit at the beginning of any enterprise, before a million digital processes occur quickly, incomprehensibly, out of sight. When things do go wrong, it can seem as if we\u2019ve pushed the first domino in a long run and then turned away, trusting the dominoes will fall neatly. Err on that first nudge, and the consequences can be amplified far out of proportion to the initial mistake. Two years ago, in a hospital in Tennessee, a nurse clicked to order the wrong drug from an electronic medication cabinet (like a vending machine for pills). She wanted anti-anxiety medication for a patient. She ended up administering a poison meant for killing prisoners on death row, and is now on trial for reckless homicide. Around the time of the 2018 Hawaiian missile debacle, it became a weird hobby of mine to look out for the starkest and strangest examples of these butterfly-effect typos. I made a note whenever a notable instance crept into the daily news cycle. A tweet by Donald Trump, this summer, that referred to Prince Charles as \u201cthe Prince of Whales\u201d, launching a frenzied few hours of meme-making. The 46m Australian banknotes that went into circulation recently, missing a letter \u201ci\u201d in the word \u201cresponsibilty\u201d in the small print. Benign stuff, mostly. You hear these stories, chuckle or wince, and move on. I began to wonder about the inadvertent keystrokes that had larger, longer, crueller effects. Of all the one-off typos and misclicks, had there been a world\u2019s worst?

I felt completely helpless.\u201d In the end, the family waited three weeks \u2013 \u201cLike a lifetime,\u201d Lang says \u2013 for the computer search to be completed. Lang was living with his parents when he was told the police had not found anything. The charge was dropped and he was free to move back home. Even then, Lang says, he found himself compulsively telling everyone he met what had happened, fearful they would hear about it in some other way. According to Clare, \u201cNigel was in bits.\u201d Later, Lang realised he was having a breakdown. \u201cYou think everyone is looking at you with scepticism. Suspicion,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can see people mulling things over in their minds, weighing it up. \u2018How\u2019s this happened? What were you looking at to make this happen?\u2019\u201d Some disastrous typos are at least reparable. In the 1960s, Nasa operatives watched as one of their new Mariner space rockets veered off course over Florida. Deep in the guidance software of the rocket, a lone dash had been left out of the code. On that occasion, engineers were able to explode the straying rocket in the sky before it could hurt anybody on the ground. After the accidental missile alert in Hawaii, there were about 20 minutes of civil panic before government workers got word out that the alert had been sent in error. When I contact the head of the government agency responsible, Vern Miyagi, he tells me that the accident might even have been beneficial for the islands, in that they will be better prepared for any real emergency. In Wales, after struggling for years to get back on his feet, Philip Davison-Sebry took Companies House to court for the error that crushed Taylor &amp; Sons. He won damages of more than \u00a38m, and has since founded another company. The cruelty in Lang\u2019s case was that there seemed no thorough way of reversing what had gone wrong. Despite the charges being dropped, the fact that he\u2019d once been arrested on suspicion of downloading child abuse images remained on Lang\u2019s record: an unacceptable taint. Clare says: \u201cEmotionally, it was like Nigel wasn\u2019t there. I remember being at the kitchen table and he was blank, like he\u2019d left the room without leaving the room.\u201d Lang tells me: \u201cYour mind\u2019s constantly on clearing your name. You can\u2019t think of anything else.\u201d He fought a legal battle for years. In 2014, three years after the arrest, Lang received a letter from Hertfordshire Constabulary, in which the police unequivocally owned up to the mistake that had led to the wrongful charge. \u201cThere was a typing error,\u201d a detective inspector confirmed. \u201cAn extra digit added on the form\u2026 Cannot convey how sorry I am\u2026\u201d Lang thought: sorry? He\u2019d stopped working. He\u2019d alienated friends. The loyalty between him and his partner had been tested in the extreme. Now he felt a weird compulsion to know something else: exactly which wrong keystroke had started his troubles? There was further inquiry. Lang was told that Hertfordshire Constabulary had meant to track a person using an IP address ending in the number six. A number one had been added, and the rest was history, years of Lang\u2019s history. At his home, picking through documents related to the case, he sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things, isn\u2019t it? One you can\u2019t ever explain.\u201d Lang has been awarded a five-figure sum in compensation. But it is plain to see, while spending time with him, that the incident has scarred him. I feel doubly sorry for Lang, because in researching this story I also come across a woman from Missouri who is something like his polar opposite \u2013 a lottery winner on the spectrum of fat-fingered flukes. If lives can be \u201csmashed up\u201d, in Lang\u2019s words, by a single wrong keystroke, it stands to reason that lives can be made better by the same thing. Happier events were set in train for Kasey Bergh, a 53-year-old divorcee from St Louis, thanks to some imprecise thumb-work back in 2006. She had bought one of the old Nokia phones with plastic buttons, and was hastily filling its address book with the numbers of friends and colleagues. Bergh must have wrongly input a number because, six years later, when she tried to text that colleague, her message went astray. It pinged on to the phone of a stranger who lived about 900 miles away, in Colorado. Henry Glendening, a man in his 20s, was driving to work at a hardware store when Bergh\u2019s text came through. He tapped out a pert, positive reply: \u201cSorry, you\u2019ve got the wrong number. But if I wasn\u2019t headed to work I\u2019d be down to hang.\u201d Bergh was charmed. They kept texting. After a while \u2013 despite the age difference, and the distance between their hometowns \u2013 the pair began dating. They married in 2015. Telling me her story, Bergh realised that she hadn\u2019t properly got to grips with how that first cross-communication occurred. Her curiosity piqued, she went off to investigate, digging out the old Nokia and contacting the former colleague whose number she got wrong. It turns out she pressed in a chunky number six, not a zero \u2013 a difference of a few millimetres. There had been a marriage as a result of those millimetres; followed by other, potentially life-saving consequences. For decades Bergh suffered from a serious kidney illness. She had already received a transplant when she and Glendening met and, after their marriage, that donor kidney began to fail. Glendening offered one of his. Donor-compatibility tests were conducted and, this spring, the couple underwent the operation. When I last spoke to them, in May, they were in recovery, bleary and happy. Bergh sends a smiley emoticon, perhaps not trusting her shaky fingers to accurately type much. The surgery has gone well. Luigi Rimonti, who\u2019d been intent on Rome and landed in Rom, also required a stay in hospital. After an hour on the stony ground in Rom, an ambulance wound its way to the remote hilltop town to collect him. As the 81-year-old\u2019s suitcases were trapped in the boot of his car, he was admitted to hospital without fresh clothes. The car was a write-off. Rimonti\u2019s pride had taken a hit, too, and when he finally called his sons to tell them what had happened, he said brusquely: \u201cThere\u2019s been an accident. I\u2019m alive.\u201d Then he hung up. For days, this was all his worried relatives knew. Genuinely catastrophic typos, like the one that caused Rimonti so much trouble, tend to draw a crowd. People like me are queasily fascinated, perhaps because these incidents remind us that basic bad luck is something that hasn\u2019t yet been smoothed away or tamed by science. While Rimonti was lying in a Pomeranian hospital, his story became international news. A German journalist got wind of what had happened, and soon there were reports about the case on local television. The story spread around Europe. Before long, Rimonti\u2019s sons were being sent confusing clips of foreign-language news items about their father. One channel even put together an animated map of his journey. The English tabloids ran stories. All this before Rimonti\u2019s sons got him home. When he finally walked in the door in June, Rimonti was bruised, car-less, uncertain on his feet, bemused by the world\u2019s reaction to his escapade. What drama for one missing letter \u201cE\u201d! His son, Gino, blamed the satnav. Hadn\u2019t Rimonti always driven to Italy by his own devices, reading road signs, feeling his way, \u201clike a penguin going home. If we\u2019d just let him drive there, I think he\u2019d have made it.\u201d They should never have let technology interfere with something so primal, Gino jokes. Meanwhile, I have been thinking the opposite: that tech really has to get a lot better, so that voice commands, or even thought commands, can override our inherent bent for sloppiness. Luigi Rimonti takes the broader view. There is only one lesson from his misadventure: \u201cLa vita \u00e8 una merda.\u201d I\u2019ll translate that one with a typo, for decency: in life, siht happens. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 August 2019 to remove text that contravened the Guardian\u2019s style guide. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "body": "<p>In 2017, \u201cCat Person\u201d, the first short story I\u2019d ever published, went viral. In the story, a college student named Margot goes on a long, disastrous date with a man in his mid-30s named Robert. At the end of the night, Margot sleeps with Robert, despite realising, belatedly, that she has no desire to do so. Her reasons for making that choice remain opaque even to her, and she ghosts him the next day. To my surprise \u2013 and, I think, to my editor\u2019s \u2013 the story became a catalyst for dozens of overlapping conversations about sex, consent, online dating and #MeToo.</p> <p>Amid the waves of often contradictory praise, judgment and analysis of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/11/cat-person-fame-was-annihilating-reveals-kristen-roupenian\" title=\"\">Cat Person</a>\u201d, an occasional comparison surfaced, that I clung to like a lifeline: the work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/mary-gaitskill\" title=\"\">Mary Gaitskill</a>. When people brought up her name in conjunction with mine, I felt both relieved and grateful. Partly this was because I genuinely loved her writing, but it also had to do with a story I had in my head about her career: she was a female writer who had first come to prominence because of stories that featured explicit sex. She had weathered the onslaught of prurient attention \u2013 not just to her writing, but to her life and her looks \u2013 that had come along with that. But she had emerged on the other side of that maelstrom as a writer who had achieved near-universal critical acclaim. I understood these early comparisons as the compliment they were almost certainly intended to be: a suggestion that I was not just a woman writing narcissistically about her own sex life and veiling it under a thin gauze of fiction; I was a woman writing narcissistically about her own sex life, veiling it under a thin gauze of fiction, and then, through some magic, turning it into art.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c206bed46b836344ef99698d0829b7e0c3c50021\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c206bed46b836344ef99698d0829b7e0c3c50021/0_100_4176_2505/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Gaitskill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Gaitskill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophie Bassouls/Sygma via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For all my admiration of the writer, though, I soon began to suspect that the Gaitskill comparison was more loaded than it first appeared. \u201cI love Mary Gaitskill,\u201d I said to a friend not long after my story came out. \u201cBut even Mary Gaitskill isn\u2019t Mary Gaitskill any more.\u201d By which I meant: Gaitskill\u2019s debut collection, <em>Bad Behavior</em>, originally published in 1988, is now more than 30 years old. In the intervening decades, she has published three novels, two more short-story collections, and a book of essays \u2013 but no one who used her name in conjunction with mine made any reference to this work. That became even more noticeable when my first book was published, and people continued to compare it to Gaitskill (in ways both complimentary to me and not) despite the fact that it was unabashedly a collection of genre-inflected horror stories, about as different in content from <em>Bad Behavior</em> as it was possible to be \u2026 well, except for all the sex. Now, I would certainly like to think Gaitskill and I have some stylistic and thematic elements in common, but no one was citing Gaitskill in my reviews to note how, say, I was interrogating the way that white women negotiate their historically troubled relationship to sentimentality, as she did in her most recent novel, <em>The Mare</em>. They brought up Gaitskill because my book had weird bad sex in it, and she had written the definitive book about Bad Sex \u2013 you know, the one with the story they made the movie <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/sep/26/dvdreviews\" title=\"\">Secretary</a></em> about.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/13/cat-person-short-story-that-launched-thousand-theories\">Cat Person: the short story that launched a thousand theories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Penguin rereleased <em>Bad Behavior</em> in the UK this year, no doubt gambling that a new generation of young women, who have grown up in an internet age glutted with stories about bad sex, will find it both reassuringly familiar and disconcertingly fresh. I think they are right about that, though perhaps for the wrong reasons: reading it again, I was once more taken aback by how good it is. It\u2019s one of those books that, no matter how many times you return to it, is always somehow a different book from the one you remember. LitHub\u2019s Emily Temple has written an excellent essay about why aspiring female writers, in particular, are often drawn to <em>Bad Behavior</em>. Reading it at 22, she recalls:</p> <p><em>The overwhelming feeling \u2026 was one of </em>permission<em>, both as a human and as a writer. After a (short) lifetime of being told that it was men and only men who were allowed the complex stories, the unlikeable narrators, the bad habits and cruelties, reading this book felt like peeling off an unwanted skin. I too could be taken seriously, I thought. I too could be chilly and sharp. I too could think such thoughts and chronicle them.</em></p> <p>I agree wholeheartedly with all of this, especially the note about cruelty. The first time I read <em>Bad Behavior</em>, it was the cruelty that compelled me. Gaitskill\u2019s narrative voice is <em>hilariously</em> mean. Her crucifying eye is most often observing the men her young female protagonists are sleeping with, and the disjunction between the way the women are behaving (politely, accommodatingly) and what they are thinking serves as a wellspring of endless black humour. For example, in the story \u201cA Romantic Weekend\u201d, a young woman reflects on a liaison that has gone poorly, to say the least:</p> <p><em>His voice was high-pitched and stupidly aggressive, like some weird kid who would walk up to you on the street and offer to take care of your sexual needs. How, she thought miserably, could she have mistaken this hostile moron for the dark, brooding hero who would crush her like an insect and then talk about life and art?</em></p> <p>Hostile moron! There is something so unleashed about that, the intensity of fury and contempt and revulsion, that makes me feel slightly giddy, even now. And note how the judgment ricochets off the man to land, ultimately, on the woman, but only in a very particular way: how could I ever have been so foolish as to believe anything good about <em>you</em>?</p> <p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in that, when I was younger, I imagined that one of the pleasures of being a writer would be that you\u2019d always get the last word. The date might go badly, the sex might be awful \u2013 or even violent or coercive \u2013 but a month later, or a year later, or 10, your old enemy would pick up your book and realise: \u201cOh, shit, I was a hostile moron <em>the whole time</em>.\u201d This is, let me be clear, an illusion. To write fiction successfully, you need to have more distance from your own experience than such positioning allows; a commitment to truth requires that you let go of your desire to use fiction to enforce justice. And yet some stories, like many of the ones in <em>Bad Behavior</em>, nonetheless create the satisfying <em>sensation</em> of punishment, and this is one of the book\u2019s most distinct pleasures. Reading \u201cA Romantic Weekend\u201d, I can\u2019t help feel as though somewhere, out there, is a man who, through the deadly deployment of the phrase \u201chostile moron\u201d, has been captured and defeated, pinned like a butterfly to the page.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"808b2f188b06c7fae626285692a083c44e69b499\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/808b2f188b06c7fae626285692a083c44e69b499/0_0_1525_2341/651.jpg\" alt=\"Gaitskill\u2019s 1988 story collection, Bad Behavior.\" width=\"651\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gaitskill\u2019s 1988 story collection, <em>Bad Behavior.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penguin Classics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This may be why the term \u201cautobiographical\u201d so often surfaces in discussions of Gaitskill\u2019s work, even though there\u2019s obviously no way to know how closely the stories parallel real life, and only a handful even make use of the first person. There is something about the way she righteously skewers her minor characters through the sharp observations of her protagonists that makes reality feel as though it\u2019s hovering very close by. Funnily enough, actual autobiographical essays rarely pull off this trick. Any visible, vested interest in self-justification dooms this kind of writing from the start. Only in fiction, maybe, can we experience this type of displaced catharsis. By removing herself from the story, the author creates space for the reader to project into that role, imagining a world in which all her judgments are final, all her enemies defeated by the sheer force of her words. Probably this is a dream that appeals, most intensely, to the powerless: people who struggle, in real life and in real time, to make themselves heard. Which is why, returning to <em>Bad Behavior </em>now, in my late 30s, I\u2019m struck less by its humour than I am by the pain. The women in these stories think cruel thoughts primarily as a response to the cruelty of others. They smile prettily \u2013 or stare blankly \u2013 holding in their frustration until it ignites into rage.</p> <p>In her article about Gaitskill, Emily Temple points out the astonishing way that the story \u201cSecretary\u201d changed as it moved from page to screen, transformed from a brutal tale of raw humiliation to a romantic comedy about female empowerment through BDSM. To me, it feels as though something analogous has happened with the way <em>Bad Behavior</em> has been transformed into The Book About Bad Sex, even though it treats a much wider range of topics (friendship, queerness, parenthood and death, to name a few) and Gaitskill herself has had an extraordinarily varied career. Reviews of her newer fiction inevitably bring up both <em>Bad Behavior</em> and the fact that her work has been perennially misinterpreted through the lens of her \u201cshocking\u201d first collection. Thus, the fetishisation of <em>Bad Behavior</em> is endlessly receding, always someone else\u2019s issue, never the reviewer\u2019s own: \u201cI\u2019m only talking about the kinky sex because other people are talking about it\u201d; \u201cMary, why do you think everyone else is so obsessed with the sexual elements in your work?\u201d In countless interviews, you can watch Gaitskill try to extract herself from this tangle, asserting first that she doesn\u2019t engage with criticism of her writing, and then patiently trying to correct some of the most egregious assumptions about who she is and what her goals as a writer might be.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Gaitskill has\u00a0a certain quality\u00a0of voice: the sense\u00a0of a line strung between horror and humour, a laugh and a\u00a0scream</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Not long ago, I was taken aback to see my own photo appear above a column in this newspaper that demanded to know: Why Are So Many Women Writing About Rough Sex? In the piece, the columnist talked about my book alongside those of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/01/normal-people-sally-rooney-review\" title=\"\">Sally Rooney</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/roxane-gay\" title=\"\">Roxane Gay</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/12/the-books-that-made-me-ottessa-moshfegh\" title=\"\">Ottessa Moshfegh</a> and culminating, inevitably, with Gaitskill. I happened to be on my UK book tour at the time, and so a variation of this question \u2013 why all the bad sex? \u2013 that made reference to the article and the other writers mentioned in it regularly surfaced. When asked, I would try, carefully, to delineate the differences between the role sex was playing in my stories versus those of the other writers, noting my genre influences, the way Rooney\u2019s sex scenes are fully integrated into her realist project of close attention to a single intimate relationship; the explicit connection Gay makes between desire and trauma, etc. I said: \u201cI can only speak for myself, but \u2026 \u201d over and over, until it almost became a mantra \u2013 though the truth was, I no longer felt fully capable of speaking for myself, either.</p> <p>Publishing a book and watching people react to it is a little like seeing a photo of yourself for the first time, after a lifetime of looking in a mirror. Wait, <em>that\u2019s</em> how everybody else sees me? One flaw hugely magnified, another barely visible, all your features slightly off-kilter, a certain wrongness, a sense of alienation: <em>no, that\u2019s not who I am! </em>Before the book came out, I would have said that \u201cbad\u201d sex, in all its varieties, was one element of my work, but not the defining one. I would have named as influences primarily writers who shared my interest in genre: Shirley Jackson, Joyce Carol Oates, Angela Carter, Stephen King. I tend to bristle at what feels like the suggestion that the sex in my writing must be <em>the point</em>; that all the other elements exist to say something about sex, and the state of sexual relations, rather than the other way round.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"115269f38416319766b46ff268a9aa5e7950772c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/115269f38416319766b46ff268a9aa5e7950772c/0_264_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Gaitskill\u2019s career represents the pinnacle of what a writer can achieve\u2019 \u2026 Kristen Roupenian.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Gaitskill\u2019s career represents the pinnacle of what a writer can achieve\u2019 \u2026 Kristen Roupenian.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chuk Nowak/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With time, however, I have begun to wonder whether a certain strand of DNA has indeed passed through Gaitskill to a new generation of writers; if her influence is greater than most of us suspect. If that\u2019s true, we should look for traces of her style not only in debut collections of young female writers (though it will undoubtedly be there), nor in books that explicitly take up the subject of kinky sex. To me, what\u2019s most distinctive about Gaitskill is a certain quality of voice: the sense of a line strung taut between horror and humour, a laugh and a scream. Given that so much of our contemporary moment provokes that exact mixture of feelings, perhaps she was simply ahead of her time.</p> <p>Shortly after I wrote the original draft of this piece, my phone lit up with texts from friends who wanted to talk to me about a Gaitskill novella, <em>This </em><em>Is Pleasure,</em> that had appeared in the New Yorker: a story about sexual harassment in the workplace that was being described as a direct response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\" title=\"\">#MeToo</a> and which featured, as one of its protagonists, a woman who shared the name of my story\u2019s main character. Margot grows up, as one friend described it. I procrastinated about reading it, afraid that it would be, in some way, a criticism, a parody, or disavowal of my work, or \u2013 more realistically \u2013 that my ego would perceive some form of judgmental engagement where none was meant to be. Was the story in dialogue with mine? I think so, if only in a playful, glancing way. Certainly, it\u2019s one that flirts with metafiction, delighting in the occasional self-referential wink:</p> <p><em>My professional reputation, after all, was made when I published a book of charming stories about masochistic women (the now charmless author of which is still complaining about the size of her advance), a book that was seen variously as groundbreaking, \u201cempowering</em><em>\u201d, sad, eye-rollingly trite, and, finally, sociologically interesting; although I\u2019ve shepherded many books into existence since, I have never quite separated myself from that titillating yet tiresome aura.</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/26/cat-person-author-kristen-roupenian-dating-ego-power-control\">Cat Person author Kristen Roupenian: 'Dating is caught up in ego, power and control'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The real world, once again, hovers very close by. I don\u2019t have enough distance on my own story to say with certainty how <em>This </em><em>Is Pleasure</em>, engages with \u201cCat Person\u201d, if it is meant to at all.

In both stories, women encounter a man whose behaviour upsets and unsettles them, and they struggle to determine how much of the responsibility is theirs (because they took some fleeting pleasure in it; because they could have put a stop to it, and did not) and how much belongs to him (because there were concrete hierarchies in which he had more power than they did; because surely we must all take some responsibility when we cause another person pain). My Margot \u2013 younger Margot \u2013 oscillates between extremes and lands on a story in which the bulk of the responsibility is his; Gaitskill\u2019s older Margot emphasises the ways that the choices that mattered most were hers. But what both stories have in common, I think, is the tacit recognition that they are stories. Some stories will account for some aspects of reality better than others, but none will ever be a fully comprehensive account. Or, as a character in <em>This Is Pleasure</em> puts it: \u201cLife is too big for anybody, and that\u2019s why we invent stories.\u201d</p> <p>Gaitskill\u2019s career still represents, for me, the pinnacle of what a writer can achieve \u2013 but it also reminds me how fraught the path to such a career remains. Write a book about the way young women use words to fight back against those who want to reduce them to sexual objects, and you may struggle to prevent yourself from becoming similarly reduced. But that, too, is a story that I\u2019m telling, one that may, in its own way, be an imperfect fit.</p> <p>In the interview that accompanies the recent novella, Gaitskill says: \u201cI am aware that some people will find the story offensive. I am not indifferent to that, but I can\u2019t control how people respond. I don\u2019t mind if some people think Quin \u2013 or Margot \u2013 is bad, and I don\u2019t think that to feel that way is necessarily a misreading; it\u2019s more a matter of opinion. It\u2019s a compliment if people respond to my characters as if they were real \u2013 and, in a way, my intentions don\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>I hope that, someday, I\u2019ll be able to tell myself the same story, and believe it. If I can, it will be, at least in part, because of Mary Gaitskill.</p> <p> \u2022 <em>Bad Behavior by Mary Gaitskill is published by Penguin Classics (\u00a38.99).

      "bodyText": "In 2017, \u201cCat Person\u201d, the first short story I\u2019d ever published, went viral. In the story, a college student named Margot goes on a long, disastrous date with a man in his mid-30s named Robert. At the end of the night, Margot sleeps with Robert, despite realising, belatedly, that she has no desire to do so. Her reasons for making that choice remain opaque even to her, and she ghosts him the next day. To my surprise \u2013 and, I think, to my editor\u2019s \u2013 the story became a catalyst for dozens of overlapping conversations about sex, consent, online dating and #MeToo. Amid the waves of often contradictory praise, judgment and analysis of \u201cCat Person\u201d, an occasional comparison surfaced, that I clung to like a lifeline: the work of Mary Gaitskill. When people brought up her name in conjunction with mine, I felt both relieved and grateful. Partly this was because I genuinely loved her writing, but it also had to do with a story I had in my head about her career: she was a female writer who had first come to prominence because of stories that featured explicit sex. She had weathered the onslaught of prurient attention \u2013 not just to her writing, but to her life and her looks \u2013 that had come along with that. But she had emerged on the other side of that maelstrom as a writer who had achieved near-universal critical acclaim. I understood these early comparisons as the compliment they were almost certainly intended to be: a suggestion that I was not just a woman writing narcissistically about her own sex life and veiling it under a thin gauze of fiction; I was a woman writing narcissistically about her own sex life, veiling it under a thin gauze of fiction, and then, through some magic, turning it into art. For all my admiration of the writer, though, I soon began to suspect that the Gaitskill comparison was more loaded than it first appeared. \u201cI love Mary Gaitskill,\u201d I said to a friend not long after my story came out. \u201cBut even Mary Gaitskill isn\u2019t Mary Gaitskill any more.\u201d By which I meant: Gaitskill\u2019s debut collection, Bad Behavior, originally published in 1988, is now more than 30 years old. In the intervening decades, she has published three novels, two more short-story collections, and a book of essays \u2013 but no one who used her name in conjunction with mine made any reference to this work. That became even more noticeable when my first book was published, and people continued to compare it to Gaitskill (in ways both complimentary to me and not) despite the fact that it was unabashedly a collection of genre-inflected horror stories, about as different in content from Bad Behavior as it was possible to be \u2026 well, except for all the sex. Now, I would certainly like to think Gaitskill and I have some stylistic and thematic elements in common, but no one was citing Gaitskill in my reviews to note how, say, I was interrogating the way that white women negotiate their historically troubled relationship to sentimentality, as she did in her most recent novel, The Mare. They brought up Gaitskill because my book had weird bad sex in it, and she had written the definitive book about Bad Sex \u2013 you know, the one with the story they made the movie Secretary about. Penguin rereleased Bad Behavior in the UK this year, no doubt gambling that a new generation of young women, who have grown up in an internet age glutted with stories about bad sex, will find it both reassuringly familiar and disconcertingly fresh. I think they are right about that, though perhaps for the wrong reasons: reading it again, I was once more taken aback by how good it is. It\u2019s one of those books that, no matter how many times you return to it, is always somehow a different book from the one you remember. LitHub\u2019s Emily Temple has written an excellent essay about why aspiring female writers, in particular, are often drawn to Bad Behavior. Reading it at 22, she recalls: The overwhelming feeling \u2026 was one of permission, both as a human and as a writer. After a (short) lifetime of being told that it was men and only men who were allowed the complex stories, the unlikeable narrators, the bad habits and cruelties, reading this book felt like peeling off an unwanted skin. I too could be taken seriously, I thought. I too could be chilly and sharp. I too could think such thoughts and chronicle them. I agree wholeheartedly with all of this, especially the note about cruelty. The first time I read Bad Behavior, it was the cruelty that compelled me. Gaitskill\u2019s narrative voice is hilariously mean. Her crucifying eye is most often observing the men her young female protagonists are sleeping with, and the disjunction between the way the women are behaving (politely, accommodatingly) and what they are thinking serves as a wellspring of endless black humour. For example, in the story \u201cA Romantic Weekend\u201d, a young woman reflects on a liaison that has gone poorly, to say the least: His voice was high-pitched and stupidly aggressive, like some weird kid who would walk up to you on the street and offer to take care of your sexual needs. How, she thought miserably, could she have mistaken this hostile moron for the dark, brooding hero who would crush her like an insect and then talk about life and art? Hostile moron! There is something so unleashed about that, the intensity of fury and contempt and revulsion, that makes me feel slightly giddy, even now. And note how the judgment ricochets off the man to land, ultimately, on the woman, but only in a very particular way: how could I ever have been so foolish as to believe anything good about you? I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in that, when I was younger, I imagined that one of the pleasures of being a writer would be that you\u2019d always get the last word. The date might go badly, the sex might be awful \u2013 or even violent or coercive \u2013 but a month later, or a year later, or 10, your old enemy would pick up your book and realise: \u201cOh, shit, I was a hostile moron the whole time.\u201d This is, let me be clear, an illusion. To write fiction successfully, you need to have more distance from your own experience than such positioning allows; a commitment to truth requires that you let go of your desire to use fiction to enforce justice. And yet some stories, like many of the ones in Bad Behavior, nonetheless create the satisfying sensation of punishment, and this is one of the book\u2019s most distinct pleasures. Reading \u201cA Romantic Weekend\u201d, I can\u2019t help feel as though somewhere, out there, is a man who, through the deadly deployment of the phrase \u201chostile moron\u201d, has been captured and defeated, pinned like a butterfly to the page. This may be why the term \u201cautobiographical\u201d so often surfaces in discussions of Gaitskill\u2019s work, even though there\u2019s obviously no way to know how closely the stories parallel real life, and only a handful even make use of the first person. There is something about the way she righteously skewers her minor characters through the sharp observations of her protagonists that makes reality feel as though it\u2019s hovering very close by. Funnily enough, actual autobiographical essays rarely pull off this trick. Any visible, vested interest in self-justification dooms this kind of writing from the start. Only in fiction, maybe, can we experience this type of displaced catharsis. By removing herself from the story, the author creates space for the reader to project into that role, imagining a world in which all her judgments are final, all her enemies defeated by the sheer force of her words. Probably this is a dream that appeals, most intensely, to the powerless: people who struggle, in real life and in real time, to make themselves heard. Which is why, returning to Bad Behavior now, in my late 30s, I\u2019m struck less by its humour than I am by the pain. The women in these stories think cruel thoughts primarily as a response to the cruelty of others. They smile prettily \u2013 or stare blankly \u2013 holding in their frustration until it ignites into rage. In her article about Gaitskill, Emily Temple points out the astonishing way that the story \u201cSecretary\u201d changed as it moved from page to screen, transformed from a brutal tale of raw humiliation to a romantic comedy about female empowerment through BDSM. To me, it feels as though something analogous has happened with the way Bad Behavior has been transformed into The Book About Bad Sex, even though it treats a much wider range of topics (friendship, queerness, parenthood and death, to name a few) and Gaitskill herself has had an extraordinarily varied career. Reviews of her newer fiction inevitably bring up both Bad Behavior and the fact that her work has been perennially misinterpreted through the lens of her \u201cshocking\u201d first collection. Thus, the fetishisation of Bad Behavior is endlessly receding, always someone else\u2019s issue, never the reviewer\u2019s own: \u201cI\u2019m only talking about the kinky sex because other people are talking about it\u201d; \u201cMary, why do you think everyone else is so obsessed with the sexual elements in your work?\u201d In countless interviews, you can watch Gaitskill try to extract herself from this tangle, asserting first that she doesn\u2019t engage with criticism of her writing, and then patiently trying to correct some of the most egregious assumptions about who she is and what her goals as a writer might be. Not long ago, I was taken aback to see my own photo appear above a column in this newspaper that demanded to know: Why Are So Many Women Writing About Rough Sex? In the piece, the columnist talked about my book alongside those of Sally Rooney, Roxane Gay, Ottessa Moshfegh and culminating, inevitably, with Gaitskill. I happened to be on my UK book tour at the time, and so a variation of this question \u2013 why all the bad sex? \u2013 that made reference to the article and the other writers mentioned in it regularly surfaced. When asked, I would try, carefully, to delineate the differences between the role sex was playing in my stories versus those of the other writers, noting my genre influences, the way Rooney\u2019s sex scenes are fully integrated into her realist project of close attention to a single intimate relationship; the explicit connection Gay makes between desire and trauma, etc. I said: \u201cI can only speak for myself, but \u2026 \u201d over and over, until it almost became a mantra \u2013 though the truth was, I no longer felt fully capable of speaking for myself, either. Publishing a book and watching people react to it is a little like seeing a photo of yourself for the first time, after a lifetime of looking in a mirror. Wait, that\u2019s how everybody else sees me? One flaw hugely magnified, another barely visible, all your features slightly off-kilter, a certain wrongness, a sense of alienation: no, that\u2019s not who I am! Before the book came out, I would have said that \u201cbad\u201d sex, in all its varieties, was one element of my work, but not the defining one. I would have named as influences primarily writers who shared my interest in genre: Shirley Jackson, Joyce Carol Oates, Angela Carter, Stephen King. I tend to bristle at what feels like the suggestion that the sex in my writing must be the point; that all the other elements exist to say something about sex, and the state of sexual relations, rather than the other way round. With time, however, I have begun to wonder whether a certain strand of DNA has indeed passed through Gaitskill to a new generation of writers; if her influence is greater than most of us suspect. If that\u2019s true, we should look for traces of her style not only in debut collections of young female writers (though it will undoubtedly be there), nor in books that explicitly take up the subject of kinky sex. To me, what\u2019s most distinctive about Gaitskill is a certain quality of voice: the sense of a line strung taut between horror and humour, a laugh and a scream. Given that so much of our contemporary moment provokes that exact mixture of feelings, perhaps she was simply ahead of her time. Shortly after I wrote the original draft of this piece, my phone lit up with texts from friends who wanted to talk to me about a Gaitskill novella, This Is Pleasure, that had appeared in the New Yorker: a story about sexual harassment in the workplace that was being described as a direct response to #MeToo and which featured, as one of its protagonists, a woman who shared the name of my story\u2019s main character. Margot grows up, as one friend described it. I procrastinated about reading it, afraid that it would be, in some way, a criticism, a parody, or disavowal of my work, or \u2013 more realistically \u2013 that my ego would perceive some form of judgmental engagement where none was meant to be. Was the story in dialogue with mine? I think so, if only in a playful, glancing way. Certainly, it\u2019s one that flirts with metafiction, delighting in the occasional self-referential wink: My professional reputation, after all, was made when I published a book of charming stories about masochistic women (the now charmless author of which is still complaining about the size of her advance), a book that was seen variously as groundbreaking, \u201cempowering\u201d, sad, eye-rollingly trite, and, finally, sociologically interesting; although I\u2019ve shepherded many books into existence since, I have never quite separated myself from that titillating yet tiresome aura. The real world, once again, hovers very close by. I don\u2019t have enough distance on my own story to say with certainty how This Is Pleasure, engages with \u201cCat Person\u201d, if it is meant to at all. But if I had to hazard a guess, I\u2019d venture \u201cMargot grows up\u201d isn\u2019t a bad description. In both stories, women encounter a man whose behaviour upsets and unsettles them, and they struggle to determine how much of the responsibility is theirs (because they took some fleeting pleasure in it; because they could have put a stop to it, and did not) and how much belongs to him (because there were concrete hierarchies in which he had more power than they did; because surely we must all take some responsibility when we cause another person pain). My Margot \u2013 younger Margot \u2013 oscillates between extremes and lands on a story in which the bulk of the responsibility is his; Gaitskill\u2019s older Margot emphasises the ways that the choices that mattered most were hers. But what both stories have in common, I think, is the tacit recognition that they are stories. Some stories will account for some aspects of reality better than others, but none will ever be a fully comprehensive account. Or, as a character in This Is Pleasure puts it: \u201cLife is too big for anybody, and that\u2019s why we invent stories.\u201d Gaitskill\u2019s career still represents, for me, the pinnacle of what a writer can achieve \u2013 but it also reminds me how fraught the path to such a career remains. Write a book about the way young women use words to fight back against those who want to reduce them to sexual objects, and you may struggle to prevent yourself from becoming similarly reduced. But that, too, is a story that I\u2019m telling, one that may, in its own way, be an imperfect fit.

      "bodyText": "Something is killing conventional economics and it\u2019s probably an inside job. Reliance on abstract mathematics and absurd assumptions has brought the discipline into disrepute, even if politics and policy are guided by the ghosts of its teaching. Nobody was surprised recently to learn that the price of the overdue and over-budget HS2 high-speed rail project could rise by another \u00a330bn. People were surprised to learn, however, that in the cost-benefit analysis used to justify the original project, planners assumed that no passengers work while on a train. That made the times savings on the new line look more valuable than they really were. But curiosities like that are nothing compared with the epic, conceptual departures from the real world made by the economics mainstream in recent years. Risk models used by the investment bank Goldman Sachs suggested that the financial crisis of 2007 should have been in effect impossible. And have you ever wondered why privatisation continues in the face of repeated failures from care services to railways, and in spite of pledges to rein them in? It\u2019s because neoclassical economics has so deeply entrenched the notion that markets are better than all other ways of organising life, that decisions escape rational scrutiny. Academic economists will tell you that their discipline offers a far more complex picture of the world. But, at the policy level, what tilts a spending decision one way or the other is the simple power of the seeming \u201cfolk wisdom\u201d that markets are best. It becomes the rule of thumb. They might look less good if the assumptions on which the equilibrium models that got us here were more widely known. The idea of perfect markets under perfect competition, for example, asks us to believe in a world where everybody knows everything, there are an infinite number of companies, no barriers to setting up a business, where any product can stand in for any other (say, a banana for a tractor) and, crucially, there are no \u201cexternalities\u201d (economic speak for \u201cconsequences\u201d) from production or consumption. All models use a few simplifying assumptions, but those underpinning mainstream economics more often distort and detach from reality. It\u2019s one of the reasons why students have rebelled, forming groups to demand that universities take a more pluralistic approach to teaching economics. Katie Kedward left a banking job in the City for ethical reasons and sought a degree that would make sense of economics. Despairing at the unreality of mainstream courses, she found a rare exception: a master\u2019s in ecological economics at the University of Leeds. The course, though, isn\u2019t even taught in the economics department but the School of Earth and Environment. That\u2019s why new groups are emerging to promote heterodox economics, which draws on the insights of the study of complexity, neuro and behavioural science, ecology, feminism and the core economy of family, mutualism and community. But there\u2019s an awfully long way to go. Late last year, on the day that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its starkest warning yet on the importance of holding global heating below 1.5C, William Nordhaus was awarded economics equivalent of the Nobel prize. Nordhaus is famous for applying conventional economic models to environmental issues. Using his toolkit on climate breakdown, infamously he came to the conclusion that an optimal economic approach would allow warming of at least 3C \u2013 the level that climate science shows would cause catastrophic, irreversible change. For anyone outside economics that might seem bewildering, but the blase disregard of the economy being a wholly owned, and utterly dependent, subsidiary of the biosphere is perfectly symbolic. Economics has a reputation for being dismal because it seems to delight in making itself confusing and inaccessible. Real progress, and better decision making, is hard to imagine without demystifying the discipline and breaking the singular grip of old school, neoclassical teaching. For that reason, my colleague David Boyle and I dared to write a beginners\u2019 guide for the complete non-expert. In it we ask some heretical questions that that could get us expelled from most university economics departments, such as: is the price mechanism so clever, or rising productivity always a good thing? We talk about the trouble with growth, and why working less might be better. Our common starting point is that the economy should serve rather than dominate people, and that it must work within planetary ecological boundaries. Roasted by heatwaves, this year the world went into ecological overshoot on 29 July, the earliest yet. Unless we begin again with economics, understanding and letting go what has gone wrong, and letting more of the real world in, one day soon everything will have fallen apart and nobody will quite know why. But the answer will be: it was the economy, stupid. \u2022 Andrew Simms is co-author with David Boyle of Economics: A Crash Course, published this week",

      "bodyText": "At Bury\u2019s historic, homely, Gigg Lane stadium, two days before what should have been the start of the season in League One, the ticket office of the newly promoted club was open but doing almost no business and the Shakers superstore was shuttered closed. The car park contained only two cars, the main reception door locked, with no lights on inside. All that was missing was the odd clump of tumbleweed, blowing across the ground. The EFL has suspended Bury\u2019s opening two games \u2013 against MK Dons and at Accrington on 10 August \u2013 a measure nobody can recall happening before, certainly not at Bury, established in 1885, who have fielded a team through every Football League season and every tumult of history since 1894. Yet in 2019 the owner, Steve Dale, has not satisfied the league that Bury have the money for hefty wages still owed to the players who won promotion \u2013 now, like the then manager Ryan Lowe, mostly departed for other clubs \u2013 or to last this season. Dale, who bought the overspending club for \u00a31 in December from Stewart Day, a property developer several of whose businesses were falling insolvent, said at the time he saw it as a philanthropic venture to help young people, and that he could \u201cbring business acumen to resolve the problems\u201d. Since then, the players won a remarkable promotion in May then revealed they had not been paid since February and called on Dale to go; office staff complained of \u201cabysmal treatment\u201d and several were then sacked by a letter informing them the club was insolvent. In June Dale completed a company voluntary arrangement that commits to paying unsecured creditors 25p for every \u00a31 owed, which saw off a winding-up petition. He has recruited a manager, Paul Wilkinson, who is understood to have six players on contracts, but Bury are under an embargo preventing them signing any more until the EFL has seen proof their wages will be paid. Dale has insisted in defiant statements on the club\u2019s website that he has indeed provided \u201cproof of funds\u201d, and while Gigg Lane wears the look of a dying club, there is apparently still vibrant football activity at their training base, Manchester City\u2019s old complex in Carrington. The supporters\u2019 trust, Forever Bury, has a home in a cabin on the edge of the Gigg Lane car park, a haven of warmth, love for the club, and celebration of its upstanding history. An honours board remembers men, now passed away, \u201cwhose contribution marks them out, be it for their loyalty, sacrifice or endeavours\u201d. They include early chairmen and players; Bob Stokoe, who was a Shakers player, player-manager and manager; and Neville Neville, husband of Jill who remains the club secretary, the parents of Gary, Phil and Tracey. A stalwart as commercial director, Neville was instrumental in saving the club after it fell into administration in 2002, with another on the honours board, the then chairman Fred Mason. Forever Bury was formed in response to that crisis and the trust\u2019s chairman, Dave Giffard, gave up his job as a computer manager to become fully involved. A Shaker since he went to his first match at Gigg Lane, enthralled, in 1959 aged eight, Giffard has never been paid as the trust chairman, and for years before he finally became a pensioner, he tried to do it on \u00a31 a day. \u201cIf I needed to go to Manchester [which is eight miles away] I walked,\u201d he says casually. \u201cI got a large map of our area and walked systematically street by street getting to every company, letting them know we are here and asking if they could help.

These days, many worthy causes compete for crowdfunding, and football people are more financially literate and wearier of clubs in crisis. Some fans have reacted to Bury\u2019s crumbling with resentment at the promotion, won with a team who the club could not afford to pay. Dominic Martinez, one among a small group of supporters who sounded the alarm about Day\u2019s financial practices after a loan was taken out in 2014 secured on Gigg Lane at 138% annual interest, believes the crisis highlights inadequacies in the game\u2019s rules. The EFL has said Dale took the club over from Day without ever providing proof of funds as required under its regulations, yet he remains the owner and sole director, insisting he can turn it all round. \u201cIt seems the EFL rules are not adequate to prevent clubs overspending,\u201d Martinez says, \u201cand as they are limited companies, once somebody owns a club, they have complete power.\u201d He says he always felt Gigg Lane was home from his first match, aged 13 in 1988, a 0-0 draw with Port Vale, and has taken his children, Lawrence, 14, George, 11, and Ana, six, since they were babies.

He recalls the long family tradition of support; his great-grandfather, a prisoner in the first world war, taking James\u2019 father in the 50s, who then took James in the 80s.

At which point we come full circle. What Jones says about coaching female fast bowlers is applicable to anyone. Why aren\u2019t men bowling steadily faster over time? Why do we seem to have topped out at the low 90s? Why would you coach every person as though their physique is the same, rather than a distinct thing with its own angles and strengths? Opening the door for a more detailed sport science may just be a great leap forward for everyone.</p> <p>Sound far-fetched? Well, it may have happened once already. There is evidence it was women who invented round-arm bowling in the first place, made necessary by the formal outfits 19th-century female cricketers had to wear and quickly adopted by their male underarm counterparts. Who knows, with a little care, and little less concern for the idea of one size fits all, something similar could even happen again.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 August 2019.

What Jones says about coaching female fast bowlers is applicable to anyone. Why aren\u2019t men bowling steadily faster over time? Why do we seem to have topped out at the low 90s? Why would you coach every person as though their physique is the same, rather than a distinct thing with its own angles and strengths? Opening the door for a more detailed sport science may just be a great leap forward for everyone. Sound far-fetched? Well, it may have happened once already. There is evidence it was women who invented round-arm bowling in the first place, made necessary by the formal outfits 19th-century female cricketers had to wear and quickly adopted by their male underarm counterparts. Who knows, with a little care, and little less concern for the idea of one size fits all, something similar could even happen again. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 August 2019. An earlier version, referring to Charterhouse and Rugby, said they \u201care not co-educational schools\u201d. That reference should have been in the past tense.",

Mubi, for example, tends to be director-led in its programming, dedicating the bulk of its retrospectives and guest-curator spots to the artists calling the shots behind the camera. Yet its current themed season, dedicated to the work of Juliette Binoche, makes a compelling case for the actor as auteur. The selected films, the bulk of them by celebrated film-makers in their own right, are tonally and stylistically disparate, yet bound by the French star\u2019s singular screen magnetism: a presence at once serene and febrile, with ideas and desires twitching beneath that extraordinary face.</p> <p>Now in her 50s, with more than 65 film credits to her name, Binoche is as busy as ever, with Claire Denis\u2019s brilliant <em>High Life</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/11/high-life-review-claire-denis-robert-pattison-juliette-binoche\" title=\"\">fresh in our film-going memories</a>, Olivier Assayas\u2019s chic, limber <strong>Non-Fiction</strong><strong> </strong>hitting screens (and Curzon Home Cinema) in October, and a new film with Japanese master Hirokazu Kore-eda, <em>The Truth</em>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/18/venice-film-festival-to-open-with-kore-edas-the-truth-starring-catherine-deneuve\" title=\"\">opening</a> the Venice film festival in a few weeks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1dd498224c8a16560fd3853a2c6c096d6b4526ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dd498224c8a16560fd3853a2c6c096d6b4526ab/0_0_3057_2070/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Binoche with Denis Lavant in Mauvais Sang (1986).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"677\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Binoche with Denis Lavant in Mauvais Sang (1986).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AF archive/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Subtitled \u201cThe Woman With a Thousand Faces\u201d, Mubi\u2019s <a href=\"https://mubi.com/specials/juliette-binoche\" title=\"\">best-of-Binoche roundup</a> is thoughtfully chosen and aptly rangy, even if it kicks off with one curious clanger (and one of the actress\u2019s few visibly unconfident moments) in Louis Malle\u2019s erotic melodrama <strong>Damage</strong>. From there on, however, the pickings get much richer. Before they shuffle off the end of Mubi\u2019s curated queue, you have a few days left to catch her two films with madcap visionary Leos Carax. In <strong>Mauvais Sang</strong>, one of her earliest breakout roles, her glowing ingenuousness is the stabilising influence in a thrillingly deranged Aids-era gangster thriller.

      "bodyText": "Auteurism \u2013 that sometimes questionable practice of attributing films entirely to their directors, superseding all other collaborators \u2013 is the predominant language of serious cinephilia, and serious cinephile streaming sites tend to follow suit. Mubi, for example, tends to be director-led in its programming, dedicating the bulk of its retrospectives and guest-curator spots to the artists calling the shots behind the camera. Yet its current themed season, dedicated to the work of Juliette Binoche, makes a compelling case for the actor as auteur. The selected films, the bulk of them by celebrated film-makers in their own right, are tonally and stylistically disparate, yet bound by the French star\u2019s singular screen magnetism: a presence at once serene and febrile, with ideas and desires twitching beneath that extraordinary face. Now in her 50s, with more than 65 film credits to her name, Binoche is as busy as ever, with Claire Denis\u2019s brilliant High Life fresh in our film-going memories, Olivier Assayas\u2019s chic, limber Non-Fiction hitting screens (and Curzon Home Cinema) in October, and a new film with Japanese master Hirokazu Kore-eda, The Truth, opening the Venice film festival in a few weeks. Subtitled \u201cThe Woman With a Thousand Faces\u201d, Mubi\u2019s best-of-Binoche roundup is thoughtfully chosen and aptly rangy, even if it kicks off with one curious clanger (and one of the actress\u2019s few visibly unconfident moments) in Louis Malle\u2019s erotic melodrama Damage. From there on, however, the pickings get much richer. Before they shuffle off the end of Mubi\u2019s curated queue, you have a few days left to catch her two films with madcap visionary Leos Carax. In Mauvais Sang, one of her earliest breakout roles, her glowing ingenuousness is the stabilising influence in a thrillingly deranged Aids-era gangster thriller. Five years later, in the ravishing, punk-operatic vagrant romance The Lovers on the Bridge, she was already a more knowing, sensuous actress. Also currently on the platform is her smart, candid turn as an audition-hopping actress in Michael Haneke\u2019s still-undervalued Code Unknown, a subversive essay on racism, class conflict and moral violence in Paris that plays, if anything, more urgently now than it did in 2000. (They don\u2019t have Haneke\u2019s more celebrated Binoche-starrer Hidden, an invaluable thematic companion piece, but Google Play does.) For a more relaxed, gentle, crinkled side of Binoche, Mubi have also selected Assayas\u2019s lovely, bittersweet, chablis-soaked Summer Hours, a grown-up family comedy that also ranks among its director\u2019s best. Newly landed on the Mubi queue, meanwhile, is the performance that, if pushed, I\u2019d pick as Binoche\u2019s greatest, and certainly one of the most ingenious by any actor this decade: she\u2019s wittily attuned to the evolution of identity, trickery and lovers\u2019 gamesmanship in Certified Copy, Abbas Kiarostami\u2019s origami-folded idea of a romantic comedy, in which two wary lovers are reunited... or have they just met? Coming later this month, too, are a pair of Bruno Dumont collaborations that perhaps offer the selection\u2019s most extreme Binoche contrasts. She\u2019s austerely devastating in the title role of stripped-back biopic Camille Claudel 1915, and having a blowsy, hysterical ball as a shrill, overdressed aristocrat in the poisoned slapstick romp Slack Bay. Also look out for Polish director Ma\u0142gorzata Szumowska\u2019s fascinating, largely overlooked Elles, a study of journalistic ethics and vicarious thrill-seeking powered by Binoche\u2019s risky physicality in the lead. A soup\u00e7on of Binoche, then, though should you wish to continue your own retrospective on other streaming platforms, options are plentiful, from established career high points such as Three Colours: Blue (Chili) to only-for-the-devoted oddities like her ambitious but uneven performance as a post-apartheid South African poet in In My Country (Amazon, if you\u2019re curious). Dig deeper, however, and you\u2019ll find a near-lost gem in the Mike Figgis short Mara, a 20-minute Henry Miller adaptation in which she bristles with concentrated sensuality. Taken from the director and recut by HBO for a 1991 compilation, it\u2019s now available via Figgis\u2019s own Vimeo page \u2013 a true Binoche completist can\u2019t do without it.

Domino (Signature, 18) Sad to report that Brian De Palma\u2019s first film in seven years is every bit the ignominious career footnote that its straight-to-DVD status suggests: an incoherent cop revenge thriller directed without much verve or pluck.

Speaking at the Garma festival in north-east Arnhem Land, the chief executive of the foundation, Denise Bowden, took aim at the Northern Territory government and the commonwealth, which she said had responsibility for the NT, and for the \u201crivers of gold\u201d that its GST formula sends to Darwin. \u201cFor the moment the Northern Territory government is unwilling or unable to respond to the deep outrage around deeply flawed processes, decision making and funding models,\u201d she said. \u201cThe commonwealth created the system that is currently in play in the Territory and has sat by and allowed it to continue unabated, dining out on the back of Aboriginal misery.\u201d Bowden drew on a submission by the foundation to the productivity commission, which alleged that the NT government siphoned half a billion dollars earmarked for Indigenous spending to other areas, by taking advantage of GST funds delivered without requirements on how they are spent. The Northern Territory receives a far bigger proportion of GST funds than the other states because of its high level of need. Yothu Yindi\u2019s analysis found that 68% of its $3.4bn was intended to benefit Indigenous people, but the NT government spent just 53%. \u201cThe data shows time and time again that hundreds of millions of dollars in untied GST funds sent to state and territory governments to address Aboriginal issues are diverted to other urban priorities, or are spent on administration in Darwin or other urban centres,\u201d Bowden said on Saturday. \u201cIt makes me cry that we are prisoners to this incompetence and maladministration.\u201d She cited as an example the $300m spent by the NT government on Darwin\u2019s waterfront precinct since 2006, and the up to $20m granted to the waterfront corporation annually to run a conference centre and tourist facilities, including a wave pool and artificial beach. \u201cForgetting the hundreds of millions in capital costs, that\u2019s an annual payment equivalent to 40 remote houses a year so local Darwinians and people visiting Darwin can enjoy themselves.\u201d Bowden accused the commonwealth of seemingly wiping its hands of a mess created \u201cwhen it left the NT to a small group of inexperience administrators in 1978\u201d. \u201cWe understand the importance of tourism to the economy but meanwhile in the bush the housing crisis continues, the housing deficit grows, indigenous people are living lives characterised by poverty and neglect and despair,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cAnother child is born to another overcrowded home.

C\u00e1diz is also nicknamed <em>tacita de plata </em>\u2013 silver cup \u2013 for the way the westering sun glints off the sea; it also makes the white marble west face of Santa Cruz cathedral glitter like a disco ball.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jul/2019-07-31T13:47:51.html\" data-alt=\"Europe map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jul/2019-07-31T13:47:51.html\">Europe map</a> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s also obvious from the tower is that C\u00e1diz is a perfect destination for those who like sea and sand but also a bit of urban buzz. Right in the old town, La Caleta is the smallest city beach, but still 450 metres long, and lovely enough to stand in for Havana in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/may/23/die-another-day-tv-film-recap\" title=\"\">Die Another Day </a>(Halle Berry, binoculars, orange bikini). A stroll to the south, Santa Maria beach is a family favourite, with calm water and a couple of <em>chiringuitos</em> (beach bars) on wide pale sand between two breakwaters.</p> <p>And these are just a curtain raiser for the four miles of unbroken sands stretching on south, starting with La Victoria (bus 1 or 7 from the old town), preferred by many young <em>gaditanos</em>, offering chiringuitos, pedalos, beach sports, outdoor cinema on the beach, and lots of bars and clubs on the prom behind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"09cdd299695986b34eeadc18beefb6e00052587d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09cdd299695986b34eeadc18beefb6e00052587d/0_286_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Santa Maria del Mar beach, C\u00e1diz.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Santa Maria del Mar beach, C\u00e1diz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeronimo Alba/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As recently as 15 years ago C\u00e1diz was a dodgy place, known more for drugs and prostitution than tapas and boutique hotels.

The line runs on to the millionaire playgrounds of Cannes and Monaco, but its first stop is Toulon, capital of the less-frequented and more affordable western Riviera.</p> <p>Founded by the Romans and a major naval base since the 15th century, Toulon also happens to have the warmest and sunniest climate in mainland France, and beaches of all kinds along 30 miles of inlets and peninsulas.</p> <p>Like many ports it once had a rather dangerous reputation, but today it is welcoming and visitor-friendly, with an integrated public transport system covering buses and the sky-blue ferries that ply its enormous natural harbour, linking the old town with beach resorts on its southern rim (<a href=\"https://www.reseaumistral.com/en\" title=\"\">10-trip ticket \u20ac10/\u20ac6.90 under-26s</a>).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b67c6bbb6e0c617de2b21d80a600b95132bc088d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b67c6bbb6e0c617de2b21d80a600b95132bc088d/0_403_6048_3629/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cityscape of night Toulon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toulon has an enormous harbour and fine public transport.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So there\u2019s a choice: base yourself at the beach and ride the ferry into the city for shopping and culture, or stay in the buzzy old town and make seaside day trips. Either way, it\u2019s a 25-minute ferry ride between the port (bottom of rue d\u2019Alger) and the wide sandy beach of <a href=\"https://www.tourisme-ouestvar.com/plage-des-sablettes-la-seyne-sur-mer.html\" title=\"\">Les Sablettes</a>, with the Fernand Braudel botanical garden. From here the coast path runs around Cap Sici\u00e9 headland, passing other beaches and coves, including small, shingly La Verne, and Fabr\u00e9gas, with black volcanic sand. Water sports lovers can explore on a paddleboard or kayak from <a href=\"http://www.ycsablettes.org/index.php/accueil.html\" title=\"\">Sablettes yacht club</a>.</p> <p>Ferries also run to the peninsula of Saint-Mandrier, which has beaches on its southern coast and a cute marina on its city side, and there are more sandy bays in the upscale eastern suburb of Le Mourillon (bus 3 from Boulevard Strasbourg). The former fishing hamlet of Anse Mejean is particularly special: a semicircular bay of gin-clear water tucked under Cap Brun fortress and home to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Resto-LEscale/351414418238638\" title=\"\">L\u2019Escale</a>, a waterside restaurant run by a former Toulon rugby star.

The authorities also recently reopened formerly bricked-up alleyways (similar to Lyon\u2019s <em>traboules</em>) under medieval buildings and made all museums (except the Naval History Museum) free. Check out the Asiatic art gallery, photography museum and contemporary Hotel des Arts. And if you\u2019re struggling to get your head around Toulon\u2019s watery geography, ride the cable car to the top of 584-metre Mont Faron (\u20ac7.80, take bus 40 to its foot), and it\u2019s all laid out below.</p> <p><strong>Where to stay</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.lecannier.com/\" title=\"\">Le Cannier</a> is a feet-in-the-sand fish restaurant (plat du jour \u20ac13) run by sisters Nathalie and Emmanuelle Frizzi.

Then you\u2019ll see the elegant bell tower of the baroque church of St Euphemia rising above a sea of terracotta rooftops and pastel-coloured houses. But however you arrive (the nearest station, Kanfanar, is 15 minutes away, while Pula airport is 40 minutes south) the charms of what is undoubtedly Istria\u2019s prettiest coastal town will soon be obvious.</p> <p>The Venetians left their mark on Rovinj after five centuries of rule \u2013 the Italians, too, from 1918 to 1947. The Istrian peninsula is officially bilingual, signs pointing to Rovigno as well as Rovinj. Perhaps because the old town was an island until 1763 when the channel was filled in, the medieval cobbled alleys and charmingly minute squares haven\u2019t really changed. It\u2019s one of the chief pleasures of the town \u2013 just wandering along the lanes before finding one that takes you to the water\u2019s edge.</p> <p>One alleyway to look out for is Ulica Grisia, which is lined with artists\u2019 workshops and galleries. On the second Sunday in August it turns into one long open-air art gallery.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"829512170cc4796d8e0e4a795798ef485ba5f4cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/829512170cc4796d8e0e4a795798ef485ba5f4cb/0_0_5119_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"There are plenty of islands to explore for visitors to Rovinj.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There are plenty of islands to explore for visitors to Rovinj.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William Manning/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the old town\u2019s peninsula is ringed with rocky swimming areas, including a series of concrete steps creating a beach near St Euphemia, the best beaches are to the south. Outside two of Rovinj\u2019s poshest hotels, <a href=\"http://monte-mulini.rovinj.hotels-istria.net/en/\" title=\"\">Monte Mulini</a> and <a href=\"http://lone.rovinj.hotels-istria.net/en/\" title=\"\">Hotel Lone</a>, is a sheltered bay with pebbly beaches along with very smart sunloungers available for rent. From here cycle and hiking paths through <a href=\"http://www.rovinj.co/en/meet-rovinj/nature/\" title=\"\">Zlatni Rt</a> lead to more secluded beaches as well as a rock-climbing area on the western side of the cape.</p> <p>The sprinkle of islands around Rovinj makes for a satisfying day \u2013 or evening \u2013 trip. The island of Sveta Katarina is a 10-minute boat ride away (\u00a33.65 return), and offers a dreamy view of Rovinj that\u2019s even more wonderful at sunset. Crveni Otok (Red Island), a 20-minute boat ride away (\u00a35 return), is a relaxing place to swim, snorkel and stroll through forest trails. It\u2019s actually two islands joined by a causeway, and, with no cars, it\u2019s a sublimely peaceful spot. But pack some swimming shoes to make the most of the pebbly and rocky beaches.</p> <p><strong>Where to eat</strong><br>Leave the harbourside restaurants to the other tourists and book ahead for <a href=\"https://www.puntulina.eu/\" title=\"\">La Puntulina</a> (mains from \u00a318), where a small terrace overlooks a rocky beach near St Euphemia. The cuisines of Italy and Istria are fused so closely that it\u2019s hard to know where one ends and the other begins. That translates into a lot of truffles \u2013 with ravioli, steak, pecorino cheese or sea bass \u2013 as well as grilled langoustines, prawns and octopus. Tucked away in a narrow alley, Mali Raj (mains from \u00a312), serves pasta, risotto and grilled meats and seafood on a vine-covered terrace.</p> <p><strong>Where to stay</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"567be295be895c034e50ec02b985cd84d22ba16f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/567be295be895c034e50ec02b985cd84d22ba16f/0_43_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Melegran, Rovinj\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A room at the Melegran, Rovinj</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Set in a restored townhouse, intimate little <a href=\"https://melegran.com/\" title=\"\">Melegran</a> has the feeling of a boutique hotel and is on a cobbled lane in the middle of the old town.</p> <p><strong>Getting there<br></strong>Probably the nicest way to arrive in Rovinj is to take a train to Venice then a <a href=\"https://venezialines.com/rovinj/\" title=\"\">ferry from San Basilio terminal</a> (2hr 45min).<br><strong>Mary Novakovich</strong></p> <h2>Cagliari<strong>,</strong> Sardinia</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a2a8bafc4f63cfac3e047faa926118de4d69912c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2a8bafc4f63cfac3e047faa926118de4d69912c/0_323_4800_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spiaggia del Poetto beach, Cagliari, Sardinia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Poetto beach.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAnd suddenly there is Cagliari: a naked town rising steep, steep, golden-looking, piled naked to the sky \u2026\u201d So wrote DH Lawrence in 1921 on sailing to Sardinia.

Out of town to the south-west, the open-air <a href=\"https://www.raversyde.be/\" title=\"\">Atlantic Wall Museum</a> is a major attraction, if a sombre one, with its 60 German second world war bunkers.

In summer, trains to Ostend are always packed with daytrippers carrying beach paraphernalia and filling the carriage with holiday vibes.

      "bodyText": "C\u00e1diz, Spain It was a real pigeon\u2019s eye view. The guide atop C\u00e1diz\u2019s Torre Tavira (\u20ac6) manoeuvred the concave viewing dish up, down and around, showing us watchtowers, churches, palaces, dockyards \u2013 and dozens of roof terraces with flapping laundry. The camera obscura at the top of this 45-metre tower, the tallest of 129 built in the 1700s for observing merchant ships, is a perfect introduction to Spain\u2019s most ancient city, and in particular its maritime position, with sea on three and a half sides. This camera obscura makes ingenious use of magnification and mirrors, but it is helped enormously by the intense light in this city, capital of Spain\u2019s Costa de la Luz. C\u00e1diz is also nicknamed tacita de plata \u2013 silver cup \u2013 for the way the westering sun glints off the sea; it also makes the white marble west face of Santa Cruz cathedral glitter like a disco ball. What\u2019s also obvious from the tower is that C\u00e1diz is a perfect destination for those who like sea and sand but also a bit of urban buzz. Right in the old town, La Caleta is the smallest city beach, but still 450 metres long, and lovely enough to stand in for Havana in Die Another Day (Halle Berry, binoculars, orange bikini). A stroll to the south, Santa Maria beach is a family favourite, with calm water and a couple of chiringuitos (beach bars) on wide pale sand between two breakwaters. And these are just a curtain raiser for the four miles of unbroken sands stretching on south, starting with La Victoria (bus 1 or 7 from the old town), preferred by many young gaditanos, offering chiringuitos, pedalos, beach sports, outdoor cinema on the beach, and lots of bars and clubs on the prom behind. As recently as 15 years ago C\u00e1diz was a dodgy place, known more for drugs and prostitution than tapas and boutique hotels. Things have changed a lot, but not to the extent that tourism pushes locals\u2019 lives to the margins. Just minutes from the cathedral square the narrow streets are home to low-key bars and greengrocers, and a historic covered market dealing mainly in fish and seafood such as oysters dredged that morning. The sea views from parks and tree-filled squares loud with birdsong are simple pleasures, but don\u2019t miss sights such as the oldest Roman amphitheatre in Spain (entrance on Calle Meson, free); two fortresses, San Sebasti\u00e1n and Santa Catalina, flanking La Caleta with art exhibitions and great views back to the city; and the Beaterio catacombs (\u20ac6) for a sobering view of C\u00e1diz life and death in centuries past. Where to eat Tapas is the way to go, with the option in many places of \u201csupersizing\u201d to a media racione. C\u00e1diz doesn\u2019t quite have a gay quarter, but our guide, dancer Sam Gordillo Conejo, took us to its \u201cgay corner\u201d and purple-painted, David Hockney-decorated tapas bar La Gorda te da de Comer (the fat woman feeds you. Tapas such as salmorejo tomato dip and bright green spinach croquetas cost from \u20ac2. Restaurante Balandro, facing north over the bay, is altogether posher, but sit up on high stools at the back bar and you eat the same food (small plates from \u20ac5) as in the main restaurant. In the evening, get to locals\u2019 favourite Taperia de Columela before the 9pm rush for interesting tapas such as aubergine \u201cchips\u201d and tuna lasagne (about \u20ac18 for two including a glass of wine). Where to stay Near the cathedral, Casa Nautilus is a converted period house with central atrium, roof terrace and 15 rooms, some with traditional glassed-in balconies (doubles from \u20ac59, room-only, but help-yourself coffee, tea and biscuits). Owned by the same people, the Spanish Galleon is more hostel-style (doubles with shared facilities from \u20ac35, apartments from \u20ac65). It has amazing views from its large roof terrace, and a new ground-floor cafe doing breakfasts from \u20ac2 and a \u20ac6 vegan lunch. Getting there Trains run to C\u00e1diz from London via Paris, Perpignan (sleeper) and Madrid. See loco2.com for details. Liz Boulter Toulon, France The C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur feeling starts soon after the eastbound train leaves Marseille: pale pink houses with apricot-coloured roofs, sharp spires of cypress trees, blue sea glimpsed through the spreading branches of umbrella pines. The line runs on to the millionaire playgrounds of Cannes and Monaco, but its first stop is Toulon, capital of the less-frequented and more affordable western Riviera. Founded by the Romans and a major naval base since the 15th century, Toulon also happens to have the warmest and sunniest climate in mainland France, and beaches of all kinds along 30 miles of inlets and peninsulas. Like many ports it once had a rather dangerous reputation, but today it is welcoming and visitor-friendly, with an integrated public transport system covering buses and the sky-blue ferries that ply its enormous natural harbour, linking the old town with beach resorts on its southern rim (10-trip ticket \u20ac10/\u20ac6.90 under-26s). So there\u2019s a choice: base yourself at the beach and ride the ferry into the city for shopping and culture, or stay in the buzzy old town and make seaside day trips. Either way, it\u2019s a 25-minute ferry ride between the port (bottom of rue d\u2019Alger) and the wide sandy beach of Les Sablettes, with the Fernand Braudel botanical garden. From here the coast path runs around Cap Sici\u00e9 headland, passing other beaches and coves, including small, shingly La Verne, and Fabr\u00e9gas, with black volcanic sand. Water sports lovers can explore on a paddleboard or kayak from Sablettes yacht club. Ferries also run to the peninsula of Saint-Mandrier, which has beaches on its southern coast and a cute marina on its city side, and there are more sandy bays in the upscale eastern suburb of Le Mourillon (bus 3 from Boulevard Strasbourg). The former fishing hamlet of Anse Mejean is particularly special: a semicircular bay of gin-clear water tucked under Cap Brun fortress and home to L\u2019Escale, a waterside restaurant run by a former Toulon rugby star. (It\u2019s usually possible to walk there from Le Mourillon, but the coast path is undergoing major reconstruction this year; take a taxi.) Toulon old town is vibrant thanks to a scheme offering tax breaks to young startups: atmospheric streets are lined with small seasonal bistros, vintage shops and galleries. The authorities also recently reopened formerly bricked-up alleyways (similar to Lyon\u2019s traboules) under medieval buildings and made all museums (except the Naval History Museum) free. Check out the Asiatic art gallery, photography museum and contemporary Hotel des Arts. And if you\u2019re struggling to get your head around Toulon\u2019s watery geography, ride the cable car to the top of 584-metre Mont Faron (\u20ac7.80, take bus 40 to its foot), and it\u2019s all laid out below. Where to stay Le Cannier is a feet-in-the-sand fish restaurant (plat du jour \u20ac13) run by sisters Nathalie and Emmanuelle Frizzi. Eight simple, fan-cooled doubles (from \u20ac75 room-only) on the first floor have balconies overlooking the beach. In town the faded but friendly and central Little Palace has doubles with aircon from \u20ac67 room-only. G\u00eetes sleeping four near Les Sablettes cost from \u20ac500 a week, and Camping La Presqu\u2019\u00eele has a pool, kids\u2019 club and mobile homes from \u20ac420 for four (check for last-minute deals). Where to eat In Fabr\u00e9gas, Il Gusto (formerly Chez Didier) does Italian food and a Friday grand aioli (the Proven\u00e7al dish of fish, shellfish and veg with garlicky mayonnaise). Of several beach restaurants at Le Mourillon, La Note Bleue is a good bet, specialising in barbecued local fish. In town, tiny Le Baron Perch\u00e9, in a small square near the port, offers a short, daily changing menu including veggie mains and Corsican specialities. Getting there Trains run to Toulon from London St Pancras International via Lille or Marseille, typically taking just over seven hours. See eurostar.com for details. LB Rovinj, Croatia Ideally, your first glimpse of Rovinj should be from the Adriatic. Then you\u2019ll see the elegant bell tower of the baroque church of St Euphemia rising above a sea of terracotta rooftops and pastel-coloured houses. But however you arrive (the nearest station, Kanfanar, is 15 minutes away, while Pula airport is 40 minutes south) the charms of what is undoubtedly Istria\u2019s prettiest coastal town will soon be obvious. The Venetians left their mark on Rovinj after five centuries of rule \u2013 the Italians, too, from 1918 to 1947. The Istrian peninsula is officially bilingual, signs pointing to Rovigno as well as Rovinj. Perhaps because the old town was an island until 1763 when the channel was filled in, the medieval cobbled alleys and charmingly minute squares haven\u2019t really changed. It\u2019s one of the chief pleasures of the town \u2013 just wandering along the lanes before finding one that takes you to the water\u2019s edge. One alleyway to look out for is Ulica Grisia, which is lined with artists\u2019 workshops and galleries. On the second Sunday in August it turns into one long open-air art gallery. While the old town\u2019s peninsula is ringed with rocky swimming areas, including a series of concrete steps creating a beach near St Euphemia, the best beaches are to the south. Outside two of Rovinj\u2019s poshest hotels, Monte Mulini and Hotel Lone, is a sheltered bay with pebbly beaches along with very smart sunloungers available for rent. From here cycle and hiking paths through Zlatni Rt lead to more secluded beaches as well as a rock-climbing area on the western side of the cape. The sprinkle of islands around Rovinj makes for a satisfying day \u2013 or evening \u2013 trip. The island of Sveta Katarina is a 10-minute boat ride away (\u00a33.65 return), and offers a dreamy view of Rovinj that\u2019s even more wonderful at sunset. Crveni Otok (Red Island), a 20-minute boat ride away (\u00a35 return), is a relaxing place to swim, snorkel and stroll through forest trails. It\u2019s actually two islands joined by a causeway, and, with no cars, it\u2019s a sublimely peaceful spot. But pack some swimming shoes to make the most of the pebbly and rocky beaches. Where to eat Leave the harbourside restaurants to the other tourists and book ahead for La Puntulina (mains from \u00a318), where a small terrace overlooks a rocky beach near St Euphemia. The cuisines of Italy and Istria are fused so closely that it\u2019s hard to know where one ends and the other begins. That translates into a lot of truffles \u2013 with ravioli, steak, pecorino cheese or sea bass \u2013 as well as grilled langoustines, prawns and octopus. Tucked away in a narrow alley, Mali Raj (mains from \u00a312), serves pasta, risotto and grilled meats and seafood on a vine-covered terrace. Where to stay Set in a restored townhouse, intimate little Melegran has the feeling of a boutique hotel and is on a cobbled lane in the middle of the old town. Getting there Probably the nicest way to arrive in Rovinj is to take a train to Venice then a ferry from San Basilio terminal (2hr 45min). Mary Novakovich Cagliari, Sardinia \u201cAnd suddenly there is Cagliari: a naked town rising steep, steep, golden-looking, piled naked to the sky \u2026\u201d So wrote DH Lawrence in 1921 on sailing to Sardinia. Almost 100 years later the city that made the writer \u201cthink of Jerusalem\u201d is just as impressive. The Phoenicians had a trading port here in the eighth century BC, and the city was later fought over by Carthaginians, Romans, Pisans, Spanish and Piedmontese. How these various invaders felt about sunshine, white sand and turquoise sea is not recorded, but they could get them all at Poetto beach, five miles of palm-lined splendour a 15-minute bus ride from the centre (route PF or PQ, \u20ac1.20). Get off at Via Gorgona for toddler-friendly shallow sea, or stay on three stops to 16th-century Torre Spagnola: beyond here there is a couple of miles of \u201cfree beach\u201d. The seafront path is well-used by joggers, rollerbladers and cyclists; there are also diving and sailing clubs, beach volleyball and more. Poetto is long enough not to feel too crowded even in August, and the water stays warm well into autumn. On summer evenings it\u2019s buzzing as city workers hit its bars and fish restaurants. Behind is Molentargius natural park, with lagoons, flamingoes and bikes to hire. For a break from the beach, or for those who don\u2019t want to lie in the sun, Cagliari has more cultural offerings than might be expected from a city of 150,000 people. The former Royal Arsenal is now the Citadel of Museums, home to the national art gallery (good for contemporary Sardinian artists) and museum of archaeology plus an Asian gallery, an ethnographic museum and a startlingly graphic museum of anatomical waxworks. Nearby, Cagliari\u2019s Roman amphitheatre (\u20ac3) is being restored: there is talk of a Unesco listing, though for now it\u2019s still untidy and crumbling. Below it, the university botanical garden (\u20ac4) is cool and shady on a hot day. The granite and limestone St Remy bastion, built in 1896, has curving steps to a vast terrace with benches and palm trees, home to a Sunday flea market. The covered promenade beneath has been restored as an art space. Behind it, steep Via dell\u2019Universit\u00e0 leads back several centuries into the medieval old town, Castello. Torre del\u2019Elefante, built in 1307, with a little stone elephant carved into one side, used to guard its western entrance. Visitors can climb this and Torre di San Pancrazio on higher ground to the north, for amazing views (\u20ac4 each). A short walk away, via alleys barely wide enough for a Fiat Cinquecento, is Cagliari\u2019s 12th-century cathedral, with its striking pale gold facade of stacked arches. The old town hall across the square also holds contemporary art exhibitions. Where to eat Cruise ships put in regularly at Cagliari, and restaurants in the streets between the port and the old town cater for this captive clientele. A better bet is the Villanova district, on the eastern flank of Castello\u2019s hill. Its 18th- and 19th-century squares and streets are pleasant to wander, and home to gems such as Locanda dei Buoni e Cattivi (Inn of the Saints and Sinners), which does Sardinian slow food specialities such as clams with spicy confit tomatoes, and an exquisite artichoke with soft egg yolk in filo pastry. For a cheaper dinner, Pizzeria Il Fantasma up the pedestrianised street does great pizzas and antipasti at outdoor tables. Of Poetto\u2019s many \u201cbeach clubs\u201d, one of the best is La Caravella, which does great things with tuna, clams and bottarga (three-course lunch \u20ac25), as well as pizzas in the evening (from \u20ac5.50). Where to stay The Buoni e Cattivi has five rooms (from \u20ac85 B&amp;B) and three self-catering apartments sleeping four (from \u20ac80 a night, in houses nearby. Set around an elegant interior courtyard, Hostel Marina has spacious dorms with single beds (from \u20ac20) and no bunks. Or float off to sleep on a nine-metre motorboat moored in the small marina south of Poetto (en suite cabin from \u20ac85). Getting there Ferries run to Cagliari from Civitavecchia (near Rome), Naples and Palermo. There are also ferries to other Sardinian ports from Genoa, Livorno, Toulon and Marseille. LB Volos, Greece Like most mainland ports in Greece, Volos isn\u2019t especially pretty. But this lively university town \u2014the gateway to the islands of Skiathos, Skopelos and Alonissos\u2014 has a lot going for it. Ancient history, modern culture, and a fantastic food scene make Volos an attractive base for exploring one of Greece\u2019s most stunning coastlines: the Pelion peninsula just to the east. You\u2019ll barely bump into any other foreigners in the backstreets behind Volos harbour. But you will find a handful of intriguing landmarks: the handsome Archaeological Museum, brimming with neolithic and paleolithic artefacts; Volos City Museum, which recounts the lives of local tobacco workers, footballers, and refugees through photographs and household objects dating back to the 1800s; and the old Tsalapatas tile and brick factory, a monument to the city\u2019s industrial heritage, which doubles as an exhibition and events space. Wandering around the old quarter of Palia is like peeling back the layers of the city\u2019s long history. There are ancient amphorae left in situ by archaeologists, an Ottoman gunpowder depot, a Byzantine castle, and the loveliest train station in all of Greece \u2014a yellow building with carved green woodwork built in 1884. Apartment blocks have become a canvas for Greek and international graffiti artists. Pick up a map of the city\u2019s 40-odd murals from the tourist information office, or book a walking tour with Pelion Culture (pelionculture.gr), led by local archaeologist Yota Pantou. Flat and compact, Volos is easy to explore by bicycle. Join the locals freewheeling along the seaside esplanade to the city beaches that begin at Anavros. Or push on to the lush Pelion peninsula, which crooks its finger into the glassy sweep of the Pagasitikos Gulf. The tree- and taverna-lined beaches on Pelion\u2019s south side are sheltered from the winds. Those nearest to town \u2014 Gatzea, Kala Nera, Boufa, Lefokastro \u2014 can get crowded, especially at weekends. Young guns and high rollers head to the beach bars poking out of the pine trees at Afissos. Families prefer sandy Milina, where you can take a boat trip to the tiny islands of Alatas and Prasouda, or all the way to snoozy Trikeri, adrift off Pelion\u2019s southern tip. Mountainous Pelion has its wild side, too. From Volos, it\u2019s a winding drive over wooded ridges and through stone hamlets to the Aegean coastline, where the road drops down to wide-open beaches and bright green coves hemmed in by cliffs. Where to stay Most hotels in Volos seem to be stuck in the 1980s. Aegli (doubles from \u20ac90 B&amp;B) is the exception having been renovated in 2016. The best rooms have balconies overlooking the port. At the Domotel Xenia Volos (doubles from \u20ac125 B&amp;B), the dreary interiors don\u2019t quite live up to the 1960s architecture; but the beachfront location is a knockout. Where to eat Pick up red pepper pie, olive biscuits and tsoureki (Greek brioche) from Palios Fournos bakery (56 Krokiou Street, Palea) for a picnic on the beach. Around 2pm, Volos comes to a standstill as locals hit their favourite tsipouradiko. There are literally hundreds of these ouzo-and-meze bars in Volos, mostly no-frills, neon-lit joints where Anthony Bourdain would have felt at home. Each karafaki (little bottle) of tsipouro, a grape distillate that comes with or without aniseed, is served with a titbit or two. You don\u2019t order \u2013 the chef-patron just brings a succession of (mostly fishy) delights, that get more generous with each round of drinks. Try Demiris for fresh sea urchin and scallops, or To Filaraki (Averof 3 Nea Ionia), where you\u2019ll be treated to cured mackerel, char-grilled octopus, and the perfect potato salad. Call it a night with an ice cream sundae at Minerva (Argonafton 53), a classic seaside caf\u00e9 that stays open all hours. Getting there Volos railway station is close to the harbour and served by local trains from Larissa (38 miles away), which is on the main Athens-Thessaloniki line. From Thessaloniki there are trains to Belgrade, Sofia and beyond (the Belgrade route is only open this year until 16 September, see seat61.com). EasyJet flies to Volos (Nea Anchialos airport, 40km away) twice a week. Rachel Howard Ostend, Belgium Ostend is called koningin der badsteden (queen of the coast), a nickname that evokes its majestic belle \u00e9poque hotels and villas. Most of these were destroyed in the second world war, but there are still jewels from the era such as the 1883-built Wellington Racecourse, which holds regular race meetings, and the 1907 railway station, where most visitors arrive. Other historic attractions include the spectacular neo-Gothic St-Petrus-en-Pauluskerk church, with its ornate twin towers. Its design was inspired by Cologne cathedral, but despite appearances it was actually built just over 100 years ago. Out of town to the south-west, the open-air Atlantic Wall Museum is a major attraction, if a sombre one, with its 60 German second world war bunkers. Happily, it is next to the recently renovated Raversyde scenic area. From the station, it\u2019s a 10-minute walk to the four-and-a-half-mile-long beach: its western end is backed by high-rise buildings but the sand is lovely and can accommodate thousands. In summer, trains to Ostend are always packed with daytrippers carrying beach paraphernalia and filling the carriage with holiday vibes. Towards the harbour a cluster of beach bars opens in summer, offering cocktails, tapas and music in the shade of palm trees and white umbrellas. Belgium\u2019s largest coastal city is riding a wave of renewal. Until about 10 years ago, this queen was looking decidedly shabby, but today it oozes cool, thanks to events such as Crystal Ship, an annual arts festival transforming the streets and buildings with vivid murals and installations. This year\u2019s edition added 10 new permanent artworks. A 10-minute walk from the railway station a former post office from 1947 is now a popular cultural centre called De Grote Post, with arts events in its side rooms. The main hall has been restored beautifully to its former glory, and everyone comes here for coffee or a bite to eat in the popular CultuurCaf\u00e9. Try the geitenkaas (goat\u2019s cheese) encased in brickdeeg (literally \u201cbrick dough\u201d). East of the centre and port, Oosteroever is a quieter, more natural stretch of beach, dominated initially by the 1811-built Fort Napoleon. It can be reached by car or bike, but it\u2019s more fun to take the free ferry that departs from near the Vistrap, the fish market. Buy some shrimps from one of the stalls (\u20ac3) and hop on. It doesn\u2019t get more Ostend than this. At Oosteroever, a walkway on the top of the Oostelijke Strekdam (Eastern Breakwater, part of the harbour defences) leads out into the sea. Near the foot of the Oostelijke Strekdam, the Phare East sailing club offers kayaking, surfing, windsurfing and kitesurfing. Where to stay The new industrial-chic Upstairs Hotel (doubles from \u20ac65 room-only) is a 15-minute walk from the station and right behind the beach on Hertstraat. The lobby has table tennis, table football and a yellow slide popular with children (and adults). Between the beach and the harbour channel, the recently renovated Providence by Getaway (two-bed studios from \u20ac52), also enjoys a prime location and hip coastal vibes. Where to eat Ostend used to be associated with tourist traps \u2013 the coast road, Zeedijk, was brimming with them \u2013 but a slew of excellent new restaurants has opened. Sanseveria, a 10-minute walk from the station, serves great bagels and salads (\u20ac13.50 for bagel, dessert and a drink) and is run by Bert Vanheuverzwijn, who used to work at Michelin-starred Hof van Cleve near Ghent. The cosy interior is decorated with his grandparents\u2019 furniture. The coffee comes with homemade chocolate cookies. Another newcomer is Expo &amp; Kafie, right behind the Zeedijk. The breakfasts feature Greek yoghurt and honey, artisanal bread, eggs, bacon and smoked salmon (from \u20ac10). This summer Chez Paulette opened Panorama on the roof of De Grote Post. The bar/restaurant has superb views and serves great homemade drinks (beetroot, ginger and carrot \u20ac6.50) and cocktails (\u20ac12), and dishes such as cod with smoked mozzarella and fresh herbs (\u20ac28). Delightful tapas too, from \u20ac9. Be aware that Panorama shuts in strong winds. For something more traditional, try the The Old Inn , a five-minute walk from De Grote Post towards the beach. There are just two dishes on the menu at this delightful restaurant with walls covered in antique posters of Ostend: steak (\u20ac23) or fish (catch of the day, price varies). Annie started this business in 1969 and still reigns supreme in the kitchen. Her husband Ren\u00e9 brings the hand-cut fries and homemade mayonnaise to your table. Desserts (\u20ac7) are local classics dame blanche (ice-cream with hot chocolate sauce) or pancake mikado (my favourite). Getting there Trains run from London St Pancras to Ostend via Brussels, taking from 3hr 32min. See eurostar.com for details. Veerle Helsen Looking for a holiday with a difference?

The infamous 30 penises scene is a self-conscious attempt to shock, but it also works as a knowing observation about how on-screen male nudity is squeamishly treated in comparison to female nudity.

      "bodyText": "There is a scene in episode two of US teen drama Euphoria when dozens of naked high-school boys swarm around the show\u2019s leading jock, Nate, in a locker room, his eyes pained as he attempts to avoid the flailing slow-motion genitalia surrounding him. When the sequence \u2013 said to be a homage to Brian De Palma\u2019s 1976 horror Carrie \u2013 aired in the States in June, it triggered a panicked response: horrified viewers counted a total of 30 penises in the scene. The president of the Parents Television Council claimed that the content was too graphic for its target audience. Critics wrote numerous articles dissecting this now-viral moment, one claiming it was \u201cpointlessly gratuitous\u201d. They should be relieved. It was originally supposed to be 80. Euphoria, written and directed by Sam Levinson (Assassination Nation) and executive-produced by Drake in partnership with indie production company A24 (Lady Bird, Moonlight, Hereditary), is to Gen Z what the brilliant Skins once was to millennials. Eight episodes seen through the eyes of 17-year-old drug addict Rue (played by former Disney darling Zendaya) and already renewed for a second season, it has all the makings of a provocative, hit teen drama: a cast of hot young things, such as model Hunter Schafer and Mid90s star Alexa Demie; a super-credible soundtrack, including Billie Eilish, Migos, Doja Cat and Lizzo, among others; and a shed-load of complaints, obviously. Levinson, 34, clearly has a lot to say about sex, social media, anxiety and addiction, but what sets Euphoria apart from other teen dramas is that this is, in part, his own story. \u201cFor better or worse, a lot of it comes from my own experiences with anxiety and addiction,\u201d he says, recalling an adolescence spent in hospitals, rehab centres and halfway houses until he finally got clean aged 19. Because of his past experiences, HBO \u2013 which was already interested in remaking the original Israeli version of Euphoria \u2013 asked him to write about his formative years. \u201cI wanted to make a show about the anxiety of being young and the insecurities and unsureness of relationships, but I wanted to do it in a way that I felt we hadn\u2019t seen before,\u201d he explains. \u201cEvery time we deal with tough subjects or gritty material, it\u2019s done in a docu-drama way. I wanted to do something that didn\u2019t rely so heavily on characters talking about their feelings because one of the toughest aspects of being young is not being able to articulate how you feel.\u201d Levinson was so keen on Zendaya for the lead that he stuck a picture of her on his initial mood board of characters. In a twist of fate, the role was exactly what The Greatest Showman star was after, in a Miley Cyrus-style move away from her Disney past. \u201cI was like [to Levinson]: \u2018There\u2019s no way that you\u2019re able to see the work that I\u2019ve done and think that I\u2019d be capable of delivering that performance,\u2019\u201d recalls Zendaya. \u201cThank whoever that he did, because, you know, you need people to believe in you.\u201d \u201cI was having this weird section in my life where I didn\u2019t really know what I was going to do next,\u201d says the actor, who was last seen in the Spider-Man reboot opposite Tom Holland. \u201cEverything I was reading just wasn\u2019t right. I was like: \u2018I\u2019m not going to have a job. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.\u2019 Then Euphoria came along and all the worries that I had had before, or ideas I\u2019d had about what I needed to do or should do, just went through the window. I was just like: \u2018I want to do this. This feels right.\u2019\u201d Whether it\u2019s Levinson\u2019s script (excerpt: \u201cEvery now and then, if I focused too closely on the way I breathed, I\u2019d die. Until every second of every day, you find yourself trying to outrun your anxiety and, quite frankly, I\u2019m just fucking exhausted\u201d) or Zendaya\u2019s career-defining performance, it\u2019s hard to argue with Nylon magazine that Rue\u2019s plight is \u201cTV\u2019s most realistic portrayal of anxiety\u201d. That\u2019s what a lot of people will relate to, if nothing else. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to depict a drug addict without an audience feeling judgmental towards them but [Zendaya] brings a humour, a warmth and a fragility,\u201d adds Levinson. \u201cShe\u2019s the beating heart of it; you empathise with her in a way that I could never imagine. Tapping into having that kind of compassion for someone going through addiction is really important to that person\u2019s eventual sobriety.\u201d When all of this graphic content makes a Skins house party look like a sleepover at the Gilmore Girls\u2019 house \u2013 and in light of 2017 teen drama 13 Reasons Why recently removing its graphic suicide scene two years after it first aired \u2013 does Euphoria take it too far?

In Congress, the only one to publicly \u201ccome out\u201d as such is Jared Huffman, a Democrat representing California\u2019s second district and a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JaredHuffman/status/1154571228604014594?s=20\">leading proponent</a> of impeachment of Donald Trump.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/07/donald-trump-evangelical-supporters\">Faith and freedoms: why evangelicals profess unwavering love for Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Huffman announced <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/11/09/this-lawmaker-is-skeptical-that-god-exists-now-hes-finally-decided-to-tell-people/?utm_term=.c4d495582524\">in late 2017</a> that he is a humanist, not an atheist. In an interview at his Capitol Hill office, he characterized himself as \u201cnon-religious, humanist, spiritual albeit without any particular dogma. I\u2019m a spiritual drifter. \u2018Seeker\u2019 would be a perfectly good word, too.\u201d</p> <p>Asked how he would define spiritual, Huffman said: \u201cI\u2019m interested in the morality and values that hold us together, the things that through time have really been the foundations of many religions, but I just see so much in organized religion that doesn\u2019t work for me that I can\u2019t really find a fit there.\u201d</p> <p>Huffman, 55, has no desire to emulate militants such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/23/scienceandnature.richarddawkins\">Richard Dawkins</a> or Christopher Hitchens.</p> <p>\u201cAtheism seems to bring with it the notion of being anti-religion as opposed to non-religious,\u201d he said. \u201cI prefer non-religious because I just want everyone to make their own religious choices. I\u2019m not against them having religion.</p> <p>\u201cI would never call religion categorically bad. I see too many good things happening by people of faith and even organized religion. I think <a href=\"https://catholicclimatecovenant.org/encyclical\">Pope Francis\u2019s encyclical</a> was one of the most impactful statements on climate change and nature in recent times and I\u2019ve seen other really great leadership on important moral issues from people of faith. I\u2019ve seen a lot of lousy, immoral stuff as well. So it\u2019s just a mix.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/254120/less-half-vote-socialist-president.aspx\">A Gallup poll published in May</a> tested Americans\u2019 willingness to vote for presidential candidates from certain groups. About 96% said they were willing to vote for a candidate who was black, followed by Catholic and Hispanic (95% each), a woman (94%), Jewish (93%), an evangelical Christian (80%), gay or lesbian (76%), under 40 (71%), Muslim (66%) and over 70 (63%).</p> <p>Bottom of the table came atheist (60%), followed by the one thing considered even worse: socialist (47%). Nevertheless, the percentage of Americans willing to vote for an atheist was more than three times the 18% Gallup recorded in its first measure, in 1958.</p> <p>Most of the 2020 Democratic candidates make references to their faith.

      "bodyText": "The 2020 presidential election has produced the most diverse field of candidates in history. There are women, people of color and an openly gay man. There are billionaires, socialists and a self-help guru. The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 view of religion is not particularly clear but there are no known atheists. Non-believers remain few and far between in American politics. In Congress, the only one to publicly \u201ccome out\u201d as such is Jared Huffman, a Democrat representing California\u2019s second district and a leading proponent of impeachment of Donald Trump. Huffman announced in late 2017 that he is a humanist, not an atheist. In an interview at his Capitol Hill office, he characterized himself as \u201cnon-religious, humanist, spiritual albeit without any particular dogma. I\u2019m a spiritual drifter. \u2018Seeker\u2019 would be a perfectly good word, too.\u201d Asked how he would define spiritual, Huffman said: \u201cI\u2019m interested in the morality and values that hold us together, the things that through time have really been the foundations of many religions, but I just see so much in organized religion that doesn\u2019t work for me that I can\u2019t really find a fit there.\u201d Huffman, 55, has no desire to emulate militants such as Richard Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens. \u201cAtheism seems to bring with it the notion of being anti-religion as opposed to non-religious,\u201d he said. \u201cI prefer non-religious because I just want everyone to make their own religious choices. I\u2019m not against them having religion. \u201cI would never call religion categorically bad. I see too many good things happening by people of faith and even organized religion. I think Pope Francis\u2019s encyclical was one of the most impactful statements on climate change and nature in recent times and I\u2019ve seen other really great leadership on important moral issues from people of faith. I\u2019ve seen a lot of lousy, immoral stuff as well. So it\u2019s just a mix.\u201d A Gallup poll published in May tested Americans\u2019 willingness to vote for presidential candidates from certain groups. About 96% said they were willing to vote for a candidate who was black, followed by Catholic and Hispanic (95% each), a woman (94%), Jewish (93%), an evangelical Christian (80%), gay or lesbian (76%), under 40 (71%), Muslim (66%) and over 70 (63%). Bottom of the table came atheist (60%), followed by the one thing considered even worse: socialist (47%). Nevertheless, the percentage of Americans willing to vote for an atheist was more than three times the 18% Gallup recorded in its first measure, in 1958. Most of the 2020 Democratic candidates make references to their faith. Former vice-president Joe Biden, a Catholic, wears his late son Beau\u2019s rosary on his left wrist. The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, a Methodist, said in June: \u201cMy faith animates all that I do.\u201d South Bend\u2019s mayor, Pete Buttigieg, an Episcopalian, has been praised for reclaiming religion for the left while Marianne Williamson has declared: \u201cMy religion is Judaism, my spirituality is universal.\u201d Sanders, who is Jewish, is a more ambiguous case. During the 2016 campaign, leaked emails revealed that a Democratic official considered raising the question of whether Sanders is an atheist in the hope of weakening him against Hillary Clinton. Sanders told the Washington Post that year he was \u201cnot actively involved with organised religion\u201d but added: \u201cI think everyone believes in God in their own ways. To me, it means that all of us are connected, all of life is connected, and that we are all tied together.\u201d So what would happen if a 2020 candidate came out as a non-believer? \u201cI think they would suffer withering criticism,\u201d Huffman said. \u201cThere still is, at the national political level, this notion that you have to put some kind of faith out there. I\u2019m not saying that anybody\u2019s faking it in the presidential field but there still is this notion that\u2019s one of the threshold things you have to do.\u201d \u2018A respectful conversation\u2019 In Congress, too, Christians are still overrepresented when compared with the general public, according to the Pew Research Center. About 23% of the public say they are atheist, agnostic or \u201cnothing in particular\u201d. The number of non-Christian members of Congress is now 63, Pew says, made up of 34 Jews, three Muslims, three Hindus, two Buddhists, two Unitarian Universalists, and 19, including the Arizona senator Kyrsten Sinema, who decline to specify a religious affiliation. Huffman, who falls in the last category, gets along with some colleagues better than others. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a respectful conversation on both sides. We talk about spirituality and religiosity. Juan Vargas [a Democrat from California], for example, is a deeply religious Catholic, and we alternate between joking and having serious conversations about Christian theology and other things all the time. They\u2019re great fun and they\u2019re great conversations.\u201d With Bible belt Republicans, however, it\u2019s tougher. \u201cI find that a little more tense because I think the evangelical brand is so at odds with my values right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe things that are being done politically in the name of evangelical Christianity I find so hypocritical and, quite frankly, irreconcilable with the teachings of Jesus Christ. \u201cI may not think that Jesus Christ is the divine son of God but he was a great teacher, and I\u2019m fascinated by his teachings and there are great lessons and values in them. I can have that conversation with lots of my religious colleagues. It\u2019s harder with the evangelicals who are on the far right and want to believe that their extrapolation of those teachings means that they\u2019re against gay marriage, climate change is a hoax and all these other things that they manage to work into their worldview.\u201d There have been bipartisan moments. In June 2017, after the Republican Steve Scalise, then House majority whip, and others were shot at baseball practice, Huffman joined his colleagues in prayer. He explained: \u201cI hope they don\u2019t mind and, thankfully, lightning did not strike. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any harm that can come from prayer and there\u2019s different types of prayer. There\u2019s prayers that are moments of reflection.\u201d He would draw the line, however, at praying alongside members of Trump\u2019s cabinet. \u201cI would feel so creeped out that I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a word to describe it,\u201d he said. Asked if he suspects Trump himself is a secret atheist, Huffman said: \u201cI think he\u2019s a narcissist. He worships himself.\u201d Huffman grew up in Independence, Missouri, the former home of Harry Truman. Independence is also a historic hub for Mormons. Huffman used to be a member of the priesthood in the branch known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, now the Community of Christ, whose world headquarters are in the city. But at 19, he lost faith. \u201cOnce you deign to ask those big questions and you don\u2019t get answers,\u201d he said, \u201cfor many, it\u2019s over at that point.\u201d Huffman does not believe in life after death but the prospect of \u201ctotal emptiness for ever\u201d that haunted the poet Philip Larkin does not appear to trouble him. \u201cThis is all there is so we\u2019d better make the most of it. Now, if you want to be a little more abstract, I also think that in a sense we live on through the good things we do and the people we influence and, for those that are seeking something more than just this temporal experience, I\u2019d say that that\u2019s what I would point to. \u201cBut many people are obviously drawn to religion because they love the idea of an afterlife, and I hope they find it.

There are no credit checks \u2013 and once you have loaded them up from your UK bank account at a typical currency conversion fee of 1%-2%, they can be used abroad, just like any other bank card \u2013 but (mostly) without hefty charges. The three standout cards, in our view, are Caxton FX Black, Sainsbury\u2019s Bank Cash Passport and WeSwap \u2013 order today and it should be with you inside a few days.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>1. House prices and rents</strong></h2> <p><strong>The possible scenario</strong></p> <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility, the government\u2019s independent forecasting agency, reckons house prices will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/18/no-deal-brexit-would-plunge-britain-into-a-recession-says-obr\" title=\"\">tumble by around 10%</a> in a disorderly Brexit. The average UK house price is \u00a3216,515, according to Nationwide, so that would translate into around \u00a321,000 off the average home, taking it back below \u00a3200,000. In London, where average prices stand at close to \u00a3500,000, the fall would be closer to \u00a350,000. Prices in the capital are already running at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jul/17/london-house-prices-fall-at-fastest-rate-in-10-years-ons\" title=\"\">about 4.5% below the level of a year ago</a>, falling at the fastest rate in a decade. Rents have been flatter across the country, but if a no-deal Brexit sees EU migrants stop coming to the UK or returning home, rents in some locations could be expected to fall.</p> <p><strong>What you can do</strong></p> <p>Most people will sit tight and do nothing, preferring not to buy or sell during such uncertainty. The OBR sees property transactions falling by a fifth in the event of no deal, which is bad news for estate agents, removal companies and retailers of furniture, carpets and curtains.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"633901ee7894eea76f7c637b4e2cd1c1a78ced7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/633901ee7894eea76f7c637b4e2cd1c1a78ced7a/0_0_1702_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brexit Keys\" width=\"1000\" height=\"952\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A no-deal Brexit could send house prices tumbling</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Guardian Design</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there are always those who have to buy or sell because their job has moved or their family has expanded. What should they do? If you\u2019re the seller, don\u2019t fall for the estate agent\u2019s trick of over-pricing a property to get the business, then slashing later to get a sale. Examine actual sold prices on your road \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.zoopla.co.uk/house-prices/\" title=\"\">Zoopla has an easily searchable database</a> \u2013 and take a bit off to reflect today\u2019s market.</p> <p>Buyers have a choice; defer a purchase until November to get clarity on Brexit (but if there is a deal, then prices could start moving up again) or make cheeky low-ball offers and see if a vendor is desperate enough to accept. How do you know a seller is desperate? One way is to search the property\u2019s listing history \u2013 most sites will say how long ago it came to market, but won\u2019t say if it was removed then relisted with a reduced price. But there are tricks, such as <a href=\"https://propcision.com/blog/stepstocheck.php\" title=\"\">those listed at Propcision</a>, to find old data from Google.</p> <p>There is far less data available on rental markets, but if a landlord tries to increase the rent in this market they\u2019re having a laugh; do your best to challenge it.</p> <h2><strong>2. Mortgages</strong></h2> <p><strong>The possible scenario</strong></p> <p>Faced with a recession induced by a no-deal Brexit, the Bank of England cuts base rate close to zero and embarks on a monetary loosening policy that sends interest rates across the board to new lows. Mortgage rates respond, with the best fixed rates dropping below 1%.</p> <p><strong>What you can do</strong></p> <p>If you are about to come off a fixed-rate deal, and believe we are heading to no deal, then hold your horses. As recently as 2016 mortgages were offered at rates as low 0.99% \u2013 a significant saving over the 1.3% to 1.7% best buys available this week.</p> <p>The other strategy is to take out a tracker mortgage that moves down (and up) in line with Bank of England base rate.</p> <p>For example, Nationwide has one of the cheapest two-year tracker remortgage deals on offer \u2013 at 1.44% \u2013 which tracks the base rate, and adds 0.69%. If base rates went to zero, buyers would see their monthly payments fall massively as their pay-rate would drop to 0.69%.</p> <p>However, buyers need to be aware that if interest rates went up substantially later on, payments would rise accordingly, says L&amp;C\u2019s David Hollingworth. He says most buyers will still want to stick with a fixed-rate deal, given that they are still at very low historical levels, and buyers have the security of knowing what they paying for its term.</p> <h2><strong>3. Savings and cash Isas</strong></h2> <p><strong>The possible scenario</strong></p> <p>The Bank of England moves quickly to cut interest rates and embarks on a new round of quantitative easing to boost the economy. Once again the banks are awash with cheap money, meaning the interest rates payable to those with savings is only going one way \u2013 down. At the height of the financial crisis the rates payable to savers in plenty of accounts fell to 0.1%, resulting in negligible returns.</p> <p><strong>What you can do</strong></p> <p>If you believe that no deal is now a likelihood \u2013 and you want to keep your savings in cash \u2013 now\u2019s the time to move them into a fixed-rate bond that guarantees the rate for the bond\u2019s term. This week Metro Bank was <a href=\"https://www.metrobankonline.co.uk/savings/products/fixed-term-savings/\" title=\"\">offering a one-year, fixed-rate bond paying 2%</a>. If you want to lock your money in for two years, <a href=\"https://www.raisin.co.uk/term-deposit/fcm003-24-month-fixed-term-deposit/?utm_source=Savings_champion&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=FCMB_2YFTD&amp;tsid=44114\" title=\"\">FCMB Bank is paying 2.22%</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.rcibank.co.uk/savings/5-year-fixed-term-account?utm_source=Affiliate%20advertising&amp;utm_medium=Affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=RCI%20affiliate%20campaign%202015\" title=\"\">five-year bonds promise 2.4%</a>. If you prefer to have some access to your cash, the <a href=\"https://www.chartersavingsbank.co.uk/Products/NoticeAccount\" title=\"\">Charter Savings Bank is paying 1.81%</a> on balances of \u00a35,000 and over. Access to your cash is available with 95 days\u2019 notice. These rates might look uninspiring, but if the stock market tanks post-Brexit, and savings rates collapse, it will look a very smart move.</p> <h2><strong>4. The currency</strong></h2> <p><strong>The possible scenario</strong></p> <p>Sterling\u2019s slide this week is the canary in the Brexit coal mine, as traders began marking the pound down to what they think it might be worth in the event of a no-deal exit. Against the euro, the pound fell below \u20ac1.10, while against the dollar it was heading to $1.20. A disorderly departure could see the pound fall to one-to-one parity against the euro and the dollar even before the 31 October deadline.</p> <p>One indication comes from betting company Boyle Sports. At the start of year it was giving punters odds of only 8-1 that the pound would collapse to be worth just one euro, but has slashed the odds to 3-1 that we\u2019ll reach that point some time this year.</p> <p><strong>What you can do</strong></p> <p>If you think the pound will continue to tumble, then buying your holiday money now makes sense, even at today\u2019s depressed levels. Don\u2019t ever buy currency at an airport bureau de change, where rates for euros are already fantastically low, with many giving you just 0.9 euros for each pound. Buy online and in advance for much better deals; you\u2019ll get around \u20ac1.06 for each pound from Travelex online this week. See our separate guide to getting the best deal on holiday money. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0fd591e284dc4db23efc2203b9a8026bf28edc30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fd591e284dc4db23efc2203b9a8026bf28edc30/299_65_901_901/500.jpg\" alt=\"Brexit Sun\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will a no-deal Brexit sink hopes of a recovery in the pound?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Guardian Design</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The currency\u2019s collapse would make everything in overseas resorts this summer more expensive.

Pensions</strong></h2> <p><strong>The possible scenario</strong></p> <p>Workers with final salary-style pensions aren\u2019t affected, as they have guarantees, but for everyone else, their pension pot depends on the performance of the stock market. Which way will markets go in a Brexit crash-out?</p> <p>Broadly speaking, domestically focused UK companies, which make most of their profits in the UK, will be obvious casualties and their share prices could fall heavily in the next few months. But the giants of the London stock market \u2013 such as BP, Shell, HSBC and Glaxo \u2013 make the vast majority of their profits in overseas markets, and are much better protected from Brexit. Indeed, as sterling plummets they are likely to rise in value, because their dollar earnings suddenly become worth much more in pounds.</p> <p><strong>What you can do</strong></p> <p>Most people think they can\u2019t do anything about their company pension scheme, but they can.</p> <p>You have to find out who manages your pension scheme, and then see what level of control you have. For example, Legal &amp; General manages 14,000 pension schemes for 2.8 million workers across the UK, including those at GNM, the Guardian\u2019s parent group.</p> <p>Members can view the value of their pension, and make choices about where the money goes, picking between cash, equity (shares) and bonds (which pay fixed rates of interest but can also go up and down in value).</p> <p>If you are convinced that a Boris Johnson-led Brexit is going to be a calamity, that the economy will tank and UK corporate profits collapse, then you can choose to shift your pension into overseas shares.</p> <p>If you believe in a total disaster \u2013 a view not shared by investment experts \u2013 you could even choose to put all of your pension into a cash fund, which means it won\u2019t be affected by a fall in the stock market. Alternatively, if you believe that no deal won\u2019t be that bad, then that would suggest you buy into domestic UK companies which could enjoy a huge \u201crelief rally\u201d. But remember, going to any extremes in investing (ie, all your money in cash, or all in one particular market) is a very risky thing to do for the long term, with almost nobody able to expertly time their investments to catch major market swings.</p> <h2><strong>6. Individual shares</strong></h2> <p><strong>Possible scenario</strong></p> <p>A Guardian Money reader asked us this week what to do about his old privatisation and demutualisation shares in the event of no deal. He holds both Lloyds (as a result of the Halifax demutualisation) and Santander. Should he sell them, he asked, fearful that a no-deal Brexit will send them crashing.</p> <p><strong>What you can do</strong></p> <p>We\u2019re not going to give advice on individual shares, but here are a few pointers. Lloyds is a UK-focused bank which makes nearly all its profits in the UK. Therefore it is in the bucket of shares not particularly attractive to worldwide investors, and if there is a recession after no deal, it is the most exposed to customers defaulting on their loans.</p> <p>But its shares have been weak for a long time. It was 72p a share just before the referendum, and is 52p now. It\u2019s arguable that the damage from Brexit is already in the price, although it can always sink lower. It has returned to paying dividends, so the yield on the shares is actually quite attractive. If you have no urgent financial need to sell, it may be worth holding for the long term, but expect bumps along the way.</p> <p>Santander is a global bank with a big British operation. So it is impacted by Brexit, but much less so than Lloyds. That said, its shares have, if anything, performed worse than Lloyds. They have fallen from \u20ac6.18 in 2017 to \u20ac3.90 this week. Maybe the lesson is that, after the financial crisis, investors are wary of banks, and that they will never again be growth stocks, and you should hold them instead for a steady supply of dividends.</p> <h2><strong>7. Jobs</strong></h2> <p><strong>The possible scenario</strong></p> <p>A no-deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Brexit</a> would plunge Britain into a recession that would shrink the economy by 2% and push unemployment above 5%, according to the OBR. Greg Clark, the government\u2019s business secretary until sacked by Boris Johnson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/12/greg-clark-no-deal-brexit-would-destroy-thousands-of-jobs\" title=\"\">said during the leadership campaign</a>: \u201cIt\u2019s evident that if you have the disruption that comes from a no-deal Brexit there will be people that will lose their jobs. It\u2019s many thousands of jobs. Everyone knows that.\u201d</p> <p><strong>What you can do</strong></p> <p>Realistically, most people can do very little about the threat of job losses, particularly if they are in low-skilled positions.</p> <p>If your job does look at risk \u2013 car plants such as Ford and Vauxhall come to mind \u2013 about the best you can do is try to build up some savings to tide you over. According to the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/emergency-savings-how-much-is-enough\" title=\"\">Money Advice Service</a>, \u201ca good rule of thumb to give yourself a solid financial cushion is to have three months\u2019 essential outgoings available in an instant access savings account\u201d. But sadly few people are able to save that much. According to Aviva, low income families typically only have around \u00a3100 in savings.</p> <h2><strong>8. Driving abroad</strong></h2> <p><strong>The possible scenario</strong></p> <p>On a late autumn trip to the continent, after Britain has crashed out of the EU with no deal, you find yourself having been pulled over by a gendarme 20km outside Calais. He/she will want to see your UK driving licence, your international driving permit (IDP 1968), your insurance green card, the car\u2019s log book (V5 document) and a GB sticker. Tourists flying into the EU and hiring a car will also need an IDP in several countries including Italy, France and the Netherlands. It is this that is likely to catch out future travellers.</p> <p><strong>What you should do</strong></p> <p>If you are heading abroad after 31 October, you need to take all these items with you. The Post Office will sell you an IDP for \u00a35.50 \u2013 you\u2019ll need to show your UK licence and passport. But they will only be <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/driving-in-the-eu-after-brexit-international-driving-permits\" title=\"\">required in some countries</a> following a no-deal Brexit; tourists hiring a car in Spain or Portugal won\u2019t need one for stays of up to six months.</p> <p>If there is a deal, UK licence holders will continue to be able to drive using their UK driving licence while visiting all EU and EEA countries. Your car insurer will supply your green card.</p> <h2><strong>9. Health</strong></h2> <p><strong>The possible scenario</strong></p> <p>A no-deal crash-out leaves many of the 1.3 million Brits living in the EU facing a major problem \u2013 what will happen if they are rushed to their local hospital? A no-deal departure ends the UK\u2019s involvement in the European health insurance card scheme and other agreements overnight. While it is bad news for holidaymakers, it has the potential to force many of those who live in the EU to abandon their dream.</p> <p><strong>What you can do</strong></p> <p>For those going on holiday, it is simply a case of buying travel insurance before you leave, and the government is advising just that. For those living abroad, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/01/spain-moves-to-protect-british-residents-in-case-of-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">Spain has said it </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/01/spain-moves-to-protect-british-residents-in-case-of-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">will guarantee continued healthcare</a> access to British expats and tourists in the country until the end of 2020 \u2013 provided the UK offers Spaniards here the same deal.</p> <p>This is highly likely as the UK government has said seeking bilateral agreements to maintain healthcare rights is a top priority.</p> <p>In France, another country in which lots of retired Brits live, the position is more complicated, particularly for those who are more temporary \u2013 spending just six months there at a time. They are being advised to formalise their residency where they can.</p> <p>It\u2019s been <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.fr/20190321/no-deal-brexit-what-the-new-french-law-means-for-britons-in-france-so-far\" title=\"\">reported that France</a> is confident of reaching a bilateral agreement with the UK on health care \u2013 helped no doubt by the fact that there are lots of French people living and working in London.</p> <p>Other countries face the same challenge. The problem for some Brits is that those agreements will not be in position by 31 October. Those with dangerous ailments may have to consider returning to the UK temporarily.</p> <p>Medicine availability is what vexes people more seriously. Critical and short shelf-life medicines \u2013 some of which may need to be refrigerated until they are consumed \u2013 would be most vulnerable in a no-deal scenario, with fears they could be held up amid chaos at the ports.</p> <p>Already there are reports of diabetics informally stockpiling their own supplies of insulin by giving themselves less on a daily basis, with potentially dangerous consequences.</p> <p>But the government says the fears are misplaced, as drug companies have already been told to build up an additional six weeks\u2019 supply of medicines to provide a buffer in the event of gridlock at Dover.</p> <h2><strong>10. Prices in the shops</strong></h2> <p><strong>The possible scenario</strong></p> <p>Two things could be triggered by a crash-out Brexit: a further slide in the value of sterling that results in the price of imported goods rising; and a complete change in the import tariff system, which could see some goods rise in price (such as cars from Germany) but others fall. The Theresa May government said in March that tariffs would be cut to zero on 87% of imports to the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/13/brexit-tariffs-on-87-of-uk-imports-cut-to-zero-in-temporary-no-deal-plan\" title=\"\">as part of a temporary no-deal plan</a>, but prices of some imports including meat, shoes and cars will go up.</p> <p><strong>What you can do</strong></p> <p>The worry will be the products that go up in price, and their availability. Among the consumer goods that will be hit are imports of beef, prices of which will go up by almost 7%, cheddar cheese, up by about \u00a320 per 100kg, and imported fully finished cars, which would attract a 10.8% levy, or about \u00a31,500 for an average new car.</p> <p>This suggests that if you have an eye on a new BMW or Mercedes, it might be worth bringing forward your purchase to before October.</p> <p>For other goods, the savings from stockpiling in advance are probably minimal. For example, while officially the change in tariffs means that tins of tuna could go up by 24%, imported men\u2019s wool jackets by 12%, and men\u2019s, women\u2019s and girls\u2019 underpants made of synthetic fibre by 12%, the reality is that shops will absorb some of the increase or may substitute for domestically produced or alternative suppliers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "1. House prices and rents The possible scenario The Office for Budget Responsibility, the government\u2019s independent forecasting agency, reckons house prices will tumble by around 10% in a disorderly Brexit. The average UK house price is \u00a3216,515, according to Nationwide, so that would translate into around \u00a321,000 off the average home, taking it back below \u00a3200,000. In London, where average prices stand at close to \u00a3500,000, the fall would be closer to \u00a350,000. Prices in the capital are already running at about 4.5% below the level of a year ago, falling at the fastest rate in a decade. Rents have been flatter across the country, but if a no-deal Brexit sees EU migrants stop coming to the UK or returning home, rents in some locations could be expected to fall. What you can do Most people will sit tight and do nothing, preferring not to buy or sell during such uncertainty. The OBR sees property transactions falling by a fifth in the event of no deal, which is bad news for estate agents, removal companies and retailers of furniture, carpets and curtains. But there are always those who have to buy or sell because their job has moved or their family has expanded. What should they do? If you\u2019re the seller, don\u2019t fall for the estate agent\u2019s trick of over-pricing a property to get the business, then slashing later to get a sale. Examine actual sold prices on your road \u2013 Zoopla has an easily searchable database \u2013 and take a bit off to reflect today\u2019s market. Buyers have a choice; defer a purchase until November to get clarity on Brexit (but if there is a deal, then prices could start moving up again) or make cheeky low-ball offers and see if a vendor is desperate enough to accept. How do you know a seller is desperate? One way is to search the property\u2019s listing history \u2013 most sites will say how long ago it came to market, but won\u2019t say if it was removed then relisted with a reduced price. But there are tricks, such as those listed at Propcision, to find old data from Google. There is far less data available on rental markets, but if a landlord tries to increase the rent in this market they\u2019re having a laugh; do your best to challenge it. 2. Mortgages The possible scenario Faced with a recession induced by a no-deal Brexit, the Bank of England cuts base rate close to zero and embarks on a monetary loosening policy that sends interest rates across the board to new lows. Mortgage rates respond, with the best fixed rates dropping below 1%. What you can do If you are about to come off a fixed-rate deal, and believe we are heading to no deal, then hold your horses. As recently as 2016 mortgages were offered at rates as low 0.99% \u2013 a significant saving over the 1.3% to 1.7% best buys available this week. The other strategy is to take out a tracker mortgage that moves down (and up) in line with Bank of England base rate. For example, Nationwide has one of the cheapest two-year tracker remortgage deals on offer \u2013 at 1.44% \u2013 which tracks the base rate, and adds 0.69%. If base rates went to zero, buyers would see their monthly payments fall massively as their pay-rate would drop to 0.69%. However, buyers need to be aware that if interest rates went up substantially later on, payments would rise accordingly, says L&amp;C\u2019s David Hollingworth. He says most buyers will still want to stick with a fixed-rate deal, given that they are still at very low historical levels, and buyers have the security of knowing what they paying for its term. 3. Savings and cash Isas The possible scenario The Bank of England moves quickly to cut interest rates and embarks on a new round of quantitative easing to boost the economy. Once again the banks are awash with cheap money, meaning the interest rates payable to those with savings is only going one way \u2013 down. At the height of the financial crisis the rates payable to savers in plenty of accounts fell to 0.1%, resulting in negligible returns. What you can do If you believe that no deal is now a likelihood \u2013 and you want to keep your savings in cash \u2013 now\u2019s the time to move them into a fixed-rate bond that guarantees the rate for the bond\u2019s term. This week Metro Bank was offering a one-year, fixed-rate bond paying 2%. If you want to lock your money in for two years, FCMB Bank is paying 2.22%, while five-year bonds promise 2.4%. If you prefer to have some access to your cash, the Charter Savings Bank is paying 1.81% on balances of \u00a35,000 and over. Access to your cash is available with 95 days\u2019 notice. These rates might look uninspiring, but if the stock market tanks post-Brexit, and savings rates collapse, it will look a very smart move. 4. The currency The possible scenario Sterling\u2019s slide this week is the canary in the Brexit coal mine, as traders began marking the pound down to what they think it might be worth in the event of a no-deal exit. Against the euro, the pound fell below \u20ac1.10, while against the dollar it was heading to $1.20. A disorderly departure could see the pound fall to one-to-one parity against the euro and the dollar even before the 31 October deadline. One indication comes from betting company Boyle Sports. At the start of year it was giving punters odds of only 8-1 that the pound would collapse to be worth just one euro, but has slashed the odds to 3-1 that we\u2019ll reach that point some time this year. What you can do If you think the pound will continue to tumble, then buying your holiday money now makes sense, even at today\u2019s depressed levels. Don\u2019t ever buy currency at an airport bureau de change, where rates for euros are already fantastically low, with many giving you just 0.9 euros for each pound. Buy online and in advance for much better deals; you\u2019ll get around \u20ac1.06 for each pound from Travelex online this week. See our separate guide to getting the best deal on holiday money. The currency\u2019s collapse would make everything in overseas resorts this summer more expensive. It\u2019s probably too late for most people now, but late bookers may want to consider half-board or all-inclusive options to control the costs. There is also an argument for booking very early this year for travel such as ski holidays. If the pound falls heavily the tour operators will be forced to raise prices in sterling, so locking a price now may make sense. Or decide to take your next holiday in the UK. If you want to take a punt against sterling and make some money by trading, all you need is a credit card and an initial deposit of around \u00a3100-\u00a3200 to join online forex traders such as eToro, City Index and so on. The big high street banks also let you trade, with minimum deposits starting at \u00a310,000. But forex trading is fantastically risky, and only those able to afford to lose a lot money should even begin trying. 5. Pensions The possible scenario Workers with final salary-style pensions aren\u2019t affected, as they have guarantees, but for everyone else, their pension pot depends on the performance of the stock market. Which way will markets go in a Brexit crash-out? Broadly speaking, domestically focused UK companies, which make most of their profits in the UK, will be obvious casualties and their share prices could fall heavily in the next few months. But the giants of the London stock market \u2013 such as BP, Shell, HSBC and Glaxo \u2013 make the vast majority of their profits in overseas markets, and are much better protected from Brexit. Indeed, as sterling plummets they are likely to rise in value, because their dollar earnings suddenly become worth much more in pounds. What you can do Most people think they can\u2019t do anything about their company pension scheme, but they can. You have to find out who manages your pension scheme, and then see what level of control you have. For example, Legal &amp; General manages 14,000 pension schemes for 2.8 million workers across the UK, including those at GNM, the Guardian\u2019s parent group. Members can view the value of their pension, and make choices about where the money goes, picking between cash, equity (shares) and bonds (which pay fixed rates of interest but can also go up and down in value). If you are convinced that a Boris Johnson-led Brexit is going to be a calamity, that the economy will tank and UK corporate profits collapse, then you can choose to shift your pension into overseas shares. If you believe in a total disaster \u2013 a view not shared by investment experts \u2013 you could even choose to put all of your pension into a cash fund, which means it won\u2019t be affected by a fall in the stock market.

Individual shares Possible scenario A Guardian Money reader asked us this week what to do about his old privatisation and demutualisation shares in the event of no deal. He holds both Lloyds (as a result of the Halifax demutualisation) and Santander. Should he sell them, he asked, fearful that a no-deal Brexit will send them crashing.

Driving abroad The possible scenario On a late autumn trip to the continent, after Britain has crashed out of the EU with no deal, you find yourself having been pulled over by a gendarme 20km outside Calais. He/she will want to see your UK driving licence, your international driving permit (IDP 1968), your insurance green card, the car\u2019s log book (V5 document) and a GB sticker. Tourists flying into the EU and hiring a car will also need an IDP in several countries including Italy, France and the Netherlands. It is this that is likely to catch out future travellers. What you should do If you are heading abroad after 31 October, you need to take all these items with you. The Post Office will sell you an IDP for \u00a35.50 \u2013 you\u2019ll need to show your UK licence and passport. But they will only be required in some countries following a no-deal Brexit; tourists hiring a car in Spain or Portugal won\u2019t need one for stays of up to six months. If there is a deal, UK licence holders will continue to be able to drive using their UK driving licence while visiting all EU and EEA countries. Your car insurer will supply your green card. 9. Health The possible scenario A no-deal crash-out leaves many of the 1.3 million Brits living in the EU facing a major problem \u2013 what will happen if they are rushed to their local hospital? A no-deal departure ends the UK\u2019s involvement in the European health insurance card scheme and other agreements overnight. While it is bad news for holidaymakers, it has the potential to force many of those who live in the EU to abandon their dream. What you can do For those going on holiday, it is simply a case of buying travel insurance before you leave, and the government is advising just that. For those living abroad, Spain has said it will guarantee continued healthcare access to British expats and tourists in the country until the end of 2020 \u2013 provided the UK offers Spaniards here the same deal. This is highly likely as the UK government has said seeking bilateral agreements to maintain healthcare rights is a top priority. In France, another country in which lots of retired Brits live, the position is more complicated, particularly for those who are more temporary \u2013 spending just six months there at a time. They are being advised to formalise their residency where they can. It\u2019s been reported that France is confident of reaching a bilateral agreement with the UK on health care \u2013 helped no doubt by the fact that there are lots of French people living and working in London. Other countries face the same challenge. The problem for some Brits is that those agreements will not be in position by 31 October. Those with dangerous ailments may have to consider returning to the UK temporarily. Medicine availability is what vexes people more seriously. Critical and short shelf-life medicines \u2013 some of which may need to be refrigerated until they are consumed \u2013 would be most vulnerable in a no-deal scenario, with fears they could be held up amid chaos at the ports. Already there are reports of diabetics informally stockpiling their own supplies of insulin by giving themselves less on a daily basis, with potentially dangerous consequences. But the government says the fears are misplaced, as drug companies have already been told to build up an additional six weeks\u2019 supply of medicines to provide a buffer in the event of gridlock at Dover. 10. Prices in the shops The possible scenario Two things could be triggered by a crash-out Brexit: a further slide in the value of sterling that results in the price of imported goods rising; and a complete change in the import tariff system, which could see some goods rise in price (such as cars from Germany) but others fall. The Theresa May government said in March that tariffs would be cut to zero on 87% of imports to the UK as part of a temporary no-deal plan, but prices of some imports including meat, shoes and cars will go up. What you can do The worry will be the products that go up in price, and their availability. Among the consumer goods that will be hit are imports of beef, prices of which will go up by almost 7%, cheddar cheese, up by about \u00a320 per 100kg, and imported fully finished cars, which would attract a 10.8% levy, or about \u00a31,500 for an average new car. This suggests that if you have an eye on a new BMW or Mercedes, it might be worth bringing forward your purchase to before October. For other goods, the savings from stockpiling in advance are probably minimal. For example, while officially the change in tariffs means that tins of tuna could go up by 24%, imported men\u2019s wool jackets by 12%, and men\u2019s, women\u2019s and girls\u2019 underpants made of synthetic fibre by 12%, the reality is that shops will absorb some of the increase or may substitute for domestically produced or alternative suppliers.",

      "bodyText": "Officials at a London council that refused to host a charity event in aid of Palestinian children did not tell the organisers the decision was based on fears their criticism of Israel could breach antisemitism guidelines, internal emails have revealed. The exchanges among officials at Tower Hamlets council also reveal they thought the event should be turned down, in part because of the row over antisemitism in the Labour party. The council told The Big Ride for Palestine, which has raised nearly \u00a3150,000 for sports equipment for children in Gaza since 2015, that the event\u2019s \u201cpolitical connotations\u201d meant that the closing rally of this year\u2019s bike ride could not go ahead in the borough \u201cwithout problems\u201d. Officials told organisers there was a risk speakers might express views which contradicted the council\u2019s policies on community cohesion and equality. Behind the scenes, council staff raised fears of a \u201creal risk\u201d that the event and its organisers could be seen to have breached the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance\u2019s (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism because of references on their website to apartheid and ethnic cleansing. One official said there were concerns \u201cnot least because of the recent furour [sic] within the Labour party over Anti Semitism [sic]\u201d. When considering how to explain the decision, one council official said it would be wise to \u201cavoid the anti Semitism aspect ref their website as this could open a can of worms and come back to bite us\u201d. There was no reference to antisemitism in the email to the event\u2019s organisers. The internal emails, released after a freedom of information request by the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign, revealed the council attempted to assess the Big Ride website according to the rubric of the controversial IHRA definition. The emails showed concern among council officials over quotes on the Big Ride website that described the Israeli treatment of Palestinians as ethnic cleansing and drew parallels between Israeli policies and apartheid-era South Africa. One section of the website said: \u201cActive opposition to the crimes of the Israeli state is a responsibility, just as opposition to South African apartheid was a moral and political imperative for many\u201d, while another said: \u201cIt\u2019s blatantly obvious to recognise the parallels between Apartheid South Africa and the state of Israel ... This is an Israeli issue, not a Jewish one, many Jewish friends oppose this oppression.\u201d Elsewhere, the ride was described as a protest \u201cagainst 67 years of Israeli ethnic cleansing\u201d. The controversial IHRA definition warns \u201cclaiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour\u201d constitutes antisemitism. It grew in prominence after the Labour party adopted a version that excluded some examples included in the original text. The party ultimately adopted the full definition, alongside a statement specifying that nothing in it should \u201cundermine freedom of expression on Israel or the rights of Palestinians\u201d. Critics say the definition potentially conflates legitimate criticism of Israel with racism. Its supporters view it as a means of helping organisations assess subtler forms of antisemitic abuse. The emails show council staff had already decided the event could be refused on the grounds it was \u201ccontroversial and sensitive\u201d before calling on colleagues to check it against IHRA criteria. After looking at the text of the website, an official, whose name was redacted from the released emails, wrote: \u201cIt seems therefore, that although the application form raises no issues, the contents of their website does raise the risk that the event will fall foul of the position the council has adopted.\u201d In a separate email, the council\u2019s head of sports, leisure and culture said she felt the event should be refused because \u201cthe council has recently adopted the [IHRA] definition of antisemitism and there are concerns about the content of the organisation\u2019s website with regard to this\u201d. The head of parks, Stephen Murray, suggested avoiding explaining the reasons behind the refusal in any reply to Big Ride organisers because of concerns that it would open \u201ca can of worms\u201d. A Tower Hamlets council spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cThe council gave the application careful consideration and decided not to host the event, because we do not host rallies with political connotations, albeit without direct links to political parties.\u201d A spokesperson for the charity said its work was focused on helping the 300,000 children in Gaza showing signs of severe psychological distress. The spokesperson added: \u201cIt\u2019s a dreadful thing when an over-scrupulous interpretation of the IHRA definition of antisemitism is used behind closed doors to prevent awareness raising of the situation in Palestine and the need for humanitarian support.\u201d",

At Hempstead Valley for example, the company is testing cardboard containers for mushrooms and tomatoes and removing plastic bags from bread baked in store. The amount of loose produce on offer has increased 40%. Having worked in Hempstead Valley\u2019s Sainsbury\u2019s as a schoolboy and returned to manage the store in his 20s as a graduate trainee, Machin is well aware the M&amp;S is surrounded by competitors there, including a large Tesco, a Lidl, an Aldi, a Sainsbury\u2019s and a Morrisons. In its second week of operation, the revamped store has brought in new shoppers and persuaded them to fill trollies rather than baskets. Machin says there are \u201cgreen shoots\u201d across the chain as it is increasing the amount of goods sold. Bryan Roberts, global insights director at research firm TCC Global, says: \u201cNo matter what you throw and M&amp;S or Waitrose it doesn\u2019t make you bullet proof to the advances of Aldi and Lidl and the on-going discount threat.\u201d He said M&amp;S\u2019s proud history of innovation and even its reputation for luxury food has been diluted as rivals have caught up. \u201cThere is no shortage of places to go for quality convenience foods,\u201d Roberts says. He says the larger stores could work in selected locations but M&amp;S might find it difficult to find enough sites with car parks and sufficient space to make a major difference. M&amp;S is trying to smile, but how long can it keep it up?",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s just over two years since I got the call asking me to write a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jul/20/meera-sodhas-aubergine-green-bean-thai-holy-basil-stir-fry-recipe\" title=\"\">vegan recipe column</a> for this magazine. It was a dream come true, but there were a few small problems.</p> <p>For a start, I wasn\u2019t vegan.</p> <p>Second, I had only ever written about Indian food.</p> <p>Third, I had just had a baby, who was only a few weeks old. Not only had life been thrown into chaos by Arya\u2019s arrival, but I had planned to take a year off. It was an amazing opportunity that had come at the worst possible time. I stalled for a day. I said yes.</p> <p>The truth is, I was excited to enter this brave new world. Huge numbers of people, growing by the day even then, were choosing to eat a more plant-based diet, whether for political, environmental or financial reasons. Although a relatively small number were vegan, a larger number were trying to reduce the meat and dairy in their diet. This seemed an important discussion and I wanted to be a part of it.</p> <p>At the time, many of the recipes being touted for vegans weren\u2019t tempting. They didn\u2019t make <em>me</em> hungry, anyway. Plant-based food was still in the shadows of its association with hemp-trouser-wearing hippies, or hijacked by the wellness brigade. It felt as though the pleasures of eating and the importance of flavour had been forgotten.</p> <p>As an outsider, I thought I could be more inventive. I understood meat-eaters and knew the textures, flavours and \u201crichness\u201d they might miss. I had also spent two years writing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/15/ofm-awards-2017-best-new-cookbook-fresh-india-meera-sodha\" title=\"\">a vegetarian Indian cookery book</a>; I knew how to make bitter cavolo nero leaves sing and how to tempt a beetroot-hater into eating a plateful.</p> <p>I began by looking beyond India to east and south-east Asia, finding new ways to shift vegetables from the side to the centre of the table. I had already travelled to Sri Lanka and eaten sublime <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jul/29/sri-lankan-beetroot-curry-recipe-vegan-green-bean-mallum-meera-sodha\" title=\"\">beetroot and cashew curries</a>. In Thailand, I had memorised every twist in the creation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jul/06/meera-sodha-thai-tomato-salad-peanut-crumbs-vegan-recipe\" title=\"\">som tam salad</a> and counted down the minutes until my next pad thai. I had been soothed by my first congee in Hong Kong and had my taste buds electrified in London\u2019s Chinatown by a bowl of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/16/dan-dan-noodles-recipe-felicity-cloake\" title=\"\">dan dan noodles</a>. I was hungry for more.</p> <p>I also found that vegan constraints are a catalyst for creativity. Not cooking with meat, fish, dairy or eggs forced me to think in new ways. I discovered the wonderful world of the Asian larder: fermented, pickled and salted ingredients \u2013 kimchi, sweet miso and gochujang added flavour in an instant.</p> <p>But veganism wasn\u2019t my only constraint. I had much less time on my hands, now that I was a mum. This meant that elaborate dishes, or those that required too much time to prepare or cook, were left out. They didn\u2019t make the cut for my Guardian column, or <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/80165/meera-sodha.html\" title=\"\">my new book</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f54dcbd6320da8cf2cf2ba299f79e30fd545db39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f54dcbd6320da8cf2cf2ba299f79e30fd545db39/447_1766_2202_2751/800.jpg\" alt=\"Meera Sodha and her daughter, Arya.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meera Sodha and her daughter, Arya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Loftus</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The biggest limitation of the past two years was not being able to travel to the countries whose food I wanted to explore, as I had for my Indian cookbooks. My daughter was so young and I didn\u2019t want to leave her. This time, I travelled by reading: I followed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/17/china-best-kept-food-secret-fuchsia-dunlop-jiangnan-recipes-sea-bass-prawns\" title=\"\">Fuchsia Dunlop</a> around the streets of Chengdu and saw 90s Jakarta through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/feb/24/ofm-classic-cookbook-madhur-jaffrey-invitation-to-indian-cooking\" title=\"\">Madhur Jaffrey</a>\u2019s eyes. When I ran out of books, I packed Arya and a notebook into a baby carrier and went on a food safari, to find the best laksa, bun cha or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/13/thai-massaman-curry-recipe-sweet-potato-aubergine-vegan-meera-sodha\" title=\"\">massaman curry</a> in London.</p> <p>I found that I could travel to Asia without travelling very far at all. I spoke to a friend, Ben, who is from Borneo, where Sarawak laksa is prized. I begged Wichet Khongphoon, the owner-chef of the Thai restaurant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/24/best-vegetarian-vegan-recipes-mapo-tofu-shawarma-aubergine-thai-ghanaian\" title=\"\">Supawan</a> in central London, to show me how to make a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/04/jack-monroe-tom-kha-gai-thai-coconut-soup-recipe\" title=\"\">tom kha g</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/04/jack-monroe-tom-kha-gai-thai-coconut-soup-recipe\" title=\"\">ai soup</a>; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2015/sep/15/my-kitchen-gallery-shuko-oda\" title=\"\">Shuko Oda</a>, the Japanese chef, to teach me how to make her walnut miso. I accosted home cooks on social media who had innocently posted photos of their breakfast, to ask them more about what they ate and how they made it.</p> <p>I embarked on a virtual curry odyssey around India \u2013 from Punjab in the north to Mysore, the city that smells of sandalwood and yoga mats, in the south; to the neighbouring state of Kerala and its mild istoos (vegetables cooked in a ginger, chilli and coconut sauce) and east to Tamil Nadu where, between ancient carved temples and silk sari shops, you will find restaurants serving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/aug/19/tomato-curry-recipe-meera-sodha-vegan\" title=\"\">thakkali kuzhambu</a>, a tomato curry cooked with tamarind, coconut and pickling spices such as mustard, fennel and cumin seeds.</p> <p>I sailed across the Palk Strait to Sri Lanka, where lunch means a selection of curries each made from one main ingredient \u2013 beetroot, aubergine, pumpkin, cashew \u2013 served alongside a coconut dal (parippu). I travelled east to Thailand, and on to Japan, where the katsu curry bears little resemblance to anything I\u2019ve eaten anywhere else.</p> <p>And I converted to tofu. Until a couple of years ago, I was a tofu-denier. The dish that changed my mind was chilli tofu, shared with my father at his favourite bolthole, <a href=\"http://tangoe-restaurant.co.uk/\" title=\"\">a canteen called Tangoe in Leicester</a>. The tofu was crisp and chewy, giving way to a soft and creamy sponginess, and doused in a sweet, fiery sauce. This is living, I remember thinking \u2013 until we got to the last piece. Surely it\u2019s the daughter who should have it, I said, but he decided it was the father\u2019s right. We are still on speaking terms.</p> <p>Here, then, are six new vegan and vegetarian recipes from my travels. I hope you enjoy.</p> <p><strong>Celery and peanut wontons with chilli soy sauce</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad227932cc891cf31ba46d9d72609d917c4ee052\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad227932cc891cf31ba46d9d72609d917c4ee052/90_300_3447_4308/800.jpg\" alt=\"Celery and peanut wontons with chilli soy sauce\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Food styling: Georgia Levy.

Place the peanuts in a food processor and blitz. Roughly chop the celery, then place in the food processor with the peanuts. Pulse until the pieces resemble coarse mince. Heat the rapeseed oil in a pan and, when hot, add the celery and peanut mixture. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes over a medium heat, stirring frequently to remove as much water as possible, then add the garlic and soy sauce and cook for a further 5 minutes. Take off the heat and leave to one side to cool.</p> <p>To make the chilli soy sauce, place all the ingredients in a saucepan. Bring to the boil, then immediately take off the heat.</p> <p>To fill the wontons, lay a wrapper in front of you in a diamond shape. Put 1\u00bd tsp of filling into the centre. Brush the edges lightly with water and fold in half to form a triangle. Press down around the filling, then press outwards to seal it properly and place on a plate. Repeat.</p> <p>To cook the wontons, drop batches of about six into a pan of boiling water for 5 minutes at a time, then drain. To serve, divide the wontons between the plates, drizzle some sauce over each portion, then scatter over some celery leaves.</p> <p><strong>Pistachio, pea and mint soba noodles</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d0210d4c0cf7fc4c9bde71b1aa926054f7846f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d0210d4c0cf7fc4c9bde71b1aa926054f7846f6/111_314_3560_4450/800.jpg\" alt=\"Pistachio, pea and mint soba noodles.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Food styling: Emily Kydd.

Line your tin with non-stick baking paper, folding it tightly into the corners so the paper comes up the sides of the tray by 2cm.</p> <p>Sift together the flour, matcha, baking powder and salt. Separate the whites of the eggs from the yolks into two large bowls and add the caster sugar to the yolks. Using an electric hand-mixer, whisk the egg whites into stiff peaks. Without cleaning the whisk, move on to the next bowl, whisking the yolks and caster sugar together for a couple of minutes until they double in volume, then stir the matcha flour mixture into the egg-yolk bowl.</p> <p>Using a large spatula, fold the egg whites into the yolks, being careful not to knock out too much air. Pour the batter into the lined tin and use a spatula to level the top. Tap the tray to release any air bubbles, then bake for 12 minutes, or until the sponge springs back to the touch.</p> <p>Take the cake out of the oven and leave to rest for exactly one minute, then place a sheet of baking paper over the top, followed by a large chopping board. Using oven gloves, turn the cake over and gently remove the tray. Carefully peel off the now top piece of baking paper and replace with a new sheet just slightly larger than the cake.</p> <p>Gently turn the cake back over again and pop it back into the tin.</p> <p>Take a sharp knife and, at one of the short ends of the cake, score a mark 2cm in, all the way along the width of the cake. Tuck that end of parchment over that edge of the cake and begin to loosely roll the sponge from one short end to the other, rolling the baking parchment with it. Transfer your roll to a cooling rack with the seam on the bottom. Loosely cover with a clean tea towel and leave to cool for 30 minutes.</p> <p>When cool, carefully unroll and spread the jam over the sponge, right to the edges. Whisk the double cream and the icing sugar together until you have soft peaks, then, leaving a 2cm border all around the sides, spread the cream on top of the jam so it is 1cm thick. Scatter over the raspberries and gently press them into the cream. Lifting the parchment at the scored end, roll the sponge up again fairly tightly (but without squeezing out the cream). Place on a tray, with the seam at the bottom, and transfer to the fridge for a couple of hours.</p> <p>When you are ready to serve, cut the roll into 9 or 10 even slices. This will keep in the fridge for two days, but is best eaten that day.</p> <p><strong>Cardamom kheer</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f64c46fc7132dd39c22f6bc5cd5a94414669338\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f64c46fc7132dd39c22f6bc5cd5a94414669338/86_421_3381_4227/800.jpg\" alt=\"Cardamom kheer\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Food styling: Georgia Levy.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s just over two years since I got the call asking me to write a vegan recipe column for this magazine. It was a dream come true, but there were a few small problems. For a start, I wasn\u2019t vegan. Second, I had only ever written about Indian food. Third, I had just had a baby, who was only a few weeks old. Not only had life been thrown into chaos by Arya\u2019s arrival, but I had planned to take a year off. It was an amazing opportunity that had come at the worst possible time. I stalled for a day. I said yes. The truth is, I was excited to enter this brave new world. Huge numbers of people, growing by the day even then, were choosing to eat a more plant-based diet, whether for political, environmental or financial reasons. Although a relatively small number were vegan, a larger number were trying to reduce the meat and dairy in their diet. This seemed an important discussion and I wanted to be a part of it. At the time, many of the recipes being touted for vegans weren\u2019t tempting. They didn\u2019t make me hungry, anyway. Plant-based food was still in the shadows of its association with hemp-trouser-wearing hippies, or hijacked by the wellness brigade. It felt as though the pleasures of eating and the importance of flavour had been forgotten. As an outsider, I thought I could be more inventive. I understood meat-eaters and knew the textures, flavours and \u201crichness\u201d they might miss. I had also spent two years writing a vegetarian Indian cookery book; I knew how to make bitter cavolo nero leaves sing and how to tempt a beetroot-hater into eating a plateful. I began by looking beyond India to east and south-east Asia, finding new ways to shift vegetables from the side to the centre of the table. I had already travelled to Sri Lanka and eaten sublime beetroot and cashew curries. In Thailand, I had memorised every twist in the creation of som tam salad and counted down the minutes until my next pad thai. I had been soothed by my first congee in Hong Kong and had my taste buds electrified in London\u2019s Chinatown by a bowl of dan dan noodles. I was hungry for more. I also found that vegan constraints are a catalyst for creativity. Not cooking with meat, fish, dairy or eggs forced me to think in new ways. I discovered the wonderful world of the Asian larder: fermented, pickled and salted ingredients \u2013 kimchi, sweet miso and gochujang added flavour in an instant. But veganism wasn\u2019t my only constraint. I had much less time on my hands, now that I was a mum. This meant that elaborate dishes, or those that required too much time to prepare or cook, were left out. They didn\u2019t make the cut for my Guardian column, or my new book. The biggest limitation of the past two years was not being able to travel to the countries whose food I wanted to explore, as I had for my Indian cookbooks. My daughter was so young and I didn\u2019t want to leave her. This time, I travelled by reading: I followed Fuchsia Dunlop around the streets of Chengdu and saw 90s Jakarta through Madhur Jaffrey\u2019s eyes. When I ran out of books, I packed Arya and a notebook into a baby carrier and went on a food safari, to find the best laksa, bun cha or massaman curry in London. I found that I could travel to Asia without travelling very far at all. I spoke to a friend, Ben, who is from Borneo, where Sarawak laksa is prized. I begged Wichet Khongphoon, the owner-chef of the Thai restaurant Supawan in central London, to show me how to make a tom kha gai soup; and Shuko Oda, the Japanese chef, to teach me how to make her walnut miso. I accosted home cooks on social media who had innocently posted photos of their breakfast, to ask them more about what they ate and how they made it. I embarked on a virtual curry odyssey around India \u2013 from Punjab in the north to Mysore, the city that smells of sandalwood and yoga mats, in the south; to the neighbouring state of Kerala and its mild istoos (vegetables cooked in a ginger, chilli and coconut sauce) and east to Tamil Nadu where, between ancient carved temples and silk sari shops, you will find restaurants serving thakkali kuzhambu, a tomato curry cooked with tamarind, coconut and pickling spices such as mustard, fennel and cumin seeds. I sailed across the Palk Strait to Sri Lanka, where lunch means a selection of curries each made from one main ingredient \u2013 beetroot, aubergine, pumpkin, cashew \u2013 served alongside a coconut dal (parippu). I travelled east to Thailand, and on to Japan, where the katsu curry bears little resemblance to anything I\u2019ve eaten anywhere else. And I converted to tofu. Until a couple of years ago, I was a tofu-denier. The dish that changed my mind was chilli tofu, shared with my father at his favourite bolthole, a canteen called Tangoe in Leicester. The tofu was crisp and chewy, giving way to a soft and creamy sponginess, and doused in a sweet, fiery sauce. This is living, I remember thinking \u2013 until we got to the last piece. Surely it\u2019s the daughter who should have it, I said, but he decided it was the father\u2019s right. We are still on speaking terms. Here, then, are six new vegan and vegetarian recipes from my travels. I hope you enjoy. Celery and peanut wontons with chilli soy sauce Wonton wrappers can be found in Chinese or large supermarkets; the sauce is mainly made out of store-cupboard ingredients. Makes 24 wontons (serves 4 to 6) For the wontons 160g unsalted peanuts 800g celery, leaves reserved 4 tbsp rapeseed oil 4 cloves of garlic, crushed with 2 tbsp light soy sauce 24 wonton wrappers (or egg-free gyoza wrappers, if vegan), defrosted For the chilli soy sauce 2 tbsp rapeseed oil 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil 4 tbsp light soy sauce 2 cloves of garlic, crushed 1 tsp chilli flakes 1\u00bd tbsp white wine vinegar 2 spring onions, chopped First, make the wonton filling. Place the peanuts in a food processor and blitz. Roughly chop the celery, then place in the food processor with the peanuts. Pulse until the pieces resemble coarse mince. Heat the rapeseed oil in a pan and, when hot, add the celery and peanut mixture. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes over a medium heat, stirring frequently to remove as much water as possible, then add the garlic and soy sauce and cook for a further 5 minutes. Take off the heat and leave to one side to cool. To make the chilli soy sauce, place all the ingredients in a saucepan. Bring to the boil, then immediately take off the heat. To fill the wontons, lay a wrapper in front of you in a diamond shape. Put 1\u00bd tsp of filling into the centre. Brush the edges lightly with water and fold in half to form a triangle. Press down around the filling, then press outwards to seal it properly and place on a plate. Repeat. To cook the wontons, drop batches of about six into a pan of boiling water for 5 minutes at a time, then drain. To serve, divide the wontons between the plates, drizzle some sauce over each portion, then scatter over some celery leaves. Pistachio, pea and mint soba noodles A real \u201cwelcome to summer\u201d dish. All the freshness and lightness that hot weather demands, but with enough in there to keep tummies full. I like to use soba noodles made from buckwheat and wheat, as they are easier to handle, but you could use 100% buckwheat soba if you prefer. Serves 2 50g pistachio kernels 1 bird\u2019s-eye chilli, finely chopped 2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped 300g frozen petit pois, defrosted 25g fresh mint, leaves picked 3 tbsp lime juice (from 2 limes) 3\u00bd tbsp toasted sesame oil 1\u2153 tsp salt 200g soba noodles 120g mangetout 100g watercress, tough stems removed, chopped Place the pistachios, chilli and garlic in a food processor and process until the pistachios have broken down. Add the peas, mint, lime juice, 3 tbsp of sesame oil and the salt, and pulse a few times (don\u2019t blend: you don\u2019t want soup). Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil and, when bubbling, drop in the noodles. Stir and boil according to the instructions. Drain, refresh briefly under cold water and drain again in a sieve over a bowl. Coat with the remaining \u00bd tbsp of sesame oil, using your fingers, to make sure they don\u2019t stick. Set the same saucepan over a low heat and put a couple of tablespoons of water into the pan. When hot, add the mangetout. Stir-fry for 2 minutes, then add the watercress. Stir-fry for a minute until it wilts, then take the pan off the heat. Place the noodles in a mixing bowl and add the vegetables. Mix with your hands, then tip on to a plate to serve. Summer pilau with tomato, coconut and cashews The tomatoes create a wonderful sauce with the coconut milk; they also float up to decorate the dish. Serves 4 as a main course 350g basmati rice 2 tbsp rapeseed oil 12 fresh curry leaves (available in Asian or larger supermarkets) 4cm cinnamon stick 1 large onion, finely sliced 4 cloves of garlic, crushed 1 green finger chilli, finely sliced 50g unsalted cashews 400g baby plum tomatoes, halved 1 x 400ml tin of coconut milk 1\u00be tsp salt Wash the rice in a few changes of cold water, then leave to soak in plenty of cold water. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a wide frying pan and add the curry leaves and cinnamon stick. Stir-fry for 1 minute, then add the onion and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, until it starts to turn golden brown and is soft. Add the garlic, chilli and cashews, and cook for a couple of minutes, then add the tomatoes and pop the lid on. Cook for about 8 minutes, until the tomatoes are soft. Drain the rice, add it to the pan and stir to combine. Add the coconut milk, 200ml of water and the salt. Stir again and bring the mixture to the boil, then put the lid on, turn the heat down to a whisper and cook for a further 15 minutes. Don\u2019t be tempted to lift the lid, as the steam is key to cooking the rice. After 15 minutes, take off the heat and keep the lid on for a further 10 minutes to let the rice rest before eating. Serve with a fresh green salad. Vietnamese coconut pancakes The Vietnamese are masters of the mouthwatering salad, elevating raw vegetables to heavenly places using a secret weapon, nuoc cham chay \u2013 a bright, hot, sweet-and-sour sauce that wakes up every neuron in your brain. Here the salad and its dressing are tucked into a deliciously crispy coconut and turmeric pancake. Makes 6 pancakes 220g rice flour \u00be tsp salt \u00bd tsp ground turmeric 1 medium egg 400ml coconut milk 200g red cabbage (around \u00bc), finely shredded 2 slim carrots (150g), julienned 5 spring onions, finely chopped 40g fresh mixed herbs (Thai basil, coriander and mint), leaves picked and roughly chopped 5 tbsp lime juice (from 3 limes) 3\u00bd tsp sugar 1\u00bd tbsp light soy sauce 1\u00bd bird\u2019s-eye chillies, finely chopped 2 cloves of garlic, crushed Rapeseed oil First, make the batter for the pancakes: put the rice flour, salt, turmeric and egg into a bowl and mix together. Add the coconut milk and 175ml of water, whisk until you have a smooth batter, then leave to one side. Next, place the cabbage, carrots, spring onions and herbs into another bowl and mix with your hands. Make the sauce by putting the lime juice, sugar, soy sauce, chillies and garlic into a jug or small bowl and mixing well. Pour two-thirds of this sauce over the veg and mix again using your hands. Pour the remaining third into a little serving bowl. To make the pancakes, heat a teaspoon of oil in a large, non-stick frying pan over a medium flame and swirl it around the pan to coat. When the pan is very hot, pour in a ladleful of batter, swirling the pan quickly and carefully so that the batter reaches the edge. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until golden and crisp on the bottom (test this by sliding a palette knife under the pancake; if it lifts away easily, it\u2019s ready). Slide on to a plate and repeat with the rest of the batter, until you have 6 pancakes. Your first one may not be perfect, but don\u2019t lose faith: you will quickly get the hang of it. To serve, place a small handful of the salad in the middle of the pancake and roll up. Serve with the extra sauce on the side. Milli\u2019s matcha roll cake with raspberries and cream You will need a Swiss roll tin as close in size to 25cm x 35cm as you can find. Serves 9 to 10 100g plain flour 2 tbsp matcha powder 1 tsp baking powder Pinch of salt 4 large, fridge-cold eggs 120g caster sugar 150g raspberry jam 200ml double cream 20g icing sugar 100g fresh raspberries Preheat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/400F/gas 6. Line your tin with non-stick baking paper, folding it tightly into the corners so the paper comes up the sides of the tray by 2cm. Sift together the flour, matcha, baking powder and salt. Separate the whites of the eggs from the yolks into two large bowls and add the caster sugar to the yolks. Using an electric hand-mixer, whisk the egg whites into stiff peaks. Without cleaning the whisk, move on to the next bowl, whisking the yolks and caster sugar together for a couple of minutes until they double in volume, then stir the matcha flour mixture into the egg-yolk bowl. Using a large spatula, fold the egg whites into the yolks, being careful not to knock out too much air. Pour the batter into the lined tin and use a spatula to level the top. Tap the tray to release any air bubbles, then bake for 12 minutes, or until the sponge springs back to the touch. Take the cake out of the oven and leave to rest for exactly one minute, then place a sheet of baking paper over the top, followed by a large chopping board. Using oven gloves, turn the cake over and gently remove the tray. Carefully peel off the now top piece of baking paper and replace with a new sheet just slightly larger than the cake. Gently turn the cake back over again and pop it back into the tin. Take a sharp knife and, at one of the short ends of the cake, score a mark 2cm in, all the way along the width of the cake. Tuck that end of parchment over that edge of the cake and begin to loosely roll the sponge from one short end to the other, rolling the baking parchment with it. Transfer your roll to a cooling rack with the seam on the bottom. Loosely cover with a clean tea towel and leave to cool for 30 minutes. When cool, carefully unroll and spread the jam over the sponge, right to the edges. Whisk the double cream and the icing sugar together until you have soft peaks, then, leaving a 2cm border all around the sides, spread the cream on top of the jam so it is 1cm thick. Scatter over the raspberries and gently press them into the cream. Lifting the parchment at the scored end, roll the sponge up again fairly tightly (but without squeezing out the cream). Place on a tray, with the seam at the bottom, and transfer to the fridge for a couple of hours. When you are ready to serve, cut the roll into 9 or 10 even slices. This will keep in the fridge for two days, but is best eaten that day. Cardamom kheer I take a bite of this sweet rice pudding and I am back at my parents\u2019 house at Diwali. Arya is 18 months old, shrieking with laughter. One more spoonful and she\u2019s six months old and learning to eat; she doesn\u2019t wrinkle her nose at a simple kheer made with apples. A couple more spoonfuls and it\u2019s 2015, I\u2019m in Mumbai, it\u2019s 2am and my husband Hugh has just arrived. I\u2019ve been away for weeks, and now he\u2019s here the kheer tastes like sweet celebration. Another spoonful and I\u2019m six, struggling to fit in at a new school. I don\u2019t tell Mum, but perhaps she knows because there\u2019s kheer for pudding and it tastes like home. \ufffc Serves 4 100g basmati rice 1 tsp ground cardamom \u00bd tsp ground cinnamon 90g caster sugar, plus 1 tbsp to decorate 700ml whole milk, plus extra if needed 150ml double cream 20g unsalted pistachios 1\u00bd tbsp dried edible flowers (such as marigolds, roses or lavender) Place the rice, spices, sugar, milk and cream in a large saucepan and set over a medium/low heat. Bring to the boil \u2013 but watch it doesn\u2019t boil over \u2013 then turn the heat down to a whisper and cook for about 30 minutes, stirring fairly frequently to make sure the rice doesn\u2019t stick and burn. If the mixture is getting too dry, add more milk, a little at a time. When the rice is nearly done, it will start to bubble and burp more furiously and will need more attention. When the rice is tender (ie there is no chalkiness in the centre), take it off the heat and spoon into a serving bowl. Allow to cool, then cover and chill in the fridge until cold. Just before serving, grind the remaining tablespoon of sugar, the pistachios and the edible flowers as finely as you can, using a mortar and pestle or an electric spice grinder. Sprinkle over the top and serve. \u2022 This is an edited extract from East: 120 Vegan And Vegetarian Recipes From Bangalore To Beijing by Meera Sodha (Penguin, \u00a320).

She has survived the triple trauma of breast cancer, a brain tumour and an engagement to Lance Armstrong (they split in 2006, a few weeks before their wedding). Meanwhile, her brand of soupy, country-tinged rock, all white wine and leather trousers, has inevitably come back round to see her booked at both Wembley and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/29/glastonbury-review-sun-helps-diverse-lineup-shine\">Glastonbury</a> this summer, playing in front of fresh new fans.</p> <p>\u201cThere are very few women who can pull in the young people \u2013 one of the many things that\u2019s unfair in my industry is that men can go on stage and play to young women when they\u2019re 60 and it\u2019s still considered sexy.\u201d Crow, on the other hand, considers herself \u201ca heritage artist\u201d now.

      "body": "<p>I\u2019ve always hated \u201cIrish jokes\u201d. Having an Irish mother, I\u2019ve always been aware how they were used to denigrate Irish people and undermine the cause of Irish nationalism. There\u2019s one joke, though, I\u2019ve always enjoyed. It\u2019s the one where the guy asks the Irishman for directions, to which he replies: \u201cWell, if I were you I wouldn\u2019t be starting from here.\u201d It\u2019s stuck with me because it offers a real life lesson that I find myself regularly referring to.</p> \n<p>Back in the 1980s and 90s, it\u2019s a lesson I should have heeded, as I argued and canvassed for a socialist Labour government when, in hindsight, it was clear that British voters had been wowed by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s strong leadership and populist policies. For my arguments to get through, I shouldn\u2019t have been starting from there. People such as Tony Blair and Alastair Campbell recognised this and modified Labour\u2019s message to resonate with these same voters to spectacular effect.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/02/byelection-tories-election-boris-johnson\">This byelection result has narrowed the Tories\u2019 route to election victory | Katy Balls</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Yet, seeing Campbell announce this week that he\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/29/jeremy-corbyn-labour-party-brexit\" title=\"\">given up on the Labour party</a>, mainly because under Jeremy Corbyn it won\u2019t go all-out remain, I couldn\u2019t help wondering if he shouldn\u2019t also take heed of that Irish lesson. Because if you want Labour to be a pure remain party \u2013 against the wishes of so many of its marginalised, traditional voters, particularly those working-class people in the north \u2013 then don\u2019t do it after a referendum in which those same voters had the once-in-a-lifetime chance to actually make their vote count. Don\u2019t choose this moment to tell millions of long-standing party supporters that you\u2019re ignoring their deeply held views.</p> \n<p>I, like Campbell, am a remainer. I also still want to reverse Brexit. But you can\u2019t stick two fingers up to a huge chunk of your voter base and not expect a negative reaction. It\u2019s why he spent so many years triangulating in the 1990s, trying to work out a middle way. How ironic that Campbell now condems Corbyn for doing exactly the same.</p> \n<p>Corbyn is facing far more flak for this today than New Labour did 20 years ago, and that\u2019s because many on the right of the party don\u2019t actually want to see him win power. (If you want proof, look at Stephen Kinnock\u2019s stony-faced reaction, captured by a <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-general-election-labour-mps-reaction-results-video-theresa-may-prime-minister-a8065796.html\" title=\"\">BBC documentary</a> camera, as the news broke that Theresa May had lost her majority in the 2017 election.) Many of those in and around politics still yearn for the Blair-Brown era when they were close to power. They\u2019re not worried about the damage Labour would suffer by going \u201cfull remain\u201d: an election defeat would merely hasten the day when the hated Corbyn steps down.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"61f98c50-4e03-4e35-af48-b4d8f77b42aa\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fP1I9ZinFRg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Others say that now Boris Johnson has energised the hard right and united his cabinet over no deal, Corbyn must do the same \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/26/boris-johnson-brexit-unite-leave-labour-remain\" title=\"\">but for remain</a>. This is nonsense. Johnson has already seen the damage caused by his rash decision-making. He\u2019s boxed himself in by refusing to talk to European leaders until they ditch the backstop; he\u2019s been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/29/dangerous-uk-government-intent-on-forcing-no-deal-says-sturgeon\" title=\"\">slapped down by Nicola Sturgeon</a> and learned that his stance is boosting the cause of Scottish independence; he\u2019s faced angry Welsh farmers whose livelihood is threatened by no-deal tariffs; and he\u2019s gone to Northern Ireland, where he\u2019s been told that the peace process is at risk. And in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/02/jo-swinson-lib-dems-winning-on-the-up-byelection-victory\" title=\"\">Brecon and Radnorshire</a> he\u2019s tasted defeat after just a week in office, losing an 8,000 majority. Far from rallying supporters, his Brexit stance has just piled up his problems. He can\u2019t even rely on the party\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/01/mark-francois-tory-rebels-vow-to-block-brexit-deal-even-without-backstop\" title=\"\">hardcore Brexiteers</a> to support any deal he might achieve with Europe. </p> \n<p>One thing I do appreciate about Johnson, though, is his optimism. I\u2019m an optimist too. In fact, the more I see of him, the more optimistic I get.</p> \n<p>An early election \u2013 before we\u2019ve left the EU \u2013 looks ever more likely. And it will be a choice between Johnson\u2019s no-deal Brexit, and Labour, which has pledged to keep remain on the table but while still showing a sensitivity to leave voters. The precise stance depends on the election\u2019s timing (as it must), but it\u2019s clear that Labour is against no deal, and open to the possibility of negotiating a Labour Brexit, while promising a referendum on any deal that is struck. I\u2019m no fan of a Labour Brexit, but, like I say, I wouldn\u2019t be starting from here, and like it or not a majority of people voted for us to leave the EU. </p> \n<p>That policy didn\u2019t work in this year\u2019s European elections, when it paid to have a clear message on leave or remain. Labour finished third, behind the Brexit party and the Liberal Democrats, a result that freaked out many Corbyn supporters. But these elections are notorious for being a repository for protest votes. The election was a proxy referendum, people voted along Brexit lines. There was no nuance. The policies that have made Corbyn so popular were not on the ballot: anti-austerity, support for public services, renationalisation, and fairer taxes for the richest. In a general election, the voters would face a simple choice: back Boris Johnson and the no-deal extremists, or back Labour and the chance to remain. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4f9d30b3e028a34a9f985e96c9d183ee2231597\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4f9d30b3e028a34a9f985e96c9d183ee2231597/0_44_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaks at a meeting of the National Policing Board in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Others say now that Boris Johnson has energised the hard right and united his cabinet over no deal Corbyn must do the same \u2013 but for remain.

But now, with the nation in crisis, it\u2019s not that easy to forge ahead.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ve always hated \u201cIrish jokes\u201d. Having an Irish mother, I\u2019ve always been aware how they were used to denigrate Irish people and undermine the cause of Irish nationalism. There\u2019s one joke, though, I\u2019ve always enjoyed. It\u2019s the one where the guy asks the Irishman for directions, to which he replies: \u201cWell, if I were you I wouldn\u2019t be starting from here.\u201d It\u2019s stuck with me because it offers a real life lesson that I find myself regularly referring to. Back in the 1980s and 90s, it\u2019s a lesson I should have heeded, as I argued and canvassed for a socialist Labour government when, in hindsight, it was clear that British voters had been wowed by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s strong leadership and populist policies. For my arguments to get through, I shouldn\u2019t have been starting from there. People such as Tony Blair and Alastair Campbell recognised this and modified Labour\u2019s message to resonate with these same voters to spectacular effect. Yet, seeing Campbell announce this week that he\u2019s given up on the Labour party, mainly because under Jeremy Corbyn it won\u2019t go all-out remain, I couldn\u2019t help wondering if he shouldn\u2019t also take heed of that Irish lesson. Because if you want Labour to be a pure remain party \u2013 against the wishes of so many of its marginalised, traditional voters, particularly those working-class people in the north \u2013 then don\u2019t do it after a referendum in which those same voters had the once-in-a-lifetime chance to actually make their vote count. Don\u2019t choose this moment to tell millions of long-standing party supporters that you\u2019re ignoring their deeply held views. I, like Campbell, am a remainer. I also still want to reverse Brexit. But you can\u2019t stick two fingers up to a huge chunk of your voter base and not expect a negative reaction. It\u2019s why he spent so many years triangulating in the 1990s, trying to work out a middle way. How ironic that Campbell now condems Corbyn for doing exactly the same. Corbyn is facing far more flak for this today than New Labour did 20 years ago, and that\u2019s because many on the right of the party don\u2019t actually want to see him win power. (If you want proof, look at Stephen Kinnock\u2019s stony-faced reaction, captured by a BBC documentary camera, as the news broke that Theresa May had lost her majority in the 2017 election.) Many of those in and around politics still yearn for the Blair-Brown era when they were close to power. They\u2019re not worried about the damage Labour would suffer by going \u201cfull remain\u201d: an election defeat would merely hasten the day when the hated Corbyn steps down. Others say that now Boris Johnson has energised the hard right and united his cabinet over no deal, Corbyn must do the same \u2013 but for remain. This is nonsense. Johnson has already seen the damage caused by his rash decision-making. He\u2019s boxed himself in by refusing to talk to European leaders until they ditch the backstop; he\u2019s been slapped down by Nicola Sturgeon and learned that his stance is boosting the cause of Scottish independence; he\u2019s faced angry Welsh farmers whose livelihood is threatened by no-deal tariffs; and he\u2019s gone to Northern Ireland, where he\u2019s been told that the peace process is at risk. And in Brecon and Radnorshire he\u2019s tasted defeat after just a week in office, losing an 8,000 majority. Far from rallying supporters, his Brexit stance has just piled up his problems. He can\u2019t even rely on the party\u2019s hardcore Brexiteers to support any deal he might achieve with Europe. One thing I do appreciate about Johnson, though, is his optimism. I\u2019m an optimist too. In fact, the more I see of him, the more optimistic I get. An early election \u2013 before we\u2019ve left the EU \u2013 looks ever more likely. And it will be a choice between Johnson\u2019s no-deal Brexit, and Labour, which has pledged to keep remain on the table but while still showing a sensitivity to leave voters. The precise stance depends on the election\u2019s timing (as it must), but it\u2019s clear that Labour is against no deal, and open to the possibility of negotiating a Labour Brexit, while promising a referendum on any deal that is struck. I\u2019m no fan of a Labour Brexit, but, like I say, I wouldn\u2019t be starting from here, and like it or not a majority of people voted for us to leave the EU. That policy didn\u2019t work in this year\u2019s European elections, when it paid to have a clear message on leave or remain. Labour finished third, behind the Brexit party and the Liberal Democrats, a result that freaked out many Corbyn supporters. But these elections are notorious for being a repository for protest votes. The election was a proxy referendum, people voted along Brexit lines. There was no nuance. The policies that have made Corbyn so popular were not on the ballot: anti-austerity, support for public services, renationalisation, and fairer taxes for the richest. In a general election, the voters would face a simple choice: back Boris Johnson and the no-deal extremists, or back Labour and the chance to remain. Of course, if it\u2019s all so rosy, people will ask why the party isn\u2019t way ahead in the polls, especially against this divided and useless government. But now, with the nation in crisis, it\u2019s not that easy to forge ahead. It could just as easily be said: if remain is so great, why isn\u2019t the demand for a People\u2019s Vote way ahead in the polls, especially set against such divisive and useless Brexit negotiations for the past three years? And I\u2019d also say: cast your mind back just two years to a divided opposition party 20 points behind in the polls, which under Corbyn all but made up the gap in a few short weeks of general election campaigning. The situation may not be exactly the same today (let\u2019s face it, Johnson will be a far better campaigner than May, though, like her when she called the election, he\u2019s had the almost undivided loyalty of the national press so far). But he is untested in a battle for mainstream voters. The last time the Tories won an election \u2013 the only time they\u2019ve won in the past 27 years \u2013 they had a great soundbite that struck home in the last few days of the 2015 campaign: Labour, in alliance with the Scottish National party, would \u201cbankrupt Britain and break up Britain\u201d. Today, who would break up Britain? Johnson and his insistence on a hard Brexit that risks Scottish independence and Irish reunification. Who will bankrupt Britain? Again, Johnson and his no-deal tactics, which the Bank of England has warned would lead to an \u201cinstantaneous shock\u201d to the economy. An election victory is no easy feat, it never is, but to those who genuinely want a Labour victory, do not lose hope. In 2014, at the previous European elections, the Conservatives came in third place. Within a year, they were voted into government with a majority. Maybe here\u2019s not such a bad place to start from. \u2022 Joseph Harker is the Guardian\u2019s deputy opinion editor",

      "bodyText": "Staff at the only nationwide service offering support to Scotland\u2019s most dangerous and troubled young people say they are devastated that it is closing at the end of October. After the conviction in February of the teenager Aaron Campbell for the rape and murder of six-year-old Alesha MacPhail, staff at the Glasgow-based Interventions for Vulnerable Youth (Ivy) project spoke out about the need to support young people like him. But now the highly specialised service, working with young people who present some of the most serious and complex risks in the country, faces closure because it cannot find a permanent base nor the funding to sustain it. Although the Scottish government committed some funding for another year, this was not enough to support it in premises of its own and, because the money is allocated on a year-by-year basis, staff say this has made it difficult to recruit and retain people, or to persuade another organisation to host the service. The project was set up five years ago to meet the needs of the minority of young people who present a severe risk of harm to others. The carefully calibrated team of health and social work specialists has supported more than 200 12- to 18-year-olds across 31 out of 32 Scottish local authorities to date, many of whom had already perpetrated very serious crimes, or made very explicit their plans to do so. The team believe that, through their interventions, they have prevented a number of murders and rapes. Ivy was initially based at the Centre for Youth and Criminal Justice (CYCJ) at Strathclyde University but this was never intended to be permanent. Fiona Dyer, the interim director of the CYCJ, said: \u201cTo meet the needs of these young people, professionals need very specialist skills, safe and supportive organisations to work within, as well as contingencies and resiliencies to buffer them from the practical and emotional demands of the work. Temporary funding simply fails to provide this as it creates uncertainty, detracts time and resources away from the \u2018real job\u2019 and undermines the ability to recruit and retain staff.\u201d The Guardian understands that Ivy staff had been in discussion with a potential new host but the offer fell through because of the project\u2019s funding constraints. Dyer said: \u201cWe have been extremely lucky to have had dedicated and committed staff who have, since the inception of the project, worked tirelessly to meet the needs of these vulnerable, marginalised and maligned young people in the hope that they can be supported to achieve better outcomes for them and those around them.\u201d A Scottish government spokesperson said: \u201cThe Interventions for Vulnerable Youth project was introduced by the Centre for Youth and Criminal Justice as a pilot to promote best practice in forensic mental health risk assessment and management for young people who present a serious risk of harm to others. \u201cWe have supported this project since its introduction and will continue to support partners delivering Ivy to seek alternative sustainable arrangements for this service in the future.\u201d An appeal by Campbell over the length of his life sentence will be heard in Edinburgh on 7 August.",

Our gang no longer comprised a man brandishing a guidebook, a woman anxiously thumbing the tickets and a teenager dragging her feet.

The first 24 hours, therefore, should be reserved for napping, a gentle recce of the area and devising a rich backstory for your Airbnb host. I\u2019ve never taken a long-haul flight, thanks to, first, the aforementioned parental disinclination and second, being a tight-fisted freelance worker; but just as I imagine you wouldn\u2019t want to attempt a demanding rock-climbing excursion on day one of your jet lag, vigorous city walks and emotionally intense family reunions are not ideal for the morning after a sleepless overnight train ride.</p> <h2><strong>Travel light</strong></h2> <p>Flight baggage fees are a pain, but they are a useful deterrent for those with a tendency to cart the entire contents of the kitchen abroad in case \u201cthey don\u2019t have any bread in Sweden\u201d.</p> <p>Unfortunately, trains, with their dangerous lack of luggage limits, actively promote such behaviour. There\u2019s also something about the continuity of rail travel \u2013 the way it literally keeps you grounded, rather than hoisting you excitingly above the clouds \u2013 that encourages living as you would at home. Flights promote recognition of the fact that you are somewhere new and might want something for breakfast other than toast.</p> <p> Sleeper compartments are not exactly cavernous. No matter how harmonious your family, being forced to share an already narrow bed with seven packs of custard creams will spark tension. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The romance of train travel imbues the food you buy with mood-boosting glamour \u2013 even if you are scoffing a dry pastry</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2><strong>Bond over the buffet car</strong></h2> <p>There is no social glue stronger than the buffet car.

Five minutes later, he comes back with a baguette in his mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that means,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ominous.\u201d The rains come. It rains through the night and all the next day. The flies of the field invade the house. We take to our beds to read for long stretches, and in between we eat and drink, and kill flies. The sun breaks through on the day of our departure, as we pack up damp socks and exploded paperbacks. We say our goodbyes and head for the airport. The woman at security flips through my US passport, turning page after page, forward and backward, looking for something and not finding it. \u201cIt\u2019s finished,\u201d she says. \u201cNearly, I know,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll apply for a new one as soon as \u2026\u201d I stop, realising that she means it\u2019s full. She needs a place to put her stamp and there isn\u2019t one. She shakes her head and turns the pages again. Can you be refused travel because your passport is too full? I don\u2019t want to ask, in case the answer is yes. Beneath my shirt, beads of sweat roll down my sides. Finally, she plants her stamp in the fold between two pages and hands me the passport with a severe smile. On the plane, all I can think about is what happens at the other end when I turn up with a solidly inked passport. How did this happen? I don\u2019t even really like travel. After we land at Stansted, my children scatter so as not to be delayed by me. As I walk along, feet heavy with dread, suitcase wheeling behind me, I notice the signs for the electronic gates have little US flags on them: according to the instructions, I\u2019m now allowed to use them as long as I\u2019m over 12. I stop to ask an official. Really? \u201cYes!\u201d he says. \u201cGo!\u201d I walk up to the screen and place my passport face down. After a few seconds the gate opens and I step through. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d says the youngest one, incredulous. \u201cBelonging!\u201d I say, while thinking that sometimes you have to ignore the dead bird in favour of the stupid dog with the baguette.",

In 2018, I was able to renew passport without a guardian. The personal fight and standoff at the passport office was not pleasant. More freedoms, I\u2019m sure, will be coming.</p> <p>\u201cAny pushback, if they dare, from conservatives will be beaten down. The snowball has just started [rolling]. Most of Saudi Arabia is young and ready. It won\u2019t always be smooth sailing; when has the fight for equality ever been easy? But the process has started. I have a feeling we are arriving at a Saudi renaissance.

      "bodyText": "Saudi women have largely embraced new laws allowing them to travel, divorce, and apply for official documents without the permission of a male guardian, and claimed conservative resistance to the sweeping decrees is doomed to fail. The measures, announced late on Thursday, amount to a partial dismantling of guardianship laws that have long confined women in Saudi Arabia to narrow gender roles and marginalised their role in society. Such moves have been long awaited and are a centrepiece of the kingdom\u2019s much-touted reform programme, which has pledged to overhaul rigid laws and customs that have made the country one of the most oppressive in the world. In the capital, Riyadh, women responded enthusiastically to questions about the changes, with some saying they heralded a \u201crenaissance\u201d, and others claiming they would profoundly improve their status. \u201cIt means a lot to me and about time,\u201d said Azzah, a woman in her mid-30s. \u201cI have been to hell and back each time I needed my passport renewed, since my father passed in 2000. In 2018, I was able to renew passport without a guardian. The personal fight and standoff at the passport office was not pleasant. More freedoms, I\u2019m sure, will be coming. \u201cAny pushback, if they dare, from conservatives will be beaten down. The snowball has just started [rolling]. Most of Saudi Arabia is young and ready. It won\u2019t always be smooth sailing; when has the fight for equality ever been easy? But the process has started. I have a feeling we are arriving at a Saudi renaissance. The future looks bright \u2026 We have the spirit, the motivation and the will.\u201d Dr Maha al-Muneef, the executive director of the National Family Safety Program (NFSP) and a recipient of the 2014 international women of courage award, said: \u201cThis takes the dependency on men out of women\u2019s lives.

      "bodyText": "Italian authorities have granted refugee status to an Eritrean man who was the victim of one of the country\u2019s most embarrassing cases of mistaken identity. Last month a judge in Palermo acquitted Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe of being a human trafficking kingpin, confirming he was the victim of mistaken identity when he was arrested more than three years ago in a joint operation by Italian and British authorities. After the verdict he was moved to a deportation centre in Caltanissetta, Sicily, awaiting removal from the country. But on Friday a panel of judges from the refugee commission in Syracuse accepted Berhe\u2019s request for asylum, meaning he is free to remain in Italy. \u201cI can\u2019t describe how happy I am,\u201d Berhe, 32, told the Guardian outside the expulsion centre. \u201cIt was a nightmare. A nightmare which lasted too long.\u201d Berhe was arrested in Karthoum, Sudan, on 24 May 2016. Italian and British authorities presented it to the press as a coup, mistaking him for one of the world\u2019s most wanted human traffickers, Medhanie Yehdego Mered, AKA the General. Within a few hours of Berhe\u2019s arrest, hundreds of Mered\u2019s victims claimed the wrong man had been detained. According to the suspect\u2019s family, far from being a notorious trafficker he was an Eritrean refugee who earned his living on a dairy farm and working occasionally as a carpenter. A three-year investigation by the Guardian uncovered witnesses and documents that the defence later produced in court to help prove his innocence. A documentary made by the Swedish broadcaster SVT in collaboration with the Guardian revealed that the real Mered was living in Uganda\u2019s capital, Kampala, spending his substantial earnings in nightclubs while Berhe faced up to 15 years in jail. In addition to two DNA tests and an array of witnesses, perhaps the most crucial proof of Berhe\u2019s innocence was a voice analysis of him and Mered, who had been caught on a wiretap in 2014. The result unequivocally concluded that the man in prison was not the trafficker. But prosecutors continued to insist the man captured in Khartoum was the real smuggler and began waging an offensive against activists and journalists, tapping phone conversations among reporters, exposing sources. The prosecutor in the trial, Calogero Ferrara, did not call a single witness to testify against Berhe, but at the end of his five hours of closing remarks on 17 June he dismissed suggestions they had the wrong man and demanded a 14-year prison term. The judge, Alfredo Montalto, of the criminal court of Palermo, rejected the prosecutor\u2019s claims. \u201cIt was a case of mistaken identity,\u201d Montalto said on 12 July. \u201cThe man in prison was wrongly arrested.\u201d Berhe was found guilty instead of a much lesser charge of aiding illegal immigration for having helped his cousin to reach Libya. Because he had already served three years in prison, the judge ordered his immediate release. Berhe\u2019s laywer, Michele Calantropo, told the Guardian: \u201cAfter the verdict I rushed to the prison alongside Berhe\u2019s sister only to find out that they moved him to an expulsions centre for migrants. We had filed an official request for asylum. It wasn\u2019t fair to move him there.\u201d \u201cMedhanie\u2019s judicial persecution has finally ended in the best way possible: with a refugee status to which he is fully entitled,\u201d said Riccardo Noury, Amnesty International\u2019s Italy spokesman. \u201cI shudder to think where he would be now if the judicial error against him had not been exposed.\u201d Relatives have asked that Berhe be awarded damages for his wrongful detention and called for an investigation to be opened into why Sicily\u2019s top prosecutors pursued the case. \u201cBerhe is free but this story won\u2019t be over until they clear his name,\u201d said Calantropo.",

It would levy a <strong>2% tax on major digital service companies</strong> whose annual revenues exceed \u00a3500m annually, such as Facebook, Google and Amazon. </p> <p>The UK and other European nations have long hoped to extract more tax from US-based tech giants, and the UK and <strong>France</strong> decided to move ahead on their own taxes before the EU reached a consensus on a unified measure. Earlier this week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/30/trumps-threat-to-tax-french-wines-labelled-completely-moronic\">Trump threatened France </a>with a tariff on wine if that country goes ahead with its plan for a 3% tax. </p> <p>The UK is in a particularly vulnerable situation vis a vis the US on this, however, because brand new prime minister <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> is banking on achieving a US-UK trade deal, which would be vital to the success of a post-Brexit UK economy. The UK\u2019s departure from the EU could come as soon as 31 October. The UK is barred from beginning negotiations with the US until then. </p> <p>The proposed digital tax is by no means the only hurdle to a trade agreement between the two countries, however. Earlier this week, my colleague Julian Borger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/31/brexit-mess-with-good-friday-and-well-block-uk-trade-deal-us-politicians-warn\">reported</a> that US congressional leaders have said they will not approve a US-UK trade deal if Brexit affects the Irish border and threatens peace in Northern Ireland. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d44a7588f08c7e177d43b1d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-02T21:28:57.862Z\">10.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hello everyone!

Lower-priced generic drug makers produced the lion\u2019s share.</p> <p>\u201cPurdue Pharma is deeply concerned about the impact the opioid addiction crisis is having on individuals and communities in Massachusetts and across the country,\u201d the company said Friday. \u201cHowever, we strongly believe that litigation is not the answer. It wastes critical resources and time that are urgently needed now in the midst of the crisis.\u201d </p> <p>OxyContin has been a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/17/opioid-crisis-drug-makers-pills-federal-data-epidemic\">highly profitable</a> drug that was very influential in the section of the market focused on the most powerful prescription narcotics. The government has also pointed out that a significant proportion of people becoming dependent on heroin and fentanyl in recent years started having problems as a result of taking prescription opioids based on oxycodone, which is derived from the opium poppy, such as OxyContin.</p> <p>Lawyers for Sackler family members named in the lawsuit, meanwhile, argued in court Friday that they couldn\u2019t be held liable because they didn\u2019t personally carry out any of the marketing efforts or issue any directives on how to boost sales of Oxycontin.</p> <p> They also argued that many of the documents cited by Healey\u2019s office actually disprove its claims and omit crucial information. </p> <p>Lawsuits against the family members state that as long-time directors of Purdue, making up the majority of the board, they are accused of <a href=\"https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/oag_opioid_lawsuit.pdf\">orchestrating</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2019/01/31/Massachusetts%20AGO%20Amended%20Complaint%202019-01-31.pdf\">knowingly</a> pushing deceptive practices at Purdue to boost sales of OxyContin while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/13/meet-the-sacklers-the-family-feuding-over-blame-for-the-opioid-crisis\">misleading</a> prescribers and the public about the risks of addiction and death, the Guardian has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/26/sacklers-opioids-purdue-pharma-oxycontin-opioids\">reported</a>.</p> <p>They reaped profits while allegedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/21/sackler-family-500-cities-counties-and-tribes-sue-oxycontin-maker\">helping create</a> \u201cthe worst drug crisis in American history,\u201d the Massachusetts state lawsuit says.</p> <p>Superior Court Judge Janet Sanders is expected to decide on the requests to toss out the case later. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fd1218f067c6aba8942d31fd0ec303f8b676ebb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fd1218f067c6aba8942d31fd0ec303f8b676ebb/0_67_4258_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, left, wipes a tear from the face of Wendy Werbiskis, of East Hampton, Massachusetts, one of the protesters gathered earlier today outside a courthouse in Boston, where a judge heard arguments in the state\u2019s lawsuit against Purdue Pharma over its role in the national drug epidemic.

One bore the words \u201cAlways loved, never forgotten.\u201d Another: \u201cWe march for those who can\u2019t.\u201d </p> <p>A full-size skeleton covered with empty prescription pill bottles was also set up, and many gathered on the court\u2019s brick plaza held up their own large signs with images of their dead loved ones. <br>Cheryl Juaire, a mother from Marlborough, Massachusetts, whose 23-year-old son Corey Merrill died of an overdose in 2011, said activists want to continue to put a spotlight on Purdue Pharma and the wealthy members of the <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/26/sacklers-opioids-purdue-pharma-oxycontin-opioids\">Sackler family</a></strong> that own the company, for their roles in sparking the opioid crisis with the prescription painkiller OxyContin, the AP writes.</p> <p>\u201cThey need to see the families,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to be held accountable for the deaths of our children. We need restitution.\u201d <br>Purdue Pharma is arguing Friday that Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey\u2019s lawsuit should be dismissed because it distorts facts and statements and makes oversimplified claims in order to scapegoat the company. </p> <p>In a statement as the hearing opened, it called Healey\u2019s lawsuit a \u201cmisguided and very political effort to try to place blame on a single manufacturer\u201d for an epidemic that\u2019s now largely driven by illegal heroin and fentanyl. <br>The opioid epidemic has claimed more than 400,000 lives since 1999, but the company has argued it produced only a small fraction of the nation\u2019s opioids about 3% between 2006 and 2012 while lower-priced generic drugs combined to make 90% of the pills. </p> <p>\u201cPurdue Pharma is deeply concerned about the impact the opioid addiction crisis is having on individuals and communities in Massachusetts and across the country,\u201d the company said. \u201cHowever, we strongly believe that litigation is not the answer. It wastes critical resources and time that are urgently needed now in the midst of the crisis.\u201d </p> <p>Healey, a Democrat, accuses the Stamford, Connecticut, company of falsely claiming <strong>OxyContin</strong> had low risk for addiction. Her office argues that Purdue Pharma pushed prescribers to keep patients on the drugs longer and aggressively targeted vulnerable populations, like the elderly and veterans. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6bc7982431fcc8cc1ac7bd2372ff8c6f75dc5ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6bc7982431fcc8cc1ac7bd2372ff8c6f75dc5ac/0_171_5724_3434/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Art photographer and activist Nan Goldin (left) and her organization, P.A.I.N.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a rundown of today\u2019s biggest political news: Puerto Rico\u2019s disgraced governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 finally resigned. His chosen successor, Pedro Pierluisi, has been sworn in, but remains under a legal cloud because he hasn\u2019t been confirmed by the Puerto Rican senate. Pierluisi said Friday evening that he would step aside if the senate does not ratify his appointment on Wednesday. The Trump administration has warned the UK that a plan to tax US-based tech giants will scuttle Boris Johnson\u2019s attempts to negotiate a post-Brexit US-UK trade deal, according to a report in the Telegraph. Congressman John Ratcliffe withdrew from consideration as the new director of national intelligence. The fierce partisan had faced strong opposition from the Senate. The number of House Democrats who support launching an impeachment inquiry into Trump reached 118 \u2013 a majority of the 235 member caucus. The NYPD\u2019s deputy commissioner of trials, Rosemarie Maldonado, recommended that Daniel Pantaleo \u2013 the officer who placed Eric Garner in a chokehold \u2013 should be fired. Have a nice weekend everyone! Pedro Pierluisi, the chosen successor of former governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, told reporters after his swearing in that he will step aside if the senate does not confirm his appointment, according to Reuters. \u201cIf I am not ratified then the second in line, the secretary of justice of Puerto Rico, will take over the governorship,\u201d Pierluisi said at his first news conference as governor. Pierluisi\u2019s position appears to contradict that of Rossell\u00f3, who earlier on Friday said that Pierluisi\u2019s appointment as secretary of state (which paved the way for his elevation to governor upon Rosell\u00f3\u2019s resignation) was a recess appointment that did not require senate confirmation. A bit more detail on the uncertainty in Puerto Rico: Pedro Pierluisi\u2019s appointment as secretary of state was approved today by the House of Representatives, but has not yet been approved by the Senate. The president of the senate, Thomas Rivera Schatz, denounced Pierluisi\u2019s apparent succession as \u201cunethical and illegal\u201d, according to Reuters. Schatz has argued that, under Puerto Rican law, justice secretary Wanda V\u00e1zquez should be the next governor. Two experts on Puerto Rico\u2019s constitution concur, according to the Reuters report: Puerto Rican constitutional expert Julio Fontanet said the territory\u2019s law clearly stated the justice secretary should be next in line for governor under current circumstances. \u201cThis is a grossly irresponsible act,\u201d Fontanet said in a television interview. \u201cThis constitutes a completely unnecessary constitutional crisis, the fruit of the irresponsibility and immaturity of Ricardo Rossell\u00f3.\u201d Here\u2019s some video of the celebrations in Old San Juan when Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 finally, officially resigned. My colleague Oliver Laughland wrote about Rossell\u00f3\u2019s chosen successor, Pedro Pierluisi, on Wednesday. You can also hear Olly discuss his time reporting on the island on our daily podcast, Today in Focus. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, Puerto Rico\u2019s embattled governor, finally resigned Friday, after weeks of protest. But uncertainty remains about the legality of the appointment of his chosen successor, Pedro Pierluisi. The next in line to the governor in Puerto Rico is the secretary of state, who is supposed to be confirmed by the territory\u2019s House and Senate. But Rossell\u00f3 only appointed Pierluisi to the position this week, when the legislature has not been in session. Rossell\u00f3 said no confirmation was required because Pierluisi was a recess appointment, but legal challenges are likely to ensue, according to the Associated Press. The Trump administration has warned the UK that the US will not sign a new trade deal with its longtime ally unless the UK drops plans to tax American tech companies, according to the Telegraph. Per the report: The threat has been communicated to the UK Government \u201cat multiple levels\u201d and has emerged as one of the most significant hurdles to Boris Johnson\u2019s hopes of a speedy agreement. Key members of the US Congress, which needs to approve any deal, have also echoed the warning, going a step further to suggest it could even block formal talks from starting. \u201cThe message was, \u2018If you go ahead and introduce this tax, we will not begin free trade negotiations with you,\u2019\u201d said one source familiar with the exchange. The digital services tax was proposed by former UK chancellor Phillip Hammond in October 2018 and expected to go into effect in April 2020. It would levy a 2% tax on major digital service companies whose annual revenues exceed \u00a3500m annually, such as Facebook, Google and Amazon. The UK and other European nations have long hoped to extract more tax from US-based tech giants, and the UK and France decided to move ahead on their own taxes before the EU reached a consensus on a unified measure. Earlier this week, Trump threatened France with a tariff on wine if that country goes ahead with its plan for a 3% tax. The UK is in a particularly vulnerable situation vis a vis the US on this, however, because brand new prime minister Boris Johnson is banking on achieving a US-UK trade deal, which would be vital to the success of a post-Brexit UK economy. The UK\u2019s departure from the EU could come as soon as 31 October. The UK is barred from beginning negotiations with the US until then. The proposed digital tax is by no means the only hurdle to a trade agreement between the two countries, however. Earlier this week, my colleague Julian Borger reported that US congressional leaders have said they will not approve a US-UK trade deal if Brexit affects the Irish border and threatens peace in Northern Ireland. Hello everyone! This is Julia Carrie Wong in San Francisco, here to see you through the rest of Friday in US politics. Saikat Chakrabarti, the chief of staff for Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is stepping down from his position, the Intercept just reported. Chakrabarti is going to work for a not-for-profit organization focused on climate crisis and the Green New Deal. Staff turnover in a freshman congresswoman\u2019s office would not normally be big news, but Chakrabarti has been unusually visible \u2013 and controversial. He worked on AOC\u2019s primary campaign, which challenged a longtime Democratic incumbent, and did not shy away from criticizing other Democratic lawmakers for their votes. You can read more about how those tensions spilled into the opinion pages of the New York Times and then Twitter in the Intercept\u2019s article. It\u2019s been a busy Friday so far. East coast handing over to west coast now, and my colleague Julia Carrie Wong, who will continue to follow all the action in US politics news this afternoon. Here are the main stories so far today Congressman John Ratcliffe took himself out of consideration to become the new director of national intelligence. He had faced an uphill battle among Republicans in the Senate, despite, or perhaps because of, ostentatious loyalty to Donald Trump, whereas extreme partisanship doesn\u2019t lend itself well to this role. The president signed the hefty spending bill passed by the Senate yesterday. He also praised Kim Jong-un lavishly despite the missiles spurting out of North Korea. And he mocked Elijah Cummings for having an intruder, which earned him a rebuke on Twitter from Nikki Haley. A majority of House Democrats now favor formally launching an impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has so far remained silent on the subject since yesterday, despite saying she\u2019d make a statement on the topic that day. An important hearing in the public health crisis triggered by the overprescription of addictive opioids painkillers in America was held in court in Boston. The New York Police Department oversight arm recommended that officer Daniel Pantaleo be fired as a result of the chokehold death of Eric Garner in 2014. Garner\u2019s dying words of \u201cI can\u2019t breath\u201d became a rallying cry for protesters of police brutality and fueled a national debate over policing, race and the use of force. US national security adviser John Bolton and US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross will speak at a conference on Venezuela - in Peru - next week as part of a campaign to force Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro to relinquish power, a senior US official said on Friday. The Tuesday meeting will be a strong show of support for Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido from the more than 50 countries that have recognized him as the rightful president of Venezuela, said the official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, the Reuters news agency reports this afternoon. In his presentation, Ross will give attendees details on a post-Maduro reconstruction plan for Venezuela. \u201cWe plan to attend and have a big presence,\u201d the official said. Peru had proposed the meeting as a way to build support for early elections in Venezuela, and wanted Maduro\u2019s allies such as Russia, China, Cuba, Bolivia and Turkey to take part. But none of those countries are expected to attend, the US official said. Washington considers Maduro a dictator who stole last year\u2019s election and has slapped a series of escalating sanctions on Venezuela to pressure him to step down. Maduro has refused and vows to resist what he describes as U.S. imperialism. Yesterday, Donald Trump said he was considering a blockade of Venezuela. His administration has so far focused on diplomatic and economic pressure against Maduro while steering clear of any military action. AOC v Cheney Needs no introduction: Key opioids hearing More than 100 people gathered in front of Suffolk County Superior Court, some with signs saying, \u201cSack the Sacklers,\u201d referring to the wealthy family that owns Purdue Pharma, the maker of the opioid prescription painkiller OxyContin. Poster boards filled with photos of hundreds of Massachusetts overdose victims were also laid out on the courthouse steps. \u201cThey need to see the families,\u201d said Cheryl Juaire, a mother from Marlborough, Massachusetts, whose 23-year-old son Corey Merrill died of an overdose in 2011. \u201cThey need to be held accountable for the deaths of our children.\u201d \u201cThey\u201d, of course, didn\u2019t show up - the eight Sacklers being sued by the state. This was a hearing for the judge to listen to their and the company\u2019s motions to dismiss the lawsuit against them by Massachusetts attorney general Maura Healey, a Democrat. Lawyers for the various defendants, including Purdue Pharma, Theresa, Beverly, Richard, Jonathan, Kathe, Ilene, David, and Mortimer Sackler Jr, said that Healey distorted facts and made oversimplified claims in her lawsuit in order to scapegoat the company for the opioids epidemic that has claimed more than 400,000 lives since 1999. Healey, in her lawsuit, accuses the Stamford, Connecticut, company of falsely and knowingly claiming OxyContin had low risk for addiction. Her office argues that Purdue Pharma\u2019s sales and marketing teams pushed prescribers to keep patients on the drugs longer and aggressively targeted vulnerable populations, like the elderly and veterans, the AP writes. In a statement as the hearing opened, Purdue Pharma called Healey\u2019s lawsuit a \u201cmisguided and very political effort to try to place blame on a single manufacturer\u201d for an epidemic that\u2019s now largely driven by illegal heroin and fentanyl. The company has argued it produced only a small fraction of the nation\u2019s opioid medications. Lower-priced generic drug makers produced the lion\u2019s share. \u201cPurdue Pharma is deeply concerned about the impact the opioid addiction crisis is having on individuals and communities in Massachusetts and across the country,\u201d the company said Friday. \u201cHowever, we strongly believe that litigation is not the answer. It wastes critical resources and time that are urgently needed now in the midst of the crisis.\u201d OxyContin has been a highly profitable drug that was very influential in the section of the market focused on the most powerful prescription narcotics. The government has also pointed out that a significant proportion of people becoming dependent on heroin and fentanyl in recent years started having problems as a result of taking prescription opioids based on oxycodone, which is derived from the opium poppy, such as OxyContin. Lawyers for Sackler family members named in the lawsuit, meanwhile, argued in court Friday that they couldn\u2019t be held liable because they didn\u2019t personally carry out any of the marketing efforts or issue any directives on how to boost sales of Oxycontin. They also argued that many of the documents cited by Healey\u2019s office actually disprove its claims and omit crucial information. Lawsuits against the family members state that as long-time directors of Purdue, making up the majority of the board, they are accused of orchestrating and knowingly pushing deceptive practices at Purdue to boost sales of OxyContin while misleading prescribers and the public about the risks of addiction and death, the Guardian has reported. They reaped profits while allegedly helping create \u201cthe worst drug crisis in American history,\u201d the Massachusetts state lawsuit says. Superior Court Judge Janet Sanders is expected to decide on the requests to toss out the case later. The \u201cvetting\u201d of John Ratcliffe So, there you go. Nothing to add. Okay, there is something to add. This last night, from the Washington Post: Trump\u2019s choice to lead the nation\u2019s intelligence community often cites a massive roundup of immigrant workers at poultry plants in 2008 as a highlight of his career. Rep. John Ratcliffe claims that as a federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Texas, he was the leader of the immigration crackdown, describing it as one of the largest cases of its kind. \u201cAs a U.S. Attorney, I arrested over 300 illegal immigrants on a single day,\u201d Ratcliffe (R-Tex.) says on his congressional website. But a closer look at the case shows that Ratcliffe\u2019s claims conflict with the court record and the recollections of others who participated in the operation. Sanders jumps in to defend Warren against Cheney Congressman Liz Cheney (as she so refers to herself), of Wyoming, daughter of ex-Veep and war hawk Dick, just lobbed a grenade at 2020 candidate Elizabeth Warren today after the Massachusetts Senator baulked during the Democratic presidential primary debate on Tuesday at the idea of a first-use nuclear strike by the US. Liz used her personal account as opposed to her official Twitter account, FYI. But Senator and 2020 rival Bernie Sanders hopped to Warren\u2019s defense with some wit. Golf The president is on his way to Bedminster, New Jersey. Staggering insight from The Mooch. Ratcliffe won\u2019t make it... Onto the Guardian\u2019s interactive The Firings and the Fury, which records the ongoing exodus of luminaries from Donald Trump\u2019s administration. I\u2019m afraid dropping out after you\u2019ve been nominated for five minutes but didn\u2019t make the cut in the Senate doesn\u2019t qualify you for this dubious honor. Loud Trump loyalist had faced uphill battle to be confirmed as DNI Texan Congressman John Ratcliffe caused a ripple with the general public and, clearly, a huge splash with Donald Trump when he staged one of those GOP mini-tantrums at the Robert Mueller hearing last month (hat-tip to Lindsey Graham when he erupted at the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearing last year). Ratcliffe first (falsely) tried to claim that former special counsel Mueller had illegally smeared the president in his report then finished with a loud flourish. \u201cI agree with the chairman this morning when he said Donald Trump is not above the law. He\u2019s not,\u201d Ratcliffe said. \u201cBut he damn sure shouldn\u2019t be below the law, which is where Volume II of this report [the Mueller report] puts him.\u201d About two seconds later, Ratcliffe was nominated to be the director of national intelligence, replacing Dan Coats who revealed last weekend that he\u2019s leaving the post. But Ratcliffe drew criticism as an inexperienced but loyal partisan being deployed in an attempt to \u201cneutralize\u201d US spy agencies as an independent and objective voice on global affairs, former intelligence officials warned last Monday, the Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger wrote. \u201cTrump is consolidating his personal control over the intelligence community,\u201d said Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a former CIA intelligence officer. He said the current directors of the CIA and FBI have found their hands tied increasingly when it comes to accurate intelligence assessment, by risk of being fired for something at odds with Trump\u2019s views. \u201cI fear that there is a slow takeover of the norms and procedures of governance by this president, amassing unprecedented executive power,\u201d Mowatt-Larssen, now at Harvard University\u2019s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, added. \u201cTo do that he needs to neutralise or at least silence the intelligence community. He has been doing that for three years, but this takes it to the new level.\u201d Republicans had their doubts and made noises behind the scenes that he would need to show he can move beyond the die-hard conservative persona that has made him a star in the House and on Fox News but less well known among senators who will decide whether to confirm him, the New York Times wrote. Ratcliffe just tweeted. Congressman John Ratcliffe has withdrawn from consideration as Donald Trump\u2019s director of national intelligence. The president just tweeted about it. More on this as it develops. George Conway retweets tweet praising Nikki Haley\u2019s wigging of Trump A journalist just tweeted: \u201cNikki...welcome to the resistance\u201d after the former US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, tweeted back an admonishment this morning to Donald Trump\u2019s sarcastic mocking of his new nemesis, Elijah Cummings, because an intruder tried to break into the Maryland congressman\u2019s home in Baltimore last weekend. And the Vox journo\u2019s tweet was just retweeted by George Conway, the husband of top Trump White House aide Kellyanne Conway. The plot thickens. Donald Trump has signed the massive spending bill negotiated between Nancy Pelosi and Steven Mnuchin and passed by the Senate yesterday in a vote of 67 for and 28 against. The bill lifts the debt ceiling until 2021 and increases spending by $320 billion over two year. A narrow majority of Senate Republicans backed the bill, thanks to lobbying from majority leader Mitch McConnell. Trump had pushed more Republicans to support the legislation after about two-thirds of House Republicans voted against it. In an effort to sway more Republicans, Trump ominously suggested yesterday he may roll back the spending increases sooner rather than later. The White House announced a little while ago that, to use their exact words: \u201cThe President has signed H.R. 3877 \u2013 An Act to amend the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, to establish a congressional budget for fiscal years 2020 and 2021, to temporarily suspend the debt limit, and for other purposes.\u201d California congressman Salud Carbajal just became the 118th House Democrat to call for the official launch of an impeachment inquiry into the conduct of the president, Donald Trump. Still no word from Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who had promised a statement on the issue yesterday, but the pressure is building. As of now, 118 out of 235 House Democrats said they support at least opening an impeachment inquiry, according to an analysis by The Washington Post. Here\u2019s Carbajal adding his weight. As North Korea engages in flurry of fresh missile tests, Donald Trump engages in more flattery of the Asian dictatorship and diplomacy by tweet. The key note of Trump\u2019s latest weird and risky outreach to Kim Jong-un reads thus: \u201cChairman Kim has a great and beautiful vision for his country, and only the United States, with me as President, can make that vision come true.\u201d You can\u2019t make it up. I\u2019d ignore it, but unfortunately it\u2019s too important. Another Republican who won\u2019t stand for re-election? There are rumbles among Washington watchers that yet another Republican member of Congress might announce today that they won\u2019t stand for re-election in 2020. It\u2019s a rumor so far, but, hey, that\u2019s partly what politics live blogs are all about, sometimes, so we\u2019re keeping our eyes and ears open on this. The House\u2019s only black Republican \u2014Representative Will Hurd \u2014 yesterday became the latest GOP lawmaker to say he won\u2019t seek re-election next year, jolting the party\u2019s efforts to appeal to minority voters and wounding its already uphill chances of regaining House control over the Democrats. Hurd\u2019s a moderate Texan. He\u2019s only 41 and appears on the late night comedy shows and everything, so it\u2019s a sore loss for the party if they want to have any pretense of caring about youthful diversity and center-right leanings in their party. Then again, perhaps the desiccated conservative whiteness is the point.... A former CIA officer, Hurd\u2019s clashed with Donald Trump over race and immigration, and used an evening tweet to announce he would not seek re-election next year. That made him the sixth House Republican to announce he\u2019ll quit in just over a week \u2014 and gives Democrats a strong shot to capture a district that borders Mexico and has a majority Hispanic population, the AP writes. The GOP will struggle to win the Latinx vote in 2020, the Guardian reports today. Hurd\u2019s exit put the GOP ahead of its pace when 34 of its members stepped aside before the last elections \u2014 the party\u2019s biggest total since at least 1930. Republicans say they don\u2019t expect this election\u2019s retirements to reach last year\u2019s levels, which is surely small comfort for the party leadership, even the implacable \u201cMoscow Mitch\u201d McConnell. New York attorney general endorses advice to fire cop in Garner case Letitia James, New York state attorney general, just tweeted urging New York City mayor and 2020 wannabe Bill de Blasio and NY Police Department chief James O\u2019Neill to follow through on the department\u2019s oversight recommendation earlier today that police officer Daniel Pantaleo, implicated in the chokehold death of Eric Garner, lose his job. Protesters at the Democratic presidential primary debate on Wednesday night heckled De Blasio, calling for the firing of Pantaleo over the 2014 killing. Protesters against \u201cBig Pharma\u201d gather outside court The hearing today in Boston marks an important stage in one of the key cases among many being brought against opioids manufacturers in something of a year of reckoning in 2019. It pits Massachusetts attorney general Maura Healey, a Democrat, against the maker of the narcotic painkiller OxyContin, Purdue Pharma, some of its senior executives and eight members of the Sackler family that own the company. You can read about the main allegations against the Sacklers in this and other lawsuits, and who they are, here: The Sackler family members, whose philanthropy to major cultural and academic institutions on both sides of the Atlantic, is increasingly unwelcome these days, argue that Healey cherry-picked from hundreds of internal documents in an attempt to vilify them in court. The Massachusetts suit cites former Purdue Pharma president Richard Sackler remarking at the launch party for OxyContin in 1996, that the painkiller\u2019s launch would be \u201cfollowed by a blizzard of prescriptions that will bury the competition.\u201d The family said in court filings Sackler was merely alluding to the fact that he was late for the event because of a blizzard. Superior Court Judge Janet Sanders is expected to decide on Purdue Pharma\u2019s dismissal request later. Massachusetts\u2019 lawsuit is among more than 2,000 by state and local governments pending against Purdue Pharma and other opioid makers. But Massachusetts\u2019 was the first to personally name members of the Sackler family. Many others have since followed suit. The government has characterized the flooding of the American public with powerful painkillers in the last 20+ years as a commercial triumph and public health crisis. Outside the court earlier today, protest organizers said they hope to continue to be a visible and vocal presence at court hearings in Massachusetts and elsewhere. They said they want to make sure any money recovered by local governments is spent directly on substance abuse treatment and recovery support programs and not other uses. Emerald Garner, the daughter of Eric Garner, urges the New York Police Department to follow through with the firing of officer Daniel Pantaleo for the chokehold death of her father in July, 2014. Nikki Haley whacks Trump\u2019s knuckles The former US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, who resigned from the post in 2018, has replied directly (via Twitter, also) to the president\u2019s offensive tweet earlier about congressman Elijah Cummings suffering an intruder at his house in Baltimore last weekend. The tweet speaks for itself. It\u2019s never been clear why Haley quit when she did. It was all public sweetness and light between her and Trump, and she\u2019s not running for president in 2020, so who knows the mind of the former South Carolina governor and highly-rated politician? She was surely, from the president\u2019s point of view, an unwelcome addition to the (ongoing) exodus from the top echelons of the Trump administration. Momentarily refreshing, if a little surprising, but also pathetic to see her choosing this moment to pop up and rap Trump\u2019s knuckles on social media today. NYPD Officer Pantaleo\u2019s days are probably numbered Police officer Daniel Pantaleo has two weeks to respond to the recommendation from the New York Police Department\u2019s oversight arm. But the firing is likely to happen, over the death of Eric Garner during an arrest attempt in 2014, CNN\u2019s Shimon Prokupecz has swiftly reported. Officer Daniel Pantaleo should be fired. That\u2019s the recommendation of the NYPD\u2019s deputy commissioner of trials, Rosemarie Maldonado, issued moments ago in the case of Eric Garner, who was killed by the police in 2014 in a tragedy epitomised by his tragic words in the moments before he died: \u201cI can\u2019t breath.\u201d Here is the Guardian\u2019s story, which will be updated as the story develops. Parents who lost children to fatal opioids overdoses, and other addiction recovery activists are rallying outside a Boston courthouse this morning as a judge hears arguments in Massachusetts\u2019 lawsuit against Purdue Pharma over its role in the prescription painkiller crisis, which in turn fueled a surge in addiction and death relating to heroin and fentanyl. About 100 protesters gathered in front of Suffolk County Superior Court before the start of the hearing, placing poster boards filled with photos of hundreds of overdose victims on the courthouse steps. One bore the words \u201cAlways loved, never forgotten.\u201d Another: \u201cWe march for those who can\u2019t.\u201d A full-size skeleton covered with empty prescription pill bottles was also set up, and many gathered on the court\u2019s brick plaza held up their own large signs with images of their dead loved ones. Cheryl Juaire, a mother from Marlborough, Massachusetts, whose 23-year-old son Corey Merrill died of an overdose in 2011, said activists want to continue to put a spotlight on Purdue Pharma and the wealthy members of the Sackler family that own the company, for their roles in sparking the opioid crisis with the prescription painkiller OxyContin, the AP writes. \u201cThey need to see the families,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to be held accountable for the deaths of our children. We need restitution.\u201d Purdue Pharma is arguing Friday that Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey\u2019s lawsuit should be dismissed because it distorts facts and statements and makes oversimplified claims in order to scapegoat the company. In a statement as the hearing opened, it called Healey\u2019s lawsuit a \u201cmisguided and very political effort to try to place blame on a single manufacturer\u201d for an epidemic that\u2019s now largely driven by illegal heroin and fentanyl. The opioid epidemic has claimed more than 400,000 lives since 1999, but the company has argued it produced only a small fraction of the nation\u2019s opioids about 3% between 2006 and 2012 while lower-priced generic drugs combined to make 90% of the pills. \u201cPurdue Pharma is deeply concerned about the impact the opioid addiction crisis is having on individuals and communities in Massachusetts and across the country,\u201d the company said. \u201cHowever, we strongly believe that litigation is not the answer. It wastes critical resources and time that are urgently needed now in the midst of the crisis.\u201d Healey, a Democrat, accuses the Stamford, Connecticut, company of falsely claiming OxyContin had low risk for addiction. Her office argues that Purdue Pharma pushed prescribers to keep patients on the drugs longer and aggressively targeted vulnerable populations, like the elderly and veterans. It looks as though New York Police Department\u2019s oversight arm is shortly going to recommend that officer Daniel Panteleo, who was involved in the \u201cchokehold\u201d killing of Eric Garner on Staten Island in 2014, should be fired. House Democrats near majority call for impeachment It\u2019s only a psychological milestone, perhaps, but once 118 House Democrats have called for the start of an official impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump, that will represent half the House caucus. As of last night, 117 have made the call, according to a count by CNN, including allies of Speaker Nancy Pelosi as well as other moderares who flipped districts from Republican to Democratic in last November\u2019s midterm elections, as well as the further and far left. But while momentum builds, Pelosi, who often makes a point of seeing the wood for the trees by relying on numbers, is acutely aware that even 50% of the Dem caucus is still only a third of the House. And with Republicans in control of the US Senate, chances of Donald Trump being impeached as far as things stand today is close to zero. The dilemma: make the point, put your marker in the sand and vote to impeach even if the inquiry won\u2019t be approved, or figure that could backfire and concentrate instead on ousting Trump at the ballot box in 2020? So far, Pelosi has walked a middle ground - focusing on a step by step process, homing in on evidence relating to obstruction of justice by the president, here detailed by the Guardian\u2019s Sabrina Siddiqui, during the Trump-Russia investigation by Robert Mueller. Elijah Cummings chases off an intruder No, not Donald Trump intruding on his dignity. Well yes, metaphorically speaking, obviously, the Maryland congressman doesn\u2019t suffer fools. But this involves a person actually trying to get into his home in Baltimore last weekend, before the president decided to launch a barrage of attacks against Cummings and Baltimore, the city in his district. Trump has just tweeted in puerile fashion. Cummings said he scared off an intruder at his Baltimore home last weekend, providing details for the first time, after Trump\u2019s tweet. In a statement Friday, the Maryland Democrat said someone \u201cattempted to gain entry into my residence at approximately 3:40 a.m. on Saturday, July 27.\u201d \u201cI was notified of the intrusion by my security system, and I scared the intruder away by yelling before the person gained entry into the residential portion of the house,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cI thank the Baltimore Police Department for their response and ask that all further inquiries be directed to them.\u201d Cummings\u2019 House oversight and reform committee has been investigating Trump family members serving in the White House, and the Congressman blasted Trump last week in a hearing, over the inhumane conditions that migrants, including babies, are being kept in during federal custody at the US-Mexico border. The break-in came hours before Trump launched a Twitter tirade against Cummings calling his majority-black district a \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.\u201d Baltimore police said it was unknown whether property was taken. Detectives were seeking information on the incident, the AP writes. Donald Trump has slapped more sanctions on Russia in connection with the 2018 poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Britain, a move that a Russian lawmaker said Friday will make it less likely for normalized US-Russian relations. The US president issued an executive order late yesterday that imposes another round of sanctions against Moscow, which has denied wrongdoing in the spy case, the Associated Press writes In March 2018, Sergei Skripal, a former Russian military intelligence officer turned double agent for Britain, and his visiting daughter, Yulia, were found unconscious on a park bench in the genteel southern British town of Salisbury after being exposed to the nerve agent Novichok. They spent weeks in critical condition but recovered. A police officer also was sickened. A few months after the attack on the Skripals, a local man, who found a perfume bottle containing traces of the discarded nerve agent, became severely ill and his girlfriend, Dawn Sturgess, died from the accidental exposure. The poisoning ignited a diplomatic confrontation in which hundreds of envoys were expelled by both Russia and Western nations. \u201cThe introduction of new sanctions against Russia by Washington not only makes the possibility of normalizing Russian-American relations even more hypothetical, they are the latest attack on international relations in general and on strategic stability in the world,\u201d said Frants Klintsevich, a member of the Russian upper house\u2019s defense and security committee, whose views generally reflect the Kremlin\u2019s thinking. Members of Congress have been pressuring the White House to impose additional punitive measures on Moscow. Earlier this week, Representative Eliot Engel, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Representative Mike McCaul, the panel\u2019s ranking Republican, wrote a letter to Trump telling him that he was required by law to impose a second round of sanctions. \u201cWe urge you to take immediate action to hold Russia fully accountable for its blatant use of a chemical weapon in Europe,\u201d they wrote. The US officially pulled out of the Cold War-era Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) agreement with Russia today, saying \u201cRussia is solely responsible for the treaty\u2019s demise.\u201d And the United Nations secretary general warned that the world has lost \u201can invaluable brake on nuclear war\u201d with the expiry of a cold war-era arms control treaty on Friday. The 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty has kept nuclear missiles off European soil for more than three decades, but the US and Russia have failed to agree on how to keep it alive. \u201cThis will likely heighten, not reduce, the threat posed by ballistic missiles,\u201d Ant\u00f3nio Guterres told reporters, adding that he was concerned about rising tensions between nuclear-armed states. Read the Guardian\u2019s report here. Bated breath for Pelosi on impeachment Perhaps we\u2019ll forgive House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the impeachment tease last night, given that she just flew back from Africa after visiting Ghana with her fellow fearless congresswoman, Ilhan Omar. The congressional delegation visit generated some amazing pictures of the two and an undeniably blatant signal of Democratic solidarity between moderate leader Pelosi and firebrand Omar, as a leading light of the progressive wing of the party and a member of the so-called Squad of four left-wing freshmen women/freshwomen/freshpersons in Congress. But still, it\u2019s exasperating. Pelosi refused to answer reporters\u2019 questions on Capitol Hill yesterday afternoon about impeachment, as it became clear that more and more Democratic house members support launching an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. But she said there would be a statement on the matter later. Now why would she flag such a thing if A. she was just going to say, again, the time is not right, the moment is not yet here, our investigations continue, type stuff and B. she wasn\u2019t actually going to put out a statement? Many wise heads (ie most mainstream media Washington political reporters) didn\u2019t think she was going to announce her blessing for an impeachment inquiry, but no-one could quite figure out why she would flag up a future utterance on the topic. Thursday came and went and so we wait. An announcement is expected from law enforcement this morning at 11.30AM in New York City concerning the career of officer Daniel Pantaleo, who was the primary officer named among a group of cops who were involved when Eric Garner died in 2014, calling out \u201cI can\u2019t breath\u201d at intervals as he was choked and taken to the ground. The death, as Garner was being apprehended for selling loose cigarettes on the street, sparked huge protests in New York at the time, and recently, when it was announced that federal prosecutors would not bring charges against Pantaleo, as a result of a decision by Donald Trump\u2019s attorney general, Bill Barr. This morning, two of Garner\u2019s children and civil rights leader Al Sharpton will make statements after they await the verdict from New York Police Department deputy commissioner of trials Rosemarie Maldonado on the career fate of Pantaleo. The Democratic Party presidential primary debate on Wednesday night, in Detroit, was interrupted by protesters shouting for Pantaleo to be fired, the Guardian\u2019s Oliver Laughland wrote at the time. Their ire interrupted Cory Booker\u2019s opening address, ironically, but it was directed at New York city mayor and 2020 presidential small-to-no-hoper Bill de Blasio. Julian Castro was the first candidate to bring the case up arguing \u201cthat police officer should be off the streets\u201d. Then Kirsten Gillibrand said emphatically, to a large cheer from the crowd, of Pantaleo: \u201cHe should be fired. He should be fired right now.\u201d After the NYPD oversight branch announces its verdict today, Pantaleo has two weeks to respond. Police commissioner James O\u2019Neill has the final say. \u201cOnly matter of time\u201d before House ignites impeachment New York congressman Eliot Engel believes it\u2019s only a matter of time before the House of Representatives launches a formal impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump. Engel chairs the powerful House foreign affairs committee and came out in favor of impeachment earlier this week, along with a flood of other House Democrats, such as moderate freshman Jennifer Wexman, who flipped a vital seat in Virginia at the midterm elections last November. Engel said that he doesn\u2019t see Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s reluctance to move forward with removal proceedings as insurmountable. \u201cThat\u2019ll change,\u201d Engel said during an interview with the New York Daily News. \u201cI think more and more members are going to decide that the role of Congress right now, the proper role, is impeachment.\u201d Pelosi\u2019s consent is ultimately mandatory for the House to initiate a formal impeachment inquiry. The plethora of incidences of serious presidential wrongdoing brought out by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report of his Trump-Russia investigation, backed up by his testimony on Capitol Hill last month, would be the first line of attack. The president\u2019s repeated displays of naked racism, and a giant, and building, stack of allegations of sexual impropriety against Trump will put gasoline on any impeachment fire regardless of which party you vote for and what you think of Trump\u2019s policies on trade, the environment and human rights. Trump and China up ante in trade war while US jobs figures released For all the developments on these two vital topics this morning, as well as their effect on the markets, I\u2019d like to direct you to our business live blog helmed from the Guardian\u2019s worldwide HQ in London. Opening of the US markets nervously awaited. Good morning, another busy day in store in US politics so plug into our live blog for all the action. Close observers of Nancy Pelosi and the big impeachment debate are blue in the face this morning waiting to see if/when the speaker of the House is going to make a statement with her latest view on launching an impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump. She told reporters on Capitol Hill yesterday to expect a statement the same day. It never came. Right now, an important hearing kicks off in court in Massachusetts, where state attorney general Maura Healey is suing OxyContin manufacturer Purdue Pharma, senior executives and the members of the Sackler family that own the prescription painkiller company. Healey blames them for precipitating the US opioids crisis and today a judge will hear the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the groundbreaking case. The crisis came up in the Democratic debates this week. The death of Eric Garner five years ago at the hands of the New York police department was also invoked at the debate this week. We have sharp eyes out for city mayor and 2020 candidate Bill de Blasio today when the fate of the officer who put Garner in a fatal and proscribed chokehold, Daniel Pantaleo, could be announced. The Department of Justice last month declined to bring charges against him.",

      "bodyText": "The enormous backlog of National Disability Insurance Scheme applications that forced the Morrison government to adopt interim plans for children will be cleared by the end of the year, the agency has said. Disability advocates welcomed an intervention from the new minister, Stuart Robert, in June to offer standardised $10,000 plans for children who would otherwise be waiting longer than 50 days but warned the measure should only be a stop-gap. Vicki Rundle, the National Disability Insurance Agency acting chief executive, told Guardian Australia the plan was only \u201ctemporary\u201d and the scheme should be running as normal with specialised plans for participants \u201cno later\u201d than year\u2019s end. \u201cWe know that by the end of December, we should \u2026 have that interim measure well and truly completed,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll have a lot of the backlog improved by the end of September, or early October \u2026 Now we\u2019ll have to watch and see how we go but that\u2019s the intention.\u201d Waiting times have been among the biggest gripes people have about the scheme, which now covers 300,000 participants, including more than 11,000 children aged 0 to six. The average delay has been more than 100 days. In an interview, Rundle also defended the agency\u2019s decision to refuse to fund sex worker services for people with disabilities, which the government has said would not meet \u201ccommunity expectations\u201d. The agency has been criticised by disability advocates for appealing to the federal court after the administrative appeals tribunal ruled a woman in her 40s was entitled to NDIS funding for sex therapy. \u201cWe\u2019ve been really clear that we don\u2019t fund sexual worker and sexual support services in the way that I believe the community understands it at least,\u201d Rundle said. \u201cWe do provide support for our participants in a more general sense to support them with the way that they live and their lifestyle, but we don\u2019t fund that.\u201d She suggested that the scheme would fund support workers to help people access sex worker services, but not the services themselves. \u201cIf I could use an analogy, and maybe it\u2019s a poor one... we\u2019ll fund a person to help take a support worker to take them to the movies, but we won\u2019t fund their movie tickets,\u201d Rundle said. Asked if the government had influenced the agency\u2019s decision, Rundle said: \u201cNo, that\u2019s an agency position. That\u2019s a position we should take and have taken, not the government.\u201d Rundle made the comments in the same week the agency released new data that included what it called one of Australia\u2019s largest-ever surveys of people with disability, their families and carers. Among parents, 91% said the scheme had helped their young child develop, while 80% said their children could now \u201ctell them what they want\u201d. The survey also found an increase in employment hours among parents and carers of children on the scheme. Satisfaction among older participants appeared to be more mixed. There were 70% of people adults 25 and older who said the scheme helped them have more choice and control in their lives. Similarly, 38% of those between 15-24 had taken part in community activities, up from 31 when they entered the scheme. But while 71% of those 25 and older said the scheme had helped them with daily activities, only about one in three noticed a difference in the home, dropping to 20% for work. And for participants aged 15-24, less than half (42%) said the scheme had improved their health and wellbeing. Sarah Johnson, the scheme\u2019s actuary, said some indicators would take longer to improve than others and that the scheme had less influence over a person\u2019s health and wellbeing, compared to their daily activities or sense of choice and control. Increasing attention has also been paid to potential inequities within the scheme, following research from University of NSW\u2019s Centre for Social Impact. Asked about the fact that only 37% of participants are women, Johnson said the discrepancy was due to the main disabilities in the scheme. \u201cThe main disabilities that we have in the scheme are autism, and developmental delay, and the ratio of males to females in those particular disabilities [are] about three-and-a-half to one,\u201d she said. Rundle also said the way the scheme had been phased was responsible for low numbers of Indigenous participants, noting that parts of WA, north Queensland and the NT had entered the scheme more recently. The release of the NDIS data followed repeated calls from experts, who say it is vital to enable research of the scheme and disabilities. Some researchers this week said data released by the agency was insufficient because it mostly presented the findings through aggregated reports, rather than data that could be analysed.",
