The government in Jakarta maintains Papua and West Papua are integral and indivisible parts of the state of Indonesia: this position has the support of major powers in the region and around the world. Known as Irian Jaya until 2000, it was split into two provinces, Papua and West Papua, in 2003. They have semi-autonomous status. The provinces have suffered from systemic underdevelopment but they are rich with natural resources, including gold, copper, and timber and generate billions of dollars for Indonesia.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is independence a big issue?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Political control of the region has been contested for more than half a century and Indonesia has consistently been accused of human rights violations and violent suppression of the region\u2019s independence movement. The people indigenous to the province are Melanesian, ethnically distinct from most of the rest of Indonesia and more closely linked to the people of Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji and New Caledonia.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So how did it become part of Indonesia?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Formerly the Netherlands New Guinea, Papua was retained by the Dutch after Indonesian independence in 1945 but the province was annexed by Jakarta in 1963. Indonesia formalised its control over West Papua in 1969 when its military hand-picked 1,025 of West Papua\u2019s population and compelled them into publicly voting in favour of the takeover under a UN-supervised, but undemocratic, process known as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/29/west-papua-independence-history\">Act of Free Choice</a>. The British and Foreign Commonwealth Office reported at the time \u201cthe process of consultation did not allow a genuinely free choice to be made\u201d, while the US embassy reported it was \u201cunfolding like a Greek tragedy, the conclusion pre-ordained\u201d.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How much support does the independence movement have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Many Papuans regard the Indonesian takeover as an illegal annexation. In 2017, an illegal petition calling for a free vote on independence, signed by 1.8 million people (about 70% of the Papuan population) and secretly carried around the provinces, was presented to the UN\u2019s decolonisation committee, and the human rights commissioner.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there an armed struggle?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Free Papua Movement has led a low-level insurgency for decades. That insurgency has long been the rationale for significant Indonesian military involvement in Papua. With the heightened police and military presence, there have been reports of security force abuses including extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary detention, excessive use of force and mistreatment of peaceful protesters. Dozens of Papuans remain behind bars for peaceful demonstration or expressing solidarity with the independence movement. West Papuan sources have claimed white phosphorous, a banned chemical weapon, has been used to attack civilians, though this has not been categorically proven. This claim has been strenuously denied by Indonesia.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there any outside support for independence?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has always been concern about the annexation of the region. A <a href=\"https://www.law.yale.edu/system/files/documents/pdf/Intellectual_Life/West_Papua_final_report.pdf\">report in 2004 by the International Human Rights Clinic at Yale Law School</a> said Indonesian military leaders \u201cbegan making public threats against Papuan leaders \u2026 vowing to shoot them on the spot if they did not vote for Indonesian control\u201d. In May 2019, the then UK government\u2019s minister for Asia and the Pacific, Mark Field, described the Act of Free Choice as an \u201cutterly flawed process\u201d, but said there was no appetite in the international community to revisit the question of the legitimacy of Indonesia\u2019s control. The Free West Papua movement has strong support from Melanesian neighbours, in particular Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands, but regional powers, such as Australia, support Indonesian control of the province.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Indonesian-controlled Papua and West Papua form the western half of the island of New Guinea.

      "bodyText": "Human rights violations and political independence in West Papua are set to command debate at this week\u2019s Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), where Papuan independence leader Benny Wenda will urge government leaders to support the \u201cFree Papua\u201d campaign amid recent escalating political violence. Exiled from Papua, but now an official representative attached to the Vanuatu government\u2019s delegation, Wenda is campaigning for a United Nations general assembly resolution next year that will re-examine the controversial 1969 Act of Free Choice vote that formalised Indonesian control of the province. Wenda told the Guardian the human rights abuses and civil repressions that currently blight the province are a \u201ccancer inside the heart of the people of the Pacific\u201d, but that major powers in the region choose to ignore it for geo-strategic and economic regions. Indonesia \u2013 not a member of the Pacific Islands Forum, but a \u201cdialogue partner\u201d attending this week\u2019s forum \u2013 regards West Papua as an integral and indivisible part of the Indonesian state. Indonesian-controlled Papua and West Papua form the western half of the island of New Guinea. Political control of the region has been contested for more than half a century and Indonesia has consistently been accused of human rights violations and violent suppression of the region\u2019s independence movement. West Papuan sources say violence in the region is worsening, protesters have been beaten and jailed, and there have been claims white phosphorous, a banned chemical weapon, has been used to attack civilians.

No other country, organisation or individual has the right to interfere in them. We firmly oppose the intervention of Indonesia\u2019s internal affairs in whatever form.\u201d The West Papuan delegation was expected to arrive for the forum at the weekend, but were unable to board flights to Tuvalu from Fiji. On Sunday, Enele Sopoaga the prime minister of Tuvalu, and Dame Meg Taylor, secretary general of the PIF, said they had no idea what had happened. It appears the problem was an administrative one on the part of the Vanuatu government, with whom the west Papuan delegation were meant to be travelling. At a meeting of the region\u2019s foreign ministers last month, Vanuatu successfully pushed to have the issue of West Papua formally included on the Pacific Islands Forum agenda, over the vociferous objections of Australia. Wenda said while the Pacific\u2019s regional powers, Australia and New Zealand, are vocal critics of rights abuses around the world \u201cthey never talk about West Papua\u201d. \u201cWe are human beings who want to live in peace, but we are discriminated against because others want to depopulate our place and take our resources. \u201cAustralia has a big responsibility in the region. Australia needs to look at this as their own issue, as a regional issue, because it will never go away in the eyes of the people. This issue is like cancer inside the heart of the people of the Pacific.\u201d Wenda said the United Liberation Movement for West Papua (ULMWP) he leads ultimately seeks a free and fair vote on secession from Indonesia. \u201cWe have never exercised our right to self-determination, that has been denied us. We are not seeking violence, we seek our rights peacefully, to decide for ourselves our future. Let us vote,\u201d Wenda said. Last year\u2019s Pacific Islands Forum communique stated: \u201cLeaders recognised the constructive engagement by Forum countries with Indonesia with respect to elections and human rights in West Papua.\u201d Wenda is seeking a similar, if not stronger, united commitment from the Pacific bloc this year, ahead of a campaign to have the UN pass a resolution next year mandating the re-examination of the UN-supervised Act of Free Choice. Along with climate change, the issue of West Papua is likely to set Australia in opposition to its Pacific island neighbours at this week\u2019s forum. Australia is strongly supportive of Indonesian sovereignty over Papua, while the independence movement has widespread support among Pacific island nations - particularly Melanesian neighbours Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands - where it is seen as a continuation of the decades-long decolonisation movement across the region. A spokesman for Australia\u2019s foreign affairs department said: \u201cAustralia recognises Indonesia\u2019s sovereignty over the Papua provinces, as stated in the Lombok Treaty of 2006. Australia will not support efforts that undermine Indonesian sovereignty over Papua in any forum and will not associate itself with any PIF communique to that effect.\u201d The spokesman said Australia regularly raised human rights concerns with Indonesian authorities, including regarding the Papua provinces. The Indonesian government spokesman said discussion of West Papua at the forum this week would create a \u201cnegative precedent to openly discuss the domestic affairs of other countries\u2026 we believe no countries will accept that\u201d. The spokesman said Papua had self-governance rights through its special autonomy status and democratically elected leaders that participated in Indonesian political system. \u201cIn the 2019 elections, the turn out in the province of Papua and West Papua was 88% \u2026 94% of the vote was in favour of president Jokowi\u2019s administration.

But I do need it because I am a queen and I deserve a rest. I\u2019m of the \u201cliving your best life\u201d mantra and I don\u2019t just talk it, I walk it. I\u2019ll have a long spa day \u2013 massage, mani, pedi, eyebrows \u2013 go for the sexiest dinner in this nice hotel on the bridge with all my girls, then get cocktails. I\u2019m single, but I\u2019m like Lady Gaga \u2013 she doesn\u2019t sleep with guys when she\u2019s writing her album because men steal her creative energy. But on my day off, I\u2019m allowed. London Hughes: To Catch a Dick is at Pleasance Courtyard every day until 25 August (apart from the 12th) \u2018Watching YouTube and making soup\u2019 \u2013 Alison Spittle I\u2019m doing an extra gig for Sarah Millican\u2019s podcast, Standard Issue Stands Up, on my day off. I\u2019m excited but it means this is the first year I won\u2019t have a full duvet day, watching programmes with no artistic merit. In Edinburgh, I\u2019ve found what helps my mental health is being able to cook for myself. I love making soup, so I\u2019ll make a big pot. There\u2019s this old recipe my mum used \u2013 grating a carrot, opening a tin of tomatoes and a stock cube, using whatever veg is decomposing at the bottom of the fridge, and throwing some salt and pepper on it. My version of mindfulness is watching YouTube and making soup. Alison Spittle: Mother of God is at Gilded Balloon Teviot until 26 August (not 13) \u2018We\u2019ll be hanging out at the kids\u2019 shows\u2019 \u2013 Ed Byrne Previously I\u2019ve taken the night off and gone into the Highlands. I love hill-walking and have committed to bagging all of Scotland\u2019s 282 Monros. I\u2019ve done 105 so far and always try and knock off a few more during the fringe. But my kids are going to be here this year, so I think it would be really bad form if I went: \u201cWell, I\u2019m pissing off to the Highlands!\u201d We\u2019ll be hanging out during the day seeing various kids\u2019 shows, then I\u2019ll be getting a babysitter and me and my wife will go out for a fancy-schmancy dinner. Ed Byrne: If I\u2019m Honest is at the Assembly Rooms until 25 August (not 12) \u2018I want to watch fireworks\u2019 \u2013 Yuriko Kotani I\u2019m going to enjoy the day off in an organic way. In Edinburgh there are so many people \u2013 maybe you bump into them and say: \u201cLet\u2019s have a coffee.\u201d But I don\u2019t know what kind of state I\u2019ll be in, so I\u2019ll listen to my body.

Officers uncovered the drugs with a street value of more than NZ$3m last week on Bethells Beach. A year ago Australian Border Force and defence patrols were sent to intercept an inflatable boat off the northern New South Wales coast heading towards the mainland. Australian authorities arrested the two occupants after they were spotted offloading the cocaine into the sea. The majority of the cocaine was recovered. Some was found along parts of the eastern coastline of Australia, from northern Queensland down to NSW. \u201cThe product found on Bethells Beach appears to have been part of this same shipment and has drifted here over the last year, as the markings and packaging of the drugs is consistent with that seized in Australia,\u201d NZ police said in a statement. A police chopper has carried out a search of the area but didn\u2019t find further packages. \u201cThere remains a small possibility of further packages turning up, and we would reiterate the importance of contacting police if you discover any suspicious or concerning items,\u201d NZ police said. A recent Guardian Australia investigation found Australia and New Zealand\u2019s appetite for cocaine is having devastating effects in the impoverished Pacific Islands region, with domestic markets opening up for the drugs in Fiji, Samoa and Tonga, and locals suffering related issues of addiction, corruption and violence. Hundreds of kilograms of cocaine have washed up on remote Pacific beaches, ships laden with drugs have run aground on far-flung coral reefs, and locals have discovered huge caches of drugs stored in underwater nets attached to GPS beacons.",

This would keep the Good Friday agreement intact.</p>\n    <p>Both the UK and EU signed up to the basic idea in December 2017 as part of the initial Brexit deal, but there have been disagreements since on how it would work.</p>\n    <p>The DUP have objected to it, as it potentially treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK, creating a customs divide in the Irish Sea, which is anathema to the unionist party.</p>\n    <p>Hardline Tory Eurosceptics also object to it, as they perceive it to be a trap that could potentially lock the UK into the EU\u2019s customs union permanently if the UK &amp; EU cannot seal a free trade agreement. That would prevent the UK from doing its own free trade deals with nations outside the bloc.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was added to May\u2019s withdrawal agreement?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Joint interpretative instrument&nbsp;</b><br></p>\n    <p>A legal add-on to the withdrawal agreement was given to Theresa May in January 2019 to try to get her deal through the UK parliament. It gives legal force to a letter from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, the presidents of the commission and council. This stated the EU\u2019s intention to negotiate an alternative to the backstop so it would not be triggered, or, if it was triggered, to get out of it as quickly as possible.</p>\n    <p><b>Unilateral statement from the UK&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>This set out the British position that, if the backstop were to become permanent and talks on an alternative were going nowhere, the UK believes it would be able to exit the arrangement.</p>\n    <p><b>Additional language in political declaration&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>This emphasises the urgency felt on both sides to negotiate an alternative to the backstop, and flesh out what a technological fix would look like. However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/12/brexit-mps-vote-theresa-may-backstop-deal-jeremy-corbyn-politics-live?page=with:block-5c8793aee4b016d23425a23e#block-5c8793aee4b016d23425a23e\">it failed to persuade the attorney general</a>, Geoffrey Cox, who said that while it \u2018reduces the risk\u2019 of the UK being trapped in a backstop indefinitely, it does not remove it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/15/hunt-and-johnson-the-backstop-is-dead-and-cant-be-in-any-eu-deal\">declared the Northern Ireland backstop \u2018dead\u2019</a> during his leadership campaign, and promised to throw it out of any deal he renegotiated with the EU. The EU has repeatedly stated that it will not reopen the withdrawal agreement for renegotiation.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Daniel Boffey, Martin Belam&nbsp;</b>and<b>&nbsp;Peter Walker&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The report said that while a majority of MPs appeared to oppose no deal, they would \u201cneed new tactics\u201d to actually block it, given the lack of Brexit-related legislation on to which to tack amendments or new motions, unlike when Theresa May was seeking to pass her deal.</p> \n<p>Simply passing motions opposing no deal would not be enough, the report argued, as Johnson\u2019s government has indicated it will not be bound by these. Amending primary legislation would carry more weight, but this would depend on bills being brought to the Commons, which might not happen. </p> \n<p>Even what the report called the \u201cnuclear option\u201d of a no-confidence vote against Johnson\u2019s government might not block no deal, the report said, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/07/could-the-queen-sack-boris-johnson-the-experts-are-divided\">as Johnson could sit out the 14-day period dictated if he lost such a vote</a>, even if a new government seemed viable.</p> \n<p>The report said that if an election was called, given a five-week campaign period and a possible week needed to finish parliamentary business before dissolution, it would be very tight to arrange before 31 October.</p> \n<p>Such a timetable \u201cwould raise big questions for the civil service\u201d, the report added. \u201cAlthough it could continue to prepare for no deal, as it would be seen as being \u2018in the national interest\u2019, it would be restricted in how it communicated about it. It would also make it a more challenging choice for businesses considering investing in no-deal preparations as they may want to await the outcome of the election.\u201d</p>",

In a report on the likely lead-up to the UK\u2019s departure, the Institute for Government said that MPs merely expressing opposition to no deal would not necessarily be sufficient and that there were limited parliamentary manoeuvres open to them to force the issue. With the exit date now less than 12 weeks away, should the government reach a new accord with the EU there would only be a slim parliamentary window in which to pass the necessary legislation. Even bringing down the government would be unlikely to see an election take place in time. \u201cMPs looking to force the government into a change of approach face a huge challenge when parliament returns,\u201d said Joe Owen, the Brexit programme director for the institute. \u201cEven if they can assemble a majority for something, they may find few opportunities to make their move \u2013 and time is running out.\u201d The thinktank\u2019s report \u2013 titled Voting on Brexit: Parliament\u2019s Role before 31 October \u2013 noted that more than three years on from the referendum, the UK\u2019s options remained the same: leaving with a deal; leaving without a deal; seeking an extension; or revoking article 50. But while no-deal Brexit would happen by default, and the government has said it does not need to pass any more primary legislation before 31 October for it to happen, a new deal would require Boris Johnson\u2019s government to seal this with the EU over the summer and begin parliamentary work after the Commons recess in September. Even if this happens \u2013 and Johnson is currently declining any new talks with the EU without a commitment from Brussels to ditch the Irish backstop border insurance policy \u2013 the current Commons schedule would leave just 22 sitting days to pass the new withdrawal deal. The report said that while a majority of MPs appeared to oppose no deal, they would \u201cneed new tactics\u201d to actually block it, given the lack of Brexit-related legislation on to which to tack amendments or new motions, unlike when Theresa May was seeking to pass her deal. Simply passing motions opposing no deal would not be enough, the report argued, as Johnson\u2019s government has indicated it will not be bound by these. Amending primary legislation would carry more weight, but this would depend on bills being brought to the Commons, which might not happen. Even what the report called the \u201cnuclear option\u201d of a no-confidence vote against Johnson\u2019s government might not block no deal, the report said, as Johnson could sit out the 14-day period dictated if he lost such a vote, even if a new government seemed viable. The report said that if an election was called, given a five-week campaign period and a possible week needed to finish parliamentary business before dissolution, it would be very tight to arrange before 31 October. Such a timetable \u201cwould raise big questions for the civil service\u201d, the report added. \u201cAlthough it could continue to prepare for no deal, as it would be seen as being \u2018in the national interest\u2019, it would be restricted in how it communicated about it. It would also make it a more challenging choice for businesses considering investing in no-deal preparations as they may want to await the outcome of the election.\u201d",

Under such shoots, beaters drive the birds towards the shooters in an organised way. With a four-month season starting from the \u201cglorious 12th\u201d of August, it is a highly managed commercial process. The announcement of the Labour review, made by the shadow environment secretary, Sue Hayman, notes that grouse moors cover an area equivalent to Greater London. Preparing this land for shooting involves draining and drying the area, which can destroy wildlife and plants, as well as affecting peat moors that would absorb carbon dioxide emissions. The process can involve burning moors, also increasing emissions. The RSPB charity notes that while the grouse industry brings work and livelihoods to some rural communities, it can also involve the illegal culling of mountain hares and birds of prey such as hen harriers. Despite these concerns, Labour said, the 10 largest English grouse moors are paid more than \u00a33m a year in farming subsidies. Hayman said: \u201cThe costs of grouse shooting on our environment and wildlife needs to be properly weighed up against the benefit of land owners profiting from shooting parties. \u201cFor too long the Tories have bent the knee to land owners and it\u2019s our environment and our people who pay the price. \u201cThere are viable alternatives to grouse shooting such as simulated shooting and wildlife tourism.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has set out a resoundingly tough stance on law and order ahead of a possible autumn general election, with a trio of announcements on extending jail terms, building new prisons and increasing police stop-and-search powers. Eschewing the more liberal approach to criminal justice briefly tried when Michael Gove was justice secretary, and prompting Labour criticism about choosing posturing over substance, Johnson said punishments \u201cmust truly fit the crime\u201d. The new policies, following on from a plan for 20,000 extra police officers, were unveiled in a series of supportive newspapers, with accompanying opinion pieces from Johnson and Priti Patel, the home secretary. On sentencing, Johnson announced a review of the policy of allowing some prisoners with a fixed sentence to be released on licence mid-way through their term on condition of continued good behaviour. The review will also look at potentially longer sentences for violent and sexual offences, and for repeat offenders, and includes \u00a385m in extra funding for the Crown Prosecution Service. \u201cDangerous criminals must be kept off our streets, serving the sentences they deserve \u2013 victims want to see it, the public want to see it and I want to see it. To ensure confidence in the system, the punishment must truly fit the crime,\u201d Johnson said. In another arguably populist pre-election move, Johnson and Patel announced that police would be freer to carry out preventive stop-and-search operations under so-called section 60 powers. Stop and search is a controversial tactic and its efficacy on a large scale is in doubt. A Home Office study of its increased use in London when Johnson was mayor found no evidence it had contributed to reducing crime levels. One of Theresa May\u2019s flagship policies as home secretary was to make police use stop and search more selectively in light of statistics showing black people were seven times more likely to be stopped by police than white people, with only about one in 10 of those stops leading to an arrest. But speaking on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show, Kit Malthouse, the police minister and a long-time ally of Johnson, said ministers were aware of the sensitivities, arguing that the rollout of body-worn cameras to police would help minimise the chances of the powers being abused. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely the case that we have to work very closely with all communities across the country to make sure that stop-and-search is done in a professional and sensitive way,\u201d he said. \u201cThings have changed. The vast majority of uniformed officers now wear a body camera, so the interaction between them and the person who is being searched can be filmed, which will lead to a professionalisation, and in fact a better reaction from the person being searched as well.\u201d Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said extending stop-and-search powers was \u201ca tried and tested recipe for unrest, not violence reduction\u201d. She said: \u201cThis draconian approach shows that Boris Johnson\u2019s government has no real plans to invest in policing or a public health approach to tackling violent crime. They have opted to appear tough instead of dealing with the root causes of crime. \u201cEvidence-based stop and search will always be a vital tool in preventing crime. But random stops have only poisoned police community relations.\u201d The new prisons announcement, for England and Wales, will see a new prison built alongside HMP Full Sutton in Yorkshire, as well as refurbishment and maintenance work to create more prison places. The additional 10,000 prisoner places will be on top of new prisons already announced, at Wellingborough in Northamptonshire and Glen Parva in Leicestershire, which the Ministry of Justice said would provide 3,360 spaces by 2023. The announcements will boost speculation that the government is wheeling out a series of voter-friendly policies in anticipation of an autumn election prompted by divisions on Brexit, whether pushed for by Johnson or forced by a vote of no confidence in the Commons.

      "body": "<p>So here was a denouement we had been expecting for a long time. It was wrapped up in an episode that managed to have a few interesting twists and turns but was, in some ways, a teeny bit muddled. In the most predictable plot development since Sir Evil George turning out to still be extremely evil, Ned found himself in prison and on trial for treason. This was always going to happen and it has been, in many ways, a very long and painful time coming. Now there are two questions to take us up to the end of this series. One, if Ned goes down, then how can Ross not go down with him? And, two, if Ned doesn\u2019t go down, then can Sir Evil George still triumph in some way against Ross?</p> \n<p>This episode still had plenty of old-school Poldark joy to offer (Christmas scenes, the children heading into Mrs Carne\u2019s school, John Conan\u2019s grandmother being a grumpy old battleaxe). But it also had a few missteps. Is my timing off or are we supposed to have completely forgotten that Kitty was pregnant and might have had a miscarriage? Or could she still be pregnant? Meanwhile, the slavery debate became complicated with the transformation of Sir Evil George into some kind of pro-slavery campaigner. (Good luck with that, George!) At the same time we seemed to veer very quickly away from Honduras and slavery into proclamations that \u201cthe King is mad\u201d. Plus, the Irish question was also randomly thrown in for good measure. Some sleight of hand and a little simplicity might have rendered this all a bit easier to swallow. But never mind. \u2019T\u2019is still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/poldark--episode-by-episode\">Poldark</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c6a5e749a0e0404ca1749aa4c9c21806ce7f2ab\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c6a5e749a0e0404ca1749aa4c9c21806ce7f2ab/0_132_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"What\u2019s happening, Morwenna?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">What\u2019s happening, Morwenna?</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hogan/BBC/Mammoth Screen</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The subplot about the forging of the magic money paper was entertaining and a good way for Demelza to reassert her authority over Tess without risking too much. \u201cWhy would a body do such a thing?\u201d Well, if a body was sacked by Demelza, a body might be very angry and vengeful. That t\u2019is why. (\u201cI\u2019ve saved you a hanging, missy,\u201d was the basic conclusion; I paraphrase.) The scenes bridging the gap between \u201cthe action in London\u201d and \u201cthe action in Cornwall\u201d were very nicely balanced here. Including the heart-wrenching will-they-won\u2019t-they business over the potential kidnapping of four-year-old velvet-clad fencing enthusiast John Conan, which was handled brilliantly. (More effusive praise and the awarding of the pewter tankard below.)</p> \n<p>Back in London, though, and true to form, Ned was turning out to be a most annoyingly ineffectual and indiscreet revolutionary, resplendent in full Bob Geldof Live Aid mode. Obviously I agree with Ned\u2019s anti-slavery views as t\u2019is only right and proper. But I would seriously not like to get stuck next to him at a dinner party. To be fair on Ned, #TeamSlavery are a miserable bunch with very poor taste in house pets. The falcon (is it a falcon?) is gaining an ever-more prominent role and has started squawking menacingly. If Horace the Pug finds out about this usurper, he\u2019s going to be livid.</p> \n<p>In the next drawing room along, Geoffrey Charles made his eventual ill-fated proposal. Sir Evil George added insult to injury by wilfully throwing Elizabeth\u2019s child under the bus and agreeing to marriage with Cecily just to spite Geoffrey Charles. I decided to withdraw my previously sympathetic comments about Sir Evil George long before his speech entitled: \u201cLet Me Commend To You the Mahogany Trade.\u201d Although it was completely hilarious that he thought he could give the most racist speech in the history of racist speeches and still ask afterwards: \u201cBut why is everyone saying that I am a racist?\u201d (I make no comment about echoes with the present day.) Well, I suppose there was no better character to espouse the bonkers \u201clogic\u201d of racism. \u201cI am viewed as a friend of heartless slave-owners.\u201d Could that possibly be because you are the friend of heartless slave-owners, Sir Evil George? Put him back in the water-boarding bath with the leeches.</p> \n<p>Luckily, Cecily had some morals and was able to leak the letter telling the truth about the wildly uncommendable nature of the mahogany trade. And she knows that the only way to fix any of this is to \u201cdrive a wedge between my father and Sir (Evil) George. With a little more charm, she is a Sindy Doll in the making. Meanwhile, Sindy Doll herself reminded us of how brilliant she is at diplomacy. Thank heavens for real friends who know where they need to be at the right time. During the search of Ross\u2019s house, Sindy Doll was truly using her poshness to the best effect. \u201cYou were magnificent!\u201d \u201cYes, I was.\u201d But you always are, Sindy Doll, you always are!</p> \n<h2>Pewter tankard award for bonkers brilliance as supporting actor</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00f82546b589cf4ce35257e32f8ea923e84ae6b3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00f82546b589cf4ce35257e32f8ea923e84ae6b3/0_0_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drake Carne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Drake Carne.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hogan/BBC/Mammoth Screen</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The relationship between Drake (Harry Richardson) and Morwenna (Ellise Chappell) has very occasionally been trying, as long-term viewers will recall. (I think the word \u201csimpering\u201d may have been used in the below-the-line comments.) However, I think over time these two have truly earned our respect and the scenes in this episode were beautifully done, from Drake\u2019s desperation to do the right thing and his anguish that this always seems beyond him, to Morwenna\u2019s sadness at leaving her child and her eventual stoic acceptance of reality. As I\u2019ve mentioned in regard to other pairings in this series, the chemistry between these two actors is perfect. They\u2019ve managed to turn something that could be cloying and irritating into a poignant and believable relationship. I, for one, am ready to donate the contents of my purse to Mrs Carne\u2019s School for Learnin\u2019. Coins only, obviously. (Side note: was it my imagination or did they keep changing the child actor for John Conan? What happened there and why did they think we wouldn\u2019t notice?)</p> \n<h2>Classic Poldark lines</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p>\u201cWhy do you not go to London, mama?\u201d \u201cBecause if I did, who would see to Cornwall?\u201d Rightly said, Demelza.</p></li> \n <li><p>\u201cDo we not know a man with the needful skillage?\u201d An expression which surely deserves more frequent outings.</p></li> \n <li><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that, Ladyship.\u201d Drake rediscovers the inner strength he had during the toad-finding days.

      "bodyText": "So here was a denouement we had been expecting for a long time. It was wrapped up in an episode that managed to have a few interesting twists and turns but was, in some ways, a teeny bit muddled. In the most predictable plot development since Sir Evil George turning out to still be extremely evil, Ned found himself in prison and on trial for treason. This was always going to happen and it has been, in many ways, a very long and painful time coming. Now there are two questions to take us up to the end of this series. One, if Ned goes down, then how can Ross not go down with him? And, two, if Ned doesn\u2019t go down, then can Sir Evil George still triumph in some way against Ross? This episode still had plenty of old-school Poldark joy to offer (Christmas scenes, the children heading into Mrs Carne\u2019s school, John Conan\u2019s grandmother being a grumpy old battleaxe). But it also had a few missteps. Is my timing off or are we supposed to have completely forgotten that Kitty was pregnant and might have had a miscarriage? Or could she still be pregnant? Meanwhile, the slavery debate became complicated with the transformation of Sir Evil George into some kind of pro-slavery campaigner. (Good luck with that, George!) At the same time we seemed to veer very quickly away from Honduras and slavery into proclamations that \u201cthe King is mad\u201d. Plus, the Irish question was also randomly thrown in for good measure. Some sleight of hand and a little simplicity might have rendered this all a bit easier to swallow. But never mind. \u2019T\u2019is still Poldark. The subplot about the forging of the magic money paper was entertaining and a good way for Demelza to reassert her authority over Tess without risking too much. \u201cWhy would a body do such a thing?\u201d Well, if a body was sacked by Demelza, a body might be very angry and vengeful. That t\u2019is why. (\u201cI\u2019ve saved you a hanging, missy,\u201d was the basic conclusion; I paraphrase.) The scenes bridging the gap between \u201cthe action in London\u201d and \u201cthe action in Cornwall\u201d were very nicely balanced here. Including the heart-wrenching will-they-won\u2019t-they business over the potential kidnapping of four-year-old velvet-clad fencing enthusiast John Conan, which was handled brilliantly. (More effusive praise and the awarding of the pewter tankard below.) Back in London, though, and true to form, Ned was turning out to be a most annoyingly ineffectual and indiscreet revolutionary, resplendent in full Bob Geldof Live Aid mode. Obviously I agree with Ned\u2019s anti-slavery views as t\u2019is only right and proper. But I would seriously not like to get stuck next to him at a dinner party. To be fair on Ned, #TeamSlavery are a miserable bunch with very poor taste in house pets. The falcon (is it a falcon?) is gaining an ever-more prominent role and has started squawking menacingly. If Horace the Pug finds out about this usurper, he\u2019s going to be livid. In the next drawing room along, Geoffrey Charles made his eventual ill-fated proposal. Sir Evil George added insult to injury by wilfully throwing Elizabeth\u2019s child under the bus and agreeing to marriage with Cecily just to spite Geoffrey Charles. I decided to withdraw my previously sympathetic comments about Sir Evil George long before his speech entitled: \u201cLet Me Commend To You the Mahogany Trade.\u201d Although it was completely hilarious that he thought he could give the most racist speech in the history of racist speeches and still ask afterwards: \u201cBut why is everyone saying that I am a racist?\u201d (I make no comment about echoes with the present day.) Well, I suppose there was no better character to espouse the bonkers \u201clogic\u201d of racism. \u201cI am viewed as a friend of heartless slave-owners.\u201d Could that possibly be because you are the friend of heartless slave-owners, Sir Evil George? Put him back in the water-boarding bath with the leeches. Luckily, Cecily had some morals and was able to leak the letter telling the truth about the wildly uncommendable nature of the mahogany trade. And she knows that the only way to fix any of this is to \u201cdrive a wedge between my father and Sir (Evil) George. With a little more charm, she is a Sindy Doll in the making. Meanwhile, Sindy Doll herself reminded us of how brilliant she is at diplomacy. Thank heavens for real friends who know where they need to be at the right time. During the search of Ross\u2019s house, Sindy Doll was truly using her poshness to the best effect. \u201cYou were magnificent!\u201d \u201cYes, I was.\u201d But you always are, Sindy Doll, you always are! Pewter tankard award for bonkers brilliance as supporting actor The relationship between Drake (Harry Richardson) and Morwenna (Ellise Chappell) has very occasionally been trying, as long-term viewers will recall. (I think the word \u201csimpering\u201d may have been used in the below-the-line comments.) However, I think over time these two have truly earned our respect and the scenes in this episode were beautifully done, from Drake\u2019s desperation to do the right thing and his anguish that this always seems beyond him, to Morwenna\u2019s sadness at leaving her child and her eventual stoic acceptance of reality. As I\u2019ve mentioned in regard to other pairings in this series, the chemistry between these two actors is perfect. They\u2019ve managed to turn something that could be cloying and irritating into a poignant and believable relationship. I, for one, am ready to donate the contents of my purse to Mrs Carne\u2019s School for Learnin\u2019. Coins only, obviously. (Side note: was it my imagination or did they keep changing the child actor for John Conan? What happened there and why did they think we wouldn\u2019t notice?) Classic Poldark lines \u201cWhy do you not go to London, mama?\u201d \u201cBecause if I did, who would see to Cornwall?\u201d Rightly said, Demelza. \u201cDo we not know a man with the needful skillage?\u201d An expression which surely deserves more frequent outings. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that, Ladyship.\u201d Drake rediscovers the inner strength he had during the toad-finding days. (Remember \u2018e they?) \u201cWhat possible use could you be in a carriage with your wife and a pug?\u201d Best line of the entire series? Or best line in any TV drama ever? I\u2019m torn. Regulation reverse sexism bare chest moment My eyesight has been so irreparably damaged by the mind-scrambling chest sightings witnessed in series one that it appears I failed to spot a pectoral glimpse faithfully reported by eagle-eyed \u2019Darkers on last week\u2019s episode. Many noted this below the line and a reader wrote to me from the Netherlands to berate me about this failure (I am not joking). I can only apologise. This week, though, it was back to business as usual. Which is to say no business at all. Next week Someone is stealing from the mine. Ned is in severe trouble. And Sir Evil George is back doing what he does best: marrying a woman who doesn\u2019t want to get married to him.",

Please do not add spoilers for later episodes in the series.</em></p> \n<p>Season three of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-handmaids-tale\">The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</a> has given us many excruciating sights, but at least we\u2019ve had a bit of a respite from rape, until the Ceremony finally reared its ugly head again in this episode. We and June had always known that her relatively unmolested days as Ofjoseph couldn\u2019t last forever.</p> \n<p>This was quite different from the clinical or cruel Ceremonies we\u2019ve seen before on the show, and one in which June was far from the only victim. \u201cBearing witness\u201d, June tells us, used to be common in the early days of Gilead when households were still resistant to monthly rapes, but that resistance, it\u2019s implied, was swiftly eradicated. And no wonder \u2013 as June tells Commander and Mrs Lawrence, the entire household, Marthas included, will be executed if the Ceremony does not go ahead. June is put into the awful position of conducting her own rape, in a household that hasn\u2019t got a clue about the rules of the Ceremony, all while two Commanders, an Aunt, a doctor, and a wife are breathing down her neck. But it isn\u2019t all bad: \u201cAt least it wasn\u2019t you,\u201d June tells Fred afterwards, once again shattering the lie of their forbidden love that he repeatedly tells himself.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc46c4e8b78152eb950a78855a75bb6e84701ef7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc46c4e8b78152eb950a78855a75bb6e84701ef7/0_100_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Handmaids assemble.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Handmaids assemble.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophie Giraud/Hulu</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The episode also offered us the clearest view of Commander Lawrence that we\u2019ve yet had. Previously, his regular flits between rebellious rule-breaker and architect of Gilead made no sense, but this week we learned that it\u2019s the Martha black market that gets Eleanor Lawrence her medication, which has now run out. He deals in the black market for his wife, and he doesn\u2019t simply leave Gilead because he\u2019s a war criminal, and would be jailed or executed as soon as he crossed the border. \u201cAnd he would deserve it,\u201d the newly-unmedicated Eleanor points out. He wants out, and he wants to live, and he wants to keep his wife safe \u2013 but he can\u2019t have all three, hence his strange lifestyle, trying to cling on to his own little bubble of freedom on the edge of Gilead. \u201cYou helped create this world,\u201d June tells him as he faces the horrific consequences of his own past actions. \u201cHow long did you think it would be before it came for you?\u201d</p> \n<p>The double-punch of the Ceremony and his wife\u2019s lack of medication are enough to finally push Lawrence towards action, and he agrees to June\u2019s plan to get Eleanor, and as many children as she can, out of Gilead. \u201cAnd be a hero,\u201d he says, ambivalently. He\u2019s no hero. Something tells us there\u2019s no chance of Lawrence getting out of this alive. Bradley Whitford was brilliant in this episode, finally able to shine some light on Lawrence and expose who he really is underneath all that bitter snark.</p> \n<h2><strong>The Waterfords</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32ada2a70dd2508a3191c509a6eda76554f36647\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32ada2a70dd2508a3191c509a6eda76554f36647/0_75_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reflected glory ...

Fred (Jospeh Fiennes), Commander Winslow (Christopher Meloni).</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophie Giraud/Hulu</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Waterfords are still in deep with Commander Winslow, and Fred is clearly enjoying his time in Winslow\u2019s reflected glory, strutting his way through an inspection of handmaids with all the confidence of power and mislead righteousness. He thinks himself untouchable enough to converse openly with June in front of dozens of handmaids, the ever-watching Aunt Lydia and his wife. The finale brought him back down to earth with a bump, with both June and Serena putting him back in his place. Serena is so desperate to get Nichole back that she is forcing Fred into a deal with Mark Tuello, the man who has been trying to bribe Serena into deflecting with promises of cigarettes and Honolulu. But will Fred risk his new standing, even for his own (stolen) daughter?</p> \n<h2><strong>The sound of music</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlSR8Wlmpac\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vlSR8Wlmpac?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>None of the usual pop music this week reminding us of the world Gilead left behind only five years previously. Instead we were treated to some classical music instead. Beethoven\u2019s Symphony No. 9 in D Minor played over the opening scene, as June hobbled with determined speed back to the Lawrence house.</p> \n<p>The episode then closes out with Vivaldi\u2019s triumphant Gloria, as June gives us the first proper smile we\u2019ve seen on this show for a long time: \u201cWe\u2019re going to need a bigger boat.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Under his eye</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ff72624c3d2da642ddd616b6782ffa9c7270f8f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ff72624c3d2da642ddd616b6782ffa9c7270f8f/0_49_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Serena (Yvonne Strahovski).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In too deep? Serena (Yvonne Strahovski).</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophie Giraud/Hulu</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><br>Handmaids and Marthas can agree on few things, but children seem to be one of them, if the kitchenful of muffin baskets is anything to go by. June still refuses to leave Gilead without Hannah, but her new focus is on saving the children of her \u2018friends\u2019, and Alma and Janine are the first two handmaids to join her crusade. After their last encounter at Natalie\u2019s bedside, it was kind of June to spare Janine further pain by lying to her about her son \u2013 although the lie will, we suspect, hurt Janine in the end.</p> \n<p>In the inspection scene, Winslow can be overheard talking to Aunt Lydia about rolling out the \u2018veil\u2019 slowly \u2013 it looks like, despite her reluctance, Lydia is going to be complicit in silencing the Boston handmaids, just like their DC counterparts.</p> \n<p>Winslow is a true misogynist, as seen in his look of confusion when June tells him that Lawrence treats her with respect, and in the curl of his lip whenever Serena speaks of political matters. What a repulsive character.</p> \n<p>The punishment for contraception is being torn apart by dogs. Of course it is.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"42ad171a-5e4c-40ca-bc10-8d3dbf7eaea2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n

      "bodyText": "Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, series three, on Channel 4 in the UK. Please do not add spoilers for later episodes in the series. Season three of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale has given us many excruciating sights, but at least we\u2019ve had a bit of a respite from rape, until the Ceremony finally reared its ugly head again in this episode. We and June had always known that her relatively unmolested days as Ofjoseph couldn\u2019t last forever. This was quite different from the clinical or cruel Ceremonies we\u2019ve seen before on the show, and one in which June was far from the only victim. \u201cBearing witness\u201d, June tells us, used to be common in the early days of Gilead when households were still resistant to monthly rapes, but that resistance, it\u2019s implied, was swiftly eradicated. And no wonder \u2013 as June tells Commander and Mrs Lawrence, the entire household, Marthas included, will be executed if the Ceremony does not go ahead. June is put into the awful position of conducting her own rape, in a household that hasn\u2019t got a clue about the rules of the Ceremony, all while two Commanders, an Aunt, a doctor, and a wife are breathing down her neck. But it isn\u2019t all bad: \u201cAt least it wasn\u2019t you,\u201d June tells Fred afterwards, once again shattering the lie of their forbidden love that he repeatedly tells himself. The episode also offered us the clearest view of Commander Lawrence that we\u2019ve yet had. Previously, his regular flits between rebellious rule-breaker and architect of Gilead made no sense, but this week we learned that it\u2019s the Martha black market that gets Eleanor Lawrence her medication, which has now run out. He deals in the black market for his wife, and he doesn\u2019t simply leave Gilead because he\u2019s a war criminal, and would be jailed or executed as soon as he crossed the border. \u201cAnd he would deserve it,\u201d the newly-unmedicated Eleanor points out. He wants out, and he wants to live, and he wants to keep his wife safe \u2013 but he can\u2019t have all three, hence his strange lifestyle, trying to cling on to his own little bubble of freedom on the edge of Gilead. \u201cYou helped create this world,\u201d June tells him as he faces the horrific consequences of his own past actions. \u201cHow long did you think it would be before it came for you?\u201d The double-punch of the Ceremony and his wife\u2019s lack of medication are enough to finally push Lawrence towards action, and he agrees to June\u2019s plan to get Eleanor, and as many children as she can, out of Gilead. \u201cAnd be a hero,\u201d he says, ambivalently. He\u2019s no hero. Something tells us there\u2019s no chance of Lawrence getting out of this alive. Bradley Whitford was brilliant in this episode, finally able to shine some light on Lawrence and expose who he really is underneath all that bitter snark. The Waterfords The Waterfords are still in deep with Commander Winslow, and Fred is clearly enjoying his time in Winslow\u2019s reflected glory, strutting his way through an inspection of handmaids with all the confidence of power and mislead righteousness. He thinks himself untouchable enough to converse openly with June in front of dozens of handmaids, the ever-watching Aunt Lydia and his wife. The finale brought him back down to earth with a bump, with both June and Serena putting him back in his place. Serena is so desperate to get Nichole back that she is forcing Fred into a deal with Mark Tuello, the man who has been trying to bribe Serena into deflecting with promises of cigarettes and Honolulu. But will Fred risk his new standing, even for his own (stolen) daughter? The sound of music None of the usual pop music this week reminding us of the world Gilead left behind only five years previously. Instead we were treated to some classical music instead. Beethoven\u2019s Symphony No. 9 in D Minor played over the opening scene, as June hobbled with determined speed back to the Lawrence house. The episode then closes out with Vivaldi\u2019s triumphant Gloria, as June gives us the first proper smile we\u2019ve seen on this show for a long time: \u201cWe\u2019re going to need a bigger boat.\u201d Under his eye Handmaids and Marthas can agree on few things, but children seem to be one of them, if the kitchenful of muffin baskets is anything to go by. June still refuses to leave Gilead without Hannah, but her new focus is on saving the children of her \u2018friends\u2019, and Alma and Janine are the first two handmaids to join her crusade. After their last encounter at Natalie\u2019s bedside, it was kind of June to spare Janine further pain by lying to her about her son \u2013 although the lie will, we suspect, hurt Janine in the end. In the inspection scene, Winslow can be overheard talking to Aunt Lydia about rolling out the \u2018veil\u2019 slowly \u2013 it looks like, despite her reluctance, Lydia is going to be complicit in silencing the Boston handmaids, just like their DC counterparts. Winslow is a true misogynist, as seen in his look of confusion when June tells him that Lawrence treats her with respect, and in the curl of his lip whenever Serena speaks of political matters. What a repulsive character. The punishment for contraception is being torn apart by dogs. Of course it is.",

The FBI is one of three authorities that have opened investigations into why Epstein, who had been placed on suicide watch for a week last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/11/jeffrey-epstein-death-fbi-doj-launch-investigations\">had not remained under special monitoring</a>. His death <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/11/jeffrey-epstein-conspiracy-theories-run-riot-with-trumps-help\">has also prompted outlandish conspiracy theories, including one backed by Donald Trump</a>. The US president retweeted a post sceptical that Epstein had killed himself and included the line \u201c#JefferyEpstein had information on Bill Clinton &amp; now he\u2019s dead\u201d. The retweet was criticised by the Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, who said it marked the president\u2019s latest bid to change the national conversation.</p> <p><strong>The number of people claiming Newstart has increased in about 10% of areas across Australia despite a national improvement,</strong> with remote Indigenous communities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/12/number-of-people-on-newstart-rises-in-10-of-areas-despite-national-improvement\">among the hardest hit</a>. Figures released by the Coalition on Sunday showed 42,000 fewer people were receiving Newstart and Youth Allowance in 2018-19 compared with the year before, equivalent to a drop of 5%, with the government using the figures to push back against calls to lift the benefit of about $275 a week. But the data, obtained by Guardian Australia, shows that the results are patchy across the country. In about 10% of geographic areas the number of people claiming the benefit has increased, with remote unemployment hotspots in the Northern Territory and South Australia, as well as Jimboomba and Beaudesert, south of Brisbane, among those getting worse in the past year.</p> <p><strong>The NSW government has been accused of failing to act on promises <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/12/chilling-effect-on-whistleblowers-nsw-accused-of-not-acting-on-pledged-protections\">to protect whistleblowers</a> who approach the Independent Commission Against Corruption.</strong> Last week,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/07/sacked-parking-inspectors-to-test-nsw-whistleblower-protections\"> Guardian Australia revealed</a> that two western Sydney council rangers were sacked after blowing the whistle on allegations they were directed to stay away from developments owned by a local councillor. Labor\u2019s shadow attorney general, Paul Lynch, says the government has ignored for too long the recommendations of two parliamentary committees to reform the Icac Act. The Greens anti-corruption spokesman, Jamie Parker, says: \u201cThe current laws have a chilling effect on whistleblowers who are forced to weigh up their instinct to report against the prospect of losing their job or being sued.\u201d</p> <h2>World</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78201c003db6b55363dcd74651f13911c612d2bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78201c003db6b55363dcd74651f13911c612d2bd/0_307_4928_2956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pakistani Christians at a rally\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pakistani Christians shout slogans in support of Kashmiris at a rally in Quetta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Banaras Khan/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The Pakistani prime minister, Imran Khan, has likened the Indian government to Nazis,</strong> warning that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/11/imran-khan-likens-global-inaction-on-kashmir-to-appeasing-hitler\">global inaction over Kashmir</a> would be the same as appeasing Hitler.

His death has also prompted outlandish conspiracy theories, including one backed by Donald Trump. The US president retweeted a post sceptical that Epstein had killed himself and included the line \u201c#JefferyEpstein had information on Bill Clinton &amp; now he\u2019s dead\u201d. The retweet was criticised by the Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, who said it marked the president\u2019s latest bid to change the national conversation. The number of people claiming Newstart has increased in about 10% of areas across Australia despite a national improvement, with remote Indigenous communities among the hardest hit. Figures released by the Coalition on Sunday showed 42,000 fewer people were receiving Newstart and Youth Allowance in 2018-19 compared with the year before, equivalent to a drop of 5%, with the government using the figures to push back against calls to lift the benefit of about $275 a week. But the data, obtained by Guardian Australia, shows that the results are patchy across the country. In about 10% of geographic areas the number of people claiming the benefit has increased, with remote unemployment hotspots in the Northern Territory and South Australia, as well as Jimboomba and Beaudesert, south of Brisbane, among those getting worse in the past year. The NSW government has been accused of failing to act on promises to protect whistleblowers who approach the Independent Commission Against Corruption. Last week, Guardian Australia revealed that two western Sydney council rangers were sacked after blowing the whistle on allegations they were directed to stay away from developments owned by a local councillor. Labor\u2019s shadow attorney general, Paul Lynch, says the government has ignored for too long the recommendations of two parliamentary committees to reform the Icac Act. The Greens anti-corruption spokesman, Jamie Parker, says: \u201cThe current laws have a chilling effect on whistleblowers who are forced to weigh up their instinct to report against the prospect of losing their job or being sued.\u201d World The Pakistani prime minister, Imran Khan, has likened the Indian government to Nazis, warning that global inaction over Kashmir would be the same as appeasing Hitler. His comments came as authorities in Indian-administered Kashmir reportedly reimposed some curfew rules in parts of the territory, following an easing of restrictions in Srinagar, the region\u2019s main city, that had allowed people to visit shops over the weekend and attend Friday prayers. Hundreds of people deported from the UK were restrained by a variety of methods including shackles, the Guardian has learned. There were 447 cases where one or more forms of restraint were used between April 2018 and March 2019. The Brexit stalemate looks set to continue after the Irish government said the backstop would not be up for renegotiation at a planned meeting between Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar. A spokesman for Varadkar said there was no prospect of a rethink on the most contentious part of the withdrawal agreement. An air war in Libya is intensifying as rival forces in the divided country try to break a military stalemate, significantly heightening the risk of civilian casualties. Hundreds of animal rights activists protested outside the bullring in Palma de Mallorca at the weekend, as bullfighting returned to the island for the first time since it was outlawed in 2017. Opinion and analysis Some political books capture the zeitgeist with such precision that they seem to blur the lines between the page and the real world and become part of the urgent, rapidly unfolding changes they are describing. Naomi Klein\u2019s No Logo, published 20 years ago, charted the dramatic rise in the west of youth-oriented, cool-hungry consumer capitalism, in which companies sold an idealised lifestyle, not the physical product on the shelf. \u201cWhat strikes me, rereading the book now,\u201d writes Dan Hancox, \u201cis not that Klein was wrong in her diagnosis, but that the changes she was documenting are so much worse than we could have ever predicted.\u201d \u201cIn this hopeful moment, it is easy to imagine a fast-food future where all the \u2018meat\u2019 is plant-based \u2013 and the environmental footprint of these convenience foods is significantly reduced, helping stop a climate crisis scientists warn we have only a decade left to tackle,\u201d writes Jessica Glenza. \u201cVeggie options no longer vie for a dusty corner of the menu in fast-food chains. Now they are jockeying to appeal to climate-conscious young people. Plant-based choices are nearly indistinguishable from their meat counterparts.\u201d Sport Manchester United have made it a nightmare start for Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea, winning 4-0 in the Premier League, writes Daniel Taylor. \u201cThey won, their new signings all seemed to have fun and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r was noisily serenaded by all four sides of the ground.\u201d In tennis, 19-year-old Bianca Andreescu has taken the Rogers Cup title after Serena Williams had to retire with a back injury in the first set. Andreescu was leading 3-1 at the time. Thinking time: Teenagers on the climate crisis As the International Congress of Youth Voices kicks off in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the Guardian invited young delegates to write about their fight against the climate crisis. Seventeen-year-old Jamie Margolin writes that the world at the moment is like a bad dystopian movie. \u201cIf you were watching a movie, and all of the characters in it knew there were only 10 years left to save the world, but they continued going on with their lives as if nothing was happening you would yell at the screen right? I would. We on planet Earth are living out that movie. Climate change and environmental destruction are quite literally ending the world \u2013 and the United Nations has made it crystal clear through years of extensive scientific research that we have a maximum of 10 years left in order to turn the tides on the climate crisis and save humanity and every creature we share this once-blue Earth with. \u201cTen years left to save the world. That means starting yesterday, we have to radically change our society \u2013 the way we live, the way we power our lives and fully make that just climate action transition in the span of 10 years in order for it to not be too late.\u201d Media roundup Scientists have warned that this summer\u2019s fish kills could occur \u201con a scale that could dwarf the mass die-offs last summer,\u201d the Sydney Morning Herald reveals. The Australian reports that \u201cthe ability of Australia\u2019s special forces to deal with security threats in the Indo-Pacific will be boosted under a $3bn, 20-year program.\u201d The Daily Telegraph\u2019s front-page headline is Abortion Revolt, with \u201cGladys in the UK as key Libs turn on her.\u201d Coming up There is a court of appeal application for Rob Karam, who is serving 35 years after being represented by Nicola Gobbo, also known as Lawyer X.

      "bodyText": "Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r praised Manchester United\u2019s \u201crisk and reward\u201d play as Chelsea were torn apart at Old Trafford on Sunday. An 18th-minute penalty from Marcus Rashford before a second from the forward after the break, along with strikes from Anthony Martial and Daniel James on 65 and 81 minutes, respectively, secured a confidence-boosting victory in what is expected to be a season of transition for United. This left Solskj\u00e6r delighted. \u201cAs we said to the boys before the game, we have found the way we want to play and a way we believe in,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to go out and do the same. We took risks but that\u2019s the way here. You have got to go for it. It\u2019s risk and reward and today we were rewarded.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r was pleased with his new signings Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and James after the opening win. The trio were bought for a combined \u00a3145m in the summer and each enjoyed a memorable debut. While Maguire and Wan-Bissaka started, James was a late replacement. Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cWe\u2019ve signed three fantastic boys, three fantastic personalities and we are delighted with them. He\u2019s [Maguire] done exactly what we\u2019ve signed him for, his presence in both boxes, his calmness and composure on the ball. He\u2019s a leader and with him, David de Gea and Victor Lindel\u00f6f they marshalled that back line really well. It is important to have strong personalities at the back. \u201cDan has made a great impact and it is the best feeling ever scoring a goal in front of the Stretford End. You can\u2019t beat that.\u201d While Wan-Bissaka was involved in Rashford\u2019s 67th-minute strike, Solskj\u00e6r was pleased with United\u2019s display following the interval. \u201cThe second half was outstanding, we defended well in shape and counterattacked well,\u201d he said. In the close season Solskj\u00e6r placed emphasis on improving the conditioning of players. \u201cThe fitter you are, the more you can do. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d the 46-year-old said. \u201cThe boys have been working hard but this is still the start, we can still get some hard work in.\u201d While Martial started in the No 9 position he occupied in pre-season, Rashford was asked to play wider. \u201cMarcus Rashford played that left-hand/striker role to perfection today,\u201d said Solskj\u00e6r. \u201cOnce in a while he is caught out defensively but that means he can counterattack. His second goal was absolutely outstanding, that\u2019s where we want him running in behind and not on the touchline crossing in. Martial\u2019s goal was a typical number nine goal, that\u2019s where I want him [close in] and he knows that. That\u2019s where the number nines get the goals.\u201d Rashford said: \u201cIt was a good start, in the first half we could have been a bit sharper but it is to be expected in the first game. In the second half we looked sharper and the fitness work we have been doing over the summer pulled us through.\u201d Frank Lampard\u2019s team were bright in passages but Chelsea\u2019s manager was left bemoaning a lack of focus. \u201cWe made four mistakes and they put them away. It is a reality check for us all,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are Chelsea. We don\u2019t want to come here and lose 4-0. It wasn\u2019t a 4-0 game for long periods but we need to accept it.\u201d He also defended his selection of Mason Mount following criticism from Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, the former Chelsea and United manager. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like the performance \u2013 is that what he said? I don\u2019t have to worry too much about [that],\u201d said Lampard.",

Still, this parsimony doubtless endeared them to the Yorkshire folk.)</p> <p>Next, explain in hushed, breathless tones that these are letters written by and to the royal siblings and their friends \u2013 and who those siblings are, for the plebs who haven\u2019t already absorbed the basics via the 300 programmes a year that are broadcast on the subject of Edward (shagger, abdicator, Nazi, all-round dingus), Bertie (the Queen\u2019s dad) and the others (Henry, military man until he met Beryl Markham and became a dingus; George, the family darling until he became a shagger; John, who died aged 13; and the aforementioned Mary).</p> <p>Third, re-explain in hushed, breathless tones that these are actual letters written by and to the actual royal siblings and their friends using their actual royal hands.</p> <p>Then, point out that these were private letters, written with the expectation of privacy, before reading out choice excerpts where the Saxe-Coburg and Gotha offspring really let rip. Generally, Edward delivers best, talking about his father\u2019s \u201cwretched life\u201d and the \u201cfoul way\u201d he treats Mary, and lamenting the increasingly propagandist nature of his 1921 tour of the empire.

I feel I am through with it and long to die. Don\u2019t breathe a word! No one must know how I feel about my life.\u201d You do feel sorry for the dingus in a gilded cage, although not as sorry as you do for the hundreds of people killed at Amritsar.</p> <p>The programme took us at a brisk trot through the two generations\u2019 dissatisfactions and frustrations with each other, the efforts to shore up the monarchy against the more perilous dissatisfactions and frustrations of the disillusioned postwar populace still waiting for a land fit for heroes. Even giving some of them the vote hadn\u2019t properly dissipated tensions. \u201cNo one knew what the wuuhking classes wuh going to do with thahr new voice!\u201d explained Deborah Cadbury in her own chocolatey one.</p> <p>Bertie and the Princess Royal kept ploughing respectable furrows, marrying Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (the Queen\u2019s mum) and Henry Lascelles (the cousin of Tommy Lascelles \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/08/the-crown-review-second-series-netflix\" title=\"\">Pip Torrens in The Crown</a> \u2013 who would later serve as private secretary to Bertie and the Queen), while George V and Queen Mary did their best to keep the rest of their increasingly dissolute children in order \u2013 not to much avail. In the wake of the General Strike, Edward was sent on another publicity tour and behaved abominably throughout. At one point, his assistant private secretary (Tommy Lascelles again) recorded his opinion that \u201cthe heir apparent, in his unbridled pursuit of wine and women and whatever selfish whim occupied him at the moment, was rapidly going to the devil and, unless he mended his ways, would soon become no fit wearer of the British crown\u201d. Baby, you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.</p> <p>You have seen it all before, illuminated slightly differently according to which cache was found in which nook or cranny of which palatial dwelling, and which socio-historical heads have been dragooned into talking us through it again. It is becoming quite comforting, really \u2013 an audiovisual strand being twisted into the rope of constitutional continuity that we are told binds us through the ages. It does give the lie to one adage, though, because there is actually nothing you can think of that wasn\u2019t exactly like the home life of at least one of our own dear queens.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was corrected on 12 August 2019.

In the case of The Queen\u2019s Lost Family \u2013 a companion piece to 2015\u2019s The Queen\u2019s Lost Cousin, about Prince William of Gloucester, which is not to be confused with The Queen\u2019s Hidden Cousins, which came a few years before that \u2013 it was Channel 4, rather than the BBC, but otherwise it was business as usual. First, take a cache of recently unearthed letters: here, a bundle of correspondence tucked away at Harewood House, near Leeds, the marital home of Princess Mary, the only daughter of George V and Queen Mary. (You would think they could afford more names, the royals, but no. Still, this parsimony doubtless endeared them to the Yorkshire folk.) Next, explain in hushed, breathless tones that these are letters written by and to the royal siblings and their friends \u2013 and who those siblings are, for the plebs who haven\u2019t already absorbed the basics via the 300 programmes a year that are broadcast on the subject of Edward (shagger, abdicator, Nazi, all-round dingus), Bertie (the Queen\u2019s dad) and the others (Henry, military man until he met Beryl Markham and became a dingus; George, the family darling until he became a shagger; John, who died aged 13; and the aforementioned Mary). Third, re-explain in hushed, breathless tones that these are actual letters written by and to the actual royal siblings and their friends using their actual royal hands. Then, point out that these were private letters, written with the expectation of privacy, before reading out choice excerpts where the Saxe-Coburg and Gotha offspring really let rip. Generally, Edward delivers best, talking about his father\u2019s \u201cwretched life\u201d and the \u201cfoul way\u201d he treats Mary, and lamenting the increasingly propagandist nature of his 1921 tour of the empire. (Sample quote from contemporary newsreel covering Edward\u2019s arrival in India: \u201cEven the horses seem pleased!\u201d) After the Amritsar massacre, however, Edward felt the bloom was really off the rose. \u201cChrist, how I loathe my job now and all the press-puffed empty success. I feel I am through with it and long to die. Don\u2019t breathe a word! No one must know how I feel about my life.\u201d You do feel sorry for the dingus in a gilded cage, although not as sorry as you do for the hundreds of people killed at Amritsar. The programme took us at a brisk trot through the two generations\u2019 dissatisfactions and frustrations with each other, the efforts to shore up the monarchy against the more perilous dissatisfactions and frustrations of the disillusioned postwar populace still waiting for a land fit for heroes. Even giving some of them the vote hadn\u2019t properly dissipated tensions. \u201cNo one knew what the wuuhking classes wuh going to do with thahr new voice!\u201d explained Deborah Cadbury in her own chocolatey one. Bertie and the Princess Royal kept ploughing respectable furrows, marrying Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (the Queen\u2019s mum) and Henry Lascelles (the cousin of Tommy Lascelles \u2013 Pip Torrens in The Crown \u2013 who would later serve as private secretary to Bertie and the Queen), while George V and Queen Mary did their best to keep the rest of their increasingly dissolute children in order \u2013 not to much avail. In the wake of the General Strike, Edward was sent on another publicity tour and behaved abominably throughout. At one point, his assistant private secretary (Tommy Lascelles again) recorded his opinion that \u201cthe heir apparent, in his unbridled pursuit of wine and women and whatever selfish whim occupied him at the moment, was rapidly going to the devil and, unless he mended his ways, would soon become no fit wearer of the British crown\u201d. Baby, you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet. You have seen it all before, illuminated slightly differently according to which cache was found in which nook or cranny of which palatial dwelling, and which socio-historical heads have been dragooned into talking us through it again. It is becoming quite comforting, really \u2013 an audiovisual strand being twisted into the rope of constitutional continuity that we are told binds us through the ages. It does give the lie to one adage, though, because there is actually nothing you can think of that wasn\u2019t exactly like the home life of at least one of our own dear queens. \u2022 This article was corrected on 12 August 2019. The boy on the left of the picture was George VI, not George V as originally stated.",

      "bodyText": "Manchester United (4-2-3-1) David de Gea A confident start to the new season with good positioning and fine saves from Barkley, Emerson and Mount. 7 Aaron Wan-Bissaka The \u00a345m summer signing made an immediate impression. Pulled inside a few times but dominant in his battles. 8 Victor Lindel\u00f6f A polished display and an important influence on the two debutants either side of him in United\u2019s defence. Booked. 7 Harry Maguire A serene start to life as the world\u2019s most expensive defender. Won every header, distributed cleanly and instigated the crucial second goal. 8 Luke Shaw Exposed several times in the first half by a lack of protection around him but handled the pressure well. 7 Paul Pogba Controlled midfield with a masterful display. Put the team first and delivered beautiful passes for the third and fourth goals. 8 Scott McTominay Tactically disciplined and dovetailed neatly with Pogba. The pair\u2019s understanding grew impressively during the game. 7 Jesse Lingard Anonymous to start with out on the right but prospered when shifted inside. A more physical presence than usual. Booked. 7 Andreas Pereira Took his opportunity well with a valuable part in the first two goals and a hand in limiting Jorginho\u2019s influence on midfield. 7 Marcus Rashford Did not look comfortable stationed out on the left but flourished centrally. His pace and touch polished United\u2019s counterattacks. 8 Anthony Martial Showed a finisher\u2019s instinct to hold off Azpilicueta and convert the second goal. More suited than Rashford to playing out wide. Booked. 7 Substitutes: Daniel James (for Pereira 74) 7, Juan Mata (for Rashford 86) 5, Mason Greenwood (for Lingard 86) 5. Chelsea (4-2-3-1) Kepa Arrizabalaga No chance with the penalty but beaten too easily when Martial took the game away from Chelsea. 6 C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta The visitors\u2019 best defender until switching off with serious consequences for the second and third goals. 5 Andreas Christensen Alert for several interceptions and strong in the air, although slow to react on the second goal and the counterattack. 6 Kurt Zouma A nervous, clumsy and costly display from a defender trying to impress after two seasons away. Booked. 4 Emerson Justified his selection over Marcos Alonso by bringing energy and greater threat. Denied by the woodwork and twice by De Gea. 7 Jorginho Tidier and more creative in possession than most but frequently overrun in the second half. Booked. 6 Mateo Kovacic Exerted little influence on the midfield battle. Allowed Pogba too much freedom to dictate proceedings. 6 Pedro Reflected Chelsea\u2019s day: sharp and inventive early on but wasteful and erratic as the game wore on. 5 Mason Mount Pressed well when Chelsea were on top only to fade after the penalty. Indecisive in front of goal. 6 Ross Barkley Looked lean and keen to get on the front foot but had little joy against Wan-Bissaka. 6 Tammy Abraham A starting role was a vote of confidence and, though unlucky to hit the post, his hold-up play needs to improve. Booked. 6 Substitutes: Christian Pulisic (for Barkley 58) 6, Olivier Giroud (for Abraham 66) 5, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 (for Jorginho 73) 5.",

Twelve months ago Martial had been close to persona non grata here due to serious differences with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, the previous manager.

      "bodyText": "Across two breathtaking minutes Manchester United shot an electric bolt through Old Trafford. Until then Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side clung to a lead against a Chelsea side who surely wondered how they still trailed. Then, in a flash, the home team were transformed. First, on 63 minutes, Anthony Martial did something rarely seen for United in recent times: he scored an old\u2011fashioned \u201csniffer\u2019s\u201d goal. Andrea Pereira smacked a cross in and there was the Frenchman to bundle home from close range. Then came a sweet United sequence in which Aaron Wan\u2011Bissaka, Jesse Lingard and Paul Pogba were all involved before the latter struck a superb 70-yard pass on to Marcus Rashford\u2019s toes and he beat Kepa Arrizabalaga. United\u2019s fans were in party mode and this reconfigured Solskj\u00e6r side were cruising. Twelve months ago Martial had been close to persona non grata here due to serious differences with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, the previous manager. Now, in the season opener against Chelsea, he was handed the centre\u2011forward berth by Solskj\u00e6r after being handed the No 9 jersey in a return to the shirt first occupied under Louis van Gaal when signing from Monaco in September 2015. In that season he registered a personal best for the club of 17 before Zlatan Ibrahimovic\u2019s arrival the following year. If that demotion in status contributed to Martial\u2019s demeanour becoming a kind of quasi-sulk as he was shifted to the margins under Mourinho, how Rashford reacted to his own move wide for Martial was one of the subplots here. Rashford\u2019s preferred position is at centre-forward too, yet after starting on the left he produced a sparkling display that suggested he harboured no dudgeon, his penalty separating the teams at the break. If Martial remains a spring chicken at 23, then Rashford, 21 and Wythenshawe-born, is the poster boy for the proud United tradition of home-reared talent. Each are emblems of Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s move to a trust in youth for this nascent campaign. In the 21-year-olds Scott McTominay and Wan-Bissaka, who made his debut, Pereira and Luke Shaw (each 23), the manager had six players who brought the average outfield age of the XI down to 23 years and seven months. If there are partly practicalities at play here following a net spend of only \u00a372m this summer, Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s hopes of a bright start to 2019-20 began to be realised when Rashford smashed in his 17th-minute penalty. This came after Chelsea had dominated the contest\u2019s opening (and would continue to do so until the interval, at least) but in the run of Pereira, then Rashford\u2019s burst into the area before being brought down, there was encouragement for the home faithful. For a period it also injected an urgency previously lacking. Suddenly Martial, Rashford and company were a muscular proposition, pinning back their visitors as Wan-Bissaka rampaged along his right-back corridor and Harry Maguire threatened to swoop in behind Chelsea for a goal on debut. Rashford\u2019s finishes were a 28th and 29th in the league in his 112th appearance, the first 27 coming at one every 248 minutes.

      "bodyText": "The suspected gunman in an attack on a mosque in Norway on Saturday was inspired by recent white extremist attacks in New Zealand and the US, online posts suggest. Police in Norway have so far only said the attack in Baerum, a town 20km from Oslo, the capital, will be investigated as a possible act of terrorism. In messages posted on the day of the attack, Philip Manshaus, a 21-year-old man who has been named by local media as the main suspect, described himself as \u201cchosen\u201d by \u201cSaint [Brenton] Tarrant\u201d, the gunman who killed 51 people at mosques in New Zealand in March. \u201cMy time is up, I was chosen by Saint Tarrant after all \u2026 We can\u2019t let this continue, you gotta bump the race war threat in real life \u2026 it\u2019s been fun,\u201d one post reads. In a meme also posted by Manshaus, three rightwing extremists suspected of being responsible for other attacks this year are depicted and praised as heroes of the white nationalist movement. Tarrant is described as having \u201caddressed the Muslim problem\u201d while Patrick Crusius, who has been charged with the attack in El Paso, Texas, in which 22 people died, is praised for \u201cfighting to reclaim his country\u201d. A third attacker suspected of killing a woman during a Passover celebration at a synagogue in California in April is also praised, alongside antisemitic abuse. The evidence of posts supporting the actions of the three suspects will fuel fears that a \u201ccascade\u201d of rightwing extremist attacks is gathering supporters around the world. \u201cWe are now no longer talking about one-off events, but a loosely coordinated chain of far-right attacks across the world, where members of these networks inspire \u2013 and challenge \u2013 each other to beat each others\u2019 body counts,\u201d said Peter Neumann, professor of security studies at King\u2019s College London. \u201cThe ultimate motivation \u2026 is to launch a race war. The aim is to carry out attacks, claim responsibility, explain your action, and inspire others to follow.\u201d The posts, made shortly before the attack, were both reported to have been on a new messaging board called Endchan, which describes itself as \u201can anonymous image-board that promotes ideas over identity,\u201d and an older board called 4chan. A messaging board used by the suspect in El Paso and elsewhere called 8chan was closed following that tragedy. Unmoderated messaging boards have emerged as a key vector for the spread of extremism. Neumann said any hopes that shutting down 8chan would deprive the far right of its virtual network looks misguided as supporters quickly move on to other message boards. Authorities believe Crusius was the author of a racist white nationalist screed that was posted online shortly before the El Paso attack. The author of the document said the attack was \u201ca response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas\u201d and said he was inspired by the gunman in Christchurch. The post by Manshaus linked to a live stream on his Facebook page \u2013 since taken down by the social network.

      "bodyText": "It was over in seconds. High over the grouse moor two hen harriers wheeled slowly around each other before, suddenly, the female darted underneath her mate to catch a freshly caught meal dropped from his talons and took it back to their chicks. \u201cThat was a food pass,\u201d said David Frew, the property manager of Mar Lodge, a vast Highland estate near Braemar in the southern Cairngorms. \u201cYou\u2019re really lucky to have seen that.\u201d On many grouse moors in Scotland, hen harriers struggle to survive. The ground-nesting bird of prey is often shot, trapped or even poisoned to protect valuable grouse stocks from predation. On these shooting estates, the sight of a harrier, eagle or buzzard wheeling overhead would be a sign of failure. The grouse season starts on Monday with the \u201cglorious 12th\u201d, when moors across the UK will echo to the sharp report of shotguns as grouse are driven into the air by beaters marching in a line through the heather. On these estates, the aim is to shoot several hundred grouse in a day. But for the first time in its history one of the main techniques needed for conventional shooting, known as driven grouse shooting, has been banned at Mar Lodge, the UK\u2019s largest national nature reserve, which is owned by the National Trust for Scotland. Called muirburn, this practice involves burning large strips of heather to create fresh shoots for young grouse. With this major departure in practice, Mar Lodge has joined other Highland estate owners who have replaced driven shooting with a more ecologically minded approach. Proponents of walked-up shooting, where the grouse breed without any human intervention, say this method is much closer to the Scandinavian and continental model of hunting \u2013 a low-impact activity where quarry is shot for the pot, not in their hundreds for a day\u2019s sport. Its adherents include wealthy Scandinavian estate owners who are investing hundreds of millions of pounds in projects to rewild the Highlands, and gun sports groups which say it can be cheaper and more accessible than driven shooting, an exclusive sport that can cost tens of thousands of pounds a day. Anders Povlsen, the clothing billionaire who is now Scotland\u2019s largest private landowner, and a keen proponent of rewilding, allows it on his estates at Glenfeshie and Gaick in the Cairngorms. Thomas MacDonell, the conservation director of Povlsen\u2019s Wildland group of estates, said driven shooting ended at Glenfeshie when the group bought the estate in 2006 and at Gaick to the south-west in 2013. In Glenfeshie\u2019s heyday in the 1990s, hunters could shoot 2,000 grouse a day. Walk-up shooting means today\u2019s clients \u2013 including a party who have booked Glenfeshie this week \u2013 may get about 20 birds, on a good day. Sigrid Rausing, an heiress to the Tetra Pak packaging empire and publisher of the literary magazine Granta, allows it at Coignafearn, her estate in the Monadhliath mountains south of Inverness. So too does her sister Lisbet Rausing, who is rewilding Corrour estate near Rannoch Moor, for her family and friends. The ethos at Glenfeshie, Gaick, Mar Lodge, Corrour and Coignafearn is simple, said Frew and MacDonell. Heather, montane shrubs and trees are allowed to regenerate, thanks to ruthless culling of red deer, whose numbers have grown to unsustainable levels across the Highlands. Native wildlife such as the mountain hare which are shot on commercial grouse moors are allowed to recolonise, and birds of prey are welcomed. Their rewilding projects will take 200 years to realise but Frew says they are \u201cnot in a rush\u201d. MacDonell sees their grouse are part of nature\u2019s food chain. \u201cOur grouse are serving an ecological purpose. Eagles need to eat as well,\u201d he says. Its supporters include Chris Packham, the wildlife film-maker and expert. Ecologists and animal rights campaigners such as Packham are campaigning for the Scottish and UK governments to introduce much stricter controls on driven grouse moors.

Supporters of intensive shooting such as the British Association for Shooting and Conservation (BASC) counter that this technique allows ground-nesting birds such as black grouse, golden plover, lapwing and curlew to prosper where otherwise their numbers would plummet.

Last week, Guardian Australia revealed that two western Sydney council rangers were sacked after blowing the whistle on allegations they were directed to stay away from developments owned by a local councillor. They had passed the information on to a councillor, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac), and later to a public inquiry, and are now launching a rare test of the state\u2019s whistleblower protections through litigation in the NSW district court. Almost two years ago, the state government promised to strengthen whistleblower protections in the public interest disclosure act.

      "body": "<p>Steve Smith is ruining Test cricket. Like a maverick cop forced off active duty, he has been back only five minutes but is already laying the town to waste. Or at least this is the perception in some parts of the British Isles.</p> <p>Some objections come from the internet eggs that spawn around comment threads, decrying him as a cheat who should never be allowed near a cricket field again \u2013 you know, like all the other ball-tamperers who were banned for life rather than being feted as greats of the game with commentary contracts and hall of fame places.</p> <p>Another interpretation is that cricket is now futile because Smith is too good. He was out of the game a year and a half, confined to desk duties by some chief who did not appreciate his way of getting results. But the instant he got back on those mean streets, he started cleaning them up again. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/aug/04/steve-smith-australia-england-ashes-second-hundred\" title=\"\">Two centuries from two attempts</a>, and the Ashes may as well be surrendered now.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/aug/10/moeen-ali-can-be-an-england-stalwart-again-despite-nathan-lyon-mauling\">Moeen Ali can be an England stalwart again despite Nathan Lyon mauling | Vic Marks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is true that Smith can become impossible to bowl to and never more so than against England: five centuries in his past six Ashes Tests, averaging 139. That is a whole lot of stepping across the stumps to knock a single to midwicket. At times Smith seems to form a wall: a bat that always middles the ball, two pads lined up behind it that are never struck. In a game that hinges on getting players out, what happens when you cannot get one out?</p> <p>Of course none of this is actually accurate. Anyone can and does and will get out. Every batsman fails more often than not. Smith might get a pair this week at Lord\u2019s. What he has done is worked out a system against an even-paced right-arm seam attack while neutering England\u2019s principal off-spinner.</p> <p>As Smith explained in 2017, he used to take guard on middle stump and not have a preliminary movement.

      "bodyText": "Steve Smith is ruining Test cricket. Like a maverick cop forced off active duty, he has been back only five minutes but is already laying the town to waste. Or at least this is the perception in some parts of the British Isles. Some objections come from the internet eggs that spawn around comment threads, decrying him as a cheat who should never be allowed near a cricket field again \u2013 you know, like all the other ball-tamperers who were banned for life rather than being feted as greats of the game with commentary contracts and hall of fame places. Another interpretation is that cricket is now futile because Smith is too good. He was out of the game a year and a half, confined to desk duties by some chief who did not appreciate his way of getting results. But the instant he got back on those mean streets, he started cleaning them up again. Two centuries from two attempts, and the Ashes may as well be surrendered now. It is true that Smith can become impossible to bowl to and never more so than against England: five centuries in his past six Ashes Tests, averaging 139. That is a whole lot of stepping across the stumps to knock a single to midwicket. At times Smith seems to form a wall: a bat that always middles the ball, two pads lined up behind it that are never struck. In a game that hinges on getting players out, what happens when you cannot get one out? Of course none of this is actually accurate. Anyone can and does and will get out. Every batsman fails more often than not. Smith might get a pair this week at Lord\u2019s. What he has done is worked out a system against an even-paced right-arm seam attack while neutering England\u2019s principal off-spinner. As Smith explained in 2017, he used to take guard on middle stump and not have a preliminary movement. This meant he could be drawn into edges outside off stump. One could see it at Trent Bridge 2013: stock-still as the ball was delivered, bat high in the backlift, he drove hard for an important 50 before Jimmy Anderson found some outswing and a nick. To combat this, Smith eventually took guard on leg stump and stepped all the way across to off. That can make players vulnerable to lbw but Smith is so strong off his legs that it opens up that scoring area while shrinking the channel. \u201cIt\u2019s a big movement,\u201d he explained, \u201cbut for me it\u2019s about trying to minimise the ways that you get out. If guys get me out lbw, I say well played, congratulations but, if I nick one off, that\u2019s when I get upset at myself.\u201d The best way to get Smith is still the outside edge.

      "bodyText": "In journalism, you can sometimes feel trapped in one of the smaller faster-spinning cogs of an information machine that never slows. Readers might experience this phenomenon through its palliatives \u2013 as, for example, a book by a leader writer or political editor who steps from frenetic years in the inner wheels on to a larger slower-moving part of the contraption and tries to make sense of its cycles. Or through a foreign correspondent who, after a long posting in which he or she has witnessed intensively the daily life of a country or region, offers a spacious survey of the people and place across time, trying to put recent events into history\u2019s weave. The little agile cogs are necessary to the machine, but unless journalists seek out, and point the rest of us towards, those who labour on the bigger belts with less speed but often richer findings \u2013 the academics, the scientists, the public sector planners \u2013 we miss much. I had that trapped feeling recently as we all watched El Paso suffer predictable consequences of a president\u2019s appeals to hate and racism, followed soon after by Donald Trump\u2019s canting about eschewing hate and racism. He has used this manoeuvre before \u2013 after Charlottesville for instance. He went to El Paso like he went to Pittsburgh, a faux mourner. After Trump\u2019s White House address \u2013 delivered with deft insincerity by reading from a teleprompter in such a way as to disown the words being uttered \u2013 the New York Times caused consternation with the headline \u201cTrump Urges Unity vs. Racism\u201d.

Quinta Jurecic and Benjamin Wittes argued that Trumpism is \u201ca movement that exists within an electoral system but which has a deeply ambivalent relationship with the democratic norms of that system, a movement which both formally rejects violence yet manages also to tolerate and encourage it\u201d. Summarising the literature, they wrote: \u201cThe radicalising subject goes through a series of steps, with each step drawing him or her closer towards extremist beliefs and sometimes mobilisation towards violence as well.\u201d The individual\u2019s social ties play a part, including, particularly, social media.

Between them, Manchester United and Chelsea have won the title in 18 of the 27 Premier League seasons. This year, they start as 50-1 outsiders. Let that marinate for a few seconds: before they\u2019ve kicked a ball, <em>Manchester United</em> and <em>Chelsea </em>are<em> 50-1</em> to win the title.</p> <p>For both teams, the realistic grail is fourth place rather than first. Both have been in endless transition - United since 2013, Chelsea since about 2007. And though Chelsea have managed to win a few titles in that time, an extraordinary achievement in many ways, such fleeting relationships with managers rarely create the same memories.</p> <p>And so, after trying all kinds of coaches, both clubs have gone back to what they know: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Frank Lampard, who manages Chelsea for the first time today. The biggest challenge for those two is to juggle the short- and long-term. They need to satisfy the instant demands of modern football \u2013 these days, even the neutrals have a sense of entitlement \u2013 to buy themselves enough time to rebuild a broken dressing-room. </p> <p>In a sane culture, they would be guaranteed at least three years to invest in young players - whether they be homegrown, like the Masons, Greenwood and Mount, or imported, like Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Christian Pulisic. But Solskjaer and Lampard will not get that guarantee; not at these clubs, not even with their popularity.</p> <p>A good start is important, then - particularly for United, given the toxic end to last season. There will still be plenty of opening-day optimism at Old Trafford, especially if the two XIs include a handful of those young players. If all concerned show enough patience, United and Chelsea shouldn\u2019t be 50-1 outsiders in years to come. But that\u2019s a pretty big if.</p> <p><strong>Kick off</strong> is at 4.30pm.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-11T14:44:16.009Z\">at 3.44pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "A pleasing day for the United gaffer ... Some player ratings for you to argue about ... Jamie Jackson on the slight changes by the United manager ... I\u2019ll leave you with Danny Taylor\u2019s match report from Old Trafford Thanks for your company - bye! Here\u2019s Frank Lampard \u201cThere were four mistakes for the goals, but we controlled major parts of the first half. We made a couple of poor decisions in the final third. We should have been ahead at half-time. Even at the start of the second half, I didn\u2019t mind it, then two mistakes and we\u2019re 3-0 down. \u201cAt 1-0 we were the better team. They\u2019re a counter-attacking team \u2013 it\u2019s a big strength of theirs, put it that way, and if you give them opportunities to run past you they will. They were absolutely clinical. \u201cThere are loads of lessons for us \u2013 we can\u2019t make unforced errors at this level. But at the same time, it was nowhere near a 4-0. We have Rudiger and Willian not far away; Callum and Ruben will be a bit longer than that. I don\u2019t want that excuse, though. The team we put out was competing very well in the game. \u201cThe first thing I said to the players was that we have to be grown up about it, because it\u2019s not nice. We\u2019re Chelsea and we don\u2019t losing 4-0 anywhere, but we have to accept that. We have to analyse the bad bits and correct them.\u201d The Man of the Match is Harry Maguire \u201cIt\u2019s a great start for myself and the team. We rode our luck a little bit in the first half \u2013 we gave them too many chances. There were a few nerves and we gave the ball away in dangerous areas. But I think we were a lot better in the second half, we controlled the game and thoroughly deserved the three points. \u201cOur front three are so dangerous, on the break especially, and it was a convincing win in the end. Even at 3-0 and 4-0 we wanted a clean sheet; we knew there were only two here last season. We need to make this place a fortress. It\u2019s a good start, but we\u2019re not getting carried away.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve finally put in a textbook Mourinho performance,\u201d says Michael Simpson. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll have warm words upstairs after the game.\u201d Ha, yes. This reminded me of some of those 4-0 wins at the start of the 2017-18 season: tight and nervous for most of the game, and then a blizzard of late, counter-attacking goals. \u201cUnited weren\u2019t great, and no doubt they will still get the worst write up of all 20 PL teams this weekend,\u201d says Bob Baccalieri. \u201cBut they have scored four, kept a clean sheet, looked like they cared, and their \u2018terrible\u2019 summer transfer business has already borne some fruit. That is good enough for me.\u201d Yes, I thought their attitude - which was such a problem at the end of last season - was excellent. Peep peep! Manchester United start their season with a rousing, if flattering, thrashing of Chelsea. Marcus Rashford scored twice, with Anthony Martial - back in his old role at No9 - and the substitute Daniel James getting the others. Paul Pogba was his usual self: exasperating at times, imperious and devastating at others. Chelsea started the game superbly and passed it well, but their shoddy defending was punished ruthlessly. 90+1 min \u201cHas there ever been more deceiving 4-0 lead than this one?\u201d says Admir Pajic. In fairness, United\u2019s performance in the last half-hour has been textbook: sit deep, give Chelsea\u2019s passers no space and shred them on the counter-attack. 90 min James is too fast even for Kante, who takes him out and is booked. It\u2019s been a fine day for the United debutants - James has scored, Maguire has been as solid as his forehead and Wan-Bissaka, though erratic, has done some impressive things. 88 min \u201cHope you\u2019re well,\u201d says Ruth Purdue. \u201cI\u2019d love to have Jorginho in a 2 with McTominay. He\u2019d keep the ball ticking over and thread balls through. I feel you need that type in that position rather than the marauding Pogba. The no 6 can play on the left of a midfield 3 when he has world class players around him. He seems not to be as consistent without a Kante, Pirlo or Matuidi. I realise I write this after that Pogba run. Any thoughts?\u201d They would complement each other, definitely. It\u2019s the Pirlo/Gattuso model that Sir Alex Ferguson loved so much. But Pogba has been majestic at times in this game. 87 min After a good cross from Wan-Bissaka, Greenwood\u2019s first-time shot is blocked. 86 min A double change for United: Juan Mata and Mason Greenwood replace the impressive pair of Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard. Beans. 85 min Mount hits a cracking low shot from distance that is well saved by de Gea, sprawling to his right. As Gary Neville says on Sky, he\u2019s had a good day. A clean sheet would mean so much to him and the whole team, given the way they defended last season. 83 min \u201cIs the scoreline a travesty?\u201d says Christopher Faherty. \u201cChelsea have dominated the ball at spells and made chances but they\u2019ve looked an open book at the back from the start of the game.\u201d It is now! It was another superb counter-attack. Pogba played a one-two with Martial and surged majestically over the halfway line, beyond the defence. As Chelsea players started to catch him up, he looked up and angled a pass through to James in the area. He overran the ball slightly but recovered to hit a shot that deflected off Emerson and beat Kepa. Daniel James scores on his debut! 81 min McTominay is booked for something or other. There have been a lot of yellow cards today, although I can\u2019t remember any bad tackles. 80 min United almost get a fourth on the counter-attack. Pogba eases a long pass forward to Rashford, who cuts inside Azpilicueta on the edge of the area and hits a shot that is blocked by Kante. 76 min It\u2019s been a strange game. Chelsea have had more possession, more shots, more shots on target, more corners, fewer fouls. But they\u2019re 3-0 down, and no xG analysis in the world will make them feel better. 73 min A change for each side: Kante replaces Jorginho, and the debutant Daniel James comes on for Andreas Pereira. 72 min Although this scoreline is a travesty, it\u2019s a reminder of how dangerous this United team can be on the counter-attack, both through the running of Rashford, Martial and Lingard and the passing of Pogba. 72 min It was Lindelof who was booked in the 69th minute, not McTominay. 71 min Zouma heads over the bar; Emerson has another shot from distance saved by de Gea. 69 min McTominay is booked for a foul on Kovacic. 68 min Between those goals, Tammy Abraham was replaced by Olivier Giroud. That was an expertly taken goal. Pogba, just inside his own half, sprayed a brilliant pass over the top to find Rashford, who made a sharp run infield away from Azpilicueta. He killed the ball beautifully with his instep, just outside the area, and passed it to the left of Kepa. Two goals in 90 seconds! The goal came on the counter-attack after Maguire robbed Abraham on the edge of the box. Rashford overhit an angled through pass to Lingard, who retrieved the ball on the right of the area and eased it to Pereira on the wing. He whipped a wicked cross into the six-yard box, where Martial got in front of Azpilicueta and forced the ball through Kepa. Anthony Martial doubles United\u2019s lead! 64 min Chelsea haven\u2019t been as threatening in the last 10 minutes, though they are still dominating possession. If it stays like, Daniel James or Mason Greenwood will surely come on for United. 62 min Pereira hangs the corner up towards Maguire, who wins it at the far post but can only head it back across goal. Chelsea clear. 62 min Martial tries to wriggle away from Zouma, who runs the ball behind for a United corner. 58 min A first change for Chelsea: the debutant Christian Pulisic replaces Ross Barkley, 58 min Abraham is booked for a foul on McTominay. 57 min \u201cI see your point about McTominay and Fletcher,\u201d says Andrew Hurley. \u201cBut do you not think players like Fletcher, the Nevilles etc function very well when they have great players around them but are exposed otherwise?\u201d I thought that Fletcher, for two years until he was out for a long period, was as good as anyone in the world in his position. In 2009-10 he was the driving force of a relatively mediocre team. Not saying McTominay will ever be that good but he could have a similar influence. 56 min A fizzing long-range from Emerson is beaten away by de Gea, falling to his left. He\u2019s made a few saves today, although most have been relatively comfortable. 54 min Maguire, who had stayed forward after a United corner, tees up Rashford for a stinging shot that is blocked on the edge of the area. 52 min Jorginho is booked for a cynical foul on Lingard, who had beaten three players with a brilliant counter-attacking run. 51 min Pedro\u2019s long-range curler takes a slight deflection and goes behind for a corner. United need to change something here because a Chelsea equaliser is in the post, and probably a winner too. 50 min Chelsea have started the second half strongly. If they don\u2019t equalise they have some decent options on the bench, including Olivier Giroud and Christian Pulisic. 49 min \u201cThere was some very incompetent football in that first half,\u201d says Rachel Clifton. \u201cWatching in a completely (apart from me and mate) empty pub called The Churchill in NYC. Popping into the loos to be inspired by old Winston\u2019s speeches which they play non-stop.\u201d Are you serious? I\u2019m all for a bit of Churchill, but a pungent 15x12 cubicle isn\u2019t traditionally the place where I urgently need to hear some inspirational rhetoric. 48 min Lingard is booked for a foul on Kovacic. 47 min \u201cSloppy?\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cYou bet. Putting too much pressure on De Gea and Maguire to bail them out? When you have one of the best goalies in the world why not. Will this work against Liverpool and MC? Probably not. Are you not entertained? Yes I am.\u201d What\u2019s the antonym of eavesdropping? 46 min Peep peep! Chelsea begin the second half. \u201cIf Rashford was a different nationality... it\u2019s odd how his profligacy is readily accepted, not even 1 in 4 (and he takes penalties),\u201d says Andrew Hurley. \u201cHe will, as usual, have five games where he looks full of potential, then disappear, but the hope will always be there for next season. United have another one of these in Martial. With Sanchez having lost his verve and seemingly desire, who will score for United this season? They look woefully short up front (and in centre midfield, where a player like McTominay should be 5th choice if United have decent midfielders). How have they spent so much money and ended up like this?\u201d I like Rashford, personally. I thought the same about McTominay, but he was a revelation against Barcelona last season, has a great attitude (which is important in this team) and could - could - have the same influence as Darren Fletcher. I know what you mean, though - despite spending \u00a3700m in the last five seasons, this team needs loads of work. The biggest problem is the lack of a coherent strategy, so they now have a squad that has been put together by five different (very different, in some cases) managers. They need to give somebody three years minimum to sort the mess out. I doubt they will, though. \u201cAs he was such a scapegoat last year, I would like to give a shout-out to Jorginho for his incisive passing, movement, and positioning,\u201d says Adam Kline-Schoder. \u201cEven though it\u2019s certainly early days, I really like the look of a much-less-constrained-by-a-strict-system Jorginho. I think it\u2019s always good when footballers are given the platform they need to perform to the max, which he seems to have now. I am hopeful that realising that this (rather than slow, ponderous, sideways passing) is his baseline will inspire a select subset of Chelsea supporters to take another chance on him!\u201d Yes he\u2019s played two or three lovely passes to cut out the United midfield. He and Barkley have been really impressive. Half-time reading Peep peep! United lead through Marcus Rashford\u2019s emphatic penalty, but their performance has been pretty ragged. Chelsea have been much the better side and hit the post twice. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. 45+1 min Two minutes of added time. 45 min I don\u2019t think you can play Pogba in a midfield two. It worked for France because of the quality of those alongside and behind him, but in this team it is putting far too much pressure on Scott McTominay and the defence. 44 min Rashford plays a cute pass inside the area to Martial, who then decides to play silly buggers and is dispossessed. 40 min: Emerson hits the post! This is absurd. Chelsea could be 3-1 or 4-1 up. Jorginho\u2019s chipped cross somehow finds its way through to Emerson, lurking to the left of the six-yard box. He takes a touch and thrashes a rising shot that hits the inside of the post and rebounds to safety. 39 min: Chance for Chelsea! Pedro finds Barkley on the left of the area. He moves the ball away from Lindelof and hits a left-footed shot that is kicked away by de Gea. As David Brent didn\u2019t say, I don\u2019t call this a scoreline, I call it a scorelie: Chelsea have been excellent, much the better team. 37 min \u201cPogba\u2019s changed his mentality over the summer then?\u201d says Kevin Wilson. \u201cI don\u2019t get his Harlem Globetrotter shtick; you\u2019ve got bloody teammates.\u201d I\u2019m sensing rancour. 36 min Zouma, who is having a bit of a beast, is booked for a bad tackle on Pereira. 36 min Pedro shoots straight at De Gea from 25 yards. Chelsea are looking dangerous again. 35 min Barkley curls a crisp low shot just wide from 20 yards. De Gea had it covered, I suspect, but it was a good effort from a player who has started very brightly. 34 min: Rashford has a goal disallowed for offside. And he was miles offside. 32 min Wan-Bissaka, who has had an excellent start to his United career, surges back to tackle Barkley and thwart a dangerous Chelsea break. 31 min Mount wastes a good opportunity. Barkley found him on the right of the area with a penetrative angled pass that went through McTominay. Mount should have taken the shot on but instead tried to cut it back towards Abraham. It was overhit and Wan-Bissaka cleared. 29 min Chelsea, who were winded by the goal, have started to move the ball around again. Some of their passing and movement has been excellent. 26 min United have had 69 per cent possession in the last 10 minutes. It\u2019s an intriguing game between two young, keen yet vulnerable sides. 24 min The goal has calmed United down, and they are starting to look better on the ball. 22 min Christensen is receiving treatment after being caught in the face by Pogba\u2019s arm as they both went for a header. 21 min Pereira\u2019s mishit free-kick from the left finds its way through to Maguire beyond the far post. His driven cross is deflected behind for a corner, which comes to nothing. 19 min That goal wasn\u2019t against the run of play; it was an affront to the run of play. Rashford scores emphatically, crashing the ball into the top-left corner. Kepa went the right way but had no chance. It was a clear penalty, a really clumsy tackle from Zouma after Rashford turned back inside him near the edge of the box. 17 min Zouma trips Rashford in the area, and Anthony Taylor points to the spot. 15 min As Gary Neville points out on Sky, Rashford is not going back to defend against Azpilicueta, so Shaw has to deal with both him and Pedro. 12 min Mount receives pass 25 yards from goal, gets the ball out of his feet and cracks a good shot that is saved by de Gea. This has been a superb start from Chelsea and a troubling one for United. 11 min Chelsea have had 68 per cent of the possession so far. 10 min There\u2019s a bit of a strut about Chelsea. After another good passing move, Pedro\u2019s low cross drifts right across the six-yard box, just in front of the unmarked Abraham. He would have had an open goal. 7 min: Martial misses a good chance! Chelsea tried to play out from the back, only for Zouma to slide an abysmal pass across the edge of his own area. It ran past Jorginho, the intended target, and went straight to Martial, whose first-time curler was too close to Kepa. He didn\u2019t really get hold of it. 6 min \u201cHi Mr. Smyth,\u201d says Bill Hargreaves. \u201cLovely to see that you\u2019ve swapped MCC blazer for football rattle and prawn sandwich. Great also to see Mou back in the PL, although as a pundit this time with Sky. He\u2019s box office, no doubt, and worth watching. I can\u2019t help thinking that these three pundits have Spurs too far ahead of the chasing pack of Chelsea, United and the Arsenal, though, especially with Arsenal\u2019s summer and their beginning to mature under a proven manager. I think Mou\u2019s quite astute here in saying that a number of other clubs will also be running the top six pretty close come May. I\u2019m so excited I could go on a foreign owner protest march.\u201d 5 min This is a superb start from Chelsea, who looked dynamic and confident. 4 min: Abraham hits the post! The Chelsea corner was only half-cleared by United and came back to Abraham on the edge of the area. He rolled Rashford, turned and hit a thunderous first-time shot that beat de Gea and slammed off the far post. 3 min Chelsea have started confidently. Mount springs down the right and hits a cross that is headed behind by Maguire. 2 min Emerson has an early run at Wan-Bissaka, who wins the ball decisively to prompt a lusty cheer from the Stretford End. 1 min Peep peep! United get the match under way, kicking from left to right. They are in red; Chelsea are in blue. It looks like United are playing Rashford on the left and Martial up front. Having heard Solskjaer\u2019s interview, I suspect Manchester United will play a diamond midfield, with Lingard behind Rashford and Martial. We\u2019ll soon find out, tactics fans. Pre-match interviews Ole Gunnar Solskjaer \u201cI\u2019ll tell [Maguire and Wan-Bissaka] to just go and enjoy playing at Old Trafford. This is what they\u2019ve been waiting for. They arere two players who we\u2019re sure will be fan favourites. \u201cThe first game is always emotional. Things happen that you can\u2019t normally explain. You want to build momentum. Football is a results business; it\u2019s always the last game that you remember and discuss. \u201cAnthony Martial, by nature, is more of a No9 than a winger. He\u2019s a goalscorer, tricky in and around the box, and we want to get him as close to the goal as possible.\u201d Frank Lampard \u201cI hope Mason continues his form with Derby last season and then in pre-season \u2013 I think he stepped up a level there and he deserves his opportunity. He\u2019s got energy in abundance but he\u2019s also got quality. This is a big test for him but I\u2019ve got complete confidence \u2013 not just today but as a player in general. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a tough game. We want to make a good start and we\u2019re confident going into the game.\u201d Harry Maguire speaks \u201cI\u2019m really proud to join this club and I\u2019m looking forward to playing now. It\u2019s a big game to start. We want to be on the front foot and play in their half. The atmosphere will be unbelievable \u2013 I played here last year on the opening as well and I know it will be great.\u201d Jos\u00e9 Mourinho department \u201cI guess this is na\u00efve,\u201d says Francis Mead, \u201cbut Angel Gomes looks a fantastic player. Please just put him in the team and play him. Give him a chance - please, please, please.\u201d He was included in the matchday squad. What more do you want? Both managers have picked young sides. The oldest player in in the United team is the captain David de Gea, 28. The oldest outfield player is Jesse Lingard, who is reportedly 26. Chelsea have only three players over the age of 25 - Cesar Azpilicueta, Jorginho and the game\u2019s only thirtysomething, Pedro. What a difference 11 years makes Manchester United give debuts to Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Harry Maguire, while Frank Lampard prefers Mason Mount to Christian Pulisic. Tammy Abraham, who made two appearances as substitute in 2015-16, starts his first league game for Chelsea. Manchester United (4-2-3-1) De Gea; Wan-Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire, Shaw; Pogba, McTominay; Lingard, Pereira, Rashford; Martial. Substitutes: Romero, Mata, Young, James, Greenwood, Matic, Tuanzebe. Chelsea (4-2-3-1) Kepa; Azpilicueta, Christensen, Zouma, Emerson; Jorginho, Kovacic; Pedro, Mount, Barkley; Abraham. Substitutes: Alonso, Kante, Caballero, Kenedy, Giroud, Pulisic, Tomori. Referee Anthony Taylor. There\u2019s just over half an hour remaining at St James\u2019 Park, where Newcastle are playing Arsenal. You won\u2019t believe the score! Essential pre-match reading This transfer news, from the PA wires, is best digested with a nice Chianti Highly-rated Monaco teenager Hannibal Mejbri is heading to Manchester United in a $10m deal, subject to FIFA clearance. The 16-year-old\u2019s future has been subject to widespread speculation this summer, with Leicester and Tottenham among those understood to be after the midfielder. But United have announced that they have \u201creached an agreement with Monaco for Hannibal Mejbri to join the club subject to FIFA approval\u201d. PA understands the deal to be worth up to $10m (\u00a39.3m), with the Ligue 1 club receiving half up front and the rest in potential add-ons. Bjorn Hardley, previously with NAC Breda, is another player awaiting international clearance, but United have confirmed three other under-18 players have received the required clearances. Dillon Hoogewerf has arrived from Ajax and Mateo Mejia from Real Zaragoza, while goalkeeper Johan Guadagno has joined from IF Brommapojkarna. United also announced that Under-23 squad members Paul Woolston and Luca Ercolani have signed new contracts. Hello and welcome to live coverage of more football. Between them, Manchester United and Chelsea have won the title in 18 of the 27 Premier League seasons. This year, they start as 50-1 outsiders. Let that marinate for a few seconds: before they\u2019ve kicked a ball, Manchester United and Chelsea are 50-1 to win the title. For both teams, the realistic grail is fourth place rather than first. Both have been in endless transition - United since 2013, Chelsea since about 2007. And though Chelsea have managed to win a few titles in that time, an extraordinary achievement in many ways, such fleeting relationships with managers rarely create the same memories. And so, after trying all kinds of coaches, both clubs have gone back to what they know: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Frank Lampard, who manages Chelsea for the first time today. The biggest challenge for those two is to juggle the short- and long-term. They need to satisfy the instant demands of modern football \u2013 these days, even the neutrals have a sense of entitlement \u2013 to buy themselves enough time to rebuild a broken dressing-room. In a sane culture, they would be guaranteed at least three years to invest in young players - whether they be homegrown, like the Masons, Greenwood and Mount, or imported, like Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Christian Pulisic. But Solskjaer and Lampard will not get that guarantee; not at these clubs, not even with their popularity. A good start is important, then - particularly for United, given the toxic end to last season. There will still be plenty of opening-day optimism at Old Trafford, especially if the two XIs include a handful of those young players. If all concerned show enough patience, United and Chelsea shouldn\u2019t be 50-1 outsiders in years to come. But that\u2019s a pretty big if. Kick off is at 4.30pm.",

The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2007:&nbsp;</b>The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive\u2019s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong&nbsp;Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2014:&nbsp;</b>The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of \u201cfake universal suffrage\u201d and \u201cfake democracy\u201d. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015,&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls.

      "bodyText": "Hong Kong has once more descended into violence, with police firing teargas at protesters across the city as mass demonstrations calling for democracy entered their 10th consecutive week. Clashes with police were particularly intense on Sunday night compared with previous days, as riot police fired teargas into a railway station to disperse crowds and were captured on film beating protesters with batons as they fled down an escalator in another station. Other protesters were injured as undercover riot police turned on a crowd in Causeway Bay and began to arrest people, while widely circulated photos on social media showed one woman bleeding profusely from her eye after she was hit by police fire at another demonstration. Police also suffered casualties, according to authorities. It came as Cathay Pacific bowed to pressure from China, sacking two ground crew and suspending a pilot for \u201cmisconduct\u201d in supporting the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests. The Hong Kong flag carrier airline, whose biggest shareholder is the Swire Group, chaired by the British billionaire Barnaby Swire, said it had fired two ground staff members for allegedly leaking the travel arrangements for a Hong Kong police football team travelling to the mainland for a tournament. The company said it was \u201caware of the inappropriate behaviour of an employee involving the misuse of company information\u201d after a Cathay employee was accused by the Chinese state of posting details of the Hong Kong police officers travelling on the airline. The airline also said it had suspended a pilot who took part in pro-democracy protests, and faces charges for rioting. Cathay said the pilot was removed from flying duties on 30 July. Cathay said it would also comply with a directive from Beijing banning all staff who support the protests from working on flights to the mainland or through its airspace. China\u2019s aviation regulator has ordered the airline to hand over identifying information for staff on mainland-bound flights effective immediately. The airline told all staff that it viewed the demonstrations as \u201cillegal protests\u201d, and if they took part they would be banned from flights. \u201cCathay Pacific Group\u2019s operations in mainland China are key to our business. In addition to flying in and out of mainland China, a large number of our routes both to Europe and to the USA also fly through mainland China airspace,\u201d its chief executive, Rupert Hogg, said. The luxury fashion label Versace and its artistic director, Donatella Versace, apologised to China after one of its T-shirts was criticised for identifying the semi-autonomous regions of Hong Kong and Macau as countries. On a tumultuous day in the city, protesters dressed in protective masks and goggles with long-sleeved shirts and trousers to protect them from teargas moved back and forth across the city\u2019s subway system as police pushed crowds from one neighbourhood to the next. Chants such as \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our time\u201d rang out as demonstrators filed into escalators alongside commuters and baffled tourists. \u201cThey sacrifice themselves,\u201d an admiring bystander said as groups of young protesters crowded into his subway carriage bound for the Kowloon peninsula to reinforce a police-protester standoff. \u201cWhat they gain is for [all of] us.\u201d At Kwai Fong station, police fired teargas to disperse crowds. Earlier, they used batons to try to stop protesters. Police said one officer had been injured by a petrol bomb hurled by a protester in Tsim Sha Tsui and that bricks had also been hurled at officers. While many in Hong Kong appear to support the protesters, including ordinary people who have shown up in their hundreds of thousands at peaceful marches this summer, its chief executive, Carrie Lam, has maintained that protesters are largely violent fringe elements who have taken advantage of a civil disobedience movement. Beijing has also signalled that it is losing patience with the protests. Its Hong Kong affairs department has spoken to the media twice in recent weeks to warn protesters that their actions will not be tolerated. Protests began in Hong Kong in early June when Lam attempted to push through a legislative bill that would have allowed for residents to appear before criminal courts in mainland China. Many residents saw the bill as a wedge issue that would lead to their loss of civil and political rights, promised until 2047 under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d agreement. The bill prompted the largest demonstrations since Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997, but Lam has steadfastly refused to meet any demands beyond a promise that the bill is now \u201csuspended\u201d. Many of its detractors, including a number of retirees and families, returned to Victoria Park in the thousands on Sunday afternoon for an assembly against the bill and to repeat their oft-heard demands that Lam withdraw it permanently and step down. At about 5pm, many pushed out of the park despite a police ban and into the shopping district of Causeway Bay and down Hennessy Road where they gathered close to police headquarters. \u201cWe are aware of what will happen,\u201d a protester, Cherry Tsang, said as she prepared to leave Victoria Park, \u201cbut I think it is actually freedom of speech.\u201d Ting Wai Fong, a retiree, said she was determined to keep coming to protests and march through the city to support the young generation. She said protesters now faced the dual terror of arrest and imprisonment as well as mobs of pro-China supporters, who attacked journalists including a reporter with the public broadcaster RTHK on Sunday and clashed with protesters the previous week. \u201cIf we are afraid, if we are not coming out to rally, we are encouraging these people to spread the terror,\u201d she said. As thousands brought traffic to a standstill on Hong Kong island, a smaller simultaneous demonstration at Sham Shui Po in Kowloon was the first to be hit with police teargas. Similar standoffs followed near police headquarters before the mostly young protesters decamped en masse for the Kowloon peninsula where many had already barricaded an important cross-harbour tunnel. Protests looked likely to continue well into the night with police stationed at a number of subway exits across the city in apparent preparation to tackle new flashmob protest tactics.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s easy to despair. The scale of the problems we face looms as large as the shadows cast by unpalatable leaders. What stirs some into action for the first time leaves others feeling simply overwhelmed. What can any one person do?</p> <p>When the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change put out a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/08/climate-crisis-reducing-lands-ability-to-sustain-humanity-says-ipcc\" title=\"\">landmark report</a> this week, warning that global heating is damaging the ability of the land to sustain humanity, many news outlets summarised it with the injunction: eat less meat. It was an easily relatable way into the story and told audiences what they could do to help \u2013 an essential part of tackling the climate crisis. It was certainly a more accessible angle than the lengthy report\u2019s advice on issues such as smallholders and soil protection.</p> <p>The danger of such an approach is that great demands can become reduced to individual purchasing decisions, conveniently freeing politicians from making unpopular choices or businesses from reducing their profits. It isn\u2019t a coincidence that so many issues are framed as purely personal choices. It is easier to blame dietary ignorance, sloth and greed for soaring levels of obesity than to tackle an obesogenic environment and the powerful \u201cbig food\u201d lobby which has helped to create it. It is easier to encourage individuals to take up meditation than to tackle the social and economic factors contributing to many people\u2019s mental health issues.</p> <p>Deforestation has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/07/bolsonaro-amazon-deforestation-exploded-july-data\" title=\"\">soared</a> in the Amazon, the world\u2019s largest rainforest, under Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s watch. A new report <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/16/trump-drilling-leases-pollution-eu-climate-change\" title=\"\">suggests</a> that leases from the Trump administration of public lands and waters for oil and gas drilling could lead to more carbon emissions than the entire European Union contributes in a year. In this context, focusing on dinner plates can sound trivial. Relying on the conscience of individual shoppers is not a substitute for governmental commitments to drastically curb carbon emissions and introduce the laws, taxes and investment which can produce a more sustainable society.</p> <p>But it is a critical part of the solution. Reining in the rise in global temperatures does not depend on Brazil curbing its destruction of the world\u2019s largest rainforest, or on European holidaymakers flying less, or on the US cutting back on fossil fuels. It depends on all these things, and much more \u2013 as the IPCC report so devastatingly shows. </p> <p>Governments and businesses follow as well as lead. They will not introduce policies which they consider political or commercial suicide. But nor will they persist with those which cost them too much support. The history of social movements tells us that ideas which seem radical and bizarre \u2013 like granting women the right to vote \u2013 can quickly become regarded as normal and even self-evident. </p> <p>When Greta Thunberg, then an unknown teenager, decided to protest about the climate crisis outside the Swedish parliament, it led to one and a half million students around the world participating in a school strike. The head of Opec <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/05/biggest-compliment-yet-greta-thunberg-welcomes-oil-chiefs-greatest-threat-label\" title=\"\">called the movement</a> \u201cperhaps the greatest threat\u201d to the oil industry.</p> <p>As Ms Thunberg herself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jul/21/great-thunberg-you-ask-the-questions-see-us-as-a-threat 0\" title=\"\">insists</a>, \u201cYou cannot have system change without individual change.\u201d In climate activism the \u201cthink global, act local\u201d link is both long-established and tangible. But it is also a useful model for other campaigning. However grim the situation, inaction will make it worse. We should be suspicious of attempts to reduce issues to individual consumer choices; mindful of the need for personal changes; and awake to the chance that even small shifts may trigger much greater ones.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s easy to despair. The scale of the problems we face looms as large as the shadows cast by unpalatable leaders. What stirs some into action for the first time leaves others feeling simply overwhelmed. What can any one person do? When the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change put out a landmark report this week, warning that global heating is damaging the ability of the land to sustain humanity, many news outlets summarised it with the injunction: eat less meat. It was an easily relatable way into the story and told audiences what they could do to help \u2013 an essential part of tackling the climate crisis. It was certainly a more accessible angle than the lengthy report\u2019s advice on issues such as smallholders and soil protection. The danger of such an approach is that great demands can become reduced to individual purchasing decisions, conveniently freeing politicians from making unpopular choices or businesses from reducing their profits. It isn\u2019t a coincidence that so many issues are framed as purely personal choices. It is easier to blame dietary ignorance, sloth and greed for soaring levels of obesity than to tackle an obesogenic environment and the powerful \u201cbig food\u201d lobby which has helped to create it. It is easier to encourage individuals to take up meditation than to tackle the social and economic factors contributing to many people\u2019s mental health issues. Deforestation has soared in the Amazon, the world\u2019s largest rainforest, under Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s watch. A new report suggests that leases from the Trump administration of public lands and waters for oil and gas drilling could lead to more carbon emissions than the entire European Union contributes in a year. In this context, focusing on dinner plates can sound trivial. Relying on the conscience of individual shoppers is not a substitute for governmental commitments to drastically curb carbon emissions and introduce the laws, taxes and investment which can produce a more sustainable society. But it is a critical part of the solution. Reining in the rise in global temperatures does not depend on Brazil curbing its destruction of the world\u2019s largest rainforest, or on European holidaymakers flying less, or on the US cutting back on fossil fuels. It depends on all these things, and much more \u2013 as the IPCC report so devastatingly shows. Governments and businesses follow as well as lead. They will not introduce policies which they consider political or commercial suicide. But nor will they persist with those which cost them too much support. The history of social movements tells us that ideas which seem radical and bizarre \u2013 like granting women the right to vote \u2013 can quickly become regarded as normal and even self-evident. When Greta Thunberg, then an unknown teenager, decided to protest about the climate crisis outside the Swedish parliament, it led to one and a half million students around the world participating in a school strike. The head of Opec called the movement \u201cperhaps the greatest threat\u201d to the oil industry. As Ms Thunberg herself insists, \u201cYou cannot have system change without individual change.\u201d In climate activism the \u201cthink global, act local\u201d link is both long-established and tangible. But it is also a useful model for other campaigning. However grim the situation, inaction will make it worse. We should be suspicious of attempts to reduce issues to individual consumer choices; mindful of the need for personal changes; and awake to the chance that even small shifts may trigger much greater ones.",

In that opening half, Rangers had only poor finishing to blame for not being on easy street as their intensity overawed the visitors. Jermain Defoe notched the first goal of a hat-trick inside 10 minutes after reacting quickest to a Sheyi Ojo long-range shot which Ofir Marciano could only parry. The former England striker\u2019s second arrived after the excellent Jordan Jones fed Ojo, who supplied the perfect cut-back. Horgan stunned Ibrox five minutes before the interval, following Allan\u2019s creative touch. \u201cIt was a magnificent pass, I would have been proud of that myself,\u201d said Gerrard. Mackie protested against his second yellow \u2013 for handball \u2013 when he would have been better served ruing his own stupidity. Rangers were of a mind to rub salt into Hibs wounds; Steven Davis tossed up a terrific cross for Defoe to head home at the back post. This marked his first treble for three and a half years. \u201cThere have been a few braces in that time,\u201d Defoe said afterwards. Alfredo Morelos, who started the game among Gerrard\u2019s substitutes, scored two almost identical goals from an angle, just inside the penalty area, in what afforded a fair complexion to the scoreline. Worse was to follow for Heckingbottom as Ojo\u2019s stoppage-time shot bounded past Marciano via a deflection from David Gray. \u201cIt got tougher as the minutes went on,\u201d the Hibs manager said. \u201cWe made bad decisions with 10 men but we were second best for long spells at 11 v 11 as well. I could sit here and give Rangers all the credit in the world but I\u2019m more concerned with our performance.\u201d Gerrard hinted he might be of a mind to add a third striker to supplement Defoe and Morelos. If this result suggested such a signing is barely needed, perhaps this was an indicator of the manager\u2019s aspirations. It won\u2019t always be as blissfully straightforward as this; one assumes, at least.",

The real story begins many years before when young students and postgraduates are being developed in our universities and laboratories.The ease or difficulty of studying and commencing a career in Britain is what will determine whether they develop those links that will bring them here to stay. I am reminded of the slogan on car stickers in the 1980s in an era of cuts in education: \u201cIf you think education is expensive, try ignorance!\u201d Sarah Sheils York \u2022 It\u2019s strange for Boris Johnson to choose Culham as the national scientific facility to demonstrate the UK\u2019s strength as a scientific nation free from European bureaucracy. The principal research facility at Culham is called JET: the Joint European Torus, a circular fusion research reactor which started off as a fully EU-supported project in the 1970s and is now substantially supported by the Eurofusion research consortium. Under Brexit, it\u2019s not clear how JET\u2019s funding will be guaranteed. Professor Norman Dombey University of Sussex \u2022 I\u2019m fascinated by the government\u2019s plan to \u201cturbo-charge\u201d no-deal Brexit plans. My car has a turbo-charger which works by blowing hot air into the engine. Is their policy based on the same principle? Robin Joy Canterbury, Kent",

      "bodyText": "The mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, has challenged Boris Johnson to visit the city and apologise directly for once publishing an article claiming drunken fans were partly responsible for the Hillsborough tragedy, after it was reported the government was reluctant to hold a major conference in the city. Anderson said on Sunday he had offered to host what the government has billed as \u201cthe biggest ever northern powerhouse conference\u201d on 13 September after Sheffield, the initial prospective host, could not find a suitable venue. But he said his offer of the Arena and Convention Centre, which hosted last year\u2019s Labour party conference, had been turned down. It is understood Johnson has not been formally invited to the conference and No 10 rejected any suggestion he was blocking or delaying the decision. With barely a month to go, Downing Street has still not revealed where the conference will take place. It adds salt to wounds first opened up when Johnson chose Manchester as the venue for his first speech as the prime minister last month, using it to back a new high-speed rail link between Manchester and Leeds without making any mention of Liverpool. It was a \u201cshortsighted omission\u201d, said Anderson, who insisted more people currently travel by rail between Liverpool and Manchester than Manchester to Leeds. Asked if Johnson would get a \u201cwarm welcome\u201d were he to visit Liverpool, Anderson said: \u201cHe\u2019d get a hot welcome. It wouldn\u2019t be warm.\u201d Anderson said Liverpudlians had not forgotten the editorial Johnson published when he was the editor of the Spectator, in 2004, which claimed the people of Liverpool were \u201chooked on grief\u201d and blamed \u201cdrunken fans\u201d for contributing to the Hillsborough disaster of 1989 in which 96 people were killed. The Liverpool Echo had originally reported the city was being overlooked in the deliberations on who would host September\u2019s Convention of the North. \u201cThere is a feeling in the local halls of power that government simply doesn\u2019t want to come here,\u201d the paper had said. Shortly before Johnson entered Downing Street, the paper also ran a story with the headline \u201cLiverpool won\u2019t forget what prime minister hopeful Boris Johnson did\u201d. During his first prime minister\u2019s questions, Johnson refused to apologise for publishing the remarks when he was reminded of them by the Labour MP for Garston and Halewood, Maria Eagle. Back in 2012, when he was still mayor of London, Johnson had said he \u201cbitterly regretted\u201d the offence caused, but insisted he did not write the offending article. \u201cIf he came into the city and apologised directly then he might have a better chance of being given more respect, rather than just saying sorry from down south,\u201d Anderson said.

Does this mean that we can expect, on 1 November, that Cummings, Johnson, Rees-Mogg et al will be whisked up to heaven, leaving the rest of us to manage as best we can down here on earth? I am starting to find that quite an attractive prospect.

Wynn was a lifelong Liberal and, after three years at the ESU, he jumped at the chance to join the Liberal party as secretary general, a job he did for seven years. There, he steered the party, under the leadership of David Steel, through the formation of the Liberal alliance with the SDP. In 1984 he retired and then returned to the Liberals as joint honorary treasurer for four more years. Wynn and Oswynne moved to Avebury, Wiltshire, in 1987, only for him to be recruited as chair of Avebury in Danger, the conservation group established to defend the World Heritage site from commercial developers, which it did successfully. He was knighted in 1984. Wynn\u2019s passions in life were the \u201cfour Ps\u201d: people, play (he was an excellent sportsman), politics and parenthood. He was a wonderful and humorous father and grandfather. He is survived by Oswynne and his three children, Julia, Kate and me, from his first marriage, and two grandchildren, James and Leo.",

There is some mystery around exactly how he made his money but he became wealthy after forming his own company J Epstein&amp;Co and linking up with powerful businessmen including Leslie Wexner, the founder of the company that owns the Victoria\u2019s Secret lingerie brand. Epstein befriended prominent figures in entertainment, politics, business and economics, but his jetset lifestyle started to unravel in 2005 when police in Palm Beach, Florida began investigating when a parent complained that he molested her 14-year-old daughter. The girl was allegedly paid to strip and massage Epstein at his Palm Beach mansion. Lawyers for Epstein brokered a much-criticised plea deal in Florida in 2008 that closed a federal inquiry involving at least 40 girls under 18 years of age. Under this arrangement, Epstein registered as a sex offender and pleaded guilty to state charges, which presented far less potential jail time than if he had faced federal charges. Then, following a bombshell investigation published in November 2018 by the Miami Herald, Epstein was arrested last month and charged with sex trafficking. He pleaded not guilty and was preparing for trial when he died in prison on Saturday. What were the charges levelled against him at the time of his death? Epstein faced up to 45 years in prison on US federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. Court documents allege that Epstein recruited dozens of victims, some of whom he trained to recruit others, in an alleged arrangement lasting at least five years in the early 2000s.

He was held on remand at the Manhattan correctional centre in New York. Who were his rich and powerful friends? Epstein travelled to Africa with Bill Clinton on his private jet, became a friend of Donald Trump who once described Epstein as a \u201cterrific guy\u201d, hosted the Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz on his private island and socialised with Prince Andrew. How have former friends reacted to the charges against Epstein?

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of people deported from the UK were restrained by a variety of methods including shackles, the Guardian has learned. There were 447 cases where one or more forms of restraint were used between April 2018 and March 2019. Information on restraint using rigid bar handcuffs, leg restraints and waist restraint belts was provided to the Guardian in a freedom of information response. Home Office policy states that there is a presumption against the use of restraint, but in 335 cases, the majority, more than one form of restraint was used at the same time. In 102 cases three different pieces of restraint equipment were used. Home Office subcontractors that provide escorting services are trained in restraint procedures. MPs and human rights campaigners condemned the evidence of widespread use of restraint during deportations. Labour\u2019s David Lammy said the new data was chilling and revealed an abuse of power. A report from her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Prisons published on Friday raised concerns about the use of restraint on a charter flight to Nigeria and Ghana earlier this year. It said: \u201cWaist restraint belts were still being used on cooperative detainees for extremely long periods without them being given a chance to demonstrate compliance. It is unacceptable that this problem continues to occur despite promises of remedial action.\u201d A previous report last year condemned the excessive use of restraint on another charter flight, when 22 of 23 passengers were held in waist restraint belts even though most had no history of disruption and were deemed low risk. Deportees on the charter flight to Jamaica in February this year, one of the Home Office\u2019s most recent charter flights, told the Guardian that everyone had been restrained for at least part of the journey. A Home Office spokesman declined to comment on the arrangements for that flight. Much of the restraint used during deportations takes place on Home Office-commissioned charter flights. Lovelyn Edobor, a disabled Nigerian victim of trafficking, said that when the Home Office tried to deport her in 2017 she was placed in a waist restraint belt attached to a long chain and dragged along. Home Office officials said a full review of the department\u2019s Homes manual on safe escorting was under way to ensure that current techniques were still the most effective. Much of the guidance about restraint during deportation follows the death of Jimmy Mubenga in 2010. The Angolan suffered cardio-respiratory collapse caused by restraint and an inquest jury found that he had been unlawfully killed, in a case revealed by the Guardian. The technique of pushing his head down hard so that any noise he made was directed toward the floor was nicknamed carpet karaoke. Home Office guidance drawn up in 2016 and which officials say is still current emphasises the need for risk assessments to be carried out before restraints are applied. Restraint should be carried out in a way that \u201cpreserves the dignity of the detainee\u201d, but elderly, infirm and terminally ill people are not automatically exempt.

A UK parliament spokesperson said: \u201cWe are in the process of transferring ownership of the area to parliament and have installed a pass-activated gate to better manage the area for those entering the estate. \u201cWe continue to engage with partners on addressing the difficult issue of rough sleeping in and around the station constructively and sympathetically.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 13 August 2019. An earlier version incorrectly stated that the land had been transferred from Westminster City Council to parliament. In fact it was transferred from Transport for London.",

The combination of the complex, grumpy detective, played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/feb/22/broadcasting.guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">John Thaw</a>, the Oxford setting of the underlying novels by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/21/colin-dexter-obituary\" title=\"\">Colin Dexter</a> and the 100-minute length of each episode created scope for a very distinctive approach.</p> <p>As Bazz (or Barry, or Bazza) recalled: \u201cMorse is a very melancholic character, so the tune had to be melancholic, and he was a lover of classical music, so it should be an orchestral score and not a synthesiser. He has a very cryptic mind, he loves doing crosswords; we came up with the obvious idea \u2013 his name is Morse and we use Morse code in the music.\u201d The spelling out of his name fitted into a rhythm that suggested a harmonic structure: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEfv6QtYFAM\" title=\"\">I picked up my guitar and there was the tune</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Over the course of 13 years, 33 episodes of Morse were broadcast, and Bazz also provided the music for a sequel, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzsqlAbFeIw\" title=\"\">Lewis, later Inspector Lewis</a> (2006-15), with Morse\u2019s sergeant (<a href=\"https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2018-07-07/britains-favourite-crime-drama-inspector-morse-lewis-kevin-whately-john-thaw/\" title=\"\">Kevin Whately</a>) moving centre stage. He did the same for a prequel, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/zteDDSn6E4Y?t=38\" title=\"\">Endeavour</a> (2012-18), with Shaun Evans as the young Morse.</p> <p>Bazz\u2019s big break in television had come in 1985 with the series Boon, starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/sep/11/guardianobituaries1\" title=\"\">Michael Elphick</a>.

More TV detective drama came with early series of Dalziel and Pascoe (1996-98).</p> <p>Born in the Sydney beach suburb of Manly, Bazz was the son of John Pheloung, a commercial artist of Irish-English descent, and Adel (nee Reber), a nurse of German-Spanish heritage.

      "bodyText": "In 1987, the Australian composer Barrington Pheloung, who has died aged 65 of respiratory failure, provided the haunting theme and incidental music to the ITV crime drama series Inspector Morse. The combination of the complex, grumpy detective, played by John Thaw, the Oxford setting of the underlying novels by Colin Dexter and the 100-minute length of each episode created scope for a very distinctive approach. As Bazz (or Barry, or Bazza) recalled: \u201cMorse is a very melancholic character, so the tune had to be melancholic, and he was a lover of classical music, so it should be an orchestral score and not a synthesiser. He has a very cryptic mind, he loves doing crosswords; we came up with the obvious idea \u2013 his name is Morse and we use Morse code in the music.\u201d The spelling out of his name fitted into a rhythm that suggested a harmonic structure: \u201cI picked up my guitar and there was the tune.\u201d Over the course of 13 years, 33 episodes of Morse were broadcast, and Bazz also provided the music for a sequel, Lewis, later Inspector Lewis (2006-15), with Morse\u2019s sergeant (Kevin Whately) moving centre stage. He did the same for a prequel, Endeavour (2012-18), with Shaun Evans as the young Morse. Bazz\u2019s big break in television had come in 1985 with the series Boon, starring Michael Elphick. The opportunity came through Anthony Minghella, who was one of the show\u2019s writers; the producer was Kenny McBain, who went on to give him the Morse commission. In 1986 Minghella asked Bazz to score the music for his play Made in Bangkok, which led to further stage commissions. TV series and documentaries also followed, and Minghella asked Bazz to contribute to the soundtrack for his film Truly, Madly, Deeply (1990), starring Juliet Stevenson and Alan Rickman. Bazz appeared on camera playing the double bass as one of the ghostly quartet of friends. He went on to score and direct the music for Nostradamus (1994), directed by Roger Christian, and Hilary and Jackie (1998), with Emily Watson as the cellist Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9, and Shopgirl (2005), both directed by Anand Tucker. More TV detective drama came with early series of Dalziel and Pascoe (1996-98). Born in the Sydney beach suburb of Manly, Bazz was the son of John Pheloung, a commercial artist of Irish-English descent, and Adel (nee Reber), a nurse of German-Spanish heritage. His grandfather, Jerry Pheloung, was a trumpeter who had led the Manly Municipal Brass Band to be Australasian Champions in 1911. Bazz was a drummer in the local army cadets band and, having taken up the guitar at the age of six, began playing in blues bands with his brother Pip during his teens. However, discovering Bach in his late teens led him to take up the guitar, and after leaving St Aloysius\u2019 college he worked as a postman to save for the fare to London to study.

      "body": "<p>The Pakistani prime minister, Imran Khan, has likened the Indian government to Nazis, warning that global inaction over Kashmir would be the same as appeasing Hitler.</p> \n<p>His comments came as authorities in Indian-administered Kashmir reportedly reimposed some curfew rules in parts of the territory, following an easing of restrictions in Srinagar, the region\u2019s main city, that had allowed people to visit shops over the weekend and attend Friday prayers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1a6ba9a1-6cf4-4c41-97ae-7af3f3152187\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Who controls Kashmir?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The region in the foothills of the Himalayas has been under dispute since&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/india\">India</a>&nbsp;and Pakistan came into being in 1947.</p>\n    <p>Both claim it in full, but each controls a section of the territory, separated by one of the world's most heavily militarised borders: the \u2018line of control\u2019 based on a ceasefire border established after a 1947-48 war. China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>TV news showed footage of jeeps fitted with loudspeakers moving in the region on Sunday afternoon, telling people to return to their homes and shopkeepers to shut markets. Landlines, mobile phones and the internet all remain blocked, preventing residents from calling relatives or friends.</p> \n<p>It was not clear if people would be allowed to leave their homes for Monday\u2019s Eid-al-Adha festival, one of the biggest celebrations of the year in Kashmir.</p> \n<p>The state has been in lockdown since Monday, when the Indian government announced it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/05/india-revoke-disputed-kashmir-special-status\">revoke its autonomy</a> and rules that prevent outsiders from buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris fear the move would alter the demography of India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state and its traditions.</p> \n<p>Despite heavy security, hundreds of people protested in Srinagar on Sunday where they chanted \u201cWhat do we want? Freedom! When do we want it? Now!\u201d. <br><strong><br></strong>On Sunday,<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ImranKhanPTI/status/1160460575454957568\">Khan said on Twitter</a>: \u201cAttempt is to change demography of Kashmir through ethnic cleansing.

On Sunday, he telephoned Iranian President Hassan Rouhani \u201cas part of his outreach to world leaders on the Kashmir situation\u201d, according to a statement issued by his office.</p> \n<p>Rouhani was quoted as saying that Muslims of Kashmir \u201cmust be able to use their legal rights and interests to be able to live in peace.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ufra Mir, a peace psychologist from Kashmir who has provided psycho-social support to as many as 200 Kashmiris who are living away from home, said: \u201cThis fear of uncertainty and this sense of not knowing what\u2019s going to happen \u2013 this is what is really stressing people out, giving them anxiety and panic attacks.\u201d</p> \n<p>Over the past week she has counselled people through phone calls, social media and through a Whatsapp group.</p> \n<p>Many of those unable to contact their families were students away from Kashmir for the first time, she added. \u201cThey were supposed to go back home but now they don\u2019t even know if they should.

      "bodyText": "The Pakistani prime minister, Imran Khan, has likened the Indian government to Nazis, warning that global inaction over Kashmir would be the same as appeasing Hitler. His comments came as authorities in Indian-administered Kashmir reportedly reimposed some curfew rules in parts of the territory, following an easing of restrictions in Srinagar, the region\u2019s main city, that had allowed people to visit shops over the weekend and attend Friday prayers. TV news showed footage of jeeps fitted with loudspeakers moving in the region on Sunday afternoon, telling people to return to their homes and shopkeepers to shut markets. Landlines, mobile phones and the internet all remain blocked, preventing residents from calling relatives or friends. It was not clear if people would be allowed to leave their homes for Monday\u2019s Eid-al-Adha festival, one of the biggest celebrations of the year in Kashmir. The state has been in lockdown since Monday, when the Indian government announced it would revoke its autonomy and rules that prevent outsiders from buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris fear the move would alter the demography of India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state and its traditions. Despite heavy security, hundreds of people protested in Srinagar on Sunday where they chanted \u201cWhat do we want? Freedom! When do we want it? Now!\u201d. On Sunday, Khan said on Twitter: \u201cAttempt is to change demography of Kashmir through ethnic cleansing. Question is: Will the world watch &amp; appease as they did Hitler at Munich?\u201d The Pakistani prime minister added that the \u201cideology of Hindu supremacy, like the Nazi Aryan supremacy, will not stop\u201d in Kashmir, but would lead to \u201cthe suppression of Muslims in India &amp; eventually lead to targeting of Pakistan\u201d. Khan has vowed to lobby heads of states and take his complaints to the UN, though the response has so far been muted. On Sunday, he telephoned Iranian President Hassan Rouhani \u201cas part of his outreach to world leaders on the Kashmir situation\u201d, according to a statement issued by his office. Rouhani was quoted as saying that Muslims of Kashmir \u201cmust be able to use their legal rights and interests to be able to live in peace.\u201d Ufra Mir, a peace psychologist from Kashmir who has provided psycho-social support to as many as 200 Kashmiris who are living away from home, said: \u201cThis fear of uncertainty and this sense of not knowing what\u2019s going to happen \u2013 this is what is really stressing people out, giving them anxiety and panic attacks.\u201d Over the past week she has counselled people through phone calls, social media and through a Whatsapp group. Many of those unable to contact their families were students away from Kashmir for the first time, she added. \u201cThey were supposed to go back home but now they don\u2019t even know if they should. A lot of them have run out of money.\u201d Mir flew back on Sunday because she wanted to support her family. \u201cI don\u2019t know the space I will be going back to. I definitely know that it won\u2019t be the same, it won\u2019t be the same space that I left,\u201d she said. A few people in Kashmir have managed to secure access to a working phone to reassure family members. Mir Mushtaq, who is working in Delhi, said that his relatives called three days ago. \u201cMy mother was consistently crying. She asked me to come there and be with her,\u201d he said. Normally, he would spend Eid with family, distributing the meat of a sacrificed goat door-to-door in Pulwama, where he would visit between 100 and 180 families. He decided to stay in Delhi to raise awareness. \u201cMy motherland is in danger. What will I do there, lock myself in a room?\u201d The communication blocks and curfew in Kashmir, which prevented people from leaving their homes for almost five days last week, were apparently intended to stop unrest, resulting in little concrete information as to what is happening in Kashmir. Restrictions on movement were lifted for the first time on Friday to allow people to attend local mosques for prayers. Afterwards, police reportedly opened fire and used teargas to break up demonstrations of at least 10,000 people who took to the streets to protest Delhi\u2019s actions. An Indian home affairs ministry official denied the reports, and said there had been only a few stray protests of no more than 20 people. However, the BBC later released a video appearing to show huge crowds marching through the streets of Srinagar, as well as police opening fire and using teargas. Delhi\u2019s decision to scrap Kashmir\u2019s special status not only faces major resistance in the territory, but has also escalated tensions with Pakistan and been condemned by China. Pakistan said that with the support of China, it would take up India\u2019s actions in Kashmir with the UN security council and that it may approach the UN human rights commission over what it has described as the \u201cgenocide\u201d of the Kashmiri people. Pakistan last week expelled the Indian high commissioner and halted trade. The country\u2019s army chief warned that his forces would take any action to stand by Kashmiris. India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has insisted that the removal of Kashmir\u2019s special status would bring investment and rid the state of terrorism.",

The private pathologist, Dr Michael Baden, was the city\u2019s chief medical examiner in the late 1970s and has been called as an expert witness in high-profile cases including by the defense at OJ Simpson\u2019s 1994 murder trial.</p> <p>According to an unnamed city official cited by the New York Times late on Sunday night, Sampson was \u201cconfident\u201d Epstein died by hanging himself in the jail cell.</p> <p>The FBI, the inspector general\u2019s office of the US justice department and the New York City medical examiner\u2019s office have all opened investigations into why Epstein, who had been placed on suicide watch for a week last month, had not remained under special monitoring.</p> <p>On the night before Epstein was found dead, a pair of guards at the jail failed to follow procedures that would have required a visual check-in on him every 30 minutes, New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/11/nyregion/epstein-death-manhattan-correctional-center.html\">quoted</a> an unnamed law enforcement official as saying. The jail is understaffed, a labor union said, and one of the guards was working his fifth straight day of overtime while the other had been forced to work overtime.</p> <p>Epstein was found dead about 24 hours after court documents in a related case shed new light on his alleged crimes. The documents were gathered as part of a defamation case brought against former Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of the publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell. The suit was settled in 2017. Lawyers for Maxwell did not reply to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/jeffrey-epstein-kills-himself-in-jail-according-to-media-reports/2019/08/10/a3d48862-bb73-11e9-b3b4-2bb69e8c4e39_story.html?noredirect=on\">media requests</a> for comment.</p> <p>Court documents described how Epstein allegedly groomed girls for rape and sexual abuse, recruiting the victims at schools or, in one significant case, at Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump\u2019s Florida resort.</p> <p>Epstein, who owned a Caribbean island, a private jet and who traveled abroad frequently, was deemed a flight risk at a court hearing last month and denied bail.

After Epstein was arrested last month at a New Jersey airport upon his return from France, Clinton released a statement denying any impropriety.</p> <p>Trump was criticized for spreading the conspiracy theory. \u201cThis is another example of our president using this position of public trust to attack his political enemies with unfounded conspiracy theories,\u201d presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Texas congressman, said on CNN.</p> <p>Federal prosecutors vowed to continue to pursue the case, despite Epstein\u2019s death.

Interviews with alleged victims and witnesses showed that some of the girls involved were under 18.</p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s events are disturbing, and we are deeply aware of their potential to present yet another hurdle to giving Epstein\u2019s many victims their day in court,\u201d said Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney in Manhattan, in a statement Saturday. \u201cTo those brave young women who have already come forward and to the many others who have yet to do so, let me reiterate that we remain committed to standing for you, and our investigation of the conduct charged in the indictment \u2013 which included a conspiracy count \u2013 remains ongoing.\u201d</p> <p>Lawyers for Epstein said they were \u201cenormously sorry to learn\u201d of their client\u2019s death.</p> <p>\u201cNo one should die in jail,\u201d said the lawyers, Reid Weingarten, Marty Weinberg and Michael Miller. \u201cWe cannot confirm rumors as to his cause of death, and we trust that the United States attorney\u2019s office and the United States Marshalls will thoroughly investigate the circumstances of today\u2019s tragedy.\u201d</p> <p>After original attempts to prosecute Epstein collapsed, Trump\u2019s former labor secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/12/alex-acosta-resigns-trump-jeffrey-epstein-plea-deal-latest-news\">Alex Acosta came under repeated scrutiny</a> for being seen as too lenient when he oversaw the case.</p> <p>In February, a judge ruled prosecutors in the case violated the law by concealing the deal from his underage alleged victims. Acosta resigned from his administration post in July.</p> <p>As Epstein\u2019s world unraveled, some of those who had sought his financial investment advice came forward while many more preferred to distance themselves, issuing statements painting their interactions in minimal terms. They included Trump and Clinton, who both issued statements saying they had had little to do with Epstein in recent years.</p> <p>Wexner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/08/victorias-secret-billionaire-says-jeffrey-epstein-stole-46m-of-his-money-report\">said this week</a> that the financier had \u201cmisappropriated\u201d more than $46m of his personal fortune.

His body was discovered by staff at the Metropolitan correctional center in Manhattan at 6.30am Saturday morning, the facility said. New York City\u2019s chief medical examiner said late on Sunday night that an autopsy had been carried out but more information was needed to determine the cause of death. Dr Barbara Sampson said in a statement that a city medical examiner performed the autopsy on Sunday while a private pathologist observed the examination at the request of Epstein\u2019s representatives. The private pathologist, Dr Michael Baden, was the city\u2019s chief medical examiner in the late 1970s and has been called as an expert witness in high-profile cases including by the defense at OJ Simpson\u2019s 1994 murder trial. According to an unnamed city official cited by the New York Times late on Sunday night, Sampson was \u201cconfident\u201d Epstein died by hanging himself in the jail cell. The FBI, the inspector general\u2019s office of the US justice department and the New York City medical examiner\u2019s office have all opened investigations into why Epstein, who had been placed on suicide watch for a week last month, had not remained under special monitoring. On the night before Epstein was found dead, a pair of guards at the jail failed to follow procedures that would have required a visual check-in on him every 30 minutes, New York Times quoted an unnamed law enforcement official as saying. The jail is understaffed, a labor union said, and one of the guards was working his fifth straight day of overtime while the other had been forced to work overtime. Epstein was found dead about 24 hours after court documents in a related case shed new light on his alleged crimes. The documents were gathered as part of a defamation case brought against former Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of the publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell. The suit was settled in 2017. Lawyers for Maxwell did not reply to media requests for comment. Court documents described how Epstein allegedly groomed girls for rape and sexual abuse, recruiting the victims at schools or, in one significant case, at Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump\u2019s Florida resort. Epstein, who owned a Caribbean island, a private jet and who traveled abroad frequently, was deemed a flight risk at a court hearing last month and denied bail. He last appeared in court two weeks ago. One accuser, Jennifer Araoz, said Epstein raped her when she was 15 years old, after she was recruited outside her high school in New York. Araoz said in a statement after his death: \u201cI am angry Jeffrey Epstein won\u2019t have to face his survivors of his abuse in court. We have to live with the scars of his actions for the rest of our lives, while he will never face the consequences of the crimes he committed, the pain and trauma he caused so many people. Epstein is gone, but justice must still be served.\u201d Attorney general William Barr, who as head of the justice department has authority over the federal facility where Epstein died, announced the inspector general\u2019s inquiry on Saturday. \u201cI was appalled to learn that Jeffrey Epstein was found dead early this morning from an apparent suicide while in federal custody,\u201d Barr wrote. \u201cMr Epstein\u2019s death raises serious questions that must be answered.\u201d But Barr\u2019s statement was at odds with Trump, who late on Saturday retweeted a conspiracy theory tying Epstein\u2019s death to the financier\u2019s relationship with Bill Clinton, a sometimes guest aboard Epstein\u2019s plane. After Epstein was arrested last month at a New Jersey airport upon his return from France, Clinton released a statement denying any impropriety. Trump was criticized for spreading the conspiracy theory. \u201cThis is another example of our president using this position of public trust to attack his political enemies with unfounded conspiracy theories,\u201d presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Texas congressman, said on CNN. Federal prosecutors vowed to continue to pursue the case, despite Epstein\u2019s death. Investigators are examining Epstein\u2019s extensive network of social and professional contacts \u2013 which included luminaries in the fields of academic science and the law, as well as politics and business \u2013 weighing whether further charges might be warranted. Epstein\u2019s circle of friends and acquaintances has included Donald Trump; Bill Clinton; Prince Andrew, the Duke of York; Leslie Wexner, the founder of the company that owns Victoria\u2019s Secret ; and many other prominent names in law, entertainment and politics. The first allegations of sexual abuse came in 2005 when a woman contacted the Palm Beach police, alleging her 14-year-old stepdaughter had been taken to Epstein\u2019s mansion by an older girl. The girl was allegedly paid $300 to strip and massage Epstein. That triggered an 11-month investigation that drew in the FBI. Interviews with alleged victims and witnesses showed that some of the girls involved were under 18. \u201cToday\u2019s events are disturbing, and we are deeply aware of their potential to present yet another hurdle to giving Epstein\u2019s many victims their day in court,\u201d said Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney in Manhattan, in a statement Saturday. \u201cTo those brave young women who have already come forward and to the many others who have yet to do so, let me reiterate that we remain committed to standing for you, and our investigation of the conduct charged in the indictment \u2013 which included a conspiracy count \u2013 remains ongoing.\u201d Lawyers for Epstein said they were \u201cenormously sorry to learn\u201d of their client\u2019s death. \u201cNo one should die in jail,\u201d said the lawyers, Reid Weingarten, Marty Weinberg and Michael Miller. \u201cWe cannot confirm rumors as to his cause of death, and we trust that the United States attorney\u2019s office and the United States Marshalls will thoroughly investigate the circumstances of today\u2019s tragedy.\u201d After original attempts to prosecute Epstein collapsed, Trump\u2019s former labor secretary Alex Acosta came under repeated scrutiny for being seen as too lenient when he oversaw the case. In February, a judge ruled prosecutors in the case violated the law by concealing the deal from his underage alleged victims. Acosta resigned from his administration post in July. As Epstein\u2019s world unraveled, some of those who had sought his financial investment advice came forward while many more preferred to distance themselves, issuing statements painting their interactions in minimal terms. They included Trump and Clinton, who both issued statements saying they had had little to do with Epstein in recent years. Wexner said this week that the financier had \u201cmisappropriated\u201d more than $46m of his personal fortune. He said money went missing a decade ago, according to a letter to the Wexner Foundation. \u201cWe discovered that he had misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family,\u201d Wexner said in the letter. \u201cThis was, frankly, a tremendous shock, even though it clearly pales in comparison to the unthinkable allegations against him now.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "An air war in Libya is intensifying as rival forces in the divided country try to break a military stalemate, heightening significantly the risk of civilian casualties. At least 45 people were killed and dozens wounded in an airstrike last Sunday that targeted a town hall meeting in south-western Libya. The forces of Khalifa Haftar, the 75-year-old military strongman who controls much of the east of the country, have been blamed. Witnesses said the attack on a residential district of Qalaa in the town of Murzuq came from a drone. The death toll, which included many children, represents one of the largest single losses of civilian life since the civil war began in 2011 following the fall of the veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi. In June, more than 50 people were killed when an airstrike demolished much of a migrant detention centre on the outskirts of Tripoli. Haftar\u2019s forces were also blamed for that attack. The new strike comes almost exactly four months after the former general launched his self-styled Libyan National Army against Tripoli, the seat of the rival Government of National Accord (GNA). Haftar\u2019s offensive has so far led to more than a thousand civilian deaths and derailed diplomatic efforts to reconcile the two main armed political factions in Libya. After rapid early gains, Haftar\u2019s forces have stalled as resistance by a coalition of militias fighting for the GNA has hardened. This has led to an increasing deployment of air power to gain tactical advantage in what has become a stalemate and to avoid further military casualties, experts say. The shift has been fuelled by the provision of drones and other weapons systems by regional and international powers backing both factions. \u201cThe air war will intensify, as long as international reaction is pretty non-existent. The conclusion is that [actors] can get away with this, and they can do it again, even in more densely populated areas. These are thresholds that keep getting crossed,\u201d said Jalel Harchaoui, an expert at the Clingendael Institute in The Hague. Haftar is supported by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, while the GNA, recognised by the UN as the legitimate government of Libya, is backed by Turkey and Qatar. In June, Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary general, called for the UN arms embargo in place since 2011 to be respected. Last week an airstrike by a drone destroyed a Ukrainian cargo plane at an airbase in Misrata, a coastal city controlled by the GNA. Ukrainian authorities said the aircraft, arriving from Turkey, was carrying humanitarian aid. The LNA said it was carrying weapons for its enemies. The strike came shortly after two cargo planes had been destroyed at Haftar\u2019s main forward airbase in Jufra. The attack on Murzuq on 4 August is thought by experts to have involved a Chinese-made armed drone probably flown from one of the airbases built by the UAE in Libya. The Wing Loong drones were first deployed in the east of the country in 2016. Arnaud Delalande, an expert in Libyan military aviation and its role in the conflict, said small fleets maintained by both sides had been depleted by enemy fire, accidents and mechanical failures in the course of recent fighting. Though the LNA already had drones deployed, operated by the UAE, the GNA obtained its unmanned aircraft from Turkey. \u201cBoth sides needed other options and drones were the best choice,\u201d Delalande said. Some other airstrikes in recent weeks have been made by what appear to be more modern F-16 or Mirage fighters. Other precision strikes have taken place at night. This suggests the involvement of either Egypt or Emirati planes and pilots, analysts say. The victims in Murzuq last Sunday were from the Tebu tribe, which has opposed the expansion of Haftar\u2019s influence into south-western Libya and has fought with local Arab tribes allied with the LNA. The target was a government building at which more than 200 local dignitaries were gathered to resolve local disputes. Guests from a wedding which had been held in the building earlier in the day were also killed when they attempted to help casualties and were hit by a second strike, Dr Ahmed Adey, a doctor in the town who treated some of the injured people, told the Guardian. Many casualties struggled to get treatment. \u201cThere\u2019s only one hospital with no resources in the town, and it\u2019s dangerous for the Tebus to travel to get treatment because of their issues with the tribal militias that are supported by Haftar,\u201d Ismail Bazinga, a medical student from Murzuq who has assisted in the care of casualties, told the Guardian on the phone. There are reports of casualties from the bombing dying after being stopped at checkpoints manned by fighters from other communities as relatives tried to take them to coastal cities for medical help. With its 50,000 inhabitants, mostly from the Tebu ethnic group, and its ancient fortress, the oasis town is located almost 900km (550 miles) by road south of Tripoli. A spokesperson of the LNA said in a video on Facebook that the airstrikes had targeted militias from neighbouring Chad. In a statement the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) said it was extremely concerned by reports of violence in Murzuq, including the airstrikes. \u201cIndiscriminate attacks constitute a blatant violation of international humanitarian and human rights law and may amount to war crimes,\u201d a statement said. The EU said \u201cindiscriminate attacks on densely populated residential areas\u201d may amount to war crimes and called for those breaching international humanitarian law to be brought to justice.",

      "bodyText": "And read Louise Taylor\u2019s report from St. James\u2019 Park: Do join Rob Smyth for kick-off at Old Trafford: Limbering up for Manchester United v Chelsea? Leicester City and Wolves kicked off the new season with a 0-0 draw, though Leander Dendoncker had a goal ruled out by the video assistant referee. Joao Moutinho\u2019s corner was headed goalwards by Dendoncker and hit the arm of Willy Boly before Dendoncker powered home the rebound. But, after a review, the goal was disallowed by the referee, Andre Marriner: Arsenal were hardly spectacular \u2013 but they got the job done. It took Arsenal until April to keep an away clean sheet in the Premier League last season but, this time around, they have yielded one within the first 96 minutes of their season. The youngsters Joe Willock and Reiss Nelson struggled to stamp their authority on the game but Aubameyang, as he so often does, came up with goods. Granit Xhaka and Matteo Guendouzi were impressive in midfield. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\u2019s goal is the difference at St. James\u2019 Park, as Steve Bruce\u2019s Newcastle reign starts with a narrow defeat. It was a game of precious few chances but Aubameyang showed a touch of class to effortlessly lift the ball over Martin Dubravka, the Newcastle goalkeeper, after sterling work by the marauding Arsenal full-back Ainsley Maitland-Niles, who had stole possession off the substitute Jetro Willems. It was Aubameyang\u2019s 33rd goal in 50 Premier League appearances \u2013 only Mo Salah (36) has scored more goals in the competition in the same timeframe. Newcastle showed plenty of spirit \u2013 Joelinton was lively on debut and Allan Saint-Maximin busy off the bench \u2013 but Arsenal always held the upper hand after taking the lead. Unai Emery handed out a few debuts as his side closed out the game, with \u00a372m record signing Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9, Dani Ceballos and Gabriel Martinelli all stepping off the bench as Arsenal held on for three points. 90+4 min: ... Lascelles does well to help Dubravka\u2019s free-kick on, it trickles down into the box but the Arsenal goalkeeper Leno is there to smother it. That\u2019s probably that. 90+3 min: Newcastle free-kick on halfway. Dubravka will lump it forward ... 90+1 min: Xhaka scarpers to the corner and draws a foul out of Javier Manquillo. Arsenal take an age to play the free-kick and, when they do, they almost free Aubameyang over the top in search of a second goal. But Dubravka is alert to it. 90 min: There will be four added minutes. 89 min: Arsenal go to pieces every time Saint-Maximin seizes possession \u2013 but they look as though they are going to survive and take the three points. 88 min: Joelinton does well to release Saint-Maximin down the left, who then lures in a couple of Arsenal shirts. Almir\u00f3n takes over the baton and nudges the ball into the path of Joelinton, who finds a pocket of space on the edge of the area. But the Brazilian\u2019s effort from distance is always rising. It all looked so promising. 85 min: Gabriel Martinelli replaces Mkhitaryan, who has had an indifferent kind of afternoon. Can Newcastle find a late equaliser? 83 min: Willems nudges the ball into the path of Saint-Maximin, who drifts out wide on the left. Then the winger comes bouncing inside, beyond Maitland-Niles and Guendouzi before taking aim. Saint-Maximin\u2019s effort does not lack power but a deflection off Guendouzi takes the sting out of his strike. The former Nice forward has made a healthy first impression in 20-odd minutes off the bench. Meanwhile, Arsenal ready another substitution ... 82 min: Edu, the Arsenal technical director, is sat up in the posh seats alongside Raul Sanllehi. Down in the technical area, Freddie Ljungberg is among those in conversation with Unai Emery as Arsenal seek to close out this victory. 80 min: Monreal cuts out Hayden\u2019s stray pass and Arsenal scoot forward through Mkhitaryan. The ball is wonderfully worked to Aubameyang, who \u2013 for a split-second \u2013 looks set to pull the trigger but he dallies ever so slightly and the chance has gone. Newcastle eat away at Aubameyang and crowd him out. 77 min: Saint-Maximin breezes beyond Maitland-Niles, whizzing beyond the full-back in a flash but the Newcastle winger slips at the crucial moment. That bit of movement gave Arsenal a fright after they had seemingly got a bit comfortable knocking the ball around the back. Meanwhile, team news from Old Trafford: 75 min: Willems combines well with Ritchie, who stands up an inviting cross in search of Joelinton \u2013 but Bernd Leno is there to gobble it up. Without making Willems a scapegoat, Newcastle have looked nowhere near as balanced since the Dutchman replaced Shelvey shortly before the hour mark. 73 min: That Aubemayeng strike seems to have sapped Newcastle of the belief they could upset Arsenal here. They are running out of ideas \u2013 and into trouble, with Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 the latest to be gifted possession, this time by Sch\u00e4r. Arsenal are merely going through the motions, so much so that P\u00e9p\u00e9\u2019s first touch is poor on receiving a throw-in down the right. Newcastle need to find a way of making life difficult in the closing stages. Joelinton has become more and more isolated. Miguel Almir\u00f3n, too, has faded a little. 71 min: Arsenal\u2019s \u00a372m man is on. Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 replaces Reiss Nelson. The Ivory Coast forward comes on to a roaring ovation from the pocket of Arsenal supporters up in the Gods at St. James\u2019 Park. Meanwhile, Xhaka is moving a little gingerly after Saint-Maximin clobbered him a moment ago. It was a nasty one. 67 min: The arrival of Saint-Maximin has stirred a home crowd and Newcastle threaten from a short corner, with a cannoned effort calling Leno into action. It could be a long 20 minutes or so for the Arsenal back line. How Bruce must wish he could throw on a certain Andy Carroll. This game is made for him. 65 min: A beaming Allan Saint-Maximin is on for Sean Longstaff. Steve Bruce will hope the winger, who is all smiles, can have a better impact than Jetro Willems, who has had a pretty torrid time since stepping off the bench. 64 min: The Real Madrid loanee Dani Ceballos is on for his competitive Arsenal debut, replacing the teenager Joe Willock. Ceballos is some talent; the Spaniard lit up the European Under-21 Championship in Italy and San Marino this summer. 60 min: Thirty-three goals in 50 Premier League appearances. Not bad going for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The Arsenal striker is up and running for the season. And how his team needed that touch of class. Maitland-Niles did superbly to lay the ball on a plate but it was a classy finish by Aubameyang. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang pounces on a gaping hole in the Newcastle defence. Maitland-Niles nabs the ball from a sleeping Willems and bombs forward down the right, whipping a wonderful ball in to the back post where Aubameyang is lurking unmarked. He has an age to dink the ball over a hapless Dubravka in the Newcastle goal. Aubameyang acrobatically celebrates getting off the mark. Dani Ceballos, Alexandre Lacazette and Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 had all been warming up. Suddenly, things are looking up for Emery. 54 min: Guendouzi drives forward unchallenged and spreads the ball wide to Aubameyang, who stabs an effort goalwards. It\u2019s blocked. Nothing doing. Arsenal have badly struggled to broach the Newcastle back line. 53 min: Steve Bruce blinks first, with Newcastle making the first substitution of the day: Jetro Willems is on for Jonjo Shelvey. 52 min: Aubameyang\u2019s deflected effort lands on the roof of Dubravka\u2019s net! The striker raced on to a low Monreal pass but was forced to shoot from a tight angle by Paul Dummett. From the resulting corner, Xhaka helped the ball on from the near post but it flew beyond Joe Willock before he could do anything about it. 51 min: Lacazette and P\u00e9p\u00e9 trudge off the bench, braving the conditions to warm up. Arsenal fans appreciate their efforts, greeting the pair with a warm applause. Unai Emery is surely only a few minutes away from changes. They are yet to get going. 48 min: Dubravka wellies the ball straight out. That\u2019s no good and he knows it. Newcastle have however started this half the brighter of these sides. Arsenal have seemed a little off-colour. 47 min: The attendance at St. James\u2019 Park is reportedly around 4,000 down on the average crowd. Some of that is presumably boycott-related. Newcastle have made a perky start to this second half, with Joelinton robbing the ball off Xhaka\u2019s feet 30 yards out. 46 min: Newcastle get us back under way. No changes. It\u2019s 0-0 at half-time at the King Power Stadium, where Leicester City and Wolves are doing battle. Meanwhile, whet your appetite for this afternoon\u2019s headline act at Old Trafford: Clearcut chances have been at a premium but Newcastle have shaded the opening 47 minutes at St. James\u2019 Park. Jonjo Shelvey rattled a post, the hustling Joelinton has been busy, as has Miguel Almir\u00f3n, who was booked for a painful dive. As for Arsenal, Unai Emery\u2019s side have been pretty underwhelming. Arsenal\u2019s two teenagers Joe Willock and Reiss Nelson have looked pretty lost but, in truth, none of their players are finding much joy. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had a whiff of goal but they have struggled to breakdown a resolute Newcastle backline. Steve Bruce, meanwhile, will be reasonably happy. Emery must be tempted to mix things up at the break, perhaps throw on a new signing. Or two. 45+2 min: Arsenal begin to zip the ball around, it\u2019s all nicey-nicey but then Mkhitaryan carelessly overhits a pass for Nelson, who is in space wide. That sloppiness just about sums it up. 45 min: There will be two added minutes. 44 min: It\u2019s all gone a bit flat. Changes at the break, maybe? 42 min: Aubameyang tries to make something happen in the final third but Newcastle stand firm. They have looked pretty sturdy in defence. Arsenal need to be that bit stronger, savvier and smarter. 40 min: Newcastle get lucky as the ball ricochets off Maitland-Niles and out for a throw. There to keep it alive on the touchline and speed up the phase of play is Steve Bruce, who rolls back the years with a peerless first touch before the throw-in is taken. Newcastle attempt to surge upfield down the left but it comes back at them and Mkhitaryan carves out a corner for Arsenal. 39 min: Miguel Almir\u00f3n drops a shoulder and has a pop from 30-odd yards. Left-footed, it\u2019s always rising but it does not lack power. A show of intent, if nothing else. Almir\u00f3n and Joelinton have been busy up front for Newcastle. 37 min: Seconds after Shelvey leathers a 40-yard pass into the advertising hoardings, Dubravka gets a goal-kick all wrong. Testing conditions for both teams, with Arsenal attempting to grapple back control on a game that has got away from them a little. Newcastle seem happy to soak up some relatively tame possession. 35 min: Mkhitaryan is booked for a rash challenge on Joelinton. Arsenal were beginning to peg Newcastle back, so that will give the hosts a chance to have a breather. Conditions are pretty bleak out there. Allan Saint-Maximin is among the Newcastle subs warming up in the swirling rain. 34 min: Ritchie is pulled up for dragging back Maitland-Niles. The game has just become a little bitty. Arsenal have another free-kick on halfway. Maitland-Niles requires some attention from the medical staff, having appeared to twist his ankle ever so slightly, but the wing-back limps back on to the pitch. 31 min: Aubameyang stings Martin Dubravka\u2019s palms with a rasping strike from the angle! The Arsenal striker was played in beautifully by Mkhitaryan and took aim. That was the inventive spark Unai Emery\u2019s side had been missing. 30 min: Xhaka glances a low ball on, but it bobbles wide. The free-kick was wayward and underhit. Steve Bruce will be the happier manager so far. 29 min: Lascelles tugs back Willock and Arsenal have a free-kick just inside the Newcastle half. Reiss Nelson will swing it in ... 25 min: Newcastle go up the other end \u2013 and Joelinton goes close! The Brazilian forward has been very lively on debut and fashions an opportunity despite being surrounded by five or six yellow Arsenal shirts. Joelinton manages to control a high ball and strides towards goal, jinking past Sokratis and Chambers before getting a stinging shot away. It\u2019s fired straight at Leno, who saves. 24 min: Reiss Nelson is booked for a late challenge on Fabian Sch\u00e4r, seconds after a sloppy pass was easily intercepted. Emery, enveloped by the hood of his raincoat, tries to gee up the troops. Arsenal have been indifferent at best. 23 min: Mkhitaryan skies a wonderful chance! A galloping Monreal is played in over the top and as he bears down on goal, Dubravka rushes out into no man\u2019s land. Newcastle are carved open, Monreal lays on the ball on for Mkhitaryan but the midfielder gets his shot all wrong. He spoons it miles over the bar. 22 min: Ritchie bends in a corner, with Lascelles the target but the Newcastle skipper cannot force it goalwards. Newcastle try to have another go but the move breaks down and Leno kickstarts an Arsenal attack. But Guendouzi, who has been heavily involved for Arsenal in the early stages, bemoans a lack of options. 21 min: Sokratis concedes a corner as Newcastle turn up the heat ... 19 min: Shelvey rattles a post! Newcastle suddenly fancy this now. Almir\u00f3n bursts down the left this time, getting the better of Maitland-Niles before they recycle possession and Shelvey lets fly from the edge of the box, with his strike whistling off the backside of Calum Chambers. Arsenal have been sloppy. 17 min: Seventeen minutes into the new season, Miguel Almir\u00f3n is booked for simulation. And it\u2019s an excruciating dive too. The Paraguay forward bundles his way towards the edge of the box and takes flight after nudging the ball between Granit Xhaka and Monreal. Arsenal look digusted with that, Almir\u00f3n sheepish. 15 min: And now Newcastle start to show some urgency. They twice threaten, with Joelinton, the \u00a340m record signing, nodding wide a deflected Ritchie cross, seconds after a dangerous ball whizzed in from the right. The Brazilian forward did well to make any kind of contact, with Chambers close for company. 14 min: Maitland-Niles comes alive down the right flank, wheeling towards the byline, flying beyond Matty Ritchie before cutting inside and leaving the Newcastle wing-back on the turf back. His pass inside looks dangerous but Newcastle clear their lines. That was the first real zip in Arsenal\u2019s play. 13 min: Guendouzi clatters through the back of Miguel Almir\u00f3n, who wins Newcastle a free-kick on halfway. Shelvey plays it short but then they promptly gift possession straight back to Arsenal. 12 min: Willock buys a free-kick out of Fabian Sch\u00e4r wide on the left-hand side. Arsenal have seen plenty of the ball without really doing anything spectacular with it. They waste the set-piece and Newcastle have a chance to press forward themselves. 10 min: Arsenal are happily knocking the ball around, with Guendouzi keeping it alive before a bustling Jonjo Shelvey arrives on the scene, sliding in to nick it away with a fine challenge. Shelvey takes a whack in the process but he\u2019s OK. 8 min: A steady spell of possession for the visitors ends with a sloppy Mkhitaryan pass in search of Maitland-Niles. Meanwhile, a question. \u201cArsenal are starting with four English/British players today,\u201d emails Kailash Pandey. \u201cWhen was the last time it happened?\u201d Is anyone able to shed any light on that one? 6 min: Almir\u00f3n looks psyched up. He darts down the right wing with Sokratis momentarily in trouble before Arsenal get bodies behind the ball. 5 min: Martin Atkinson halts play and picks up ... a bangle. No, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a piece of the shiny pre-match Premier League signage. The league can expect a slap on the wrist at some point. Now then, back to the football. 3 min: A stray crossfield pass bounces out of play. A thumbs-up from Matty Ritchie, who recognises the good intentions of Manquillo. 2 min: Miguel Almir\u00f3n is slipped in down the right but Calum Chambers does well to hold his ground on the byline, ushering the Newcastle forward away from danger. Unai Emery, with his raincoat hood up, is barking out orders. 1 min: Aubameyang and Willock link up neatly but the former is flagged offside after being slipped in. He was about a yard off. Encouraging start. Aubameyang get us under way. It\u2019s bucketing it down. The teams are in the tunnel. Jamaal Lascelles looks in the zone, ready to rumble. Granit Xhaka, the Arsenal skipper, is limbering up. Seven minutes until kick-off at St James\u2019 Park. A few hundred supporters have followed through on their promise of protesting pre-march, marching to the stadium in driving rain holding a banner that spells out the words \u2018boycott Ashley\u2019. Bruce knows the value of a result this afternoon. \u201cIf you\u2019re born here, it\u2019s in you,\u201d he said. \u201cA result always seems to help any situation.\u201d A gentle reminder that Mesut \u00d6zil and Sead Kolasinac are absent because of \u201csecurity concerns\u201d. Police said two men have been charged with a public order offence connected to an Arsenal player, with the pair arrested outside the north London home of \u00d6zil. A fortnight ago the players were targeted by carjackers. On that occasion footage showed Kolasinac confronting the offenders, who were brandishing knives, after they approached \u00d6zil\u2019s car in Golders Green. Police said they were treating the public order offence and the attempted car-jacking as separate incidents. Essential pre-match reading: Now, here\u2019s a killer pre-match stat, courtesy of Opta: Arsenal have named two English teenagers (Joe Willock and Reiss Nelson) in their starting XI for a Premier League game for the first time since February 1998 (Paolo Vernazza and Matthew Upson v Crystal Palace), before either Willock or Nelson were born. Team news news: Newcastle\u2019s \u00a340m record signing Joelinton is in from the off but Unai Emery opts to keep his raft of new signings \u2013 David Luiz, Dani Ceballos, Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 and Gabriel Martinelli \u2013 on a very strong Arsenal bench. Reiss Nelson makes his first start for more than 15 months and the 19-year-old Joe Willock also has a chance to impress. Newcastle\u2019s other new recruits, Emil Krafth and Allan Saint-Maximin, are among the subs. Andy Carroll has been milling around the tunnel but is not involved. When fit, his arrival should at least aid Joelinton, who was hardly prolific in the Bundesliga last season.

Bruce has at least been given some money to strengthen his squad this summer, with Joelinton and Allan Saint-Maximin set to feature. Arsenal, too, have been flexing their financial muscle, with Kieran Tierney and \u00a372m record signing Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 among those coming through the door to overhaul a new-look Arsenal squad in the past couple of weeks. Throwing around a bit of cash has failed to halt the disquiet on Tyneside though, with a boycott against Ashley\u2019s ownership and a city-centre protest march also scheduled. \u201cFor me, I don\u2019t want it to upset the team and we know what a full St James\u2019 Park can do,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cI am sure the fans will enjoy seeing the players on the pitch. I want to give the fans a team they can be proud of and can associate with.\u201d Kick-off: 2pm (BST)",

      "bodyText": "A little bit of a boycott and an awful lot of rain ensured that Steve Bruce\u2019s Newcastle United reign began in downbeat mode as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang emphasised his enduring importance to Arsenal by cutting through the gloom and registering an exquisitely incisive winner. If it hardly bodes well for Bruce that the chaotic preamble to that goal involved him screaming \u2018what the fuck\u2019s happening\u2019 as his new Netherlands left-back, Jetro Willems, replaced Jonjo Shelvey and immediately began charging around in midfield, these are very early days. Willems was meant to step in at left wing-back but it transpired that tactical instructions were lost in translation and he did not realise Matt Ritchie was shifting positions to assume Shelvey\u2019s central role. Two minutes after order was finally restored, the Eintracht Frankfurt loanee proved the victim of another misunderstanding, with Paul Dummett this time, before his surrender of possession prefaced an anti-climactic defeat. Bruce\u2019s pain was surely exacerbated by the fact that Unai Emery\u2019s supposedly vulnerable and hardly full-strength backline managed that real north Londoner\u2019s collector\u2019s item, a rare clean sheet on the road, on a day when a starting frontline missing both the \u00a372m P\u00e9p\u00e9 and Alexandre Lacazette created very little of note. At least the sight of the watching Andy Carroll keeping his ponytail dry with a baseball cap emblazoned with the word \u2018Icon\u2019 hinted at the prospect of potentially better days ahead but unfortunately for Newcastle, their newly returned, local attacking hero is injured \u2013 yet again. Admittedly there were some tantalising Miguel Almir\u00f3n cameos, redolent with glittering promise but the undeniable absence of real ruthlessness in front of goal appeared suggestive of a long, hard slog ahead. In mitigation Bruce\u2019s players arguably had the better of things until injury concerns necessitated the withdrawal of first Shelvey and then Sean Longstaff from central midfield and they, fatally, lost shape. That reshuffle also cut the supply lines to Joelinton, Bruce\u2019s marquee \u00a340m Brazilian attacking signing from Hoffenheim, whose debut proved as quiet as a young Arsenal XI\u2019s opening half. If Emery\u2019s side felt unsettled by the security issues which dictated that Mesut \u00d6zil and Sead Kolasinac did not board the flight to the north east, their hosts seemed to derive a measure of reassurance from the reasonably secure looking 3-5-2 framework within which Bruce had initially configured them. That structure proved sufficiently robust to keep the score goalless at half-time on a day when Mike Ashley, Newcastle\u2019s owner, will have been fairly satisfied to note that a proposed boycott of the game on the part of supporters variously dismayed by Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s departure, his stewardship of the club and Bruce\u2019s appointment fell more than a little flat. Almost 48,000 still filed into the 52,000-capacity stadium while a pre kick-off protest march from Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct in the nearby city centre to the ground attracted only around 300 dissenting fans. They missed the sight of Bernd Leno making a smart one-handed save to prevent Joelinton scoring and the important Isaac Hayden interception which possibly denied Henrikh Mkhitaryan a goal. Bruce will have been mighty relieved to see Mkhitaryan curl an inviting opening wastefully off target but gratified by both his team\u2019s initial strength down the left and his new public\u2019s early generosity of spirit towards him. Significantly Ben\u00edtez\u2019s successor was the recipient of warm applause as he, rather niftily, subdued a dropping stray ball with a heel as it flew into the technical area. It would ultimately prove a rare highlight but Mkhitaryan\u2019s lack of similar assurance on a day when the often wayward Armenian provoked frequent frustration as he almost palpably struggled to settle into any sort of passing groove seemed to be playing into Bruce\u2019s hands. Tellingly Emery looked disgruntled with far more than the raindrops beating down on the tightly pulled hood of his Arsenal anorak. The moment had arrived for Aubameyang to issue a reminder that his presence, alone, is often sufficient to undo teams by beginning his pursuit of another golden boot in the most convincing fashion. His 33rd goal in 50 Premier League appearances began with Dummett\u2019s slapdash pass selling Willems horribly short and enabling Ainsley Maitland-Niles to seize possession and advance down the right before picking Aubameyang out with a luscious pass which removed Jamaal Lascelles from the defensive equation. What followed from Aubameyang was an amalgam of adhesive control, technical excellence and exquisite incision all in the space of two touches. With his first the Gabon striker tamed the dropping delivery and with the second he dinked a cushioned half-volley over Martin Dubravka, his boot connecting at precisely the right moment as the ball bounced back up off the turf.

I think people know and understand I\u2019m a completely different person from the 16-year-old child that I was, who had no political training and no political education at all at that time.\u201d</p> <p>Ibrahim said her experience was common among young people from Muslim backgrounds or people of colour who dared to step into the public sphere. \u201cTo me, what\u2019s been the most upsetting thing is to see young people who would be incredible in these roles to not even think of running because of the backlash that I faced. If it had been any of my white peers or colleagues they would never have experienced that.\u201d</p> <p>Ibrahim said she worried about putting herself forward as a candidate to lead the NUS after witnessing the experience of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/may/08/nus-president-malia-bouattia-it-was-the-most-difficult-year-of-my-life\">Malia Bouattia</a>, the first Muslim NUS president, who was subjected to Islamophobic attacks and hate-filled trolling on social media during her tenure.</p> <p>She said: \u201cWhen I was thinking about running, it was the biggest factor that was putting me off \u2013 the backlash and the vilification and all the horrors that would come with it. </p> <p>\u201cBut at the same time I recognise it\u2019s not something I should be afraid to do and I want to be able to encourage young people \u2013 especially young girls that look like myself \u2013 to be able to come into these spaces and make decisions for the institutions they represent and be unapologetic for who they are.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Islamophobia directed at young women like Ibrahim continues.

It has been slashing staff numbers, cutting officer roles and selling off its London headquarters in Gray\u2019s Inn Road in order to avoid financial collapse.</p> <p>The union\u2019s considerably more modest new home is in a corner of Hackney community college. Despite the scaled-down nature of the organisation, Ibrahim is enthusiastic about campaigning for a fully funded education system that is accessible to all.</p> <p>She said: \u201cI want to change the narrative of the way we talk about education and for people to understand education is for the public good. I\u2019ve been in the sector for years and seen the mess that it has got into, and the mess it\u2019s heading towards. Free education is not about me. I\u2019ve got my degree.

I think people know and understand I\u2019m a completely different person from the 16-year-old child that I was, who had no political training and no political education at all at that time.\u201d Ibrahim said her experience was common among young people from Muslim backgrounds or people of colour who dared to step into the public sphere. \u201cTo me, what\u2019s been the most upsetting thing is to see young people who would be incredible in these roles to not even think of running because of the backlash that I faced. If it had been any of my white peers or colleagues they would never have experienced that.\u201d Ibrahim said she worried about putting herself forward as a candidate to lead the NUS after witnessing the experience of Malia Bouattia, the first Muslim NUS president, who was subjected to Islamophobic attacks and hate-filled trolling on social media during her tenure. She said: \u201cWhen I was thinking about running, it was the biggest factor that was putting me off \u2013 the backlash and the vilification and all the horrors that would come with it. \u201cBut at the same time I recognise it\u2019s not something I should be afraid to do and I want to be able to encourage young people \u2013 especially young girls that look like myself \u2013 to be able to come into these spaces and make decisions for the institutions they represent and be unapologetic for who they are.\u201d Meanwhile, the Islamophobia directed at young women like Ibrahim continues. On Wednesday, she tweeted: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how frequent it happens, what the context is, where it happens or who the perpetrators are, I will always be racially profiled and discriminated against. Who you are, what you\u2019ve achieved and what you do will never matter.\u201d Ibrahim takes over the leadership of the NUS at a difficult time for the union, which has has been forced to undergo a radical overhaul because of a \u00a33m deficit. It has been slashing staff numbers, cutting officer roles and selling off its London headquarters in Gray\u2019s Inn Road in order to avoid financial collapse. The union\u2019s considerably more modest new home is in a corner of Hackney community college. Despite the scaled-down nature of the organisation, Ibrahim is enthusiastic about campaigning for a fully funded education system that is accessible to all. She said: \u201cI want to change the narrative of the way we talk about education and for people to understand education is for the public good. I\u2019ve been in the sector for years and seen the mess that it has got into, and the mess it\u2019s heading towards. Free education is not about me. I\u2019ve got my degree. It\u2019s about future generations that are going to come after me.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 12 August 2019 because Zamzam Ibrahim was previously president of the students\u2019 union at the University of Salford, not at the University of Bradford as an earlier version said. This has been corrected.",

Sigrid McCawley, lawyer to Virginia Giuffre and other victims, said in a statement that Epstein\u2019s suicide was \u201cno coincidence\u201d. \u201cWe are hopeful that the government will continue to investigate and will focus on those who participated and facilitated Epstein\u2019s horrifying sex trafficking scheme that damaged so many. The victims await the true justice they have sought and deserve,\u201d she said. Civil rights lawyer Lisa Bloom, who represents several alleged victims, called for Epstein\u2019s estate to be held for his accusers. She tweeted: \u201cI am calling today for the administrators of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s estate to freeze all his assets and hold them for his victims who are filing civil cases. Their lives have been shattered by his sexual assaults, their careers derailed. They deserve full and fair compensation NOW.\u201d On Friday, more than 2,000 pages of documents were unsealed from a 2015 defamation claim in the US by Virginia Giuffre against Ghislaine Maxwell, settled in 2017. The records contain graphic allegations against Epstein, as well as the transcript of a 2016 deposition of Epstein in which he repeatedly refused to answer questions to avoid incriminating himself.

When the 16-year-old Greta Thunberg visited Britain earlier this year I convened cross-party talks with her on how to end our climate emergency.

So I have reached out to 10 women colleagues from across the political spectrum at Westminster and Holyrood \u2013 Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, Labour, the SNP, Plaid Cymru, the Independent Group for Change and independent \u2013 asking that we join together to stop the dangerous pursuit of a crash-out Brexit.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>If parliament passed a motion of no confidence in Boris Johnson\u2019s government, the plan would be for them to form a temporary cabinet, existing only to propose a Brexit referendum, likely to be remain versus no deal.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/11/cabinet-women-no-deal-brexit-caroline-lucas\">I\u2019m calling for a cabinet of women to stop a disastrous no-deal Brexit | Caroline Lucas</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The move by Lucas is the first public offer to Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP, as well as Tory rebels, detailing who would lead a potential government of national unity and how it could be constituted with the explicit aim of delivering a referendum.</p> \n<p>The move is likely to have a mixed reception in Westminster from some leading figures coordinating the anti-no deal planning in parliament, several of whom are not in favour of a second referendum, including Sir Oliver Letwin and Nick Boles.</p> \n<p>Labour has ruled out backing a replacement government not led by Jeremy Corbyn, limiting the chances that the plan could succeed.

      "bodyText": "The Green MP, Caroline Lucas, has thrown down the gauntlet to 10 high-profile female politicians over blocking a no-deal Brexit, proposing a cabinet of national unity including Labour\u2019s Emily Thornberry, the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, and the former Conservative cabinet minister Justine Greening to seek legislation for a fresh referendum. In an extraordinary proposal that will be viewed with scepticism by rival parties, Lucas offered to broker a deal with female MPs from all the main political parties in Westminster, as well as the SNP\u2019s leader, Nicola Sturgeon. If parliament passed a motion of no confidence in Boris Johnson\u2019s government, the plan would be for them to form a temporary cabinet, existing only to propose a Brexit referendum, likely to be remain versus no deal. The move by Lucas is the first public offer to Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP, as well as Tory rebels, detailing who would lead a potential government of national unity and how it could be constituted with the explicit aim of delivering a referendum. The move is likely to have a mixed reception in Westminster from some leading figures coordinating the anti-no deal planning in parliament, several of whom are not in favour of a second referendum, including Sir Oliver Letwin and Nick Boles. Labour has ruled out backing a replacement government not led by Jeremy Corbyn, limiting the chances that the plan could succeed. Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, appears unlikely to back such a move. Lucas, who is understood to have begun talks with the women she has addressed in her open letter, sent the offer to Thornberry, Swinson, Greening and Sturgeon, as well as the Change UK MP Anna Soubry, the independent MP Heidi Allen, the SNP\u2019s Kirsty Blackman, the independent Northern Irish MP Sylvia Hermon and Plaid Cymru\u2019s Liz Saville Roberts. The final MP who has been approached is Yvette Cooper, one of the leading Labour figures coordinating efforts to stop no deal, but the only one of the addressees who has not explicitly endorsed a second referendum herself. Lucas, the former Green party leader who is her party\u2019s only MP, wrote: \u201cIt is hard to remember a moment in my lifetime when Britain faced a greater crisis. A coup led by a small group of rightwing libertarians is all but complete, as the Vote Leave team has been reassembled and taken control of 10 Downing Street. \u201cThey are set upon implementing the most extreme no-deal version of Brexit \u2013 and, most terrifyingly, we are running out of time to stop them.\u201d Lucas said she believed a cabinet of women from across the political spectrum would be best placed to set up an \u201cemergency cabinet\u201d which she said would \u201cwork for reconciliation\u201d rather than fight new political battles. \u201cWhy women? Because I believe women have shown they can bring a different perspective to crises, are able to reach out to those they disagree with and cooperate to find solutions,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt was two women who began the Peace People movement during the worst of the troubles in Northern Ireland; it was two women who were key to the signing of the Paris agreement on climate; difficult, intractable problems have found the beginning of resolution thanks to the leadership of women.\u201d Soubry said she had been in contact with Lucas over the idea, but had some reservations: \u201cThe very serious point is that people of different political views, who might profoundly disagree over some things, need to put their differences aside and work together to stop a no-deal Brexit. That is really important. \u201cHowever, while I agree that women can do things in a different way, if you\u2019re trying to stop no-deal Brexit then the key thing is to bring people together, not to divide them on the basis of their gender.\u201d But Allen said she had signed up to the plan: \u201cCaroline is right to draw the conclusion that often it\u2019s us women who are prepared to get people round a table and work differently. \u201cWe are facing the precipice of no deal so we have to shed old ways of working, and fast. Women are by nature less tribal, so I\u2019m very willing to play my part and try.\u201d In her letter, Lucas argued she did not accept that such an arrangement risked being an anti-democratic stitch-up. The proposal was, she said, \u201cnot so that a small group of us decide on Britain\u2019s future, but so that we end the dangerous pursuit of a crash-out Brexit and find a way forward which allows the British people to decide which course to take\u201d. Lucas said the first course of action would be to defeat Johnson in a confidence vote with the immediate aim of forming a national unity government which would negotiate an extension to article 50 in order to hold a new referendum. That referendum would give voters the option to choose between remain and \u201cthe latest government plan\u201d. Lucas said that could include a revised withdrawal agreement, should Johnson have produced one, but accepted it was \u201cmore likely\u201d that the alternative would be to leave with no deal. Lucas said those forming the new government would commit to \u201caccept the outcome of that fair, transparent and informed vote, even if it delivers a result we do not agree with\u201d, implying the temporary government would then dissolve. \u201cI believe we can make this happen,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to meet with me in the coming days, so together we can transform the conversation about Brexit. So together we can find a positive way forward, revitalise our democracy and stand up to this government\u2019s reckless gamble with Britain\u2019s future.\u201d",

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Caroline Lucas \u2013 prime minister</strong></p> \n<p>While her letter does not make this explicit, it does make it clear the Green party MP is leading the effort, and would head the brief administration.

Instead a shirt-sleeved August crowd saw a powerful home win which will fuel that time-honoured English emotion, premature optimism. There is still more than a month before the tournament kicks off, as both coaches were quick to stress afterwards.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/aug/11/england-wales-rugby-union-world-cup-warm-up-match-live\">England 33-19 Wales: Rugby World Cup warm-up match \u2013\u00a0as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That said, there was sufficient strength and energy on display from Eddie Jones\u2019s players to send them skipping down the M4 to Bristol where the final 31-man squad is due to be confirmed at lunchtime on Monday. Warren Gatland\u2019s Wales will head westward in more contemplative mood, having lost for the first time in 15 Tests and missed the opportunity, for now, to overhaul the All Blacks.</p> <p>The reality is that neither of these two sides is yet in a position to make grandiose claims on the subject of world domination but England\u2019s directness, scrum supremacy and power out wide were conspicuous enough to send an equally blunt message to the southern hemisphere. They will be big, fit and strong in Japan and a potential threat to anyone if they can bring the decision-making and consistent execution to match.</p> <p>When Joe Cokanasiga, Billy Vunipola, Manu Tuilagi and a revved-up Ellis Genge are in full cry there is certainly no shortage of front-foot muscle and Northampton\u2019s Lewis Ludlam, who played almost as hard as he sang the national anthem, could not have done much more to press for a seat on the plane.</p> <p>Had the all-action Tom Curry not departed prematurely with a sore acromioclavicular joint, Wales might have found it harder to launch the second-half comeback which dragged them back from 21-7 down. Without the class and defensive valour of Jonathan Davies and Liam Williams it could have become a long afternoon.</p> <p>It will be interesting to see how they respond this coming Saturday in the reverse fixture in Cardiff, when Gatland plans to employ largely the same starting XV. As Alun Wyn Jones wryly noted afterwards, they also started this year\u2019s Six Nations slowly but \u201cdid pretty well in the end\u201d. Either way the result of a scan on Gareth Anscombe\u2019s injured knee will be keenly awaited, the Welsh fly-half having ended the day on crutches.</p> <p>Rather more pivotal encounters await in Japan but there was an edge to this supposed warm-up from the outset, England\u2019s impressive early close-range power earning them a 14-0 lead through converted tries from Vunipola and Cokanasiga.</p> <p>Wales needed a spark and were duly blessed with an outstanding individual try from their scrum-half, Gareth Davies, who spotted space down the blindside off a scrum and swerved past Elliot Daly for a wonderful 40-metre solo score. It was Davies who scored the crucial try in their 2015 World Cup pool win over England on this ground and his highlights reel grows ever more eye-catching.</p> <p>At no stage, however, were Wales able to relax in the set pieces and England\u2019s third try was a gift. Ken Owens\u2019s decision to opt for a long throw close to his own line with half-time looming was an interesting gambit which backfired spectacularly when the ball soared over Alun Wyn Jones and Luke Cowan-Dickie hurtled over for his first England try.</p> <p>A 21-7 interval lead was due reward for England\u2019s extra urgency and attacking intensity but Wales were not finished, surging back into contention with tries from George North and the replacement prop Wyn Jones after the hosts had replaced their debutant scrum-half Willi Heinz. While the Gloucester man is a smart tactician, which England clearly like, there have been quicker 9s at the highest level.</p> <p>Three George Ford penalties and a late opportunist Daly drop goal, however, clinched a morale-boosting win for Jones\u2019s side, who had four locks on the field at one stage in the second half.</p> <p>Vunipola was a purposeful presence, Cokanasiga was a consistent handful on the left wing and, along with Ludlum and Heinz, both Jack Singleton and Joe Marchant earned precious first caps off the bench. It brings to 70 the number of players capped by Jones since early 2016, with no fewer than 129 having been called up to train with the squad.</p> <p>The trick now is to distil those various hunches down to the optimum 31-man blend, capable of mixing it with anyone in Japan. Knowing Jones there may yet be a selectorial sting in the tale but, style-wise, it is already clear his 31 chosen men will not be a shy, retiring bunch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "This was supposed to be Wales\u2019s big moment, a chance to knock New Zealand off their decade-long perch at the top of the World Rugby rankings. Instead a shirt-sleeved August crowd saw a powerful home win which will fuel that time-honoured English emotion, premature optimism. There is still more than a month before the tournament kicks off, as both coaches were quick to stress afterwards. That said, there was sufficient strength and energy on display from Eddie Jones\u2019s players to send them skipping down the M4 to Bristol where the final 31-man squad is due to be confirmed at lunchtime on Monday. Warren Gatland\u2019s Wales will head westward in more contemplative mood, having lost for the first time in 15 Tests and missed the opportunity, for now, to overhaul the All Blacks. The reality is that neither of these two sides is yet in a position to make grandiose claims on the subject of world domination but England\u2019s directness, scrum supremacy and power out wide were conspicuous enough to send an equally blunt message to the southern hemisphere. They will be big, fit and strong in Japan and a potential threat to anyone if they can bring the decision-making and consistent execution to match. When Joe Cokanasiga, Billy Vunipola, Manu Tuilagi and a revved-up Ellis Genge are in full cry there is certainly no shortage of front-foot muscle and Northampton\u2019s Lewis Ludlam, who played almost as hard as he sang the national anthem, could not have done much more to press for a seat on the plane. Had the all-action Tom Curry not departed prematurely with a sore acromioclavicular joint, Wales might have found it harder to launch the second-half comeback which dragged them back from 21-7 down. Without the class and defensive valour of Jonathan Davies and Liam Williams it could have become a long afternoon. It will be interesting to see how they respond this coming Saturday in the reverse fixture in Cardiff, when Gatland plans to employ largely the same starting XV. As Alun Wyn Jones wryly noted afterwards, they also started this year\u2019s Six Nations slowly but \u201cdid pretty well in the end\u201d. Either way the result of a scan on Gareth Anscombe\u2019s injured knee will be keenly awaited, the Welsh fly-half having ended the day on crutches. Rather more pivotal encounters await in Japan but there was an edge to this supposed warm-up from the outset, England\u2019s impressive early close-range power earning them a 14-0 lead through converted tries from Vunipola and Cokanasiga. Wales needed a spark and were duly blessed with an outstanding individual try from their scrum-half, Gareth Davies, who spotted space down the blindside off a scrum and swerved past Elliot Daly for a wonderful 40-metre solo score. It was Davies who scored the crucial try in their 2015 World Cup pool win over England on this ground and his highlights reel grows ever more eye-catching. At no stage, however, were Wales able to relax in the set pieces and England\u2019s third try was a gift. Ken Owens\u2019s decision to opt for a long throw close to his own line with half-time looming was an interesting gambit which backfired spectacularly when the ball soared over Alun Wyn Jones and Luke Cowan-Dickie hurtled over for his first England try. A 21-7 interval lead was due reward for England\u2019s extra urgency and attacking intensity but Wales were not finished, surging back into contention with tries from George North and the replacement prop Wyn Jones after the hosts had replaced their debutant scrum-half Willi Heinz. While the Gloucester man is a smart tactician, which England clearly like, there have been quicker 9s at the highest level. Three George Ford penalties and a late opportunist Daly drop goal, however, clinched a morale-boosting win for Jones\u2019s side, who had four locks on the field at one stage in the second half. Vunipola was a purposeful presence, Cokanasiga was a consistent handful on the left wing and, along with Ludlum and Heinz, both Jack Singleton and Joe Marchant earned precious first caps off the bench. It brings to 70 the number of players capped by Jones since early 2016, with no fewer than 129 having been called up to train with the squad. The trick now is to distil those various hunches down to the optimum 31-man blend, capable of mixing it with anyone in Japan. Knowing Jones there may yet be a selectorial sting in the tale but, style-wise, it is already clear his 31 chosen men will not be a shy, retiring bunch.",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of Asda supermarket stores will help power the UK\u2019s electricity system this winter by using their fridges as a virtual battery pack for the energy grid. Britain\u2019s third-largest supermarket chain has signed up 300 stores and 18 distribution depots to schemes which can earn the grocery giant extra revenue while helping to balance the electricity grid. Under the long-term deal with National Grid the supermarket\u2019s nationwide networks of freezer aisles and storage fridges will make up a 13-megawatt power source \u2013 enough energy to power about 8,500 homes. Asda has also signed up to a trial which could mean its fridges are called on at only 10 minutes\u2019 notice to act as a safety net if there is an unexpected power station outage. National Grid pays out about \u00a31bn worth of contracts through its energy capacity market. Most are awarded to power plants so they are ready to ramp up their generation but they can also be given to companies which can cut their electricity use to help reduce overall demand on the grid. Peter Smith, Asda\u2019s energy manager, said the deals were a \u201cno-brainer\u201d for the supermarket, which can easily cut the electricity to its fridges and air conditioning when needed while keeping the temperature of its stores stable. All industrial fridges are turned off at least once a day as part of a standard defrost cycle but new technology means supermarkets can earn extra revenue by matching the downtime to Britain\u2019s energy needs. The supermarket is working with Flexitricity, a specialist Edinburgh-based energy firm, which uses technology to aggregate the energy potential of companies across the country. Flexitricity hopes that by creating a virtual battery across its portfolio of clients it can bid for National Grid contracts which would earn the companies extra revenue while cutting carbon emissions. Smith said: \u201cReducing energy consumption makes both environmental and business sense. \u201cWhile we are a large company, our individual sites are relatively small, so the [Flexitricity] model provides an innovative and collaborative way for us to manage our consumption better, reduce our carbon footprint and provide a benefit back to the National Grid. It really is a no-brainer for us,\u201d he said. Tesco is also undertaking trials to test whether cold food could prove to be Britain\u2019s largest battery by using mini-power cuts to its freezer aisles to help balance the grid. If Tesco harnessed all its fridges across the UK it could create a virtual battery of between 25MW and 50MW, which is on a par with the batteries attracting interest from major energy companies.",

      "bodyText": "Italy\u2019s far-right deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, has clashed with Richard Gere over the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean, suggesting the Hollywood star should house himself those stranded on rescue ships after the US actor urged the Italian government to \u201cstop demonising asylum seekers\u201d. Gere who is currently on the island of Lampedusa, Sicily, after a visit onboard a Spanish NGO ship, Proactiva Open Arms, where he met some of the 160 migrants the vessel rescued in the strait of Sicily. The ship has been stuck for 10 days off Lampedusa due to Italy\u2019s ban on landing migrants. The 69-year-old actor appeared in a video message urging people to support the charity and the people onboard. \u201cAll hands onboard would have been lost,\u201d Gere said in the video. \u201cSo, the people you see here on this boat, they\u2019re only here because of the donations to Open Arms for the work they do.\u201d Last week, Gere, who was holidaying in Tuscany, travelled to Sicily and joined the charity to deliver food and supplies to the migrants. \u201cI already came to Lampedusa two or three years ago,\u201d Gere said, \u201cto visit the migrants hotspot so I knew the situation first-hand: they are people who have lived horrible stories, they have suffered a lot, they call them migrants but they are refugees who need help.\u201d Gere also compared the crisis in the Mediterranean and the prohibition of landing migrants with the Trump administration\u2019s policies on the border with Mexico: \u201cWe have our problems with refugees coming from Honduras, Salvador, Nicaragua, Mexico \u2026 It\u2019s very similar to what you are going through here,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has to stop everywhere on this planet now. And it will stop if we say so,\u201d Gere said, adding that he doesn\u2019t want to get into a political fight. On Saturday, Salvini, who last year declared Italy\u2019s ports closed to migrant rescue ships, replied to the actor: \u201cGiven this generous millionaire is voicing concern for the fate of the Open Arms migrants, we thank him.\u201d \u201cHe can take all the people aboard back to Hollywood, on his private plane,\u2019\u2019 Salvini said, \u201cand support them in his villas. Thank you, Richard!\u201d\u2019 The Italian government has introduced a new security decree, drafted by Salvini, who is also the interior minister, that would mean NGO rescue boats bringing migrants to Italy without permission could face fines of up to \u20ac50,000 (\u00a347,000). The new bill, which has been described by aid groups as a \u201cdeclaration of war against the NGOs who are saving lives at sea,\u201d aims to put an end to aid groups\u2019 rescue missions in the central Mediterranean. Meanwhile, another rescue ship with migrants onboard is awaiting a safe port. The Ocean Viking, flying the Norwegian flag and operated by the NGOs Doctors Without Borders and SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, has not been allowed to let the people disembark and was denied \u201centry, transit and parking in Italian waters\u201d. The boat has recovered more than 80 migrants \u2013 adults and children \u2013 most of Sudanese origin, off Libyan waters. It was the second 24-hour rescue operation conducted by the ship, which had already recovered 85 people.",

(Except he isn\u2019t hanging upside down, obviously). He is tired, he says. Not from a season sitting on benches, in Stoke and Burnley; or from being out on the town, dancing like a robot; but because there is a new addition to the Crouch family: child number four, aged four weeks when we meet in a fancy London hotel.<br><br>He wanted to call his second son Divock, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/08/how-psychology-helped-origi-be-a-liverpool-hero-after-wolfsburg-low\">Divock Origi</a>, whose heroics helped Liverpool on their way to winning the Champions League (Crouch has a place in his heart for all his many former clubs, but a special one for the Reds). But his wife \u2013 the model and television personality Abbey Clancy \u2013 wasn\u2019t having it. So the little lad is called Jack. <br><br>How is he? \u201cGood as gold. He just wakes up for his bottle, he\u2019s not like a crier,\u201d says Crouch, with a proud little yawn. And how\u2019s Dad, at dadding? \u201cHands on. Yeah, I\u2019m good. I enjoy it, it\u2019s good fun.\u201d <br><br>There is also another new baby \u2013 a weekly football show called Back of the Net (nothing to do with Alan Partridge) that will go out on Amazon Prime Video. Crouch, who is 38, will host alongside the broadcaster Gabby Logan and the comedian John Bishop. There will be a studio element, with an audience, interviews and, Crouch promises, proper guests, his heroes. <br><br>For example? Can he say, he asks the Amazon publicity woman who is sitting in with a notepad, playing the role of the ref. Harry Redknapp, his old gaffer, and John Barnes were in the pilot; he can say that.<br><br>Back of the Net is going to be relaxed and humorous, he says. We will see people in unexpected situations. He mentions they have a well-known football hard man reviewing kids\u2019 toys. Roy Keane? \u201cHa ha ha, no comment.\u201d <br><br>Hang on. John Bishop is another Red. Is this going to be a Liverpool love-in? \u201cJohn will be biased, 100%, but I won\u2019t be. I\u2019ve got a big affection for Liverpool, but I\u2019ve got big affection for Tottenham, QPR, Aston Villa, Southampton, Portsmouth, all the clubs that I\u2019ve played for.

He scored 42 goals for Liverpool. And, after initially being booed by England supporters, he was capped 42 times for his country, scored 22 times and went to two World Cups. <br><br>Recently, he has been proving himself in different ways. With his (second) <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/how-to-be-a-footballer-9781785039782.html\">autobiography</a>, his comic <a href=\"https://twitter.com/petercrouch?lang=en-gb\">tweeting</a> and his excellent <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06kyljg/episodes/downloads\">That Peter Crouch Podcast</a> on the BBC, he has demonstrated qualities not often associated with or witnessed in his profession: insightfulness, awareness of some of the absurdities of his world, a sense of humour. Crouchy is funny. \u201cSummer for me is about time with the family,\u201d he Tweeted, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/petercrouch/status/876846713163718656?lang=en\">with a picture of him feeding giraffes</a>. An interview once asked he what he would be if he hadn\u2019t been a footballer. \u201cA virgin,\u201d came the reply.<br><br>Back of the Net won\u2019t just be a trip back down Lad Way, he promises, a return to Baddiel and Skinner\u2019s Fantasy Football League. \u201cI think maybe that\u2019s been done and football\u2019s moving in a different direction,\u201d he says, citing the rise of the women\u2019s game. Logan will help to ensure that the programme is not just blokey banter. \u201cIt\u2019s not just young lads who like football any more,\u201d Crouch says. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge range of different people \u2013 everyone, really.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e5a1b138473c40aff3ba552ccd63c1029f75a730\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5a1b138473c40aff3ba552ccd63c1029f75a730/637_0_1996_1996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crouch with his wife Abbey Clancy in 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crouch with his wife Abbey Clancy in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apart from Clancy, that is.

She wasn\u2019t interested in the Women\u2019s World Cup either. It\u2019s the game, not him. <br><br>Did he watch it? \u201cYeah. It was very good; the standard was good, the coverage was good, England did great. I would\u2019ve liked to have seen them win it, obviously, but America were the best team in the tournament.\u201d<br><br>It will help more girls into football, he says, although his daughters \u2013 Sophia, 8, and Liberty, 4 \u2013 seem to have inherited their mother\u2019s apathy towards the game. The elder takes an interest when it suits her, like when some of the boys at holiday camp asked her if her dad really was Peter Crouch. Suddenly, he says, she wanted him to come and pick her up. \u201cAnd she came on the field after the last game at Burnley; they enjoyed that.\u201d<br><br>Football may have broadened its appeal and become more inclusive over the course of the 23 years Crouch has played the game, but it has also seen a return to the bad old days. There are more incidents of overt racism in the stands. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s something we don\u2019t want to see or hear,\u201d he says. <br><br>And is it not extraordinary that there are still no current Premier League footballers who are gay and out? It\u2019s like a last bastion of homophobia. \u201cThere is talk of a gay footballer coming out,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it would be an issue now; it shouldn\u2019t be, in this day and age.\u201d <br><br>Crouch has had abuse hurled at him from the stands, including \u2013 since starting out as a teenager \u2013 chants of \u201cfreak\u201d. And it did get to him. \u201cOf course, I was a bit conscious of being so skinny and tall. I\u2019m different-looking to the average footballer. So, obviously, when I started getting those chants it was hurtful, and it pushed me to the point where I thought: \u2018Do I really want to put myself through this?\u2019 Yes, I had doubts and things like that, but I look back on it now and I\u2019m proud of coming through that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"54c5b97d0b92a218ccf369c51b2ab904a8035e62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54c5b97d0b92a218ccf369c51b2ab904a8035e62/361_0_1313_957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crouch with his fellow Back of the Net presenters, John Bishop and Gabby Logan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"729\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crouch with his fellow Back of the Net presenters, John Bishop and Gabby Logan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amazon Prime Video</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br><br>He\u2019s not just different-looking. Crouch doesn\u2019t behave like your stereotypical Premier League player, either. \u201cI think footballers are perhaps too guarded. Maybe I\u2019ve let people in a bit more, just being a bit more honest.\u201d</p> <p>No, it\u2019s not to do with being more middle-class, he says. (His dad worked in advertising \u2013 Crouch did work experience at his agency and loved it. He says he might have gone into something like that \u2013 as well as remaining a virgin, obviously \u2013 if he hadn\u2019t become a footballer). \u201cI had quite a traditional upbringing, but, you know, I grew up around football and footballers, I was the same; I\u2019ve got a lot of my mates from football.\u201d</p> <p>He says the football industry and many players take themselves way too seriously. \u201cIf you\u2019re a player at the highest level, and you get told you\u2019re amazing, day in, day out, it may be hard to climb down from there,\u201d he says, raising his hand from the sofa, to indicate the highest level. <br><br>But Crouch wasn\u2019t always up there (except literally).

      "bodyText": "Folded up in the corner of a sofa, wearing skinny black jeans and a black shirt, limbs tucked away wherever they will go, Peter Crouch looks a bit like a sleeping bat. (Except he isn\u2019t hanging upside down, obviously). He is tired, he says. Not from a season sitting on benches, in Stoke and Burnley; or from being out on the town, dancing like a robot; but because there is a new addition to the Crouch family: child number four, aged four weeks when we meet in a fancy London hotel. He wanted to call his second son Divock, after Divock Origi, whose heroics helped Liverpool on their way to winning the Champions League (Crouch has a place in his heart for all his many former clubs, but a special one for the Reds). But his wife \u2013 the model and television personality Abbey Clancy \u2013 wasn\u2019t having it. So the little lad is called Jack. How is he? \u201cGood as gold. He just wakes up for his bottle, he\u2019s not like a crier,\u201d says Crouch, with a proud little yawn. And how\u2019s Dad, at dadding? \u201cHands on. Yeah, I\u2019m good. I enjoy it, it\u2019s good fun.\u201d There is also another new baby \u2013 a weekly football show called Back of the Net (nothing to do with Alan Partridge) that will go out on Amazon Prime Video. Crouch, who is 38, will host alongside the broadcaster Gabby Logan and the comedian John Bishop. There will be a studio element, with an audience, interviews and, Crouch promises, proper guests, his heroes. For example? Can he say, he asks the Amazon publicity woman who is sitting in with a notepad, playing the role of the ref. Harry Redknapp, his old gaffer, and John Barnes were in the pilot; he can say that. Back of the Net is going to be relaxed and humorous, he says. We will see people in unexpected situations. He mentions they have a well-known football hard man reviewing kids\u2019 toys. Roy Keane? \u201cHa ha ha, no comment.\u201d Hang on. John Bishop is another Red. Is this going to be a Liverpool love-in? \u201cJohn will be biased, 100%, but I won\u2019t be. I\u2019ve got a big affection for Liverpool, but I\u2019ve got big affection for Tottenham, QPR, Aston Villa, Southampton, Portsmouth, all the clubs that I\u2019ve played for. I\u2019ve played for enough clubs to have a varied view on things.\u201d Since failing to break into the first team at Tottenham as a teenager and getting loaned out to Dulwich Hamlet and IFK H\u00e4ssleholm in the Swediesh third tier, Crouchy has spent two decades proving people wrong. The wrong shape to be a striker, the wrong shape to be any kind of footballer, he scored 108 Premier League goals for the seven Premier League clubs he played for, including ridiculous bicycle kicks \u2013 then he really was hanging upside down in the air \u2013 and that wonder volley against Manchester City. He scored 42 goals for Liverpool. And, after initially being booed by England supporters, he was capped 42 times for his country, scored 22 times and went to two World Cups. Recently, he has been proving himself in different ways. With his (second) autobiography, his comic tweeting and his excellent That Peter Crouch Podcast on the BBC, he has demonstrated qualities not often associated with or witnessed in his profession: insightfulness, awareness of some of the absurdities of his world, a sense of humour. Crouchy is funny. \u201cSummer for me is about time with the family,\u201d he Tweeted, with a picture of him feeding giraffes. An interview once asked he what he would be if he hadn\u2019t been a footballer. \u201cA virgin,\u201d came the reply. Back of the Net won\u2019t just be a trip back down Lad Way, he promises, a return to Baddiel and Skinner\u2019s Fantasy Football League. \u201cI think maybe that\u2019s been done and football\u2019s moving in a different direction,\u201d he says, citing the rise of the women\u2019s game. Logan will help to ensure that the programme is not just blokey banter. \u201cIt\u2019s not just young lads who like football any more,\u201d Crouch says. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge range of different people \u2013 everyone, really.\u201d Apart from Clancy, that is. She has been known to call her husband at 10 to three on a Saturday to ask what his plans are for the afternoon. He doesn\u2019t mind that she\u2019s not interested \u2013 in fact, it\u2019s nice to come home and talk about other things, he says. She wasn\u2019t interested in the Women\u2019s World Cup either. It\u2019s the game, not him. Did he watch it? \u201cYeah. It was very good; the standard was good, the coverage was good, England did great. I would\u2019ve liked to have seen them win it, obviously, but America were the best team in the tournament.\u201d It will help more girls into football, he says, although his daughters \u2013 Sophia, 8, and Liberty, 4 \u2013 seem to have inherited their mother\u2019s apathy towards the game. The elder takes an interest when it suits her, like when some of the boys at holiday camp asked her if her dad really was Peter Crouch. Suddenly, he says, she wanted him to come and pick her up. \u201cAnd she came on the field after the last game at Burnley; they enjoyed that.\u201d Football may have broadened its appeal and become more inclusive over the course of the 23 years Crouch has played the game, but it has also seen a return to the bad old days. There are more incidents of overt racism in the stands. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s something we don\u2019t want to see or hear,\u201d he says. And is it not extraordinary that there are still no current Premier League footballers who are gay and out? It\u2019s like a last bastion of homophobia. \u201cThere is talk of a gay footballer coming out,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it would be an issue now; it shouldn\u2019t be, in this day and age.\u201d Crouch has had abuse hurled at him from the stands, including \u2013 since starting out as a teenager \u2013 chants of \u201cfreak\u201d. And it did get to him. \u201cOf course, I was a bit conscious of being so skinny and tall. I\u2019m different-looking to the average footballer. So, obviously, when I started getting those chants it was hurtful, and it pushed me to the point where I thought: \u2018Do I really want to put myself through this?\u2019 Yes, I had doubts and things like that, but I look back on it now and I\u2019m proud of coming through that.\u201d He\u2019s not just different-looking. Crouch doesn\u2019t behave like your stereotypical Premier League player, either. \u201cI think footballers are perhaps too guarded. Maybe I\u2019ve let people in a bit more, just being a bit more honest.\u201d No, it\u2019s not to do with being more middle-class, he says. (His dad worked in advertising \u2013 Crouch did work experience at his agency and loved it. He says he might have gone into something like that \u2013 as well as remaining a virgin, obviously \u2013 if he hadn\u2019t become a footballer). \u201cI had quite a traditional upbringing, but, you know, I grew up around football and footballers, I was the same; I\u2019ve got a lot of my mates from football.\u201d He says the football industry and many players take themselves way too seriously. \u201cIf you\u2019re a player at the highest level, and you get told you\u2019re amazing, day in, day out, it may be hard to climb down from there,\u201d he says, raising his hand from the sofa, to indicate the highest level. But Crouch wasn\u2019t always up there (except literally). Perhaps that helped make him who is, I say. He says the loan in Sweden grounded him and made him really work for success. \u201cThen I had to struggle at QPR; I went up and down, got to the Premier League, but even at 23 I wasn\u2019t quite ready for the Premier League. I went back down. I wasn\u2019t Michael Owen, I didn\u2019t burst on and score a goal for England at 18. I sometimes think the way I did it \u2026\u201d, he pauses, then laughs. \u201cNo, listen, I\u2019d rather have been Michael Owen.\u201d But imagine listening to That Michael Owen Podcast. Exactly; now you\u2019re imagining switching it off. When we meet, Crouch hasn\u2019t officially hung up the size 12s, and he jokes about taking over from Gareth Bale at Real Madrid, or Neymar at Paris Saint-Germain.

It escalated from there.\u201d Over the next few weeks, Oakenfull documented sightings on her Instagram. \u201cEveryone started getting really into it.\u201d When Oakenfull went on holiday, she said: \u201cI\u2019m not doing any dress content for a week.\u201d By then, her followers were hungry for polka-dot content and, on her return in May, Oakenfull set up Hot 4 the Spot, describing it as a \u201csafe space for the dress\u201d.</p> <p>There have been other viral fashion sensations in recent years: <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/6898707/m-s-polka-dot-jumpsuit-back-in-stock-matching-version-kids/\" title=\"\">last summer\u2019s M&amp;S jumpsuit</a>, or the R\u00e9alisation Par leopard-print skirt with an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/leopardmidiskirt/\" title=\"\">Instagram fan account</a>. But the Zara dress is a different beast. This is not a cult item being worn by a narrow cross-section of women of similar ages and economic backgrounds. It has transcended its initial cool-girl early adopters to become a sartorial choice for women of all shapes, sizes and ages. It is no longer the preserve of slim, middle-class city-dwelling women who work in offices and do pilates. The dress is worn at village fetes, suburban barbecues and on school runs. It has become the everywoman dress.</p> <p>Why is it so popular with such a diverse range of women? \u201cIt\u2019s a readymade outfit,\u201d says Neelam Hundal, a 31-year old solicitor from London, who bought the dress in April. \u201cIt will go with anything. It can be casual \u2013 I\u2019ve worn it on the beach \u2013 but I can also wear it to the office.\u201d Plus, it suits all body types.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really unusual to find in our modern times an item that suits so many people,\u201d says Nicola Melody, a 37-year-old senior manager from Leeds. \u201cUsually, when something is popular it\u2019s got really thin straps, so you can\u2019t wear a bra, or it\u2019s too fitted so doesn\u2019t suit anyone with a hint of stomach. But this dress suits everyone.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d1cffbcc85a7b3eeda0e1a338101d44fb61c324\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d1cffbcc85a7b3eeda0e1a338101d44fb61c324/0_204_821_774/500.jpg\" alt=\"Double take \u2026 Jessica Eve Nilson found herself lunching with a friend in the same dress.\" width=\"500\" height=\"471\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Double take \u2026 Jessica Eve Nilson found herself lunching with a friend in the same dress.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram/hot4thespot</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fact that the dress is not revealing is a major selling point. \u201cI\u2019m Muslim and I always want to wear something quite modest in terms of the length and covering my arms,\u201d says Sadia Siddiqui, a 45-year-old strategist from east London. \u201cIt\u2019s modest, but also stylish.\u201d</p> <p>Sharmaine Foster, a 40-year-old housekeeper from Barton-le-Clay in Bedfordshire, feels it is age-appropriate, but also on trend. \u201cEverything in shops tends to be short or cropped, and I\u2019m a bit past that now.\u201d</p> <p>What makes such a demure dress summer\u2019s hottest fashion trend? \u201cYou couldn\u2019t be more covered up,\u201d says Pamela Church Gibson, a fashion historian, adding that the dress is a form of sartorial protest. \u201cIt\u2019s a reaction against very revealing clothes.\u201d She references Kim Kardashian\u2019s appearance at the Met Ball in a corseted Thierry Mugler dress, and the Love Island contestants in their spray-on Lycra. \u201cThe fact it\u2019s so comfortable is very important. It moves past your body and works with it. It doesn\u2019t attempt to rein it in or enclose it. It\u2019s a great relief to put on a dress like that. It gives you that feeling of being completely comfortable in your own skin.\u201d</p> <p>I think of Church Gibson\u2019s words as I unfold the dress from its packaging. Despite previously selling out, it is still available online in some sizes. Zara will not say how many dresses have been sold. By now, I have heard so much about it that it feels like meeting an old friend. Slipping on the dress, I understand immediately what the fuss is about. It is more voluminous than I thought \u2013 and no one warned me how hard it is to do up the button at the back of the neck. But it feels like wearing a nightie, which is to say wonderful. Out for dinner on Saturday night, I gorge myself on pillowy pide, hummus and kebab and experience the joy of my stomach expanding gently like a self-inflating airbed under a polka-dot canvas, invisible to anyone but me.</p> <p>In a society that aggressively polices the female body, the dress feels forgiving. It will drape kindly over wobbly arms and can accommodate a large meal. It also washes well \u2013 and air dries without creasing, so it is ideal for women who don\u2019t have the time or inclination for ironing.</p> <p>Perhaps this is why an unlikely sisterhood has sprung up around the dress. \u201cIt has started a weird club that people want to be a part of,\u201d Oakenfull explains. \u201cIt\u2019s this massive fingers-up to the idea that women should pit ourselves against each other and decide who wore it best. It\u2019s about embracing the fact that we\u2019re all wearing the same thing and enjoying it.\u201d</p> <p>Wearing the dress on the street is like being part of a secret coterie. \u201cYou get smiles, mainly from other women,\u201d says Melody. </p> <p>It is a brave \u2013 or foolhardy \u2013 woman who wears the Zara dress to a social occasion, given how likely it is that someone else will be wearing it. Either that, or she wants the thrill of walking into a room, knowing that the dress may also be there. \u201cPart of my love of the dress is the idea that I shouldn\u2019t wear it because so many other people have it,\u201d Melody says. \u201cBut that just makes me want to wear it more.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"08309cdadfa25ec1a60b0be3dcb3f7ce8d8a16ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08309cdadfa25ec1a60b0be3dcb3f7ce8d8a16ef/0_0_989_603/500.jpg\" alt=\"Spot on at the Wilderness music festival.\" width=\"500\" height=\"305\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spot on at the Wilderness music festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram/hot4thespot</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, things can get awkward. When 24-year-old Jessica Eve Nilsson, a business manager from Surrey, met a friend for lunch in July, she couldn\u2019t figure out why diners were laughing as she arrived. The reason was simple: she and her friend were wearing the dress.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone was looking at us and doing double-takes,\u201d Nilsson says. \u201cIt was one of the weirdest experiences.\u201d As they were sitting at an outdoor table, they were <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BzhmJQoAElI/\" title=\"\">prime photo fodder</a> \u2013 when Nilsson sent a photo to Hot 4 the Spot, Oakenfull replied saying she had already received one, taken without their knowledge. After lunch, they went for drinks \u2013 and bumped into about 10 other women, also wearing the dress. While Nilsson sees the funny side, it is not an experience she wants to repeat \u2013 she has not worn the dress since.</p> <p>The online community around the dress is especially heartwarming, given how negative social media is for many women. There is no toxicity, only women swapping tips <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BzoHWRWldlU/?utm_source=ig_embed\" title=\"\">on how to dye the dress different colours</a>, or sharing images of themselves beaming in identical outfits. The day after we speak, Oakenfull uploads a picture of 11 women wearing the dress in a giant human chain at the Wilderness festival.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6016fbec3c7614e5d37ac60d0a039109e48bacbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6016fbec3c7614e5d37ac60d0a039109e48bacbd/0_1_1045_1045/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olivia Jackson in her dyed pink dress.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olivia Jackson in her dyed pink dress.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram/&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/clothesmyboyfriendhates/&quot;&gt;clothesmyboyfriendhates&lt;/a&gt;</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The dress is also remarkable because it is one of the only \u201cIt\u201d dresses to have a mass-market price point. \u201cIf you think about the Roland Mouret dress,\u201d says Church Gibson, referencing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2005/dec/15/shopping.fashion\" title=\"\">the \u00a31,000 Galaxy design that was ubiquitous</a> in the media in 2005, \u201cthat was very expensive.\u201d</p> <p>A decade on, the commotion around a \u00a340 Zara frock is a reflection of our straitened financial times. \u201cI haven\u2019t got any money, I\u2019m worrying about Brexit,\u201d summarises Church Gibson. She says the last time this prairie-inspired silhouette was popular was in the 1970s, when Laura Ashley dressed a generation during a decade of economic crisis.</p> <p>The dress\u2019s popularity also shows the waning influence of traditional industry gatekeepers. The Galaxy dress, modelled by celebrities such as Rachel Weisz and Cameron Diaz, was celebrated on the pages of Vogue, before being ripped off by the high street. Now we are introduced to the Zara dress through social media. \u201cIt shows more than anything the power of Instagram,\u201d says Church Gibson. \u201cThere is this alternative system of fashion media, that is not dependent on looking at magazines.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26ebaadb10085e7ec970e75fed4977fd06d0d59b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26ebaadb10085e7ec970e75fed4977fd06d0d59b/0_154_3840_5606/685.jpg\" alt=\"Sirin Kale tries the Zara dress for herself.\" width=\"685\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sirin Kale tries the Zara dress for herself.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, fast fashion tends to have a human cost: low wages and poor conditions for the workers who produce it. Zara\u2019s owner, Inditex, does not publish the names of the factories it uses, so it is hard to find out what life is like for the people who make the dress. When asked for this article how the dress is made, Zara did not wish to comment. <a href=\"https://www.inditex.com/documents/10279/619384/Inditex+Annual+Report+2018.pdf/08ed7885-969d-94ff-5abf-6f10d0315fbf\" title=\"\">Inditex\u2019s 2018 annual report</a> states that they \u201cfirmly believe that our model only works if it is sustainable ... [we] have placed the workers in our supply chain at the centre of systems of control in order to foster initiatives that promote social progress.\u201d</p> <p>A dress can mean many things to many people. This is a story of how we went mad for a cheap frock during a summer of great political uncertainty, how we started hugging strangers on the street while Britain baked and it began to feel as if the country was tipping headlong over a precipice.</p> <p>\u201cWe are in very dark times at the moment,\u201d says Melody. \u201cWe have a prime minister we didn\u2019t vote for, the prospect of a no-deal Brexit in October, Trump in America. There\u2019s a lot of awful stuff in the world at the moment and not a lot of joy. I think people do latch on to the thing that brings them joy. The dress did that. It\u2019s fun, accessible. It\u2019s got us talking to each other, strangers coming up to people on the street. It\u2019s allowed people to connect with each other.\u201d Melody pauses: \u201cMaybe that\u2019s a bit profound for a piece of clothing.\u201d</p> <p>It is a bit far-fetched, I think, until I am walking down the street on Sunday evening and see yet another woman smiling at me. Never underestimate the power of the dress.</p>",

The reason was simple: she and her friend were wearing the dress. \u201cEveryone was looking at us and doing double-takes,\u201d Nilsson says. \u201cIt was one of the weirdest experiences.\u201d As they were sitting at an outdoor table, they were prime photo fodder \u2013 when Nilsson sent a photo to Hot 4 the Spot, Oakenfull replied saying she had already received one, taken without their knowledge. After lunch, they went for drinks \u2013 and bumped into about 10 other women, also wearing the dress. While Nilsson sees the funny side, it is not an experience she wants to repeat \u2013 she has not worn the dress since. The online community around the dress is especially heartwarming, given how negative social media is for many women. There is no toxicity, only women swapping tips on how to dye the dress different colours, or sharing images of themselves beaming in identical outfits. The day after we speak, Oakenfull uploads a picture of 11 women wearing the dress in a giant human chain at the Wilderness festival. The dress is also remarkable because it is one of the only \u201cIt\u201d dresses to have a mass-market price point. \u201cIf you think about the Roland Mouret dress,\u201d says Church Gibson, referencing the \u00a31,000 Galaxy design that was ubiquitous in the media in 2005, \u201cthat was very expensive.\u201d A decade on, the commotion around a \u00a340 Zara frock is a reflection of our straitened financial times. \u201cI haven\u2019t got any money, I\u2019m worrying about Brexit,\u201d summarises Church Gibson. She says the last time this prairie-inspired silhouette was popular was in the 1970s, when Laura Ashley dressed a generation during a decade of economic crisis. The dress\u2019s popularity also shows the waning influence of traditional industry gatekeepers. The Galaxy dress, modelled by celebrities such as Rachel Weisz and Cameron Diaz, was celebrated on the pages of Vogue, before being ripped off by the high street. Now we are introduced to the Zara dress through social media. \u201cIt shows more than anything the power of Instagram,\u201d says Church Gibson. \u201cThere is this alternative system of fashion media, that is not dependent on looking at magazines.\u201d Of course, fast fashion tends to have a human cost: low wages and poor conditions for the workers who produce it. Zara\u2019s owner, Inditex, does not publish the names of the factories it uses, so it is hard to find out what life is like for the people who make the dress. When asked for this article how the dress is made, Zara did not wish to comment. Inditex\u2019s 2018 annual report states that they \u201cfirmly believe that our model only works if it is sustainable ... [we] have placed the workers in our supply chain at the centre of systems of control in order to foster initiatives that promote social progress.\u201d A dress can mean many things to many people. This is a story of how we went mad for a cheap frock during a summer of great political uncertainty, how we started hugging strangers on the street while Britain baked and it began to feel as if the country was tipping headlong over a precipice. \u201cWe are in very dark times at the moment,\u201d says Melody. \u201cWe have a prime minister we didn\u2019t vote for, the prospect of a no-deal Brexit in October, Trump in America. There\u2019s a lot of awful stuff in the world at the moment and not a lot of joy. I think people do latch on to the thing that brings them joy. The dress did that. It\u2019s fun, accessible. It\u2019s got us talking to each other, strangers coming up to people on the street. It\u2019s allowed people to connect with each other.\u201d Melody pauses: \u201cMaybe that\u2019s a bit profound for a piece of clothing.\u201d It is a bit far-fetched, I think, until I am walking down the street on Sunday evening and see yet another woman smiling at me. Never underestimate the power of the dress.",

      "body": "<p>For a couple of years Nontando Mpofu, known to her friends as Lucy, struggled to find permanent work and often found herself reliant on the generosity of her church and food bank.</p> <p>\u201cLife was a real struggle, and it was very hard for me to juggle everything \u2013 paying the rent and looking after my daughter as a single parent,\u201d Mpofu, 40, says in the airy kitchen of her flat in Leytonstone, east London. \u201cI got into quite a bit of debt and rent arrears.\u201d</p> <p>Mpofu\u2019s life changed last November when an unlikely alliance between France\u2019s biggest bank and her social housing landlord helped get her back into permanent work with a job at Marks &amp; Spencer, and get her bank account into the black. \u201cI was just scrolling through Facebook one day, and I saw a post from someone in the community saying: \u2018If you\u2019ve been unemployed for six months \u2013 get in touch, we can help\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The message had been posted by a support officer employed by her landlord London &amp; Quadrant (L&amp;Q) , one of the UK\u2019s largest housing associations which rents out close to 100,000 homes in London and the south-east. L&amp;Q employs more than a dozen people dedicated to getting its long-term unemployed residents such as Mpofu into permanent jobs.</p> <p>The team of support workers helped Mpofu perfect her CV, coached her through mock interviews, and helped her identify jobs suitable to her skills and circumstances. The L&amp;Q team also helps unemployed residents with buying clothes to wear to interviews and paying for travel.</p> <p>Matthew Corbett, the director of the L&amp;Q foundation, said the housing association was committed to helping its tenants into work because \u201cit makes our communities happy and healthier\u201d but also because L&amp;Q is contractually obliged to by its bank, BNP Paribas.</p> <p>France\u2019s biggest bank loaned L&amp;Q \u00a3100m at a discount rate on the condition that the housing association helped at least 600 of its residents into work. BNP Paribas and L&amp;Q were unable to state how big the discount is, but Corbett said it was significant and would free up more money for the housing association to invest in its foundation.</p> <p>L&amp;Q, which was founded by a Church of England priest in 1963, smashed the target of getting 600 residents into work, and the loan will be extended for four years with L&amp;Q required to increase its job search effort by an additional 25 people each year. Accountants at PwC will audit L&amp;Q to verify that the housing association really achieved the target, which built upon its existing efforts to get residents into work.</p> <p>Social housing residents are twice as likely to be unemployed compared with the UK population on average, according to <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/files/2018-07/building-communities-that-work-july18.pdf\">research by the Institute </a><a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/files/2018-07/building-communities-that-work-july18.pdf\">for Public Policy Research (IPPR)</a>. Those who are in work are likely to be low-paid and in part-time jobs. The average weekly pay for housing association tenants is \u00a3250, compared to \u00a3232 for local authority tenants, \u00a3348 for private renters and \u00a3454 for owner-occupiers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2018/jun/27/uk-social-housing-celebrate-nhs\">UK social housing should be celebrated like the NHS | Melanie Rees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Waqar Ahmed, L&amp;Q\u2019s finance director, said: \u201cEverything that L&amp;Q does begins with social purpose, and we believe that no one should be denied the opportunity to achieve their potential because of where they live.</p> <p>\u201cBNP Paribas is exactly the sort of partner we are looking for, and we are delighted to have completed this ground-breaking deal with them. The team at BNP Paribas share our sense of social purpose, and our combined vision is going to help hundreds more people into employment every year.\u201d</p> <p>BNP Paribas said the idea to offer the discount \u201csustainability-linked\u201d loan came about after the bank\u2019s change to its corporate social responsibility policy to do more to \u201ccreate a positive impact in society\u201d.</p> <p>Simon Gates, a senior banker at BNP Paribas UK, said the deal was the first to tie the terms of a loan to efforts to reduce unemployment. \u201cIt is the result of close collaboration to conceptualise and structure what represents a landmark deal for sustainable finance in the UK: to our knowledge, this is the first ever UK housing association loan that incorporates a concrete, positive impact metric.</p> <p>\u201cL&amp;Q will be assessed on the actual impact realised in the community in terms of helping residents back to work. We think this is a watershed moment and we are honoured to support L&amp;Q as it continues its essential work of building affordable, high-quality homes.\u201d</p> <p>After the success of the deal with L&amp;Q, BNP Paribas signed a similar deal this week with Optivo, another housing association which owns 47,000 homes occupied by close to 100,000 people. Gates said the Optivo loan was \u201cabout getting people back into work, which is good for individuals, families, the economy and society\u201d.</p> <p>David Reynolds, the BNP Paribas banker who agreed the deal, said the French bank saw it as part of its \u201cresponsibility to align financing to reward worthy causes\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the top down, we are really focused on the positive impact banking can have,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to show that we support these sort of causes that are doing good for society.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reynolds said the bank was putting aside a pool of money to support other social housing projects as well as other schemes aimed at improving the environment and cutting down on waste water.</p> <p>Greg Beales, the campaigns director of the housing charity Shelter, said it was important that banks such as BNP Paribas were making it easier for housing associations to build more homes particularly at a time of severe government cuts. \u201cThis shows the private sector stepping in to provide finance when the public finances have been incredible stretched,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cHomes can help do so much more social good than just simply providing housing: they act as a platform from which people can improve their whole lives.\u201d</p> <p>The terms of the Optivo loan have not been disclosed due to commercial sensitivity, but it is understood that the target will call on the housing association to significantly build on the approximately 1,000 residents a year it currently helps into work.</p> <p>On the frontlines helping Optivo residents find work are 17 <a href=\"https://www.giveusachance.co.uk/\">Give Us a Chance</a> employment specialists including Whitney Henry.</p> <p>Henry, who got her job through the same programme, said the most important aspect of her work was to give other residents \u201cthe confidence to believe in themselves\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSome people have been out of work for a long time, and they have lost some of that confidence and belief in themselves,\u201d said Henry, who works with residents on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, one of the most deprived parts of the UK.</p> <p>Her personal target is to get 50 people a year into work. Last year she found jobs for 126, including every member of a family of four. The father secured a job as a school caretaker, the mother got part-time cleaning work in the school, the daughter took an IT course before getting a job at PC World, and her brother is studying the same course while working at Greggs.</p> <p>\u201cIt is so rewarding when they get into jobs,\u201d Henry said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the best feeling in the world that you have helped them achieve, and you feel like you have achieved with them.

      "bodyText": "For a couple of years Nontando Mpofu, known to her friends as Lucy, struggled to find permanent work and often found herself reliant on the generosity of her church and food bank. \u201cLife was a real struggle, and it was very hard for me to juggle everything \u2013 paying the rent and looking after my daughter as a single parent,\u201d Mpofu, 40, says in the airy kitchen of her flat in Leytonstone, east London. \u201cI got into quite a bit of debt and rent arrears.\u201d Mpofu\u2019s life changed last November when an unlikely alliance between France\u2019s biggest bank and her social housing landlord helped get her back into permanent work with a job at Marks &amp; Spencer, and get her bank account into the black. \u201cI was just scrolling through Facebook one day, and I saw a post from someone in the community saying: \u2018If you\u2019ve been unemployed for six months \u2013 get in touch, we can help\u2019.\u201d The message had been posted by a support officer employed by her landlord London &amp; Quadrant (L&amp;Q) , one of the UK\u2019s largest housing associations which rents out close to 100,000 homes in London and the south-east. L&amp;Q employs more than a dozen people dedicated to getting its long-term unemployed residents such as Mpofu into permanent jobs. The team of support workers helped Mpofu perfect her CV, coached her through mock interviews, and helped her identify jobs suitable to her skills and circumstances. The L&amp;Q team also helps unemployed residents with buying clothes to wear to interviews and paying for travel. Matthew Corbett, the director of the L&amp;Q foundation, said the housing association was committed to helping its tenants into work because \u201cit makes our communities happy and healthier\u201d but also because L&amp;Q is contractually obliged to by its bank, BNP Paribas. France\u2019s biggest bank loaned L&amp;Q \u00a3100m at a discount rate on the condition that the housing association helped at least 600 of its residents into work. BNP Paribas and L&amp;Q were unable to state how big the discount is, but Corbett said it was significant and would free up more money for the housing association to invest in its foundation. L&amp;Q, which was founded by a Church of England priest in 1963, smashed the target of getting 600 residents into work, and the loan will be extended for four years with L&amp;Q required to increase its job search effort by an additional 25 people each year. Accountants at PwC will audit L&amp;Q to verify that the housing association really achieved the target, which built upon its existing efforts to get residents into work. Social housing residents are twice as likely to be unemployed compared with the UK population on average, according to research by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). Those who are in work are likely to be low-paid and in part-time jobs. The average weekly pay for housing association tenants is \u00a3250, compared to \u00a3232 for local authority tenants, \u00a3348 for private renters and \u00a3454 for owner-occupiers. Waqar Ahmed, L&amp;Q\u2019s finance director, said: \u201cEverything that L&amp;Q does begins with social purpose, and we believe that no one should be denied the opportunity to achieve their potential because of where they live. \u201cBNP Paribas is exactly the sort of partner we are looking for, and we are delighted to have completed this ground-breaking deal with them. The team at BNP Paribas share our sense of social purpose, and our combined vision is going to help hundreds more people into employment every year.\u201d BNP Paribas said the idea to offer the discount \u201csustainability-linked\u201d loan came about after the bank\u2019s change to its corporate social responsibility policy to do more to \u201ccreate a positive impact in society\u201d. Simon Gates, a senior banker at BNP Paribas UK, said the deal was the first to tie the terms of a loan to efforts to reduce unemployment. \u201cIt is the result of close collaboration to conceptualise and structure what represents a landmark deal for sustainable finance in the UK: to our knowledge, this is the first ever UK housing association loan that incorporates a concrete, positive impact metric. \u201cL&amp;Q will be assessed on the actual impact realised in the community in terms of helping residents back to work. We think this is a watershed moment and we are honoured to support L&amp;Q as it continues its essential work of building affordable, high-quality homes.\u201d After the success of the deal with L&amp;Q, BNP Paribas signed a similar deal this week with Optivo, another housing association which owns 47,000 homes occupied by close to 100,000 people. Gates said the Optivo loan was \u201cabout getting people back into work, which is good for individuals, families, the economy and society\u201d. David Reynolds, the BNP Paribas banker who agreed the deal, said the French bank saw it as part of its \u201cresponsibility to align financing to reward worthy causes\u201d. \u201cFrom the top down, we are really focused on the positive impact banking can have,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to show that we support these sort of causes that are doing good for society.\u201d Reynolds said the bank was putting aside a pool of money to support other social housing projects as well as other schemes aimed at improving the environment and cutting down on waste water. Greg Beales, the campaigns director of the housing charity Shelter, said it was important that banks such as BNP Paribas were making it easier for housing associations to build more homes particularly at a time of severe government cuts. \u201cThis shows the private sector stepping in to provide finance when the public finances have been incredible stretched,\u201d he said. \u201cHomes can help do so much more social good than just simply providing housing: they act as a platform from which people can improve their whole lives.\u201d The terms of the Optivo loan have not been disclosed due to commercial sensitivity, but it is understood that the target will call on the housing association to significantly build on the approximately 1,000 residents a year it currently helps into work. On the frontlines helping Optivo residents find work are 17 Give Us a Chance employment specialists including Whitney Henry. Henry, who got her job through the same programme, said the most important aspect of her work was to give other residents \u201cthe confidence to believe in themselves\u201d. \u201cSome people have been out of work for a long time, and they have lost some of that confidence and belief in themselves,\u201d said Henry, who works with residents on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, one of the most deprived parts of the UK. Her personal target is to get 50 people a year into work. Last year she found jobs for 126, including every member of a family of four. The father secured a job as a school caretaker, the mother got part-time cleaning work in the school, the daughter took an IT course before getting a job at PC World, and her brother is studying the same course while working at Greggs. \u201cIt is so rewarding when they get into jobs,\u201d Henry said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the best feeling in the world that you have helped them achieve, and you feel like you have achieved with them. I am so proud of all them.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The police minister, Kit Malthouse, has insisted that a new wave of stop-and-search operations should not increase community tensions as the government unveiled a series of anti-crime measures. Both Boris Johnson, the prime minister, and Priti Patel, the home secretary, announced in separate comment articles in Sunday newspapers a lifting of restrictions on police carrying preventive stop-and-search operations under so-called section 60 powers \u2013 in another apparent sign of a looming general election. Johnson, writing in the Mail on Sunday, said the time had arrived to \u201ccome down hard on crime\u201d. In the Sun on Sunday, Patel said she would ensure police had \u201cthe resources and the powers they need\u201d to protect people. At the same time, a Ministry of Justice announcement of a \u00a32.5bn prison programme to create 10,000 new places, and a plan to defer the release of prisoners under licence, was briefed in advance to the Telegraph. Stop-and-search in is a controversial tactic, and its efficacy on a large scale is in doubt. A Home Office study of its increased use in London when Johnson was mayor found no evidence it had contributed to reducing crime levels. One of Theresa May\u2019s flagship policies as home secretary was to make police use stop-and-search more selectively in the light of statistics showing black people were seven times more likely to be stopped by police than white people, with only about one in 10 of those stops leading to an arrest. Labour said the announcement showed the Johnson government preferred to \u201cappear tough\u201d rather than focus on effective policies to combat crime. But speaking on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show, Malthouse said ministers were aware of the sensitivities, arguing that the rollout of body-worn cameras to police would help minimise the chances of the powers being abused. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely the case that we have to work very closely with all communities across the country to make sure that stop-and-search is done in a professional and sensitive way,\u201d he said. \u201cThings have changed. The vast majority of uniformed officers now wear a body camera, so the interaction between them and the person who is being searched can be filmed, which will lead to a professionalisation, and in fact a better reaction from the person being searched as well.\u201d The new government\u2019s robust attitude towards law and order matters, including a plan to recruit 20,000 extra police, has increased speculation there will be an election in the autumn. Patel was criticised last week for saying she wants criminals \u201cto literally feel terror\u201d. Asked about the comments, Malthouse said: \u201cWe certainly want criminals to be in fear of police detecting them and catching them and putting them inside. We know that the greatest deterrent to crime is the perception of the likelihood of getting caught. And that\u2019s, psychologically, what we need to increase.\u201d Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said: \u201cThis draconian approach shows that Boris Johnson\u2019s government has no real plans to invest in policing or a public health approach to tackling violent crime. They have opted to \u2018appear tough\u2019 instead of dealing with the root causes of crime. \u201cEvidence-based stop-and-search will always be a vital tool in preventing crime. But random stops have only poisoned police and community relations.\u201d The new prisons announcement, for England and Wales, will see a new prison built alongside HMP Full Sutton in Yorkshire, as well as refurbishment and maintenance work to create more prison places. The new 10,000 prisoner places will be on top of new prisons already announced, at Wellingborough in Northamptonshire and Glen Parva in Leicestershire, which the ministry of justice said will provide 3,360 spaces by 2023. The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, said: \u201cMore and better prison places means less re-offending and a lower burden on the taxpayer in the future. \u201cIt is vital we have a world-leading prison estate to keep criminals off our streets and turn them into law-abiding citizens when they have paid their debt to society. \u201cModern jails are best placed to achieve that and will provide us with crucial stability in our prison estate for many years to come so we can keep criminals behind bars, rehabilitate them, and better protect the public.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Until recently, one of <em>New Yorker</em> staff writer Jia Tolentino\u2019s best-kept secrets was that she spent the summer of her 16th year filming a reality show called <em>Girls v Boys: Puerto Rico</em>. A cheerleader then, she got permission from her school, which was situated in the middle of a Texan megachurch so large they called it the Repentagon, by telling them she\u2019d be \u201ca light for Jesus, but on television\u201d. An essayist who explores what it\u2019s like to live right now, no \u2013 <em>now</em>, remains, at 30, rebellious and contradictory in ticklish ways.</p> <p>For example, a person of the old world might not expect, when meeting the best young essayist in the world, to find her in denim cut-offs scrolling Instagram behind a Brooklyn caf\u00e9. They might not expect a woman who grew up an evangelical Christian to write a piece that links the weightless grace of coming up on ecstasy to that of kneeling in church, in words like \u201cepiphany\u201d and \u201cglory\u201d. They might not expect a piece about the challenging year she spent in Kyrgyzstan to be headlined: I Joined the Peace Corps to Keep From Becoming an Asshole. She treats all her subjects (recent essays include anti-abortion propaganda and the internet trend of fans begging celebrities to kill them) with equal care and precision, and such academic tenderness that the reader barely notices their mind being changed \u2013 after reading her interview with a woman who\u2019d had a late-term abortion, she received emails from pro-lifers rethinking their stance; hers are essays that talk to young women about old problems and old men about young memes. And they might not expect, in our interview of an hour-and-a-half, for \u201cthe Joan Didion of our time\u201d (<em>New York Magazine</em>) to use the word \u201clike\u201d 1,035 times.</p> <p>She has left her dog at home, which is sad. Luna is the size of eight dogs and appears often in her stories as comic relief. Usually, Tolentino works with Luna at her feet and talks to her as she picks her way through the rubble of an idea. She knows what she wants to write about when, \u201cI feel some sort of chemistry with the subject. The bar for me is when it\u2019s interesting enough that I would talk about it on my own time.\u201d One example is \u201cwomen\u2019s optimisation\u201d, the project of \u201cgetting better at being a woman\u201d which, in her new book <em>Trick Mirror </em>she investigates through chopped salad, her previous job at feminist website <a href=\"https://jezebel.com/\" title=\"\">Jezebel</a>, very expensive leggings, and Virgil\u2019s <em>Aeneid</em>.</p> <p>To read it as a person like me, brought up on girl power and the slogans of mainstream feminism, is to be stimulated and awakened to the small domestic truths of life. \u201cI like to write about modern instincts that are in some way good. And also in some way dangerous.\u201d She explores millennial issues with two hands, because, \u201cMaybe this thing\u2019s totally ridiculous, but also, secretly important. I enjoy those extremes.\u201d </p> <p><em><strong>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to</strong></em> write about things as you wish they were,\u201d wrote Zadie Smith of <em>Trick Mirror</em>. \u201cIt\u2019s much harder to think for yourself, with the minimum of self-delusion. It\u2019s even harder to achieve at a moment like this, when our thoughts are subject to unprecedented manipulation, monetisation and surveillance.\u201d One way Tolentino manages this is by offering one idea, then cracking it open to reveal a series of alternative ideas, Russian doll-like within. Her work, Smith added, \u201cfilled me with hope\u201d.</p> <p>Yep. And not just because of the kindness with which she approaches ideas, especially ideas we are used to seeing framed in black and white, but because the subjects she writes about today are the same subjects she once blogged about at Jezebel. What were once niche, women\u2019s magazine themes \u2013 pop stars, beauty products, sex and rage \u2013 are now, in the <em>New Yorker</em>, mainstream, and recognised as valid topics for study. This is not the old world any more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da7290cf0837f2313ebb7f2805290c8f1045966e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da7290cf0837f2313ebb7f2805290c8f1045966e/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jia Tolentino, smiling, in a white t-shirt, a leaf-covered garden wall behind her\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019ve had the same personality since I was three years old.

For instance, love versus the representation of it in a wedding. In the essay <em>I Thee Dread</em>, she writes that despite having been invited, with her long-term boyfriend, to 46 weddings in nine years, her apathy towards them has grown. How much harder, she asks, would it be for straight women to accept the reality of marriage if they were not first presented with the fantasy of the wedding?</p> <p>She remains fixated on the thing versus its representation, which means promoting (representing) her book (the thing) has become increasingly difficult. A hardback book feels awkward to her \u2013 she likes to describe herself as \u201cjust a blogger\u201d. She\u2019s been blogging since she was 10 (\u201cI\u2019m going insane! I literally am addicted to the web!\u201d she wrote on her Angelfire site in 1999), but the \u201cjust\u201d is sly \u2013 her education in journalism at Jezebel was invaluable: a unique chance to learn \u201chow to fuck up on the internet. We would see these great waves of disapproval and anger and morality. With an uncommon amount of freedom to negotiate it.\u201d She thrives on such tensions.</p> <p><em><strong>It wasn\u2019t just</strong></em> to keep from becoming an asshole that she joined the Peace Corps in 2010, it was to test her limits. \u201cI wanted to be in the middle of nowhere and go nuts and see what it\u2019s like.\u201d Tolentino arrived in<em><strong> </strong></em>Kyrgyzstan just as the government was overthrown. She was evacuated. She got active tuberculosis. Kyrgyzstan is a place where bride kidnapping still happens; she was sexually harassed by her host father \u2013 she was sexually harassed a lot, in part, she thinks, because with her Filipino parentage she happens to look Kyrgyz. \u201cEvery day I was seesawing between extremes of transcendent lonely happiness and crushing despair.\u201d</p> <p>Kyrgyzstan borders China, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan. \u201cAnd the feel is very strange. Like, I had no running water in my village, but they sold cookies shaped like iPhones. Nothing made sense, you know?\u201d The cookies feel like some kind of metaphor for her work, the meeting of fast and slow, a mind that has been brought up online turning its lens inward, to analyse the internet itself \u2013 she is particularly fascinating when writing about the online performance of identity, analysing the ways she has benefited from, for instance, the internet\u2019s sticky focus on opinion. But my brain moves slower and she\u2019s already run ahead. \u201cI think that\u2019s one thing that growing up in the church did to me \u2013 I love being uncomfortable. It is so... interesting.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016 she wrote an essay called <em>How Empowerment Became Something for Women to Buy</em>. \u201cI hated that word,\u201d she shudders, \u201cyet at the same time, I knew my entire career was possible because feminism was marketable now.\u201d</p> <p>How does she feel about becoming part of the feminism industry? \u201cI think about it a lot. If something is more fun to represent than to experience, then you should avoid it. It\u2019s the same way with the feminism marketplace: if something is more commodified than it is true, you should avoid it.

      "bodyText": "Until recently, one of New Yorker staff writer Jia Tolentino\u2019s best-kept secrets was that she spent the summer of her 16th year filming a reality show called Girls v Boys: Puerto Rico. A cheerleader then, she got permission from her school, which was situated in the middle of a Texan megachurch so large they called it the Repentagon, by telling them she\u2019d be \u201ca light for Jesus, but on television\u201d. An essayist who explores what it\u2019s like to live right now, no \u2013 now, remains, at 30, rebellious and contradictory in ticklish ways. For example, a person of the old world might not expect, when meeting the best young essayist in the world, to find her in denim cut-offs scrolling Instagram behind a Brooklyn caf\u00e9. They might not expect a woman who grew up an evangelical Christian to write a piece that links the weightless grace of coming up on ecstasy to that of kneeling in church, in words like \u201cepiphany\u201d and \u201cglory\u201d. They might not expect a piece about the challenging year she spent in Kyrgyzstan to be headlined: I Joined the Peace Corps to Keep From Becoming an Asshole. She treats all her subjects (recent essays include anti-abortion propaganda and the internet trend of fans begging celebrities to kill them) with equal care and precision, and such academic tenderness that the reader barely notices their mind being changed \u2013 after reading her interview with a woman who\u2019d had a late-term abortion, she received emails from pro-lifers rethinking their stance; hers are essays that talk to young women about old problems and old men about young memes. And they might not expect, in our interview of an hour-and-a-half, for \u201cthe Joan Didion of our time\u201d (New York Magazine) to use the word \u201clike\u201d 1,035 times. She has left her dog at home, which is sad. Luna is the size of eight dogs and appears often in her stories as comic relief. Usually, Tolentino works with Luna at her feet and talks to her as she picks her way through the rubble of an idea. She knows what she wants to write about when, \u201cI feel some sort of chemistry with the subject. The bar for me is when it\u2019s interesting enough that I would talk about it on my own time.\u201d One example is \u201cwomen\u2019s optimisation\u201d, the project of \u201cgetting better at being a woman\u201d which, in her new book Trick Mirror she investigates through chopped salad, her previous job at feminist website Jezebel, very expensive leggings, and Virgil\u2019s Aeneid. To read it as a person like me, brought up on girl power and the slogans of mainstream feminism, is to be stimulated and awakened to the small domestic truths of life. \u201cI like to write about modern instincts that are in some way good. And also in some way dangerous.\u201d She explores millennial issues with two hands, because, \u201cMaybe this thing\u2019s totally ridiculous, but also, secretly important.

In the years immediately after Gordon Brown granted it operational independence in 1997, the Bank operated largely as a monetary policy institute and concentrated on hitting the government\u2019s 2% inflation target. Mervyn King was the obvious choice to step up from deputy governor to succeed Eddie George in 2003.</p> <p>That was before the banking crisis of 2007-08, which resulted in the Bank being given responsibility for financial as well as monetary stability. It was before a decade of squeezed living standards and austerity, and it was before the UK voted to leave the EU. Bank of England governors are unable to avoid being dragged into political controversy whether they like it or not.

      "bodyText": "The moment is fast arriving when Sajid Javid will choose Mark Carney\u2019s replacement as the governor of the Bank of England, and Westminster is alive with speculation. One of Javid\u2019s first requests on being made chancellor was to be brought up to speed on the runners and riders for the Threadneedle Street race, although the official Treasury line is that an announcement will be made in the autumn. Javid\u2019s interest underlines the importance given to getting the right man or woman for the job. He has to decide whether to appoint one of the candidates on a shortlist, drawn up for him by a panel headed by the Treasury\u2019s permanent secretary, Sir Tom Scholar, or choose someone else entirely. There was a time when picking a governor was an uncontentious affair. In the years immediately after Gordon Brown granted it operational independence in 1997, the Bank operated largely as a monetary policy institute and concentrated on hitting the government\u2019s 2% inflation target. Mervyn King was the obvious choice to step up from deputy governor to succeed Eddie George in 2003. That was before the banking crisis of 2007-08, which resulted in the Bank being given responsibility for financial as well as monetary stability. It was before a decade of squeezed living standards and austerity, and it was before the UK voted to leave the EU. Bank of England governors are unable to avoid being dragged into political controversy whether they like it or not. Carney, a street fighter by nature, has rubbed plenty of Tory MPs up the wrong way with his downbeat Brexit forecasts. One school of thought is that Javid will play it straight, choosing someone who knows their way around the financial markets, has a network of international contacts and can be trusted to steer the economy through what might be a tricky period. With the pound under downward pressure in the currency markets, there is a case for this sort of appointment, and the chancellor has someone who fits the job spec in the form of Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority. A variation on this theme would be for the Treasury to appoint one of its own to run the Bank, either Sir John Cunliffe, who worked at the Treasury and 10 Downing Street before becoming one of the Bank\u2019s governors or Sir John Kingman, the chairman of Legal and General but once a senior mandarin at Whitehall\u2019s most powerful departments. Johnson has appointed the most ethnically diverse cabinet in Britain\u2019s history, which has seen bets placed on Minouche Shafik and Shriti Vadera. Of the two, Shafik, the director of the London School of Economics, looks to have the better chance. Born in Egypt, she worked at the World Bank, Whitehall\u2019s international development department and the International Monetary Fund before joining the Bank in 2014. The fact that she left after two and a half years after reportedly falling out with Carney is probably a plus point as far as the current government is concerned. Vadera was born in Uganda and arrived in the UK as a child after her family was expelled by Idi Amin. The difficulty for the chairwoman of Santander\u2019s UK arm is that she was once a special adviser to Gordon Brown. Given that Johnson sacked two Brexiter ministers, Liam Fox and Penny Mordaunt, because they had backed Jeremy Hunt in the leadership race would appear to make a Vadera appointment extremely unlikely. There is, though, another option. It involves Javid ignoring the names on the shortlist and plumping for Gerard Lyons, the former chief economist at Standard Chartered. Lyons would certainly be a controversial pick. Questions would be asked about whether he has the management skills to run an institution as big and complex as the Bank.

Fourthly, Lyons is an expert in China and other emerging markets, and that will be helpful to the government as it tries to deliver on its promise of a global Britain.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a question I always dread: what\u2019s your favourite plant? With an estimated 400,000 species to pick from, talk about a tough choice. But if I absolutely had to grow just one group of garden plants, it would be the hardy banana.</p> <p>Despite finding their centre of diversity in the lowland tropics of south-east Asia, there are several banana species from the northerly (and especially high-altitude) edges of their range that experience significant levels of frost, and a climate on a par with that of many areas of Britain. The classic example of this is the Japanese hardy banana, <em>Musa basjoo</em>, which actually hails from Sichuan in China and has been recorded as being \u201croot hardy\u201d to as low as -20C if kept dry. So even when the above-ground section of the plant is turned to mush by freezing temperatures below -5C, it is capable of regenerating from energy stores in underground corms the following spring.</p> <p>Planting young plants on a 20cm-thick layer of gravel or pebbles will help ensure the corms they later develop do not sit in sogginess when dormant over winter, as the bacterial and fungal infections this can trigger can be more damaging than the cold. A 10-15cm layer of mulch, such as chipped bark, will provide an insulating blanket to keep out the worst of the frost.</p> <p>One important consideration is rarely mentioned: wind. Growing up to 5m tall with leaves 2m long, the beautiful silhouette of this plant is ruined by winds that tear the leaves to ribbons. Bananas work best in urban courtyards, woodland planting schemes and walled gardens \u2013 anywhere protected from strong gusts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9fa4059fb56ca31f2f03e6c1d6379a75a7bdd6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9fa4059fb56ca31f2f03e6c1d6379a75a7bdd6c/33_1099_3366_4207/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lovely bunch: Musa basjoo dwarf bananas.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lovely bunch: Musa basjoo dwarf bananas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>M</em><em> sikkimensis</em> is from the chilly highlands of north-east India, has an allegedly similar level of hardiness to <em>M basjoo</em> (although in my experience it is a touch more tender), and looks even more exotic, with bright burgundy splodges across its glossy olive leaves. As they are grown from seeds, not cloned like <em>M</em><em> basjoo</em>, there is a great deal more genetic variation in this species, with some having far more colourful leaves, for example. This may also explain why hardiness reports vary, so it is worth testing out seed from a range of suppliers to see what you get.</p> <p>If you are after something smaller, try the closely related Golden Lotus banana, <em>M</em><em> lasiocarpa</em>. Like other hardy bananas, it hails from high-altitude locations in China, making it as a good third place in terms of hardiness (roots will probably handle lows of -10C for short periods if well mulched). What it lacks in terms of extreme cold tolerance it makes up for in spectacular, canary-yellow flowers in the shape of lotus buds. Growing a maximum of 2m high, with silvery, glaucous leaves, this means in really cold areas they could be lifted and treated as beautiful conservatory specimens in the chilliest parts of the country.</p> <p>Aside from that, all you really need to do to ensure the best summer display possible is to know that it is essentially impossible to over-water (or over-fertilise) an outdoor banana in full growth. So if you are generous with the watering can, these botanical beauties will return the favour tenfold with some of the most dramatic leaves possible on our chilly island chain.</p> <p><em>Email James at <a href=\"mailto:james.wong@observer.co.uk\">james.wong@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Botanygeek?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@Botanygeek</a></em></p> <p><br></p>",

Planting young plants on a 20cm-thick layer of gravel or pebbles will help ensure the corms they later develop do not sit in sogginess when dormant over winter, as the bacterial and fungal infections this can trigger can be more damaging than the cold. A 10-15cm layer of mulch, such as chipped bark, will provide an insulating blanket to keep out the worst of the frost. One important consideration is rarely mentioned: wind. Growing up to 5m tall with leaves 2m long, the beautiful silhouette of this plant is ruined by winds that tear the leaves to ribbons. Bananas work best in urban courtyards, woodland planting schemes and walled gardens \u2013 anywhere protected from strong gusts. M sikkimensis is from the chilly highlands of north-east India, has an allegedly similar level of hardiness to M basjoo (although in my experience it is a touch more tender), and looks even more exotic, with bright burgundy splodges across its glossy olive leaves. As they are grown from seeds, not cloned like M basjoo, there is a great deal more genetic variation in this species, with some having far more colourful leaves, for example. This may also explain why hardiness reports vary, so it is worth testing out seed from a range of suppliers to see what you get. If you are after something smaller, try the closely related Golden Lotus banana, M lasiocarpa. Like other hardy bananas, it hails from high-altitude locations in China, making it as a good third place in terms of hardiness (roots will probably handle lows of -10C for short periods if well mulched). What it lacks in terms of extreme cold tolerance it makes up for in spectacular, canary-yellow flowers in the shape of lotus buds. Growing a maximum of 2m high, with silvery, glaucous leaves, this means in really cold areas they could be lifted and treated as beautiful conservatory specimens in the chilliest parts of the country. Aside from that, all you really need to do to ensure the best summer display possible is to know that it is essentially impossible to over-water (or over-fertilise) an outdoor banana in full growth. So if you are generous with the watering can, these botanical beauties will return the favour tenfold with some of the most dramatic leaves possible on our chilly island chain.

      "body": "<p>On paper, it\u2019s a great time to be on a dating app. In the seven years since <a href=\"https://tinder.com/\" title=\"\">Tinder</a>\u2019s entrance on to the dating scene in 2012, it has gone from fringe novelty to romantic ubiquity; within two years of launching, it was seeing 1bn swipes a day. Other apps have similarly impressive stats: in 2018, Bumble\u2019s global brand director revealed it had more than 26 million users and a confirmed 20,000 marriages.</p> <p>It\u2019s a far cry from the considerably less optimistic response Tinder received when it launched. Many hailed it as the end of romance itself. In a now infamous <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/08/tinder-hook-up-culture-end-of-dating\" title=\"\"><em>Vanity Fair</em> article</a>, Nancy Jo Sales even went so far as to suggest it would usher in the \u201cdating apocalypse\u201d.</p> <p>This scepticism, clearly, did not have much of an impact. Bumble\u2019s marriages don\u2019t seem to be a fluke; though figures vary, a <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~mrosenfe/Rosenfeld_et_al_Disintermediating_Friends.pdf\" title=\"\">recent study</a> from the University of New Mexico found meeting online had finally overtaken meeting through friends, with 39% of American couples first connecting through an app.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Crucially, matchmakers only put you with others who are seriously looking for a relationship</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, a new study, <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407519861153?journalCode=spra\" title=\"\">published last month</a> in the <em>Journal of Social and Personal Relationships</em>, was less positive, finding compulsive use made swipers feel lonelier than they did in the first place. This was particularly bad for those with low self-esteem: the less confident someone was, the more compulsive their use \u2013 and the worse they felt at the end of it.</p> <p>This echoes what is felt by many users. While the web-based dating sites such as Match.com, which apps have largely superceded, aren\u2019t without issues, swipe-based apps have brought with them a new layer of anxiety, prompting an increasing number of users to report malaise.</p> <p>In fact swipe fatigue has prompted some daters to try an analogue approach. A few years ago, when Tindermania was in full swing, visiting a matchmaker would have seemed outdated at best, tragic at worst. In 2019, the industry has not only prevailed but thrived: gone is matchmaking\u2019s fusty image, replaced with Instagram-worthy, blush-pink branding and a far more inclusive ethos.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7adb20cf608d2ccd108c15f819837309f976426e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7adb20cf608d2ccd108c15f819837309f976426e/0_201_4588_2752/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tinder\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It can feel quite addictive\u2019: Tinder\u2019s swipey interface.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Caroline Brealey founded <a href=\"https://www.mutualattraction.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Mutual Attraction</a>, a London-based matchmaking service, eight years ago; since then, she says, the company has seen a dramatic increase in younger clients. People are fed up with the online experience, she believes, left jaded by what they see as its transactional nature. \u201cOne of the key differences with matchmaking is you\u2019re working one on one,\u201d she says. Unlike online dating, which can see you ghosted even after meeting, matchmakers give you feedback. Crucially, they only match you with others who are seriously looking for a relationship.</p> <p>An even younger demographic \u2013 undergraduate students \u2013 also seems to be worrying about its odds of finding love online. The Marriage Pact project, initially created at Stanford and being rolled out to other universities <a href=\"https://www.oxfordstudent.com/2019/02/13/what-is-the-oxford-marriage-pact/\" title=\"\">including Oxford</a>, seeks to provide a \u201cmarital backup plan\u201d for students, with couples paired off via a questionnaire and algorithm. With one participant gloomily noting on Facebook that her Marriage Pact partner hadn\u2019t even responded to a friend request, the service may not provide a smooth path to everlasting love, either. But with nearly 5,000 students signing up in Stanford alone, it does indicate that even carefree, digital-first young people are concerned about their online prospects and want an app-free alternative.</p> <p>So in the face of all this gloom, what exactly is it that makes Tinder, Bumble and the rest so perpetually compelling? \u201cTinder doesn\u2019t actually present anything radically new,\u201d explains Michael Gratzke, chair of the <a href=\"http://lovenetwork.hull.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Love Research Network</a>, based at the University of Hull. Dating apps, Gratzke says, closely mimic the way we make snap decisions about people in real life: \u201cWhen we enter a room, it takes seconds to sort who we see.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/may/10/i-swiped-left-on-tinder-so-he-found-me-on-linkedin-why-cant-some-men-take-no-for-an-answer\">I swiped left on Tinder so he found me on LinkedIn. Why can't some men take no for an answer? | Katie Cunningham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gratzke may be right about this \u2013 after all, the discourse around Tinder\u2019s ability to destroy the concept of love tends to be overblown. But there is one thing about it that differs from traditional love: that dangerous, delicious swipe.</p> <p>There\u2019s been a lot of talk recently about the addictive nature of social media. Tech companies have built in features to help us manage our use of their products; <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/30/lawmaker-wants-end-social-media-addiction-by-killing-features-that-enable-mindless-scrolling/\" title=\"\">Republican senator Josh Hawley has proposed a bill to limit how long users can spend online</a>; and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/05/tech-addiction-former-facebook-google-employees-campaign\" title=\"\">well publicised campaign against the addictive nature of smartphones</a> has been launched by ex-Google product designer Tristan Harris, who has first-hand experience of how technology seeks to monopolise our lives and attention spans.</p> <p>Tinder, Bumble and other apps with a swiping mechanism could easily fall under this purview \u2013 one of their most common critiques is that they \u201cgamify\u201d dating. Anecdotally, this tends to be the primary reason my friends complain about apps: the endless presentation of profiles to be judged and sorted into \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d piles does, after a while, have the uncanny feel of a game, not a search for love.</p> <p>Research also bears this out, with <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407519861153?journalCode=spra\" title=\"\">Katy Coduto, lead author of the <em>Journal of Social and Personal Relationships</em> study</a>, suggesting that limiting swipes could be one way of making the experience less addictive. In theory, Tinder already does this, giving you 100 likes per day. But you can easily get round this \u2013 Tinder Gold subscribers, who pay for extra features, get unlimited right swipes.</p> <p>It\u2019s no surprise Tinder can feel addictive \u2013 the same mechanism is used in gambling, lotteries and video games. In a 2018 documentary, Tinder cofounder Jonathan Badeen admitted its algorithm had been inspired by the behavioural reinforcement psychology he\u2019d learned about as an undergraduate. Referred to as a variable ratio reward schedule, in it participants are given a number of unpredictable responses before the one they want, in this case a match. The unexpected hit of the win reinforces the searching behaviour, which is why you keep on swiping.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s no surprise Tinder feels\u00a0quite addictive: the same\u00a0mechanism is\u00a0used in gambling, lotteries and video\u00a0games</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But none of this is to say user experience design is the only reason people aren\u2019t finding what they\u2019re looking for. Helen Fisher, a biological anthropologist, has been Match.com\u2019s chief scientific adviser since 2005. The real problem, she argues, is that we simply don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. \u201cThis is new technology and nobody has ever told us how to use it.\u201d We shouldn\u2019t even be thinking of these tools as \u201cdating apps\u201d, says Fisher. \u201cThey\u2019re not dating sites, they\u2019re introducing sites. The only thing they can do is if you require a certain type of person, they give you that person.

      "bodyText": "On paper, it\u2019s a great time to be on a dating app. In the seven years since Tinder\u2019s entrance on to the dating scene in 2012, it has gone from fringe novelty to romantic ubiquity; within two years of launching, it was seeing 1bn swipes a day. Other apps have similarly impressive stats: in 2018, Bumble\u2019s global brand director revealed it had more than 26 million users and a confirmed 20,000 marriages. It\u2019s a far cry from the considerably less optimistic response Tinder received when it launched. Many hailed it as the end of romance itself. In a now infamous Vanity Fair article, Nancy Jo Sales even went so far as to suggest it would usher in the \u201cdating apocalypse\u201d. This scepticism, clearly, did not have much of an impact. Bumble\u2019s marriages don\u2019t seem to be a fluke; though figures vary, a recent study from the University of New Mexico found meeting online had finally overtaken meeting through friends, with 39% of American couples first connecting through an app. However, a new study, published last month in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, was less positive, finding compulsive use made swipers feel lonelier than they did in the first place. This was particularly bad for those with low self-esteem: the less confident someone was, the more compulsive their use \u2013 and the worse they felt at the end of it. This echoes what is felt by many users. While the web-based dating sites such as Match.com, which apps have largely superceded, aren\u2019t without issues, swipe-based apps have brought with them a new layer of anxiety, prompting an increasing number of users to report malaise. In fact swipe fatigue has prompted some daters to try an analogue approach. A few years ago, when Tindermania was in full swing, visiting a matchmaker would have seemed outdated at best, tragic at worst. In 2019, the industry has not only prevailed but thrived: gone is matchmaking\u2019s fusty image, replaced with Instagram-worthy, blush-pink branding and a far more inclusive ethos. Caroline Brealey founded Mutual Attraction, a London-based matchmaking service, eight years ago; since then, she says, the company has seen a dramatic increase in younger clients. People are fed up with the online experience, she believes, left jaded by what they see as its transactional nature. \u201cOne of the key differences with matchmaking is you\u2019re working one on one,\u201d she says. Unlike online dating, which can see you ghosted even after meeting, matchmakers give you feedback. Crucially, they only match you with others who are seriously looking for a relationship. An even younger demographic \u2013 undergraduate students \u2013 also seems to be worrying about its odds of finding love online. The Marriage Pact project, initially created at Stanford and being rolled out to other universities including Oxford, seeks to provide a \u201cmarital backup plan\u201d for students, with couples paired off via a questionnaire and algorithm. With one participant gloomily noting on Facebook that her Marriage Pact partner hadn\u2019t even responded to a friend request, the service may not provide a smooth path to everlasting love, either. But with nearly 5,000 students signing up in Stanford alone, it does indicate that even carefree, digital-first young people are concerned about their online prospects and want an app-free alternative. So in the face of all this gloom, what exactly is it that makes Tinder, Bumble and the rest so perpetually compelling? \u201cTinder doesn\u2019t actually present anything radically new,\u201d explains Michael Gratzke, chair of the Love Research Network, based at the University of Hull. Dating apps, Gratzke says, closely mimic the way we make snap decisions about people in real life: \u201cWhen we enter a room, it takes seconds to sort who we see.\u201d Gratzke may be right about this \u2013 after all, the discourse around Tinder\u2019s ability to destroy the concept of love tends to be overblown. But there is one thing about it that differs from traditional love: that dangerous, delicious swipe. There\u2019s been a lot of talk recently about the addictive nature of social media. Tech companies have built in features to help us manage our use of their products; Republican senator Josh Hawley has proposed a bill to limit how long users can spend online; and a well publicised campaign against the addictive nature of smartphones has been launched by ex-Google product designer Tristan Harris, who has first-hand experience of how technology seeks to monopolise our lives and attention spans. Tinder, Bumble and other apps with a swiping mechanism could easily fall under this purview \u2013 one of their most common critiques is that they \u201cgamify\u201d dating. Anecdotally, this tends to be the primary reason my friends complain about apps: the endless presentation of profiles to be judged and sorted into \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d piles does, after a while, have the uncanny feel of a game, not a search for love. Research also bears this out, with Katy Coduto, lead author of the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships study, suggesting that limiting swipes could be one way of making the experience less addictive. In theory, Tinder already does this, giving you 100 likes per day. But you can easily get round this \u2013 Tinder Gold subscribers, who pay for extra features, get unlimited right swipes. It\u2019s no surprise Tinder can feel addictive \u2013 the same mechanism is used in gambling, lotteries and video games. In a 2018 documentary, Tinder cofounder Jonathan Badeen admitted its algorithm had been inspired by the behavioural reinforcement psychology he\u2019d learned about as an undergraduate. Referred to as a variable ratio reward schedule, in it participants are given a number of unpredictable responses before the one they want, in this case a match. The unexpected hit of the win reinforces the searching behaviour, which is why you keep on swiping. But none of this is to say user experience design is the only reason people aren\u2019t finding what they\u2019re looking for. Helen Fisher, a biological anthropologist, has been Match.com\u2019s chief scientific adviser since 2005. The real problem, she argues, is that we simply don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. \u201cThis is new technology and nobody has ever told us how to use it.\u201d We shouldn\u2019t even be thinking of these tools as \u201cdating apps\u201d, says Fisher. \u201cThey\u2019re not dating sites, they\u2019re introducing sites. The only thing they can do is if you require a certain type of person, they give you that person. That\u2019s all any app can ever do.\u201d If someone ghosts you, lies to you or there\u2019s simply no spark? That\u2019s not a tech problem \u2013 it\u2019s a human problem. Whether we\u2019re searching for love online or off, we\u2019re likely to stay bound by the inexplicable foibles of the human psyche. That\u2019s not to say apps themselves have nothing to do with our dating woes \u2013 as Coduto says, something about that slot-machine satisfaction when we get a match isn\u2019t quite as fulfilling as we\u2019d like and the endless choice of partners soon seems less than liberating. Fisher\u2019s solution? Log off when you\u2019ve spoken to nine people. More than this and we\u2019re cognitively overloaded, she argues, leading to romantic fatigue. If they don\u2019t work out? Get offline completely, she says. Meet someone in a park or a bar, ask friends for an introduction or approach someone on the street. And if that fails, too?

      "body": "<p>Some political books capture the zeitgeist with such precision that they seem to blur the lines between the page and the real world and become part of the urgent, rapidly unfolding changes they are describing. On 30 November 1999, mere days before the publication of Naomi Klein\u2019s debut, <em>No Logo</em>, the epochal \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/dec/05/wto.globalisation\" title=\"\">Battle of Seattle</a>\u201d began. Tens of thousands turned out to protest against the World Trade Organisation, and the global corporate interests it represented, and were met with tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets and stun grenades. Seattle\u2019s mayor declared a state of emergency, and a massive \u201cno protest zone\u201d, as the violence continued, while the chief of police resigned.</p> <p>Reading <em>No Logo</em> back then in my first year at university was hugely formative; the book, mixing eye-opening reportage with sharp-tongued analysis of consumer capitalism, was a bible for understanding the world my generation was growing up in and the motor behind a new kind of grassroots politics. The battle lines were clear, as ordinary citizens around the world stood in opposition to corporate greed, sweatshops, union-busting, \u201cMcJobs\u201d, privatisation and environmental destruction: and the avatar for them all, the increasingly unavoidable logos of western \u201csuperbrands\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>While our minds were elsewhere, the superbrands ramped up their cannibalisation of every aspect of our cultural lives</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>No Logo </em>was published on the cusp not just of a new millennium, but a new phase of globalisation, in which household names such as McDonald\u2019s, Nike, Shell, Starbucks, Disney, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Microsoft could trample over workers\u2019 rights, local laws and civic opposition in pursuit of ever bigger profits, as western outsourcing crashed against the shores of the developing world, leaving behind human misery and environmental ruin as the tide rolled out.</p> <p>The book charted the dramatic rise in the west of youth-oriented, cool-hungry consumer capitalism, in which companies sold an idealised lifestyle, not the physical product on the shelf. With the factories and production lines moved out of sight, and out of mind, the superbrands could focus their North American and European operations on ever more elaborate and intrusive marketing schemes and protecting their brand through censorship and legal action. In one infamous case, Disney sued a small-town creche for painting an unauthorised mural of their characters. Privatisation, Naomi Klein observed in <em>No Logo</em>, \u201cslithers into every crevice of public life\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a50d2f7957e99b6d221afaf928dd706c75d16c88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a50d2f7957e99b6d221afaf928dd706c75d16c88/0_19_1728_1092/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters against the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in Seattle, 1999\" width=\"1000\" height=\"632\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters against the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in Seattle, 1999: \u2018It felt like a dam breaking \u2013 every month there was another massive demonstration.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: H\u00e9ctor Mata/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Caustically funny and polemical in places, Klein\u2019s book won plaudits for her dogged research and reportage, from the candid and stomach-turning declarations of the brand gurus and snake-oil sellers to first-hand reporting from the sweatshops in the developing world\u2019s semi-lawless \u201cexport processing zones\u201d.</p> <p>It became a new truism, for those of us schooled in <em>No Logo</em>\u2019s worldview, that corporations were becoming more powerful than governments. Where previous generations had focused on the oppressive strictures of militarism, racism, nuclear power or patriarchy, the superbrands now became synonymous with all that was wrong with the world. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, they roamed across the globe unhindered and their marketing-first mentality took over party politics too: New Labour, reflected a piece in ad-land bible <em><a href=\"https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/new-labour-brand-10-years/653501\" title=\"\">Campaign</a></em> marking the tenth anniversary of the 1997 general election, was \u201cperhaps the most brand-savvy political project in British history\u201d.</p> <p><em>No Logo </em>had a global impact far beyond anything Naomi Klein \u2013 only 29 at the time and unknown outside her native Canada \u2013 had expected. It became a bestseller in the UK (among numerous other countries) and was translated into more than 30 languages, with more than a million copies in print worldwide. The instant success propelled her to fame and Klein\u2019s subsequent books <em>The Shock Doctrine</em>, <em>No Is Not Enough</em> and <em>This Changes Everything</em> were all bestsellers (her newest, <em>On Fire</em>, making the case for a green New Deal, arrives in September). <em>No</em> <em>Logo</em> inspired numerous musicians and artists: Radiohead were so swayed by the book that they toured Europe in a tent to avoid corporate-sponsored venues and considered naming their 2000 album <em>No Logo</em>, before finally alighting on <em>Kid A</em>. The book did so well, in fact, that Klein\u2019s publisher tried to persuade her that they should copyright the title and logo; others, seemingly oblivious to the irony, even proposed a No Logo clothing line. Incredulous, Klein declined.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b73cc57cb1d46ae742efd06b6c58805e8600d482\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b73cc57cb1d46ae742efd06b6c58805e8600d482/16_0_2443_1466/1000.jpg\" alt=\"No Logo Naomi Klein Fourth Estate books\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A backlash from the corporate world inevitably followed: most famously, the <em>Economist</em> published a <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=teh+economist+pro+logo+cover&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images&amp;iai=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tacticalmediafiles.net%2Fmmbase%2Fimages%2F1778%2FBUS_15_ProLogoCover.jpg\" title=\"\">cover feature riffing on Klein\u2019s book jacket design</a>, with the splash \u201cPro Logo: Why brands are good for you\u201d. But the protests continued, as in Seattle usually organised around gatherings of the WTO, the World Bank, the IMF or the G8. In the press, these were often described as \u201canti-globalisation\u201d, though the activists preferred \u201cthe global justice movement\u201d \u2013 they weren\u2019t against internationalism, they argued, they just wanted it done very differently.</p> <p>\u201c<em>No Logo</em> hit at this moment when a global movement was exploding and taking mainstream commentators entirely by surprise,\u201d says Klein on the phone from the west coast of Canada. \u201cIt felt a bit like a dam breaking \u2013 every month, there was another massive demonstration, across the world, not just in the global north.\u201d She had real trouble finding a US publisher for the book, she recalls. They would tell her how much they loved the manuscript, but that there would be no interest in it: \u201cThe perception among media and cultural gatekeepers in the late 90s was that young people were completely apolitical.\u201d</p> <p>What strikes me, rereading the book now, is not that Klein was wrong in her diagnosis, but that the changes she was documenting are so much worse than we could have ever predicted \u2013 from PepsiCo exploring the idea of broadcasting its logos into space to KFC buying festival DJ slots for Colonel Sanders. We have reached an audio-visual climax of total brand dominance, as if Piccadilly Circus or Times Square were simply laboratories for how our world would look in the 21st century.</p> <p>So what happened to the focused anti-corporate anger Klein describes in the book? In an age of synergistic \u201cbrand personalities\u201d with \u201cstrong voices\u201d, integrated social media strategies, trend forecasters and micro-influencers, have we given in to the total branding of every aspect of our lives and culture?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Whether it\u2019s Dove against body fascism or Gillette tackling toxic masculinity, our woke pounds are there for the taking</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The critical moment for the global justice movement, when it was perhaps still to reach its full potential, arrived with the 9/11 attacks in the US less than two years later and the wholesale change in the political conversation that quickly ensued. The west was swept up by George W Bush\u2019s \u201cyou\u2019re with us or against us\u201d rhetoric, the \u201cwar on terror\u201d, the rise of surveillance and the neoconservative adventures in Afghanistan and Iraq. The urgency of the anti-war movement absorbed western energies.</p> <p>As well as shifting activists\u2019 focus away from the sportswear and fast food brands, the Bush-era crackdown drove a wedge between the more radical anti-capitalist activists on the one hand and the bigger NGOs and trade unions. \u201cWhen governments started equating the global justice movement with terrorists, a lot of them got spooked,\u201d Klein says. \u201cWhat had been so exciting about these coalitions was they were so diverse: you had scruffy anarchists, big shiny mainstream NGOs and auto workers\u2019 unions all alongside one another, doing really hard and sometimes fractious work to find common ground, but they did it. In South America, India and elsewhere, these movements continued, but the north left them behind.\u201d</p> <p>While our minds were elsewhere, the superbrands ramped up their cannibalisation of every aspect of our cultural lives. Earlier this year, KFC bought a five-minute <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=colonel+sanders+Ultra+KFC&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images&amp;iai=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FvuSgz0HOgK8%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg\" title=\"\">DJ slot for Colonel Sanders</a> \u2013 or a man in a cartoonish Colonel Sanders outfit \u2013 at major American dance music festival Ultra. Logos hover everywhere we look, like spots in our peripheral vision. It is strikingly rare, in 2019, to encounter an unbranded, unsponsored cultural experience. Every festival, programme, public-awareness campaign and event has a series of \u201cpartners\u201d, a cluster of familiar icons at the bottom of the poster. Every charity is led by its marketing team. Every TV programme is \u201cbrought to you by\u2026\u201d \u2013 a name other than its production company.</p> <p>This reaches even more flagrant extremes as the companies that were initially paying for product placement in films and TV programmes become original content-creators. Where once we might have seen Jerry Seinfeld ostentatiously drinking Pepsi and wearing Nike trainers in an episode of his sitcom, we now have Pepsi Max TV and Nike TV channels on YouTube, producing their own content: not just adverts, but short documentaries, featurettes, competitions and interviews, with viewcounts often in the millions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c5220835cb7c79a9fcc7a5a4f478e205510bf17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c5220835cb7c79a9fcc7a5a4f478e205510bf17/0_0_2541_1312/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018DJ Colonel Sanders\u2019 at the Ultra music festival in Miami\" width=\"1000\" height=\"516\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018DJ Colonel Sanders\u2019 at the Ultra music festival in Miami.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Florida Fanatics/YouTube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Corporate brands swamp our digital lives, resulting in the uncanny spectacle of their social media accounts <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/300278\" title=\"\">bantering</a> with one another on Twitter, sassily posting pop culture gifs and responding to breaking news events \u201cin voice\u201d. Many of them have also developed their pre-existing corporate social responsibility programmes into a performance of \u201cwokeness\u201d, to both generate headlines and head off some of our boredom and scepticism. Whether it\u2019s Dove soap challenging body fascism in the beauty industry or Gillette attempting to tackle toxic masculinity in the name of selling razors, our woke pounds are there for the taking.</p> <p>On another level to its rivals in this regard is Nike, most recently harnessing a portentous mixture of feminist (\u201cbreaking every single glass ceiling\u201d) and self-help rhetoric via Megan Rapinoe and the US women\u2019s football team. When the company made headlines last autumn with its <a href=\"https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/colin-kaepernick-hails-crazy-dreamers-video-ad-nike/1492060\" title=\"\">Dream Crazy</a> advert that featured NFL star Colin Kaepernick, controversial for kneeling during the national anthem in protest at police racism and brutality, the reports underneath told their own story. First, the advert was widely reported as appearing in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the Just Do It campaign, a landmark purely because it was three decades since a previous ad campaign. Second, Nike CEO, Mark Parker, responded to the controversy by telling <em><a href=\"https://www.marketingweek.com/nike-proud-of-colin-kaepernick-ad-campaign/\" title=\"\">Marketing Week</a></em> he was proud of the ad: it was a success because it drove \u201crecord engagement\u201d. Not sales \u2013 <em>brand engagement</em>. \u201cWe\u2019re motivated to inspire our consumers to connect and engage,\u201d Parker continued. Not buy trainers.</p> <p>Inevitably, some were unhappy that Kaepernick allowed his bold political protest to be co-opted by Nike. For Klein, that\u2019s unfair. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously complex, but I think the athletes deserve a lot of credit for pushing back against their usual gagging,\u201d she says, comparing Kaepernick to Robbie Fowler\u2019s 1997 \u201csupport the dockers\u201d T-shirt (a gesture of solidarity with striking Liverpool dockers that earned him a fine) and Megan Rapinoe wearing a Nike football shirt with civil rights activist Audre Lorde\u2019s <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=megan+rapinoeshirt+with+audre+lorde&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images&amp;iai=http%3A%2F%2Flesbienraisonnable.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F03%2FMegan-Rapinoe.png\" title=\"\">name on the back</a>. \u201cFrom Nike\u2019s point of view, these ventures are not \u2018brave\u2019, this is what they have always done \u2013 this is literally their brand. But it\u2019s also not as simple as a corporate co-option, because in response to being told \u2018shut up and play\u2019, what these athletes have shown is that it\u2019s really powerful when they don\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cKaepernick is an incredible activist and what he\u2019s done is historic \u2013 and he\u2019s also given away a huge amount of money to grassroots groups.

Of course not.</p> <p>\u201cWhen musicians and athletes don\u2019t accept the idea that because they have corporate sponsors, they have to keep quiet, it can take us to some interesting places,\u201d Klein avers.</p> <p>There are two things driving the brands\u2019 ongoing territorial expansion. The first is that consumer capitalism is boring and so constantly requires innovative, ever more ridiculous stunts to hold our increasingly fragmented attention. That\u2019s why \u201cexperiential marketing\u201d (PR stunts, in old money) is the ad-land buzzphrase. Senior marketeer Hilary Bradley told <em><a href=\"https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/six-trends-shaping-experiential/1495683\" title=\"\">Campaign</a></em> magazine last autumn that millennials in particular needed \u201cmemorable experiences\u201d to help them \u201cemotionally connect\u201d to a product.</p> <p>The second is that consumer capitalism is insatiable \u2013 it is the same reason businesses are pushing for cities to function around the clock, to fit in more shopping and advertising time, trying to effectively \u201ccolonise the night\u201d, an idea the American art critic Jonathan Crary explored in his 2013 book <em>24/7: Late Capitalism and the Ends of Sleep</em>. In April, the news broke that PepsiCo was working with a Russian \u201cspace startup\u201d to look into projecting its logos into the night skies via a series of satellites. Like all empires, consumer capitalism always requires new territory to conquer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"89757d0638d67323ad578102ed51c660fbb432ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89757d0638d67323ad578102ed51c660fbb432ca/0_0_1500_1081/1000.jpg\" alt=\"KFC filled 350 potholes in Louisville, Ky in 2009\" width=\"1000\" height=\"721\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">KFC filled and \u2018re-freshed\u2019 350 potholes in Louisville, Kentucky.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KFC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And we are often unwilling subjects. Consumers, marketing executive David Lubars told Klein in <em>No Logo</em>, in a moment of perfect candour, \u201care like roaches \u2013 you spray them and spray them and they get immune after a while.\u201d Since 1999, the spray has become considerably more potent and it\u2019s getting everywhere. Not just trainers, razors and soft drinks, but places, spaces, charities, local councils, human beings: all of them need a brand identity, because all of them are pitching themselves in the global marketplace. As the public sphere becomes ever more emaciated by cuts, corporations step in.</p> <p>Brands are literally filling in holes in the road with their logos: in Louisville, Kentucky, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102390105&amp;t=1563985222798&amp;t=1565170905678\" title=\"\">KFC filled in a plague of potholes</a>, stamping them with a stencil that read \u201cRe-freshed by KFC\u201d. They paid what is small change in advertising terms \u2013 $3,000 \u2013 to fix 350 potholes in the city, or buy 350 adverts. \u201cCities are struggling all over America and you do what you can,\u201d Louisville\u2019s mayor, Jerry Abramson, told NPR. \u201cWe\u2019re fortunate to have such an outstanding corporate citizen in this community.\u201d</p> <p>Occupying physical space beyond a billboard has always been appealing; when Adidas signed its \u201ctier one\u201d \u00a340m London 2012 Olympic partnership deal, it cannily struck an agreement to plant inner-city sporting <a href=\"http://www.gamesmonitor.org.uk/node/1800\" title=\"\">\u201cAdiZones\u201d</a> (outdoor gyms), and thus its logos, in public spaces across the country, for up to 20 years. It was a nod to the idea of trickle-down athleticism made by the Games, leaving what are essentially semi-permanent, 3D billboards in public spaces, in return for a minuscule investment \u2013 and some <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2008/09/11/hackney_adizone_feature.shtml\" title=\"\">free publicity</a> to boot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c24d5349771351d03fd5ea1158cfec700b53635\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c24d5349771351d03fd5ea1158cfec700b53635/0_377_5126_3040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An AdiZone exercise area in Hackney, east London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"593\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An AdiZone exercise area in Hackney, east London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was just the latest iteration of a 1990s scene Klein describes in <em>No Logo </em>\u2013 Nike marketeers visiting inner-city basketball courts in mostly black neighbourhoods in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia, branding the courts with the company\u2019s logo, and giving out trainers to the most stylish alpha males, in a pre-digital version of \u201cinfluencer\u201d culture.</p> <p>One vital trend that was just emerging when <em>No Logo</em> was published and is now a near-universal experience \u2013 for those entering the job market, at least \u2013 is that of self-branding: commodifying and selling yourself, carefully \u201ccurating\u201d your \u201csocials\u201d and general online presence, in response to the frenetic demands of the gig economy (the number of self-employed young adults in the UK has almost <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44887623\" title=\"\">doubled</a> since 2001). \u201cIt was really only celebrities who could actually be their own brand, in 1999,\u201d Klein says. \u201cThe idea that a high-school student could have a \u2018personal brand\u2019 would have seemed absurd.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest change since <em>No Logo </em>came out is that neoliberalism has created so much precarity that the commodification of the self is now seen as the only route to any kind of economic security. Plus social media has given us the tools to market ourselves non-stop.\u201d This worries Klein because it hinders solidarity: \u201cBrands don\u2019t cooperate very well \u2013 they\u2019re built to be selfish and proprietary.\u201d</p> <p>In her position as the Gloria Steinem chair at Rutgers University in New Jersey, Klein has been teaching a course to undergraduates called The Corporate Self, tracing the journey from the birth of branding, and her own <em>No Logo</em>, up to Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s acclaimed book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/02/age-of-surveillance-capitalism-shoshana-zuboff-review\" title=\"\">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a></em>, published in the UK in January. Zuboff may do for big tech what Klein did for the superbrands 20 years ago. They watch and critique the Colin Kaepernick ads, Klein says, comparing them to the Michael Jordan equivalents from the 1980s and 90s.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been fun to talk to them about surveillance capitalism, because they\u2019ve grown up with it \u2013 they\u2019ve grown up in it \u2013 and to follow the emerging ways people are confronting the tech giants.\u201d She recently brought in as speakers some of the organisers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/01/google-walkout-global-protests-employees-sexual-harassment-scandals\" title=\"\">2018\u2019s Google walkout protest</a>, in which thousands of the corporation\u2019s employees walked out of work in protest at the handling of sexual harassment and gender inequality.</p> <p>It is functionally harder to live life away from 2019\u2019s insatiable tech super-corporations, and some of the superbrands Klein covered in 1999 seem almost quaint in their aspirations to be part of our lives. It is certainly much easier not to buy a fizzy drink or eat at McDonald\u2019s than it is to function day to day without helping generate profits for one or all of Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple or Microsoft. Proud of yourself for not buying books or gifts from Amazon? Fair enough, but it is also the largest cloud service provider, with a 32% market share; your favourite activist website is probably using Amazon Web Services.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re more globally connected than ever before,\u201d Klein says, \u201cand also less connected to who makes our clothes, who grows our food, and I think part of that is down to information overload. And in terms of what social media is doing to our ability to stay focused, to not see the world in terms of these matrices of our own marketability and consumability, whether it\u2019s views or likes or retweets\u2026\u201d She sighs. \u201cWell, I think this may be the death of us. It\u2019s not that people don\u2019t care, it\u2019s that they care for five seconds. That acceleration of emotion, and attention \u2013 it\u2019s a pretty big shift in 20 years.</p> <p>\u201cI think the next big battles will be over the information commons: the entire business model of these tech giants is an extractive model, based on people\u2019s unpaid labour. It\u2019s been the most incredible bait-and-switch, to simultaneously say, \u2018Don\u2019t be evil\u2019 and persuade us to live our lives in public and online and share everything.\u201d</p> <p>There is, however, one small part of our relationship with brands that the internet and social media have perhaps democratised \u2013 the ability to control the memes of production. \u201cIn <em>No Logo</em>, in the \u2018adbusting\u2019 chapter, I was writing about a few daring guys with ladders, defacing billboards,\u201d she laughs, \u201cand now you have millions of people able to do parody ads and share them with everyone, instantaneously.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXuLqVfk27g\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OXuLqVfk27g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXuLqVfk27g\">Watch a parody Nike ad here</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>While the images of black-clad protesters on the streets of Seattle in 1999 may have marked a rupture of sorts, the rapid decline of the global justice movement it heralded is not something to be entirely mourned by activists, Klein says, because another kind of progress has been made. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to lose sight of just how hegemonic neoliberalism really was, in the late 1990s. There is an ascendant democratic socialist left in the west now and it\u2019s liberalism that is in crisis.\u201d The global justice movement was, she says, a movement of \u201cnos\u201d and not a lot of \u201cyeses\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s taken a while to get the political and intellectual confidence to not only say \u2018no\u2019 to the ravages of neoliberal austerity, but to propose bold and imaginative structural transformation.</p> <p>\u201cThe real sea change between then and now is that that critique of corporate power is utterly mainstream. If you look at the US presidential candidates, not just Elizabeth Warren\u2019s or Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaigns but even some of the more mainstream candidates \u2013 everybody has to talk about breaking up big tech and standing up to the fossil fuel companies.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe it\u2019s partly that our relationships with the companies behind the logos have changed dramatically since 1999 too. Another example of a new trend recorded in <em>No Logo </em>that\u2019s become commonplace is the gig economy, or precarious work. People have no reciprocal relationship, no give and take, with their big-name corporate employers. In the Fordist era of production-line factory jobs after the war, many workers may have had miserably mundane nine-to-fives but at least those came with stability, pensions and as jobs for life. The gig economy is shattering any lingering sense of trust in or fidelity to corporations. \u201cWide-scale public rage at oligarchic power is very mainstream now,\u201d Klein says.</p> <p>And that surely can\u2019t be good for the brand.</p> <p>Perhaps it is a function of age, but recalling the world<em> No Logo</em> described when I was 18 \u2013 a world before 9/11 and the \u201cwar on terror\u201d, before the global financial crisis and before the gig economy and big tech set the terms of your employment and social life respectively \u2013 does feel like harking back to a more innocent time. It would be easy for me to get an Uber to a WeWork office, order some Deliveroo and finish this article on Google Docs, while I stream Spotify, taking a break to browse Facebook and Instagram on my Android phone, finesse my personal brand on Twitter and wonder where the <em>No Logo</em> revolution all went wrong.</p> <p>But it was never as simple as merely boycotting brands you vaguely disapproved of; the thrust of the book, and the global justice movement in general, was not about making more tasteful shopping decisions, but understanding how corporations shape our lives and culture and using that knowledge to try to, at least, stop them from running riot. The stakes are higher now than they were in the 1990s and this time, thanks to books such as <em>No Logo</em>, we can\u2019t say that we didn\u2019t know.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Some political books capture the zeitgeist with such precision that they seem to blur the lines between the page and the real world and become part of the urgent, rapidly unfolding changes they are describing. On 30 November 1999, mere days before the publication of Naomi Klein\u2019s debut, No Logo, the epochal \u201cBattle of Seattle\u201d began. Tens of thousands turned out to protest against the World Trade Organisation, and the global corporate interests it represented, and were met with tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets and stun grenades. Seattle\u2019s mayor declared a state of emergency, and a massive \u201cno protest zone\u201d, as the violence continued, while the chief of police resigned. Reading No Logo back then in my first year at university was hugely formative; the book, mixing eye-opening reportage with sharp-tongued analysis of consumer capitalism, was a bible for understanding the world my generation was growing up in and the motor behind a new kind of grassroots politics. The battle lines were clear, as ordinary citizens around the world stood in opposition to corporate greed, sweatshops, union-busting, \u201cMcJobs\u201d, privatisation and environmental destruction: and the avatar for them all, the increasingly unavoidable logos of western \u201csuperbrands\u201d. No Logo was published on the cusp not just of a new millennium, but a new phase of globalisation, in which household names such as McDonald\u2019s, Nike, Shell, Starbucks, Disney, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Microsoft could trample over workers\u2019 rights, local laws and civic opposition in pursuit of ever bigger profits, as western outsourcing crashed against the shores of the developing world, leaving behind human misery and environmental ruin as the tide rolled out. The book charted the dramatic rise in the west of youth-oriented, cool-hungry consumer capitalism, in which companies sold an idealised lifestyle, not the physical product on the shelf. With the factories and production lines moved out of sight, and out of mind, the superbrands could focus their North American and European operations on ever more elaborate and intrusive marketing schemes and protecting their brand through censorship and legal action. In one infamous case, Disney sued a small-town creche for painting an unauthorised mural of their characters. Privatisation, Naomi Klein observed in No Logo, \u201cslithers into every crevice of public life\u201d. Caustically funny and polemical in places, Klein\u2019s book won plaudits for her dogged research and reportage, from the candid and stomach-turning declarations of the brand gurus and snake-oil sellers to first-hand reporting from the sweatshops in the developing world\u2019s semi-lawless \u201cexport processing zones\u201d. It became a new truism, for those of us schooled in No Logo\u2019s worldview, that corporations were becoming more powerful than governments. Where previous generations had focused on the oppressive strictures of militarism, racism, nuclear power or patriarchy, the superbrands now became synonymous with all that was wrong with the world. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, they roamed across the globe unhindered and their marketing-first mentality took over party politics too: New Labour, reflected a piece in ad-land bible Campaign marking the tenth anniversary of the 1997 general election, was \u201cperhaps the most brand-savvy political project in British history\u201d. No Logo had a global impact far beyond anything Naomi Klein \u2013 only 29 at the time and unknown outside her native Canada \u2013 had expected. It became a bestseller in the UK (among numerous other countries) and was translated into more than 30 languages, with more than a million copies in print worldwide. The instant success propelled her to fame and Klein\u2019s subsequent books The Shock Doctrine, No Is Not Enough and This Changes Everything were all bestsellers (her newest, On Fire, making the case for a green New Deal, arrives in September). No Logo inspired numerous musicians and artists: Radiohead were so swayed by the book that they toured Europe in a tent to avoid corporate-sponsored venues and considered naming their 2000 album No Logo, before finally alighting on Kid A. The book did so well, in fact, that Klein\u2019s publisher tried to persuade her that they should copyright the title and logo; others, seemingly oblivious to the irony, even proposed a No Logo clothing line. Incredulous, Klein declined. A backlash from the corporate world inevitably followed: most famously, the Economist published a cover feature riffing on Klein\u2019s book jacket design, with the splash \u201cPro Logo: Why brands are good for you\u201d. But the protests continued, as in Seattle usually organised around gatherings of the WTO, the World Bank, the IMF or the G8. In the press, these were often described as \u201canti-globalisation\u201d, though the activists preferred \u201cthe global justice movement\u201d \u2013 they weren\u2019t against internationalism, they argued, they just wanted it done very differently. \u201cNo Logo hit at this moment when a global movement was exploding and taking mainstream commentators entirely by surprise,\u201d says Klein on the phone from the west coast of Canada. \u201cIt felt a bit like a dam breaking \u2013 every month, there was another massive demonstration, across the world, not just in the global north.\u201d She had real trouble finding a US publisher for the book, she recalls. They would tell her how much they loved the manuscript, but that there would be no interest in it: \u201cThe perception among media and cultural gatekeepers in the late 90s was that young people were completely apolitical.\u201d What strikes me, rereading the book now, is not that Klein was wrong in her diagnosis, but that the changes she was documenting are so much worse than we could have ever predicted \u2013 from PepsiCo exploring the idea of broadcasting its logos into space to KFC buying festival DJ slots for Colonel Sanders. We have reached an audio-visual climax of total brand dominance, as if Piccadilly Circus or Times Square were simply laboratories for how our world would look in the 21st century. So what happened to the focused anti-corporate anger Klein describes in the book? In an age of synergistic \u201cbrand personalities\u201d with \u201cstrong voices\u201d, integrated social media strategies, trend forecasters and micro-influencers, have we given in to the total branding of every aspect of our lives and culture? The critical moment for the global justice movement, when it was perhaps still to reach its full potential, arrived with the 9/11 attacks in the US less than two years later and the wholesale change in the political conversation that quickly ensued. The west was swept up by George W Bush\u2019s \u201cyou\u2019re with us or against us\u201d rhetoric, the \u201cwar on terror\u201d, the rise of surveillance and the neoconservative adventures in Afghanistan and Iraq. The urgency of the anti-war movement absorbed western energies. As well as shifting activists\u2019 focus away from the sportswear and fast food brands, the Bush-era crackdown drove a wedge between the more radical anti-capitalist activists on the one hand and the bigger NGOs and trade unions. \u201cWhen governments started equating the global justice movement with terrorists, a lot of them got spooked,\u201d Klein says. \u201cWhat had been so exciting about these coalitions was they were so diverse: you had scruffy anarchists, big shiny mainstream NGOs and auto workers\u2019 unions all alongside one another, doing really hard and sometimes fractious work to find common ground, but they did it. In South America, India and elsewhere, these movements continued, but the north left them behind.\u201d While our minds were elsewhere, the superbrands ramped up their cannibalisation of every aspect of our cultural lives. Earlier this year, KFC bought a five-minute DJ slot for Colonel Sanders \u2013 or a man in a cartoonish Colonel Sanders outfit \u2013 at major American dance music festival Ultra. Logos hover everywhere we look, like spots in our peripheral vision. It is strikingly rare, in 2019, to encounter an unbranded, unsponsored cultural experience. Every festival, programme, public-awareness campaign and event has a series of \u201cpartners\u201d, a cluster of familiar icons at the bottom of the poster. Every charity is led by its marketing team. Every TV programme is \u201cbrought to you by\u2026\u201d \u2013 a name other than its production company. This reaches even more flagrant extremes as the companies that were initially paying for product placement in films and TV programmes become original content-creators. Where once we might have seen Jerry Seinfeld ostentatiously drinking Pepsi and wearing Nike trainers in an episode of his sitcom, we now have Pepsi Max TV and Nike TV channels on YouTube, producing their own content: not just adverts, but short documentaries, featurettes, competitions and interviews, with viewcounts often in the millions. Corporate brands swamp our digital lives, resulting in the uncanny spectacle of their social media accounts bantering with one another on Twitter, sassily posting pop culture gifs and responding to breaking news events \u201cin voice\u201d. Many of them have also developed their pre-existing corporate social responsibility programmes into a performance of \u201cwokeness\u201d, to both generate headlines and head off some of our boredom and scepticism. Whether it\u2019s Dove soap challenging body fascism in the beauty industry or Gillette attempting to tackle toxic masculinity in the name of selling razors, our woke pounds are there for the taking. On another level to its rivals in this regard is Nike, most recently harnessing a portentous mixture of feminist (\u201cbreaking every single glass ceiling\u201d) and self-help rhetoric via Megan Rapinoe and the US women\u2019s football team. When the company made headlines last autumn with its Dream Crazy advert that featured NFL star Colin Kaepernick, controversial for kneeling during the national anthem in protest at police racism and brutality, the reports underneath told their own story. First, the advert was widely reported as appearing in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the Just Do It campaign, a landmark purely because it was three decades since a previous ad campaign. Second, Nike CEO, Mark Parker, responded to the controversy by telling Marketing Week he was proud of the ad: it was a success because it drove \u201crecord engagement\u201d. Not sales \u2013 brand engagement. \u201cWe\u2019re motivated to inspire our consumers to connect and engage,\u201d Parker continued. Not buy trainers. Inevitably, some were unhappy that Kaepernick allowed his bold political protest to be co-opted by Nike. For Klein, that\u2019s unfair. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously complex, but I think the athletes deserve a lot of credit for pushing back against their usual gagging,\u201d she says, comparing Kaepernick to Robbie Fowler\u2019s 1997 \u201csupport the dockers\u201d T-shirt (a gesture of solidarity with striking Liverpool dockers that earned him a fine) and Megan Rapinoe wearing a Nike football shirt with civil rights activist Audre Lorde\u2019s name on the back. \u201cFrom Nike\u2019s point of view, these ventures are not \u2018brave\u2019, this is what they have always done \u2013 this is literally their brand. But it\u2019s also not as simple as a corporate co-option, because in response to being told \u2018shut up and play\u2019, what these athletes have shown is that it\u2019s really powerful when they don\u2019t. \u201cKaepernick is an incredible activist and what he\u2019s done is historic \u2013 and he\u2019s also given away a huge amount of money to grassroots groups. That doesn\u2019t let Nike off the hook, but I think just condemning Kaepernick for taking their money is ridiculous.\u201d In the UK, this balancing act is reflected in Stormzy\u2019s simultaneous role as high-profile Adidas brand ambassador and outspoken critic of the Conservative government, the Daily Mail and others. Plied with free Adidas merchandise since he was an underground grime MC, cut him and you suspect he would bleed three stripes. When Paul Pogba signed for Manchester United (who also wear Adidas) in 2016 for a record \u00a3100m, the deal was announced by a special Adidas-produced video featuring the two of them, soundtracked by Stormzy, a perfect piece of four-way brand synergy. But did this affiliation stop Stormzy putting in one of the most powerful and controversial political performances in living memory at the 2018 Brit awards, calling the political establishment \u201ccriminals\u201d for their betrayal of the victims of the Grenfell fire? Of course not. \u201cWhen musicians and athletes don\u2019t accept the idea that because they have corporate sponsors, they have to keep quiet, it can take us to some interesting places,\u201d Klein avers. There are two things driving the brands\u2019 ongoing territorial expansion. The first is that consumer capitalism is boring and so constantly requires innovative, ever more ridiculous stunts to hold our increasingly fragmented attention. That\u2019s why \u201cexperiential marketing\u201d (PR stunts, in old money) is the ad-land buzzphrase. Senior marketeer Hilary Bradley told Campaign magazine last autumn that millennials in particular needed \u201cmemorable experiences\u201d to help them \u201cemotionally connect\u201d to a product. The second is that consumer capitalism is insatiable \u2013 it is the same reason businesses are pushing for cities to function around the clock, to fit in more shopping and advertising time, trying to effectively \u201ccolonise the night\u201d, an idea the American art critic Jonathan Crary explored in his 2013 book 24/7: Late Capitalism and the Ends of Sleep. In April, the news broke that PepsiCo was working with a Russian \u201cspace startup\u201d to look into projecting its logos into the night skies via a series of satellites. Like all empires, consumer capitalism always requires new territory to conquer. And we are often unwilling subjects. Consumers, marketing executive David Lubars told Klein in No Logo, in a moment of perfect candour, \u201care like roaches \u2013 you spray them and spray them and they get immune after a while.\u201d Since 1999, the spray has become considerably more potent and it\u2019s getting everywhere. Not just trainers, razors and soft drinks, but places, spaces, charities, local councils, human beings: all of them need a brand identity, because all of them are pitching themselves in the global marketplace. As the public sphere becomes ever more emaciated by cuts, corporations step in. Brands are literally filling in holes in the road with their logos: in Louisville, Kentucky, KFC filled in a plague of potholes, stamping them with a stencil that read \u201cRe-freshed by KFC\u201d. They paid what is small change in advertising terms \u2013 $3,000 \u2013 to fix 350 potholes in the city, or buy 350 adverts. \u201cCities are struggling all over America and you do what you can,\u201d Louisville\u2019s mayor, Jerry Abramson, told NPR. \u201cWe\u2019re fortunate to have such an outstanding corporate citizen in this community.\u201d Occupying physical space beyond a billboard has always been appealing; when Adidas signed its \u201ctier one\u201d \u00a340m London 2012 Olympic partnership deal, it cannily struck an agreement to plant inner-city sporting \u201cAdiZones\u201d (outdoor gyms), and thus its logos, in public spaces across the country, for up to 20 years. It was a nod to the idea of trickle-down athleticism made by the Games, leaving what are essentially semi-permanent, 3D billboards in public spaces, in return for a minuscule investment \u2013 and some free publicity to boot. This was just the latest iteration of a 1990s scene Klein describes in No Logo \u2013 Nike marketeers visiting inner-city basketball courts in mostly black neighbourhoods in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia, branding the courts with the company\u2019s logo, and giving out trainers to the most stylish alpha males, in a pre-digital version of \u201cinfluencer\u201d culture. One vital trend that was just emerging when No Logo was published and is now a near-universal experience \u2013 for those entering the job market, at least \u2013 is that of self-branding: commodifying and selling yourself, carefully \u201ccurating\u201d your \u201csocials\u201d and general online presence, in response to the frenetic demands of the gig economy (the number of self-employed young adults in the UK has almost doubled since 2001). \u201cIt was really only celebrities who could actually be their own brand, in 1999,\u201d Klein says. \u201cThe idea that a high-school student could have a \u2018personal brand\u2019 would have seemed absurd. \u201cThe biggest change since No Logo came out is that neoliberalism has created so much precarity that the commodification of the self is now seen as the only route to any kind of economic security. Plus social media has given us the tools to market ourselves non-stop.\u201d This worries Klein because it hinders solidarity: \u201cBrands don\u2019t cooperate very well \u2013 they\u2019re built to be selfish and proprietary.\u201d In her position as the Gloria Steinem chair at Rutgers University in New Jersey, Klein has been teaching a course to undergraduates called The Corporate Self, tracing the journey from the birth of branding, and her own No Logo, up to Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s acclaimed book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, published in the UK in January. Zuboff may do for big tech what Klein did for the superbrands 20 years ago. They watch and critique the Colin Kaepernick ads, Klein says, comparing them to the Michael Jordan equivalents from the 1980s and 90s. \u201cIt\u2019s been fun to talk to them about surveillance capitalism, because they\u2019ve grown up with it \u2013 they\u2019ve grown up in it \u2013 and to follow the emerging ways people are confronting the tech giants.\u201d She recently brought in as speakers some of the organisers of 2018\u2019s Google walkout protest, in which thousands of the corporation\u2019s employees walked out of work in protest at the handling of sexual harassment and gender inequality. It is functionally harder to live life away from 2019\u2019s insatiable tech super-corporations, and some of the superbrands Klein covered in 1999 seem almost quaint in their aspirations to be part of our lives. It is certainly much easier not to buy a fizzy drink or eat at McDonald\u2019s than it is to function day to day without helping generate profits for one or all of Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple or Microsoft. Proud of yourself for not buying books or gifts from Amazon? Fair enough, but it is also the largest cloud service provider, with a 32% market share; your favourite activist website is probably using Amazon Web Services. \u201cWe\u2019re more globally connected than ever before,\u201d Klein says, \u201cand also less connected to who makes our clothes, who grows our food, and I think part of that is down to information overload. And in terms of what social media is doing to our ability to stay focused, to not see the world in terms of these matrices of our own marketability and consumability, whether it\u2019s views or likes or retweets\u2026\u201d She sighs. \u201cWell, I think this may be the death of us. It\u2019s not that people don\u2019t care, it\u2019s that they care for five seconds. That acceleration of emotion, and attention \u2013 it\u2019s a pretty big shift in 20 years. \u201cI think the next big battles will be over the information commons: the entire business model of these tech giants is an extractive model, based on people\u2019s unpaid labour. It\u2019s been the most incredible bait-and-switch, to simultaneously say, \u2018Don\u2019t be evil\u2019 and persuade us to live our lives in public and online and share everything.\u201d There is, however, one small part of our relationship with brands that the internet and social media have perhaps democratised \u2013 the ability to control the memes of production. \u201cIn No Logo, in the \u2018adbusting\u2019 chapter, I was writing about a few daring guys with ladders, defacing billboards,\u201d she laughs, \u201cand now you have millions of people able to do parody ads and share them with everyone, instantaneously.\u201d While the images of black-clad protesters on the streets of Seattle in 1999 may have marked a rupture of sorts, the rapid decline of the global justice movement it heralded is not something to be entirely mourned by activists, Klein says, because another kind of progress has been made. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to lose sight of just how hegemonic neoliberalism really was, in the late 1990s. There is an ascendant democratic socialist left in the west now and it\u2019s liberalism that is in crisis.\u201d The global justice movement was, she says, a movement of \u201cnos\u201d and not a lot of \u201cyeses\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s taken a while to get the political and intellectual confidence to not only say \u2018no\u2019 to the ravages of neoliberal austerity, but to propose bold and imaginative structural transformation. \u201cThe real sea change between then and now is that that critique of corporate power is utterly mainstream. If you look at the US presidential candidates, not just Elizabeth Warren\u2019s or Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaigns but even some of the more mainstream candidates \u2013 everybody has to talk about breaking up big tech and standing up to the fossil fuel companies.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s partly that our relationships with the companies behind the logos have changed dramatically since 1999 too. Another example of a new trend recorded in No Logo that\u2019s become commonplace is the gig economy, or precarious work. People have no reciprocal relationship, no give and take, with their big-name corporate employers. In the Fordist era of production-line factory jobs after the war, many workers may have had miserably mundane nine-to-fives but at least those came with stability, pensions and as jobs for life. The gig economy is shattering any lingering sense of trust in or fidelity to corporations. \u201cWide-scale public rage at oligarchic power is very mainstream now,\u201d Klein says. And that surely can\u2019t be good for the brand. Perhaps it is a function of age, but recalling the world No Logo described when I was 18 \u2013 a world before 9/11 and the \u201cwar on terror\u201d, before the global financial crisis and before the gig economy and big tech set the terms of your employment and social life respectively \u2013 does feel like harking back to a more innocent time. It would be easy for me to get an Uber to a WeWork office, order some Deliveroo and finish this article on Google Docs, while I stream Spotify, taking a break to browse Facebook and Instagram on my Android phone, finesse my personal brand on Twitter and wonder where the No Logo revolution all went wrong. But it was never as simple as merely boycotting brands you vaguely disapproved of; the thrust of the book, and the global justice movement in general, was not about making more tasteful shopping decisions, but understanding how corporations shape our lives and culture and using that knowledge to try to, at least, stop them from running riot. The stakes are higher now than they were in the 1990s and this time, thanks to books such as No Logo, we can\u2019t say that we didn\u2019t know.",

The outage, the biggest in a decade, caused chaos during the evening rush hour, plunging Newcastle airport into darkness and causing gridlock in some areas as traffic lights stopped working. Describing the disruption as \u201cenormous\u201d, the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, said: \u201cNational Grid must urgently review and report to Ofgem.

Written from prison, they plead with him to take her on as a client. \u201cI guess it comes down to this in the end. I am the nanny in the Elincourt case, Mr Wrexham. And I didn\u2019t kill that child.\u201d <em>The Turn of the Key</em> then shifts back in time and Rowan tells her story from her discovery of an advert looking for a \u201cpractical, unflappable\u201d nanny to look after four children in the wilds of Scotland. She learns that the four previous incumbents have resigned in the past 14 months, but takes the job anyway, despite the discovery of an ominous note left by her predecessor and the desperate pleading of one of her new charges to stay away because \u201cthe ghosts wouldn\u2019t like it\u201d. Left on her own with the children almost from the start, things quickly go from bad to worse \u2013 creaking footsteps at night, lost keys, a walled garden filled with poisonous plants, a history of hauntings. Ware tells a cracking tale and, as in her breakout novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/22/the-best-recent-crime-fiction-novels-review-roundup\" title=\"\"><em>In a Dark, Dark Wood</em></a>, the house itself plays a hugely menacing part in proceedings.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/platform-seven-9780571321957.html\" title=\"\">Platform Seven</a></h2> <p>Louise Doughty<br><em>Faber &amp; Faber, \u00a312.99, pp448</em></p> <p>The ghost in Louise Doughty\u2019s <em>Platform Seven</em> offers a different kind of haunting. For much of the book, she is unable to remember her own story, tethered to Peterborough station and its surroundings, as she wonders how she came to die on platform seven two years earlier, and what led a man to the same place. Malign presences stalk this tale and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/16/apple-tree-yard-doughty-review\" title=\"\"><em>Apple Tree Yard</em></a> author goes on to unravel a scarily plausible story of emotional abuse and coercive control, one that led to Lisa Evans\u2019s death and which will go on to play out in the lives of many other women, unless young British Transport Police officer PC Akash Lockhart can dig deeper into her apparent suicide. <em>Platform Seven</em> manages to be both rooted in the horror of human evil \u2013 \u201cSometimes, it\u2019s like you\u2019re trying to give me a glimpse of what you\u2019d be like if you were a bad person,\u201d Lisa says to her boyfriend at one point, careful to keep a light laugh in her voice as she tries to steer him on to a better path, and tinged with supernatural terrors: \u201cMy cold anger rises and rises inside me until I bloat like an unspeakable thing,\u201d Lisa tells us, as the reality of how she has ended up in this situation becomes clear. It is, finally, desperately moving.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/perfect-wife-9781786488527.html\" title=\"\">The Perfect Wife</a></h2> <p>JP Delaney<br><em>Quercus, \u00a312.99, pp448</em></p> <p>Readers who liked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/16/before-i-sleep-sj-watson-review\" title=\"\"><em>Before I Go </em><em>to Sleep</em></a> by SJ Watson will enjoy <em>The Perfect Wife, </em>JP Delaney\u2019s futuristic twist on the story of an amnesiac wife with a secretive husband. Abbie wakes with no memory of how she ended up in a hospital bed. Tim, her husband, is beside her, crying with joy; a Silicon Valley genius, he explains to her that she\u2019s \u201cartificial. Intelligent, conscious\u2026 but manmade\u201d \u2013 a companion robot, or cobot, created five years after Abbie\u2019s death.</p> <p>\u201cAfter I lost you, plenty of people told me I should move on, find someone else to spend my life with. But I knew that was never going to happen. So I did this instead.\u201d As she struggles to come to terms with this new reality, she learns there are rules: Tim won\u2019t tell her how she died, won\u2019t let her go outside and blocks access to searches on the internet. When she finds a hidden tablet, she begins to investigate...</p> <h2>How the Dead Speak</h2> <p>Val McDermid<br><em>Little, Brown, \u00a318.99, pp416</em></p> <p>Clinical psychologist and profiler Tony Hill and detective Carol Jordan are not in good places, literally or emotionally, as Val McDermid\u2019s <em>How the Dead Speak</em> opens. At the start of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/19/val-mcdermid-books-interview-crime-tony-hill-carol-jordan-insidious-intent\" title=\"\">11th book in the series</a>, Tony is in prison, six months into a four-year sentence for killing a murderer to prevent Carol from having to do it; Carol has resigned from the police force and is trying to deal with her PTSD. Her former team, meanwhile, is struggling without her as they look into the discovery of a large number of bodies in the grounds of a convent, while a serial killer is plotting his next move. This might be well into the Hill/Jordan series, but McDermid\u2019s storytelling is as classy and compelling as ever.</p> <p>\u2022 To buy <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/turn-of-the-key-9781787300439.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>The Turn of the Key</em></a>, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/platform-seven-9780571321940.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Platform Seven</em></a>, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/perfect-wife-9781786488527.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>The Perfect Wife</em></a> or <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/how-the-dead-speak-9781408712252.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>How the Dead Speak</em></a>, go to <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/\" title=\"\">guardianbookshop.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

      "bodyText": "The Turn of the Key Ruth Ware Harvill Secker, \u00a312.99, pp352 Rowan, the narrator of Ruth Ware\u2019s spooky, tense thriller about an apparent haunting in the Highlands, starts her story with a bundle of letters to a barrister. Written from prison, they plead with him to take her on as a client. \u201cI guess it comes down to this in the end. I am the nanny in the Elincourt case, Mr Wrexham. And I didn\u2019t kill that child.\u201d The Turn of the Key then shifts back in time and Rowan tells her story from her discovery of an advert looking for a \u201cpractical, unflappable\u201d nanny to look after four children in the wilds of Scotland. She learns that the four previous incumbents have resigned in the past 14 months, but takes the job anyway, despite the discovery of an ominous note left by her predecessor and the desperate pleading of one of her new charges to stay away because \u201cthe ghosts wouldn\u2019t like it\u201d. Left on her own with the children almost from the start, things quickly go from bad to worse \u2013 creaking footsteps at night, lost keys, a walled garden filled with poisonous plants, a history of hauntings. Ware tells a cracking tale and, as in her breakout novel In a Dark, Dark Wood, the house itself plays a hugely menacing part in proceedings. Platform Seven Louise Doughty Faber &amp; Faber, \u00a312.99, pp448 The ghost in Louise Doughty\u2019s Platform Seven offers a different kind of haunting. For much of the book, she is unable to remember her own story, tethered to Peterborough station and its surroundings, as she wonders how she came to die on platform seven two years earlier, and what led a man to the same place. Malign presences stalk this tale and the Apple Tree Yard author goes on to unravel a scarily plausible story of emotional abuse and coercive control, one that led to Lisa Evans\u2019s death and which will go on to play out in the lives of many other women, unless young British Transport Police officer PC Akash Lockhart can dig deeper into her apparent suicide. Platform Seven manages to be both rooted in the horror of human evil \u2013 \u201cSometimes, it\u2019s like you\u2019re trying to give me a glimpse of what you\u2019d be like if you were a bad person,\u201d Lisa says to her boyfriend at one point, careful to keep a light laugh in her voice as she tries to steer him on to a better path, and tinged with supernatural terrors: \u201cMy cold anger rises and rises inside me until I bloat like an unspeakable thing,\u201d Lisa tells us, as the reality of how she has ended up in this situation becomes clear. It is, finally, desperately moving. The Perfect Wife JP Delaney Quercus, \u00a312.99, pp448 Readers who liked Before I Go to Sleep by SJ Watson will enjoy The Perfect Wife, JP Delaney\u2019s futuristic twist on the story of an amnesiac wife with a secretive husband. Abbie wakes with no memory of how she ended up in a hospital bed. Tim, her husband, is beside her, crying with joy; a Silicon Valley genius, he explains to her that she\u2019s \u201cartificial. Intelligent, conscious\u2026 but manmade\u201d \u2013 a companion robot, or cobot, created five years after Abbie\u2019s death. \u201cAfter I lost you, plenty of people told me I should move on, find someone else to spend my life with. But I knew that was never going to happen. So I did this instead.\u201d As she struggles to come to terms with this new reality, she learns there are rules: Tim won\u2019t tell her how she died, won\u2019t let her go outside and blocks access to searches on the internet. When she finds a hidden tablet, she begins to investigate... How the Dead Speak Val McDermid Little, Brown, \u00a318.99, pp416 Clinical psychologist and profiler Tony Hill and detective Carol Jordan are not in good places, literally or emotionally, as Val McDermid\u2019s How the Dead Speak opens. At the start of the 11th book in the series, Tony is in prison, six months into a four-year sentence for killing a murderer to prevent Carol from having to do it; Carol has resigned from the police force and is trying to deal with her PTSD. Her former team, meanwhile, is struggling without her as they look into the discovery of a large number of bodies in the grounds of a convent, while a serial killer is plotting his next move. This might be well into the Hill/Jordan series, but McDermid\u2019s storytelling is as classy and compelling as ever. \u2022 To buy The Turn of the Key, Platform Seven, The Perfect Wife or How the Dead Speak, go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

And a new strategy has emerged. When Monzo launched, in 2015, its customer base was 95% male, 100% iPhone-owning, and highly concentrated in London. But a recent TV ad campaign targeted older customers, prompting 260,000 account openings in June alone. Blomfield hopes to reach 3m customers by the end of the year.

He is keen to tell me that 26% of Monzo\u2019s staff identify as non-straight, but laments that gender diversity \u201cstill isn\u2019t very good\u201d. (The staff is around 65% men.) \u201cWe\u2019re also not great at age diversity. Most of our staff are in their 20s and 30s, and people in their 40s and 50s find it much harder to integrate.\u201d He is about to hire a diversity inclusion leader. \u201cI\u2019m very, very excited about that.</p> <p>For the sake of transparency, anyone can read the minutes from Monzo board meetings; that transparency doesn\u2019t extend to revealing who gets paid what.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s continuously a question that nags us,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy should anyone not know what anyone else is paid? It makes lots of people nervous, but if you don\u2019t know, how can you be sure that you\u2019re not systematically underpaying one set of people \u2013 writers or designers or women or people from certain ethnic backgrounds?\u201d</p> <p>The fact that all of this is on Blomfield\u2019s agenda speaks to a new financial culture that has emerged in the post-crash era. Increasingly, campaigners for fair pay encourage us to challenge taboos around salaries and, hopefully, reveal structural inequalities in the process. Meanwhile, we seem to be endlessly obsessed with the minutiae of other people\u2019s finances: witness the popularity of <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/money-diary-uk?_ga=2.30331128.617666039.1564676065-1003146559.1564676065\" title=\"\">Refinery 29\u2019s money diaries</a>, or the constant babyboomer complaints about millennial avocado habits. Given the precarity of modern employment, it is no wonder more of us are being mindful about our money.</p> <p>For all its high-tech innovations, Monzo\u2019s success mostly comes from treating customers as people as opposed to <em>econs</em> \u2013 the supposedly rational, profit-maximising consumers that economists have traditionally assumed us to be. One of Monzo\u2019s most popular features is the \u201cpot\u201d. If you want to save for a holiday, for example, you can channel a certain amount of your money into a \u201cpot\u201d. A more recent iteration is the \u201clocked pot\u201d, which prevents users from accessing those savings for a year, if they choose. \u201cTo an economist, that is totally illogical,\u201d Blomfield says. \u201cYou\u2019re actually reducing someone\u2019s optionality there. But to a behavioural psychologist it\u2019s perfectly obvious.\u201d</p> <p>A similar philosophy lies behind the gambling block pioneered by Monzo\u2019s vulnerable customers team \u2013 since copied by other banks. Customers can opt to block all gambling transactions from their cards, with a 48-hour cooling-off period, \u201cgiving people that little bit of extra friction to control their behaviour in ways they want is incredibly powerful.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a0cc6de475fb68f164c1548d7307147197d0cf75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0cc6de475fb68f164c1548d7307147197d0cf75/1112_1243_2292_4602/498.jpg\" alt=\"A phone with the Monzo app active\" width=\"498\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s not hard to see how such features might be extended \u2013 and abused. Why not introduce, say, a McDonald\u2019s block? \u201cMcDonald\u2019s, yeah, you could do a McDonald\u2019s block quite easily,\u201d says Blomfield. \u201cBut alcohol and cigarettes are the two I would really love to put a block on.\u201d Monzo doesn\u2019t have the data to do this by itself, he explains. \u201cBut what Tesco could do is send entire receipt data through the Mastercard and Visa networks, which would then enable us to say: \u2018Aha! There\u2019s alcohol on that!\u2019 Then we could decline the transaction until you take the alcohol out of your cart and re-swipe your card. It\u2019s entirely possible, it just needs all the shops to adopt it.\u201d</p> <p>You can see why civil liberties campaigners might be concerned: imagine if Universal Credit were contingent on cigarette consumption. Companies that rely on exploiting our passing weaknesses won\u2019t like it either. But for the individual who struggles with impulse control in the face of societal pressure to spend, it\u2019s quite appealing. The economy has functioned on cheap credit for more than a generation now \u2013 banks lending you money they don\u2019t really have so you can buy stuff you don\u2019t really need. Blomfield seems to be saying: maybe we wouldn\u2019t need to borrow so much money if we didn\u2019t buy so much stuff. Maybe control is more important to us than choice.</p> <p>That would appear to give lots of power to Monzo, but Blomfield stresses that power really lies in the \u201ccommunity\u201d. There are more than 40,000 members of the bank\u2019s community forum (5.62% of the company is owned by microfunders) and they seem happy to defend the company on social media and pitch in with ideas, too. It\u2019s hard to think of a financial brand that commands that sort of loyalty besides <a href=\"https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/\" title=\"\">MoneySavingExpert.com</a> (MSE), the personal finance community founded by Martin Lewis, aka \u201cthe most trusted man in Britain\u201d. Blomfield accepts the comparison, \u201cBut they need to keep persuading people to come back to the site each year,\u201d he says. \u201cThe average Monzo customer checks their app 15 times a week.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>The dream, as yet unrealised, </strong></em>is to build MSE-style price comparison features into the app, so it would be the single place you control all of your finances: student loan, mortgage, savings, pension, credit cards. \u201cThe idea is that we become the kind of storefront for everything. For example, when it\u2019s time to renew your mortgage, we come to you proactively and say, hey, we\u2019ve gone out and we\u2019ve found these three or four providers, which one would you like? Here\u2019s the best rate, here\u2019s the best customer service, you choose but we proactively find the best deals for you. I think that\u2019s a fundamental challenge to the big banks\u2019 business models because they rely on cross-sale of their own products.\u201d</p> <p>Another unrealised dream is to turn Monzo into a social enterprise. As a law student, Blomfield spent a lot of time thinking about jurisprudence: \u201cCan you ever make a rule today that you can\u2019t undo in the future? Can we as a company put a set of rules in place that mean in the future we can\u2019t break those rules? There are certain corporate structures which require you to place social and environmental impact alongside profitability. I\u2019m surprised more companies don\u2019t do that, to be honest.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ll find the best deals. The big banks can only sell their own products</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But Monzo has more workaday challenges to meet first, not least persuading its customers to deposit more of their actual salaries in their accounts. There are regulations to comply with, staff to hire, and the small matter of disrupting the banking sector in the US. Monzo has teamed up with a partner bank in Ohio and is planning a \u201cgrassroots\u201d launch. That is the \u201cshiny new toy\u201d, but Blomfield is trying not to be too distracted by it for the moment.</p> <p>He says he tries to leave his laptop at home when he\u2019s on holiday, bakes his own sourdough, and makes his own pottery (\u201cI know, I know, the tech clich\u00e9\u2026\u201d). But clearly switching off is hard.</p> <p>So what is on his mind at 3am? \u201cHonestly? I\u2019m worried about some catastrophic event, whether it\u2019s a data breach, a cybersecurity incident, an infrastructure outage, which means our systems go down and we lose people\u2019s money and Monzo is over. That is terrifying.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s also not improbable. Last week (after this interview had taken place), Monzo urged 480,000 customers to change their pin numbers, after it emerged that the data had not been stored in the most secure part of the bank\u2019s internal databases, leaving it exposed to 110 \u201cunauthorised\u201d engineers, who could have accessed the pin numbers over a six-month period. Monzo stressed that no fraud had taken place, but clearly, it <em>might</em> have.</p> <p>The last financial crisis was all about credit risk and liquidity, he warns \u2013 essential banking problems. \u201cThe next problem with banks is going to be technology. So I spend a lot of time thinking about systems resilience.\u201d Monzo is regulated just like any other bank \u2013 its customers are protected up to the standard \u00a385,000 under the government\u2019s Financial Services Compensation scheme. And while it\u2019s hardly reassuring to imagine a cyber- financial crisis might look like, it would be more worrying if he weren\u2019t worried about one.</p> <p>He is no longer too concerned about the bigger banks launching their own Monzo-esque features. Most have them now. \u201cI worry that we\u2019ve not got the winning model yet,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd someone new will come along with some way of managing your money that everyone then flocks to.\u201d</p> <p><em>This piece was amended on 15 August 2019 to correct a quotation.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Tom Blomfield doesn\u2019t come across like the CEO of a bank. Bank CEOs aren\u2019t usually 33. They don\u2019t turn up for interviews in a stripy T-shirt, munching on a banana. They certainly don\u2019t lean over to show you their current balance, mid-conversation. Blomfield actually wants to show me a feature on the Monzo app, a piece of software that has become bank manager, financial advisor and, in some cases, personal counsellor, to its 2.5m customers.

It makes lots of people nervous, but if you don\u2019t know, how can you be sure that you\u2019re not systematically underpaying one set of people \u2013 writers or designers or women or people from certain ethnic backgrounds?\u201d The fact that all of this is on Blomfield\u2019s agenda speaks to a new financial culture that has emerged in the post-crash era. Increasingly, campaigners for fair pay encourage us to challenge taboos around salaries and, hopefully, reveal structural inequalities in the process. Meanwhile, we seem to be endlessly obsessed with the minutiae of other people\u2019s finances: witness the popularity of Refinery 29\u2019s money diaries, or the constant babyboomer complaints about millennial avocado habits. Given the precarity of modern employment, it is no wonder more of us are being mindful about our money. For all its high-tech innovations, Monzo\u2019s success mostly comes from treating customers as people as opposed to econs \u2013 the supposedly rational, profit-maximising consumers that economists have traditionally assumed us to be. One of Monzo\u2019s most popular features is the \u201cpot\u201d. If you want to save for a holiday, for example, you can channel a certain amount of your money into a \u201cpot\u201d. A more recent iteration is the \u201clocked pot\u201d, which prevents users from accessing those savings for a year, if they choose. \u201cTo an economist, that is totally illogical,\u201d Blomfield says. \u201cYou\u2019re actually reducing someone\u2019s optionality there. But to a behavioural psychologist it\u2019s perfectly obvious.\u201d A similar philosophy lies behind the gambling block pioneered by Monzo\u2019s vulnerable customers team \u2013 since copied by other banks. Customers can opt to block all gambling transactions from their cards, with a 48-hour cooling-off period, \u201cgiving people that little bit of extra friction to control their behaviour in ways they want is incredibly powerful.\u201d It\u2019s not hard to see how such features might be extended \u2013 and abused. Why not introduce, say, a McDonald\u2019s block? \u201cMcDonald\u2019s, yeah, you could do a McDonald\u2019s block quite easily,\u201d says Blomfield. \u201cBut alcohol and cigarettes are the two I would really love to put a block on.\u201d Monzo doesn\u2019t have the data to do this by itself, he explains. \u201cBut what Tesco could do is send entire receipt data through the Mastercard and Visa networks, which would then enable us to say: \u2018Aha! There\u2019s alcohol on that!\u2019 Then we could decline the transaction until you take the alcohol out of your cart and re-swipe your card. It\u2019s entirely possible, it just needs all the shops to adopt it.\u201d You can see why civil liberties campaigners might be concerned: imagine if Universal Credit were contingent on cigarette consumption. Companies that rely on exploiting our passing weaknesses won\u2019t like it either. But for the individual who struggles with impulse control in the face of societal pressure to spend, it\u2019s quite appealing. The economy has functioned on cheap credit for more than a generation now \u2013 banks lending you money they don\u2019t really have so you can buy stuff you don\u2019t really need. Blomfield seems to be saying: maybe we wouldn\u2019t need to borrow so much money if we didn\u2019t buy so much stuff. Maybe control is more important to us than choice. That would appear to give lots of power to Monzo, but Blomfield stresses that power really lies in the \u201ccommunity\u201d. There are more than 40,000 members of the bank\u2019s community forum (5.62% of the company is owned by microfunders) and they seem happy to defend the company on social media and pitch in with ideas, too. It\u2019s hard to think of a financial brand that commands that sort of loyalty besides MoneySavingExpert.com (MSE), the personal finance community founded by Martin Lewis, aka \u201cthe most trusted man in Britain\u201d. Blomfield accepts the comparison, \u201cBut they need to keep persuading people to come back to the site each year,\u201d he says. \u201cThe average Monzo customer checks their app 15 times a week.\u201d The dream, as yet unrealised, is to build MSE-style price comparison features into the app, so it would be the single place you control all of your finances: student loan, mortgage, savings, pension, credit cards. \u201cThe idea is that we become the kind of storefront for everything. For example, when it\u2019s time to renew your mortgage, we come to you proactively and say, hey, we\u2019ve gone out and we\u2019ve found these three or four providers, which one would you like? Here\u2019s the best rate, here\u2019s the best customer service, you choose but we proactively find the best deals for you. I think that\u2019s a fundamental challenge to the big banks\u2019 business models because they rely on cross-sale of their own products.\u201d Another unrealised dream is to turn Monzo into a social enterprise. As a law student, Blomfield spent a lot of time thinking about jurisprudence: \u201cCan you ever make a rule today that you can\u2019t undo in the future? Can we as a company put a set of rules in place that mean in the future we can\u2019t break those rules? There are certain corporate structures which require you to place social and environmental impact alongside profitability. I\u2019m surprised more companies don\u2019t do that, to be honest.\u201d But Monzo has more workaday challenges to meet first, not least persuading its customers to deposit more of their actual salaries in their accounts. There are regulations to comply with, staff to hire, and the small matter of disrupting the banking sector in the US. Monzo has teamed up with a partner bank in Ohio and is planning a \u201cgrassroots\u201d launch. That is the \u201cshiny new toy\u201d, but Blomfield is trying not to be too distracted by it for the moment. He says he tries to leave his laptop at home when he\u2019s on holiday, bakes his own sourdough, and makes his own pottery (\u201cI know, I know, the tech clich\u00e9\u2026\u201d). But clearly switching off is hard. So what is on his mind at 3am? \u201cHonestly? I\u2019m worried about some catastrophic event, whether it\u2019s a data breach, a cybersecurity incident, an infrastructure outage, which means our systems go down and we lose people\u2019s money and Monzo is over. That is terrifying.\u201d It\u2019s also not improbable. Last week (after this interview had taken place), Monzo urged 480,000 customers to change their pin numbers, after it emerged that the data had not been stored in the most secure part of the bank\u2019s internal databases, leaving it exposed to 110 \u201cunauthorised\u201d engineers, who could have accessed the pin numbers over a six-month period. Monzo stressed that no fraud had taken place, but clearly, it might have. The last financial crisis was all about credit risk and liquidity, he warns \u2013 essential banking problems. \u201cThe next problem with banks is going to be technology. So I spend a lot of time thinking about systems resilience.\u201d Monzo is regulated just like any other bank \u2013 its customers are protected up to the standard \u00a385,000 under the government\u2019s Financial Services Compensation scheme. And while it\u2019s hardly reassuring to imagine a cyber- financial crisis might look like, it would be more worrying if he weren\u2019t worried about one. He is no longer too concerned about the bigger banks launching their own Monzo-esque features. Most have them now. \u201cI worry that we\u2019ve not got the winning model yet,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd someone new will come along with some way of managing your money that everyone then flocks to.\u201d This piece was amended on 15 August 2019 to correct a quotation.",

I write it as an Englishman, and I just cannot see how England get back into the series. </p> <p>Bowling-wise Australia can at least match them in every department - with the possible exception of swing - but even that potential advantage is diminished with Anderson\u2019s absence, and besides, there\u2019s never a guarantee of swing. As fragile as Australia\u2019s batting stocks can be, in Smith they have the transcendent figure of the series, and in Wade and Head two fighters in decent nick. Plus you know Warner\u2019s going to come good at some point. </p> <p>England look shot to me after their World Cup exploits, and that\u2019s said without judgement. The ECB have prioritised white ball cricket for some time and clearly accepted the Ashes may suffer as a consequence. So be it. I am happy to be proven wrong!</p> <p>As for United, until they appoint a football / technical director with clout they\u2019re going to be playing catch-up behind Liverpool and Man City. They need years of strategic planning, not just a busy transfer window or two. Hopefully the Glazers recognise the situation and act accordingly. Or better still, hand over the reins completely. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d4fbb348f0896be8f8f71ae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-11T06:54:31.246Z\">7.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>NRL: HT: Rabbitohs 6-12 Storm </strong>- An intriguing half on the Central Coast ends with Melbourne a converted try to the good.

I spent this morning building snowmen in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne and I have yet to properly thaw out. The weather will of course make for some interesting outdoor action this afternoon.</p> <p>Our focus today will be on the <strong>NRL</strong> with two humdinger contests to sink our teeth into. From 2pm the third-placed Raiders welcome the second-placed Roosters to Canberra in conditions I can only imagine will resemble Disney\u2019s Frozen. If that wasn\u2019t a big enough blockbuster for you then at 4.05pm the fourth-placed Rabbitohs host the ladder leading Storm in Gosford. A month out from the playoffs we\u2019ve been dealt a free finals taster, and I am hungry.</p> <p>There\u2019s plenty of intrigue in the <strong>AFL</strong> too with Fremantle needing a win away to St Kilda to keep their finals hopes alive. That one began at 1.10pm. Richmond have been moving through the gears in recent weeks and they\u2019ll be out to assert their premiership credentials against old foes Carlton from 3.20pm. Finally, West Coast round the day off against Adelaide in a fixture starting at 5.20pm that is of interest at both ends of the eight. </p> <p>Either side of all that there\u2019s <strong>Super Netball </strong>to keep an eye on with the birds of fire and thunder already in battle, and the Fever hosting the Magpies at 8pm.</p> <p>In amongst all that there\u2019s all the overnight action to discuss and anything you wish to add to the agenda.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s just about it from me for this afternoon. Thanks, as always for your company. It\u2019s been a day dominated by big wins for the Storm and Roosters in the NRL, while in the AFL the Dockers have been trimmed from the list of finals contenders. I\u2019ll be back to do it all again next Sunday. Until then, keep warm! A game that swung wildly one way and then the other ends, as it so often does, with Melbourne Storm taking home the two points. The ladder leaders blasted out of the blocks but were then becalmed for the next 45 minutes, during which they had a spell playing with just 12 men. When the game was there to be won in the final quarter the Storm stars stood up with Camerons Smith and Munster pulling out the crucial plays when it mattered most. If today was a pre-finals audition amongst the top four, Storm and the Roosters passed with flying colours. Can anybody challenge them in September and deny a repeat of last year\u2019s grand final? Richmond\u2019s premiership bandwagon continues to roll towards September with a seventh win in a row. This one wasn\u2019t pretty but in horrendous conditions at an icy MCG Damien Hardwick won\u2019t care. The Tigers replace Collingwood in the top four and can now look forward to laying down a couple of pre-finals markers with home fixtures against the Eagles and Lions ahead to round off the home-and-away campaign. It was a day to remember for Jack Graham who was the leading goal-kicker on the ground with four, and the top tackler with 14. NRL: 77 mins: Rabbitohs 16-26 Storm - That seals it for the Storm! Superb timing at dummy half from Smith, perfectly executed grubber from Munster, and a flying chase from Croft. AFL: QT: West Coast 3.4 (22) vs Adelaide 1.4 (10) - Business as usual for the premiers who have established a handy lead at quarter-time at home to the Crows. NRL: 74 mins: Rabbitohs 16-20 Storm - Game on at Gosford! Campbell Graham has a hat-trick and this one is going down to the wire. NRL: 61 mins: Rabbitohs 12-18 Storm - Of course, as soon as I type that Melbourne are in trouble they make a couple of line breaks to regain field position before Smith chisels open a gap for Munster to shimmy through. Never write off champions. NRL: 55 mins: Rabbitohs 12-12 Storm - Melbourne are back to their full complement of players but it\u2019s all Souths up in Gosford. AFL: The final match of the round is now underway at Optus Stadium with West Coast hosting Adelaide. AFL: HT: Richmond 8.6 (54) vs 4.6 (30) Carlton - The Blues have dug in at the MCG but Richmond retain a convincing lead going into the final break. Stats-wise, Jack Graham now has nine tackles to go with his four goals. NRL: 46 mins: Rabbitohs 12-12 Storm - And it takes no time at all for the extra man to tell, Campbell Graham crossing after some slick hands in the Rabbitohs backline. The Storm are under the pump now on the Central Coast. NRL: 44 mins: Rabbitohs 6-12 Storm - The break hasn\u2019t done the ladder leaders any good with more Melbourne indiscipline at the start of the second half. Felise Kaufusi has been binned for a professional foul on the Souths kick-chase under the posts. Thanks for joining in Enigma_One. I wondered if anybody would pick up on the cricket comment. I write it as an Englishman, and I just cannot see how England get back into the series. Bowling-wise Australia can at least match them in every department - with the possible exception of swing - but even that potential advantage is diminished with Anderson\u2019s absence, and besides, there\u2019s never a guarantee of swing. As fragile as Australia\u2019s batting stocks can be, in Smith they have the transcendent figure of the series, and in Wade and Head two fighters in decent nick. Plus you know Warner\u2019s going to come good at some point. England look shot to me after their World Cup exploits, and that\u2019s said without judgement. The ECB have prioritised white ball cricket for some time and clearly accepted the Ashes may suffer as a consequence. So be it. I am happy to be proven wrong! As for United, until they appoint a football / technical director with clout they\u2019re going to be playing catch-up behind Liverpool and Man City. They need years of strategic planning, not just a busy transfer window or two. Hopefully the Glazers recognise the situation and act accordingly. Or better still, hand over the reins completely. NRL: HT: Rabbitohs 6-12 Storm - An intriguing half on the Central Coast ends with Melbourne a converted try to the good. This one looks set to go down to the wire. It\u2019s been a half of two halves. The Storm threatened to run away with things in the opening 20 but some ill-discipline and unforced errors have allowed Souths back into the contest. Melbourne could do with the half-time siren and the opportunity to regroup. NRL: 25 mins: Rabbitohs 4-12 Storm - After an age camped in Melbourne territory Souths have finally hit the scoreboard. Football: The English Premier League is back up and running and the opening round of matches has so far been dominated by big wins to title favourites Liverpool and Manchester City. And there was good news for Australia\u2019s Premier League pair with Mat Ryan and Aaron Mooy celebrating an unexpected 3-0 away win for Brighton against Watford. The round concludes at 1.30am tomorrow morning with Chelsea visiting Man Utd in the most anticipated match of the weekend. AFL: HT: Richmond 6.4 (40) vs 1.6 (12) Carlton - What looked like a treacherous fixture for the Tigers is turning into a handy pre-finals tune up. Richmond have skipped through the showers to show their class, Jack Graham in particular turning it on, leaving Carlton contemplating a face-saving job in the second half. NRL: 15 mins: Rabbitohs 0-12 Storm - Melbourne mean business. They have blown their top-four rivals away in the opening 20 minutes on the Central Coast. NRL: 5 mins: Rabbitohs 0-6 Storm - It hasn\u2019t taken the Storm long to settle in Gosford. It\u2019s been all Melbourne in the opening stages. NRL: No rest for the wicked. The second blockbuster of the day is underway on the positively balmy Central Coast (it\u2019s 13C). The Roosters come out on top in a superb game of rugby league worthy of gracing the finals. The victory cements Sydney\u2019s status in second on the ladder and means the Raiders can be overtaken by Souths if they overcome Storm in the afternoon\u2019s second blockbuster. It was the Roosters backline that did the business at GIO Stadium with Daniel Tupou and James Tedesco both carrying over 200m each and Latrell Mitchell showing his class with the boot. AFL: QT: Richmond 3.2 (20) vs 0.2 (2) Carlton - The Blues and Tigers are enduring miserable conditions at the roof-less MCG and it\u2019s reflected on the scoreboard. Between the icy gusts of wind and driving rain only three goals have been mustered, all to Richmond, who take a handy lead into quarter time. Oh boy, what a way for Fremantle\u2019s season to end. Ross Lyon has just had his pocket pinched by his old club at Marvel Stadium, and the Saints fans are loving it. The Dockers looked to have done enough when they engineered their biggest lead of the match with just six minutes remaining but Brett Ratten\u2019s St Kilda refused to give in and after banging on the door in the closing stages finally found a breakthrough in the last minute. The final goal of the game forced the eighth change of lead and it proved conclusive. The victory leaves St Kilda level with the Dockers on nine wins for the season but with two rounds remaining neither are likely to make the top eight because of their poor percentage records. NRL: 65 mins: Raiders 18-22 Roosters - There\u2019s life in the Raiders yet! AFL: 1 min remaining: St Kilda 10.12 (72) vs 10.9 (69) Fremantle - The Saints hit the front! AFL: 6 mins remaining: St Kilda 8.11 (59) vs 10.8 (68) Fremantle - The Dockers are out to their biggest lead of the day after kicking the first goal of the final quarter in the 18th minute of action. Still no goals between Richmond and Carlton at the MCG in atrocious conditions. Not a weekend for fans of high-scoring matches. NRL: 53 mins: Raiders 12-22 Roosters - Sydney\u2019s backline is something else. There can\u2019t be a better player in rugby league right now than James Tedesco, what a superb attacking talent. Cricket: The second Ashes Test begins at Lord\u2019s on Wednesday and England are in all sorts. Their star bowler is unavailable, the top six looks shaky, and most of the World Cup winning heroes look spent. Australia, by contrast, look full of options, especially in their bowling stocks. A first series victory on English soil since 2001 has to be on the cards. Indeed it is, against a Carlton outfit rejuvenated under caretaker coach David Teague. Both sides are now out on the MCG preparing for the opening bounce. AFL: 3QT: St Kilda 8.7 (55) vs 9.8 (62) Fremantle - Two evenly matched sides going toe-to-toe at Marvel Stadium and there\u2019s little separating them at the final change. There\u2019s been barely a kick in it since midway through the second quarter with neither team able to break free. Nat Fyfe continues to offer the most upside to fantasy fans with a couple of goals and 28 possessions. NRL: HT: Raiders 12-18 Roosters - A thrilling half of rugby league ends with the visitors with their noses in front. James Tedesco again tops the stats sheet for metres gained while the try-scoring kicking machine that is Latrell Mitchell has already bagged ten points. The Thunderbirds may have ended the opening quarter behind but it was one-way traffic thereafter. Adelaide\u2019s 12-goal, three bonus point, victory all-but condemns the Firebirds to the wooden spoon with two rounds remaining. Maria Folau was named player of the match for shooting 35 goals from 38 attempts to go with ten assists. The fixture was the final time Laura Clemesha and Caitlyn Nevins will appear in front of the Firebirds\u2019 home crowd with the retiring pair facing two road trips to round off their careers in purple. NRL: 35 mins: Raiders 12-18 Roosters - The spectacular tries just keep coming at GIO Stadium. Tennis: The Rogers Cup is one of the major milestones on the way to the US Open and Canada\u2019s biggest tennis event is providing plenty of talking points. In the men\u2019s draw the only member of the big three in attendance, Rafael Nadal, is through to tomorrow\u2019s final, and primed to be a contender once again at Flushing Meadows. The women\u2019s draw has been altogether wilder. The final will pit 19-year old phenomenon Bianca Andreescu against an opponent twice her age; Serena Williams. Williams has yet to claim a title this season but victory in Toronto would set up her charge for a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam (and redemption for last year\u2019s final meltdown) in New York later this month. There\u2019s also been a change at the top of the world rankings with Naomi Osaka recapturing the number one spot from Ashleigh Barty, while the form player on tour, Simona Halep, withdrew from her quarter-final with injury. There\u2019s never a quiet day on the WTA Tour. NRL: 25 mins: Raiders 12-12 Roosters - Controversy in the nation\u2019s capital with the Roosters levelling courtesy of an intervention from the bunker. Super Netball: 3QT: Firebirds 45-51 Thunderbirds - Another bonus point to the Thunderbirds and their lead is now up to six points with the Firebirds looking condemned to the wooden spoon for 2019. NRL: 20 mins: Raiders 12-6 Roosters - Not a bad way for Jarrod Croker to celebrate game 250. As Winnie alludes to in the comments, it\u2019s going to be a rollercoaster fortnight in the race for the AFL finals with percentage playing its part. I can easily envisage seventh-placed Essendon losing both their remaining fixtures (away to Freo and Collingwood), and eighth-placed Port Adelaide are no certainties away to North Melbourne and at home to the Dockers. Eleven wins may well prove enough to secure a final which brings Adelaide, the Bulldogs, and Fremantle into the equation. Of that trio, the Dockers have by far the lowest percentage. AFL: HT: St Kilda 6.5 (41) vs 6.4 (40) Fremantle - The Dockers gained the ascendancy in the second quarter but failed to kick clear of St Kilda, only to find themselves back behind at the main break. Nat Fyfe has two goals to go with his 21 disposals, while Dan Hannebery has bagged his first couple as a Saint. NRL: 11 mins: Raiders 6-6 Roosters - This contest is living up to its billing. The Raiders have hit back quickly against the Roosters, keeping the ball alive with offload after offload, eventually creating a chance for Jordan Rapana. NRL: 5 mins: Raiders 0-6 Roosters - It\u2019s taken no time at all for the Roosters to opening the scoring in Canberra, and you won\u2019t see a sweeter passing move all season. Unsurprisingly James Tedesco was to the fore, and it\u2019s set up this top-four blockbuster beautifully. Super Netball: HT: Firebirds 30-33 Thunderbirds - Adelaide powered ahead of Queensland in the second quarter to surge into a three goal lead and secure the second available bonus point. The Thunderbirds upped their intercept game to secure more possession and in turn more shots at goal than the Firebirds. Sasha Glasgow and Maria Folau have missed just two efforts between them with Folau in particular catching the eye around the goal circle. Rugby: The big Australian sport story of the day continues to be the Wallabies\u2019 pummelling of the All Blacks in the Bledisloe Cup last night. New Zealand were reduced to 14 men just before half-time and Australia exploited their advantage ruthlessly. With the World Cup on the horizon this was a timely boost for Michael Cheika, not to mention a result with wider ramifications. South Africa\u2019s hammering of Argentina in the early hours of the morning means the Springboks will take home the Rugby Championship for the first time, while Wales will move ahead of the All Blacks on the unofficial world rankings. It\u2019s the first time in a decade New Zealand haven\u2019t been considered the best team in international rugby. AFL: QT: St Kilda 4.3 (27) vs 2.3 (15) Fremantle - If the 12th-placed Dockers are any chance of sneaking into the eight during the run home they need to pick up four points against St Kilda at Marvel Stadium this afternoon. But things haven\u2019t begun as Ross Lyon would have hoped against his former side, the Saints racing into an early lead, helped by of a strong opening salvo from Tim Membrey. Super Netball: QT: Firebirds 16-15 Thunderbirds - Queensland have sneaked the first bonus point in their battle with Adelaide to avoid this year\u2019s wooden spoon. The two sides occupying the least envied places on the ladder missed just one shot at goal apiece in the opening quarter. The Firebirds, remember, are still striving to break their duck for 2019. Hello everybody and welcome to what is comfortably the coldest Sportwatch of my time at Guardian towers. I spent this morning building snowmen in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne and I have yet to properly thaw out. The weather will of course make for some interesting outdoor action this afternoon. Our focus today will be on the NRL with two humdinger contests to sink our teeth into. From 2pm the third-placed Raiders welcome the second-placed Roosters to Canberra in conditions I can only imagine will resemble Disney\u2019s Frozen. If that wasn\u2019t a big enough blockbuster for you then at 4.05pm the fourth-placed Rabbitohs host the ladder leading Storm in Gosford. A month out from the playoffs we\u2019ve been dealt a free finals taster, and I am hungry. There\u2019s plenty of intrigue in the AFL too with Fremantle needing a win away to St Kilda to keep their finals hopes alive. That one began at 1.10pm. Richmond have been moving through the gears in recent weeks and they\u2019ll be out to assert their premiership credentials against old foes Carlton from 3.20pm. Finally, West Coast round the day off against Adelaide in a fixture starting at 5.20pm that is of interest at both ends of the eight. Either side of all that there\u2019s Super Netball to keep an eye on with the birds of fire and thunder already in battle, and the Fever hosting the Magpies at 8pm. In amongst all that there\u2019s all the overnight action to discuss and anything you wish to add to the agenda.

Tom Morris, also still an associate of the National, where he was best known for War Horse, has taken a busman\u2019s holiday from running the Bristol Old Vic to direct an opera version of the controversial Lars Von Trier film Breaking the Waves. Opening at the Edinburgh festival on 21 August, this is the European premiere of composer Missy Mazzoli\u2019s 2016 US hit. New operas are notoriously hard to commission and stage, with so many aficionados almost antipathetic to anything nontraditional. This production has been funded to the tune of $1m largely through Opera Ventures, which solely backs new work on contemporary themes. It was set up recently by John Berry, ex-English National Opera, who relies on philanthropists for his cash. After Edinburgh, Breaking the Waves will move to Paris, before New York\u2019s Brooklyn Academy of Music, with the Metropolitan Opera orchestra under Yannick N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin. I saw him last month conducting Shostakovich\u2019s Fifth at the Proms: brilliant. Marcel Proust\u2019s In Search of Lost Time is one of those works that many begin, but usually fail to get through. Over the August bank holiday, Radio 4 is scheduling the masterpiece in nine episodes. Translated and adapted by Timberlake Wertenbaker, and starring Sirs Derek Jacobi and Simon Russell Beale, it will also be available as a complete \u201cbox set\u201c on BBC Sounds from the afternoon of 24 August. Less excuse now not to start and finish this French classic.",

      "body": "<p>Only a minute after meeting Joseph Gilgun, he starts to tell me about his Grandma Sadie. He says my Dictaphone looks like a beard trimmer and it reminds him of Sadie because she used to shave her beard with one. \u201cI loved my Grandma Sadie, she were amazing. I think she was quite a tough old bird, really.\u201d He conjures up a memory of his grandparents\u2019 council house in Chorley. \u201cIt always smelled of stale Superkings, because she smoked in the house, and this strong smell of tea, because she used to reuse her tea bags.\u201d He goes back to being eight years old, in trouble, with his cousin, shut in the bedroom. \u201cI think we were being bollocked, me and our Carl. And we check the drawer, and for whatever reason, there\u2019s a fucking machete in it. Like, a huge machete! You could chop a child\u2019s head off with it. And me and Carl were at an age where one of us might actually use it on the other,\u201d he grins. He sits back in his chair, his tattooed legs stretching out. \u201cAnyway!\u201d</p> <p>This is a typical Gilgun yarn. He is a warm and vivid storyteller who could chat for England, all packaged up in puppyish enthusiasm. Whether he\u2019s explaining the difficulties of sourcing an antique, Grecian-style dildo that a canine co-star could wrap its jaws around \u2013 a saga that turned out to be far more fraught than you might expect \u2013 or speaking frankly about his bipolar diagnosis, he is never lost for words, which is how he ended up creating <em>Brassic</em>, a loose and fond reimagining of some of the adventures he got up to as a teenager in Lancashire.</p> <p>Back in 2014, when he was shooting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/14/pride-film-review-mark-kermode-power-in-unlikely-union\" title=\"\">the film </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/14/pride-film-review-mark-kermode-power-in-unlikely-union\" title=\"\">Pride</a></em>, he started to tell his co-star Dominic West about the attempted theft of a Shetland pony. West wisely suggested Gilgun turn it into television, so he did. He paired up with <em>Shameless</em> and <em>Clocking Off</em> writer Danny Brocklehurst, who gave the ideas some shape. At Gilgun\u2019s insistence, West appears in the show as a terrible, self-involved GP.</p> <p>Gilgun is 35, but he\u2019s been acting since he was a child, when an educational psychologist suggested he should take part in drama workshops. He joined <em>Coronation Street</em> at 10, and then <em>Emmerdale</em> in his early 20s, but it was his turn as Woody in <em>This Is England</em> that made him into a star, of which that familiar \u201cLol\u201d tattoo is a reminder, spelling out the name of his character\u2019s true love. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3752343b897afe0446e3c436173183507a4751e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3752343b897afe0446e3c436173183507a4751e6/0_78_1537_922/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gilgun with Vicky McClure as Lol in This Is England.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gilgun with Vicky McClure as Lol in This Is England.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the past few years, he\u2019s been spending time in the States, playing Cassidy, the alcoholic Irish vampire in the big-budget comic-book adaptation <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/26/preacher-review-the-revoltingly-violent-comic-book-adaptation-returns\" title=\"\">Preacher</a></em>, but the fourth and final season has finished shooting. <em>Brassic</em>, then, is a return of sorts for Gilgun. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty autobiographical,\u201d he nods. \u201cI can\u2019t go into the criminality. I\u2019ll leave that to the viewers to decide what\u2019s real from what isn\u2019t,\u201d he says, smiling, \u201cbut a lot of that shit has gone down.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX4GzQ8Ux1w\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XX4GzQ8Ux1w?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX4GzQ8Ux1w\">Watch a trailer for Brassic.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Gilgun grew up with his two sisters in Rivington, a few miles north of Wigan, where his dad worked in a metalworking factory that made parts for boilers. \u201cHe was a fucking hero. He\u2019d cycle to work, all the way to Wigan. He was a strong man and he\u2019d work these long hours at the foundry, cycle back, play for hours with us kids. He was a brilliant dad. And my mum was a very sensitive, liberal lady, always has been. Puts on a posh voice, depending on what company she\u2019s in.\u201d</p> <p>At primary school, a teacher picked up on the signs that Gilgun might be dyslexic. He would write things backwards, and grow easily frustrated when he couldn\u2019t do the work. He remembers having to write his first essay. \u201cWe had to fill an A4 page with writing, and it was so stressful that I was physically sick.\u201d Now, he says, he has a personal assistant. \u201cNot because I need a smoothie at three o\u2019clock in the morning \u2013 it\u2019s because I can\u2019t read a single email.\u201d</p> <p>When he was 11, his parents split up, and around that same time, his dad was made redundant. \u201cTough age, you know. Couldn\u2019t figure it out.

I\u2019ve been on everything, dude.\u201d</p> <p>At 26, Gilgun had been cast in <em>Misfits</em> as Rudy, a character split into two versions of himself \u2013 one upbeat, confident and gregarious, the other melancholy, insecure and uncertain. It was a demanding role, because he was playing two people. \u201cAnd I have this colossal fucking meltdown: I\u2019m not eating, I\u2019m not sleeping\u2026 all this shit that I go through every time.\u201d He starts to choke up when he remembers the kindness of the show\u2019s producer, Matt Strevens, who got him to a private doctor (\u201cposh, he looked like the fucking lion out of Narnia\u201d), who told him that the medication he\u2019d been on for years had been damaging his mental health. \u201cHe said, \u2018Everything you\u2019ve taken on the list I can see in front of me is detrimental to someone who suffers with bipolar \u2013 which, by the way, you have\u2019.\u201d Up until that point, Gilgun had no idea.

On the one hand, it\u2019s given him access to healthcare that he would not have had otherwise. He has weekly therapy now, and the environment he works in provides him with discipline. He is strict about being on set on time, and always knowing his lines. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking hard up here, like, super hard,\u201d he says, tapping his head. \u201cThis head of mine never rests. Do not make the assumption that because somebody has got mental health issues they are weak-minded. That person is terrified, anxious. Getting out of bed alone has been a huge, monumental task. Getting in that shower, brushing the teeth, somehow managing to eat their breakfast\u2026 Some will have children, and they have to go and do exactly the same thing you do at work, only they\u2019re suffering like that. Now that to me is a fucking hard dude or gal.\u201d</p> <p>On the other hand, there are some parts of his job, and some roles in particular, that have taken it out of him. \u201cI almost enjoy the fact, in a sadistic way, that a part is going to damage me a little bit,\u201d he explains. <em>This Is England</em> was one of those roles. When Woody found himself cut off from the gang, Gilgun cut himself off from the cast, who are his close friends in real life. \u201cThat was a difficult thing to do.\u201d They filmed in Sheffield, where he didn\u2019t know anyone else. \u201cEssentially I\u2019m on my own in a flat, locked away. The lines get very, very blurred.\u201d</p> <p>Though it borrows from Gilgun\u2019s youth, there is a sense that <em>Brassic</em> shows a parallel life for Gilgun, a what-could-have-been, had his acting career not taken off. \u201cDefinitely,\u201d he agrees. \u201cI mean, I was a bad kid, but I wasn\u2019t El Chapo. I\u2019d sell a bit of weed and I\u2019d shift a bit of gear. I\u2019ll not go into details. But I think [Gilgun\u2019s character] Vinnie is someone I could have ended up being.\u201d He points out that in a lot of his roles, his character has been surrounded by a close group of friends: <em>Misfits</em>, <em>This Is England</em> and even <em>Preacher</em> are about tight friendships. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not very social. I spend a lot of time on my own. The few friends I do have, I rarely see, and I keep them at a distance. I think I feel guilty for doing well.\u201d Vinnie, meanwhile, is always there for his mates, and rarely alone. \u201cIt\u2019s a version [of me] that I\u2019d like to be, you know. I\u2019d love to be that guy who\u2019s not a flakey friend, who does turn up to weddings and parties, but I\u2019m not him. I don\u2019t know if I ever will be.\u201d</p> <p>In the core <em>Brassic</em> gang, one of the characters, Tommo, is a committed lothario who has sex with men and women, while hardman Ash is an Irish Traveller who happens to be gay. \u201cWe\u2019re not making a fucking comment,\u201d says Gilgun, shrugging. \u201cIt makes no difference. In a working-class community, often you are accepted for the oddball you\u2019ve become. The working classes go through a very specific filtration system that\u2019s different to the middle and upper classes, and a lot of that is based around survival. As a result of that, you get these huge personalities \u2013 they\u2019re fucking nuts, you know \u2013 and you just accept them.\u201d He fondly mentions local characters from his home town, eccentrics who nobody would dare mess with. \u201cYou know, the show is an unapologetic comment on what it is to be working-class,\u201d says Gilgun. \u201cWe\u2019re not all miserable. Some of the happiest people I know have got fuck all.\u201d</p> <p>One of the more surprising truthful elements of <em>Brassic</em> is that, like Vinnie, Gilgun does actually live out in the woods, in a derelict house in the north west, that he\u2019s slowly doing up, with the help of his mum and his sisters. He broke in through a skylight one day, he says, and just started living there. \u201cWhen I first moved in, I lived in a tent in the house because there was this big hole in the ceiling.\u201d When he was filming <em>Preacher</em>, the American network would put him up in \u201cthese multimillion-dollar eco houses\u201d, so it was quite the contrast. \u201cI go straight back into the derelict house where there\u2019s no hot water and I can\u2019t really flush the toilet properly without throwing a bucket down it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18a278848ed5c7eda9ae64cd51c8285a1456c455\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18a278848ed5c7eda9ae64cd51c8285a1456c455/0_284_5287_3172/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from the second episode of Brassic, left to right: Gilgun, Aaron Heffernan, Tim Key, Tom Hansen and Damien Molony.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from the second episode of Brassic, left to right: Gilgun, Aaron Heffernan, Tim Key, Tom Hansen and Damien Molony.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky UK</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He\u2019s never been the kind of person who hankers for material stuff. \u201cI don\u2019t have a nice car. I have two bikes, I like trainers, I like tattoos, quite like gold teeth.\u201d He flashes a gold-free smile. \u201cI might get some of them made.\u201d He was talking to his therapist about all of this recently. \u201cI had a bit of a breakthrough. She was saying, \u2018Why don\u2019t you have a girlfriend? Why don\u2019t you have a house? You\u2019ve got all this money. Do something with it.\u2019\u201d He says that, partly, he doesn\u2019t feel worthy of it. \u201cBut the other aspect is, once I\u2019ve got a girl that I know I can love and she loves me, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll get a house and I\u2019ll learn to drive and I\u2019ll become a normal human being, get a golden retriever and a fucking dishwasher and all that. I\u2019ll give it everything I have. I\u2019ve never really had that love, being in love like that.\u201d He says it\u2019s hard, because of his bipolar, but also because of his work, which means he\u2019s away a lot. \u201cI can\u2019t meet anyone. I\u2019m nice, as well!\u201d So he\u2019s just put himself on Tinder. \u201cBut it\u2019s difficult. No one\u2019s in the market for a bipolar squatter who lives in the fucking woods, do you know what I mean?\u201d</p> <p>Gilgun has already got his next project lined up. It\u2019s early days, so he\u2019s not allowed to say what it is, but <em>Brassic</em> has given him a taste for the creative side. \u201cI\u2019ve got loads of ideas and for the first time in my life, I\u2019ve got the confidence to be able to sit up and go, hey, they\u2019re fucking brilliant.\u201d I tell him I loved <em>Brassic</em>. By the end of it, I cared deeply about all of the characters, especially Vinnie. He looks pleased. \u201cSome of it is real, so you\u2019re watching someone\u2019s life. There\u2019s a truth to all of it. Even though we\u2019re doing crazy things like robbing horses.\u201d He mentions a rule that they would never play a scene for laughs. If he caught an actor doing it, he\u2019d immediately stop them. \u201cBecause what we\u2019re doing is mad enough. You don\u2019t have to add to that,\u201d he smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s already fucking mental.\u201d</p> <p><em>All episodes of Brassic will be available on Sky One and Now TV from 22 August</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Only a minute after meeting Joseph Gilgun, he starts to tell me about his Grandma Sadie. He says my Dictaphone looks like a beard trimmer and it reminds him of Sadie because she used to shave her beard with one. \u201cI loved my Grandma Sadie, she were amazing. I think she was quite a tough old bird, really.\u201d He conjures up a memory of his grandparents\u2019 council house in Chorley. \u201cIt always smelled of stale Superkings, because she smoked in the house, and this strong smell of tea, because she used to reuse her tea bags.\u201d He goes back to being eight years old, in trouble, with his cousin, shut in the bedroom. \u201cI think we were being bollocked, me and our Carl. And we check the drawer, and for whatever reason, there\u2019s a fucking machete in it. Like, a huge machete! You could chop a child\u2019s head off with it. And me and Carl were at an age where one of us might actually use it on the other,\u201d he grins. He sits back in his chair, his tattooed legs stretching out. \u201cAnyway!\u201d This is a typical Gilgun yarn. He is a warm and vivid storyteller who could chat for England, all packaged up in puppyish enthusiasm. Whether he\u2019s explaining the difficulties of sourcing an antique, Grecian-style dildo that a canine co-star could wrap its jaws around \u2013 a saga that turned out to be far more fraught than you might expect \u2013 or speaking frankly about his bipolar diagnosis, he is never lost for words, which is how he ended up creating Brassic, a loose and fond reimagining of some of the adventures he got up to as a teenager in Lancashire. Back in 2014, when he was shooting the film Pride, he started to tell his co-star Dominic West about the attempted theft of a Shetland pony. West wisely suggested Gilgun turn it into television, so he did. He paired up with Shameless and Clocking Off writer Danny Brocklehurst, who gave the ideas some shape. At Gilgun\u2019s insistence, West appears in the show as a terrible, self-involved GP. Gilgun is 35, but he\u2019s been acting since he was a child, when an educational psychologist suggested he should take part in drama workshops. He joined Coronation Street at 10, and then Emmerdale in his early 20s, but it was his turn as Woody in This Is England that made him into a star, of which that familiar \u201cLol\u201d tattoo is a reminder, spelling out the name of his character\u2019s true love. For the past few years, he\u2019s been spending time in the States, playing Cassidy, the alcoholic Irish vampire in the big-budget comic-book adaptation Preacher, but the fourth and final season has finished shooting. Brassic, then, is a return of sorts for Gilgun. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty autobiographical,\u201d he nods. \u201cI can\u2019t go into the criminality. I\u2019ll leave that to the viewers to decide what\u2019s real from what isn\u2019t,\u201d he says, smiling, \u201cbut a lot of that shit has gone down.\u201d Gilgun grew up with his two sisters in Rivington, a few miles north of Wigan, where his dad worked in a metalworking factory that made parts for boilers. \u201cHe was a fucking hero. He\u2019d cycle to work, all the way to Wigan. He was a strong man and he\u2019d work these long hours at the foundry, cycle back, play for hours with us kids. He was a brilliant dad. And my mum was a very sensitive, liberal lady, always has been. Puts on a posh voice, depending on what company she\u2019s in.\u201d At primary school, a teacher picked up on the signs that Gilgun might be dyslexic. He would write things backwards, and grow easily frustrated when he couldn\u2019t do the work. He remembers having to write his first essay. \u201cWe had to fill an A4 page with writing, and it was so stressful that I was physically sick.\u201d Now, he says, he has a personal assistant. \u201cNot because I need a smoothie at three o\u2019clock in the morning \u2013 it\u2019s because I can\u2019t read a single email.\u201d When he was 11, his parents split up, and around that same time, his dad was made redundant. \u201cTough age, you know. Couldn\u2019t figure it out. I really struggled and I was very angry for a long time, but my job has afforded me the opportunity to do a bit of therapy, and that\u2019s just been fucking huge.\u201d The trouble with therapy, he says, is that it\u2019s not nearly as accessible as it needs to be. \u201cThere\u2019s not that many therapists and there\u2019s so many people with mental health issues. You need talking therapy, but it\u2019s just not available. If I go to my doctor and say, \u2018I\u2019m having suicidal thoughts\u2019, they\u2019ll go, \u2018Right, well, I can give you some therapy\u2026 there\u2019s a three-month waiting list\u2019.\u201d Gilgun wrote this into Brassic; its funniest moments are often its blackest. When he was a teenager, Gilgun was prescribed antidepressants. \u201cI\u2019d been a difficult child, a very emotional young man, kicking off about something, or fucking bawling my eyes out, heartbroken.\u201d His mother told him that the family had come to expect these \u201ccatastrophes\u201d, as he calls them, once a month or so. \u201cWe\u2019d always talk like: Joseph\u2019s due one of his meltdowns.\u201d But by 17, the situation had become untenable. \u201cMum and Dad had separated, life was starting to really change. I was in the process of going off the fucking rails, deeply unhappy.\u201d He\u2019d heard that the GP would hand out pills that could make him happy, so he made an appointment. At first, the doctor did offer him counselling. \u201cBut it was a long wait and I needed help there and then.\u201d He took the antidepressants instead. \u201cI ended up on these drugs for years. They\u2019d put me on one, I\u2019d go all the way up to the highest dose, then it\u2019d stop working again and I\u2019d go on to another, go all the way up to the highest dose, taken off that, go on to another. I\u2019ve been on everything, dude.\u201d At 26, Gilgun had been cast in Misfits as Rudy, a character split into two versions of himself \u2013 one upbeat, confident and gregarious, the other melancholy, insecure and uncertain. It was a demanding role, because he was playing two people. \u201cAnd I have this colossal fucking meltdown: I\u2019m not eating, I\u2019m not sleeping\u2026 all this shit that I go through every time.\u201d He starts to choke up when he remembers the kindness of the show\u2019s producer, Matt Strevens, who got him to a private doctor (\u201cposh, he looked like the fucking lion out of Narnia\u201d), who told him that the medication he\u2019d been on for years had been damaging his mental health. \u201cHe said, \u2018Everything you\u2019ve taken on the list I can see in front of me is detrimental to someone who suffers with bipolar \u2013 which, by the way, you have\u2019.\u201d Up until that point, Gilgun had no idea.

Some of the happiest people I know have got fuck all.\u201d One of the more surprising truthful elements of Brassic is that, like Vinnie, Gilgun does actually live out in the woods, in a derelict house in the north west, that he\u2019s slowly doing up, with the help of his mum and his sisters. He broke in through a skylight one day, he says, and just started living there. \u201cWhen I first moved in, I lived in a tent in the house because there was this big hole in the ceiling.\u201d When he was filming Preacher, the American network would put him up in \u201cthese multimillion-dollar eco houses\u201d, so it was quite the contrast. \u201cI go straight back into the derelict house where there\u2019s no hot water and I can\u2019t really flush the toilet properly without throwing a bucket down it.\u201d He\u2019s never been the kind of person who hankers for material stuff. \u201cI don\u2019t have a nice car. I have two bikes, I like trainers, I like tattoos, quite like gold teeth.\u201d He flashes a gold-free smile. \u201cI might get some of them made.\u201d He was talking to his therapist about all of this recently. \u201cI had a bit of a breakthrough. She was saying, \u2018Why don\u2019t you have a girlfriend? Why don\u2019t you have a house? You\u2019ve got all this money. Do something with it.\u2019\u201d He says that, partly, he doesn\u2019t feel worthy of it. \u201cBut the other aspect is, once I\u2019ve got a girl that I know I can love and she loves me, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll get a house and I\u2019ll learn to drive and I\u2019ll become a normal human being, get a golden retriever and a fucking dishwasher and all that. I\u2019ll give it everything I have. I\u2019ve never really had that love, being in love like that.\u201d He says it\u2019s hard, because of his bipolar, but also because of his work, which means he\u2019s away a lot. \u201cI can\u2019t meet anyone. I\u2019m nice, as well!\u201d So he\u2019s just put himself on Tinder. \u201cBut it\u2019s difficult. No one\u2019s in the market for a bipolar squatter who lives in the fucking woods, do you know what I mean?\u201d Gilgun has already got his next project lined up. It\u2019s early days, so he\u2019s not allowed to say what it is, but Brassic has given him a taste for the creative side. \u201cI\u2019ve got loads of ideas and for the first time in my life, I\u2019ve got the confidence to be able to sit up and go, hey, they\u2019re fucking brilliant.\u201d I tell him I loved Brassic. By the end of it, I cared deeply about all of the characters, especially Vinnie. He looks pleased. \u201cSome of it is real, so you\u2019re watching someone\u2019s life. There\u2019s a truth to all of it. Even though we\u2019re doing crazy things like robbing horses.\u201d He mentions a rule that they would never play a scene for laughs. If he caught an actor doing it, he\u2019d immediately stop them. \u201cBecause what we\u2019re doing is mad enough. You don\u2019t have to add to that,\u201d he smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s already fucking mental.\u201d All episodes of Brassic will be available on Sky One and Now TV from 22 August",

There will be no more novels, no more essays, no more occasions where her living voice reaches across time and space to pierce us with insight. I feel the collective mind wrestling with disbelief, the way my own mind did in the days after my father died. Maybe this is a mistake. Maybe someone will tell us very soon that she has come back.</p> <p>What consoles in the wake of her death \u2013 which I want to think of as her ascension \u2013 is the monument Morrison has left us here on Earth, a lifetime of work in inspired exploration of selfhood and nationhood as informed by notions of race. In America, a country whose founding fallacies of white versus black, dominion versus enslavement and superiority versus inferiority reverberate ceaselessly through the fabric of daily life, there is no topic more urgently relevant. And yet, there is no topic that has been more consciously and unconsciously eschewed, mishandled or contested.</p> <p>In the preface to her 1992 essay collection <em>Playing in the Dark</em>, Morrison writes: \u201cUntil very recently, and regardless of the race of the author, the readers of virtually all of American fiction have been positioned as white. I am interested to know what that assumption has meant to the literary imagination.\u201d</p> <p>Across her celebrated career, in terms both critical and creative, Morrison went to work upon the question of what race has done to the American mind. \u201cMy project,\u201d She wrote in that volume\u2019s closing essay, \u201cis an effort to avert the critical gaze from the racial object to the racial subject; from the described and imagined to the describers and imaginers; from the serving to the served.\u201d</p> <p>Her critical project empowered readers to recognise that it is the needs and fantasies of whiteness that determine the manner in which blackness is depicted in the canon of American literature. And her novels chose black lives as their central subjects, enthralling readers with her commitment to the inner lives of black characters.</p> <p>I was in Morrison\u2019s presence just a few times. I joined Princeton\u2019s creative writing faculty just as Morrison was retiring from teaching, though she remained a presence on campus, and returned occasionally to the classroom. One afternoon, as I sat with my own students in what was essentially the anteroom outside Morrison\u2019s office, she walked through the space. I had been making some point about poetry. I had been very confident in the moments just prior to the sighting, then I felt myself grow small, afraid in the way that certain mountains, even from a distance, can make one feel the fear of falling.</p> <p>Once, before a reading on campus by a young black novelist in whom Morrison had taken an interest, the three of us sat on a bench smoking cigarettes. Stupefying awe having already set in, the most I had mustered to say was: \u201cIt\u2019s an honour to meet you.\u201d I sat silently as the two of them chatted, thinking it remarkable that Toni Morrison could do just that \u2013 chat \u2013 so easily, so naturally, like an ordinary mortal.</p> <p>Ten years later, I interviewed her onstage. I cringe recalling how I kept asking her, in each of my questions, to solve our nation\u2019s moral problems, to predict its future, when perhaps what she had wanted to talk about were her characters, her sentences, her ways of capturing the very real voices of her \u2013our \u2013 richly varied people.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know Toni Morrison. But in another sense \u2013 one everyone who has read and loved her work will recognise \u2013 she and I were intimates. Near the end of my first marriage, I read <em>Jazz</em>, a novel about passion and violence, transcendence and futility. A part of me grew pained and alert when, in the final pages, the narrator admits to the wish to say, openly, \u201cthat I have loved only you, surrendered my whole self reckless to you and nobody else. That I want you to love me back and show it to me.\u201d</p> <p>During the year between the death of my father and the birth of my daughter, I sat in a different marriage, surrendering myself to the layers of feeling and consequence which speak directly to the condition of motherhood in Morrison\u2019s novels. If they had been visible to me before, now they stirred a layer of spirit I hadn\u2019t previously understood myself to possess. The new life dawning in me, ghostly and mysterious, was touched and classified by Morrison\u2019s voice. \u201cI\u2019m here. I lasted,\u201d says Sethe once she has claimed Beloved as her own true daughter returned from the dead. \u201cNow I can look at things again because she\u2019s here to see them too.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5cd82337b0d263e9b65ed65642f622e4c513c487\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5cd82337b0d263e9b65ed65642f622e4c513c487/0_0_3500_3723/940.jpg\" alt=\"Toni Morrison photographed in New York City in 1979.\" width=\"940\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morrison photographed in New York City in 1979.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Great novels enter us. They reconfigure our sense of who we are and what we feel. They urge a part of ourselves to take flight, to merge with something alive outside of us, the proxy for which is often the novelist herself. In this way, great literature helps us to feel recognised, comprehended, accompanied.</p> <p>In the days after Morrison\u2019s death was announced, I sat down to reread <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/-9780099759911.html\" title=\"\">The Bluest Eye</a></em>. It\u2019s a first novel and yet \u2013 astoundingly \u2013 everything is there. The voices, nimbly alive, don\u2019t just mimic or signal black life, but, rather, invoke and rejoice in it. The clarity and urgency of characters is telegraphed through indelible gestures: three pennies guarded in a child\u2019s shoe, the poor hunched shoulders and tilted head of the girl Pecola, who\u2019s lived her whole short life with an internalised sense of ugly unlovability. The various forms of rage that rise up in the face of lack stand revealed, as do the barbarous social conditions in place to perpetuate such lack \u2013 not just in America but everywhere that difference between people is recognised and leveraged.</p> <p>She was herself even then.</p> <p>What is she now? I find myself asking these days when the reality of her absence remains tenuous. Today, I believe her to be an abiding source of insight and force, coaxing still, from wherever she has gone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b3a77958cfb8d9d6aa80580ac582af7725086088\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3a77958cfb8d9d6aa80580ac582af7725086088/1325_0_2765_3456/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Reynolds\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Jason Reynolds: \u2018She told those of us who would grow up to become black writers that we were free\u2019</h2> <p><em>Acclaimed American author of novels and poetry for young adults. His 2016 story Ghost was a National Book Award finalist in the US for young people\u2019s literature</em></p> <p>I didn\u2019t encounter Toni Morrison\u2019s work until I was in my early 20s. I wasn\u2019t much of a reader as a kid, let alone a reader of something as complex as Toni Morrison\u2019s work, so I came to it a little late. The first book I read was <em>The Bluest Eye</em>, which I found while working in a book store, and I loved it. After that, I read <em>Sula</em>, which is probably my favourite of her novels, but it took me much longer to read <em>Beloved</em>. I felt like I had to grow into it. I would try it over and over and it would fit a little better each time, and eventually it fit perfectly.</p> <p>For me, there is an audacity to her work. She was a maverick and she had an ability to write really complex and painful things in a way that felt boundless. For so long, we had been told how writers were supposed to write \u2013 this is the way it\u2019s supposed to sound, to look, to move \u2013 and she up-ended all those things, in <em>Beloved </em>in particular. I\u2019m thinking of the way she bleeds and conflates time, and the idea of spirit \u2013 how in our tradition, spirit doesn\u2019t necessarily mean something that is gone, but something that is present, that is always there.</p> <p>She really pushed the limits and told those of us who would grow up to become black writers that we were free \u2013 free to write however and whatever we wanted to write. There is only one other person that gave me that same feeling of freedom, and that\u2019s James Baldwin, but Baldwin pretty much kept with the concrete, whereas Morrison bled into the surrealism and the magic \u2013 the magic that makes us who we are.</p> <p>If you are a writer, and specifically a black writer, it feels almost impossible not to be influenced by Toni Morrison. There\u2019s that line in <em>Beloved</em>, one her most quoted sentences, where a character says: \u201cShe is a friend of my mind. She gather me, man.\u201d I think about that sentence all the time. It speaks to her ability to describe a man who is trying to express love. How does he articulate this love with limited language? Actually, that language is not so limited: it becomes expansive because he\u2019s forced to get creative in his explanation. So in trying to describe love, he says, \u201cShe gather me.\u201d None of us could ever come up with that.</p> <p>For a lot of us now, when we\u2019re approaching the page, we don\u2019t have to be afraid of our poetry. We don\u2019t have to be afraid to stretch language. And in being stretched, the language becomes more real. In my own book, <em>Ghost</em>, a young person is trying to describe his anger and he says: \u201cI got so much mad in me.\u201d I don\u2019t get to say that without Toni Morrison \u2013 I don\u2019t get to have the freedom to make the language feel familiar and fantastic at the exact same time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4bd96dc22708c54b78e8a84857a8da5322347cfa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bd96dc22708c54b78e8a84857a8da5322347cfa/0_0_4424_3700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morrison with her sons, Slade and Ford, at her home in December 1978.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"836\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morrison with her sons, Slade and Ford, at her home in December 1978.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I wish I\u2019d met her. I\u2019ve got a lot of friends who knew her, but unfortunately I was never in a situation to shake her hand and say thank you. Several years back, I was at an event where they were auctioning a first edition, mint condition, signed copy of <em>Beloved</em>. I bid for it and won the bid, and I remember my friends saying: \u201cYou paid way too much money for that.\u201d But I looked at that book last night and thought, man, what a treasure. That\u2019s the closest I\u2019m ever going to come to her.</p> <p>I think she\u2019ll be remembered as someone who loved us \u2013 and loved us enough to scare us. I know that she scared the white establishment, and that made me feel safe. It made us feel bigger. She was unafraid.</p> <p>In a 1993 interview with Charlie Rose, she said: \u201cWhat are you without racism? \u2026 If you can only be tall because somebody is on their knees, then you have a serious problem. And my feeling is that white people have a very, very serious problem and they should start thinking about what they can do about it.\u201d</p> <p>As a kid of 18 or 19 watching that, and even now as a 35-year-old repeating that, I feel emboldened. Toni\u2019s irreverence was godly. Her irreverence felt miraculous. And I think it helped to spark the magic in a lot of us, who had been told over and over again, by every other faction in life, that we were less than and that we deserved invisibility.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3dfe345d11c09de2821536b1ccd59b4b281e3cc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dfe345d11c09de2821536b1ccd59b4b281e3cc2/3289_1032_1329_1661/800.jpg\" alt=\"Bryan Stevenson\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Bryan Stevenson: \u2018She was fearless. She said you can be black and great. And she never stopped saying that\u2019</h2> <p><em>Campaigning lawyer and founder of the </em><em>Equal Justice Initiative</em><em>, which has overturned the wrongful convictions of 135 prisoners on death row in the American south. </em><em>Stevenson, </em><em>59</em><em>, chose words by</em><em> Toni Morrison for the <a href=\"https://museumandmemorial.eji.org/memorial\" title=\"\">National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama</a>, the first official monument to the 4,000 black Americans murdered by lynching</em></p> <p>The first book of Toni Morrison\u2019s I read was <em>The Bluest Eye</em>, and what amazed me about it was the honesty with which she expressed what it is like to be black in a world that so clearly values whiteness. I was 17 or 18, just heading to college. In the previously segregated school where I grew up in Delaware we were not exposed to black authors. I had to go and find Ralph Ellison\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/invisible-man.html\" title=\"\">Invisible Man</a></em> for myself, for example.</p> <p>I think because Morrison had worked as an editor in publishing she was mindful of an absence of a particular voice in that literature, a way of thinking and a way of talking. Storytelling is such a rich part of the tradition of any child of parents who grew up in the south; you were surrounded by adults who told stories with a particular kind of melody and magic. When my mother and her sisters and the neighbours in our community got talking together it would have that quality to it \u2013 there was nothing more entertaining or engaging than being at the table while these black women spoke to each other and expressed their fears and their sorrows and their joys and their insights. It was a truth-telling space. Toni Morrison brought that voice out into the world.</p> <p>We never met but we had hoped to honour her at our annual dinner for the Equal Justice Initiative in New York next month. When we opened our museum and memorial in Montgomery we had these monuments and sculptures and descriptions of the lynchings, and I felt like we needed something powerful to say to people when they left this really intense experience. I had read a little book Toni Morrison had put out just a couple of years ago of a lecture she had just done at Harvard, \u201cThe Origin of Others\u201d, and there was a quote from <em>Beloved</em> in it that was just so perfect for what we wanted to say. When we approached her for permission she could not have been more supportive and encouraging of us using it there, and was hoping to come to see it for herself. The quote contains an exhortation: \u201cAnd O, my people, out yonder, hear me, they do not love your neck unnoosed and straight. So love your neck... hear me now, love your heart. For this is the prize.\u201d This idea that if you have survived this violence and terror you can\u2019t just run and hide, you are actually going to have to dig deep and love the parts of yourself that other people would exploit and brutalise and injure \u2013 I just thought it was such a powerful way of suggesting how you could recover from that history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"573deb8c02829589aaf15236cc89c590bae70a9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/573deb8c02829589aaf15236cc89c590bae70a9c/0_0_4096_2731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morrison with Barack Obama before being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morrison with Barack Obama before being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pete Souza/The White House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She was fearless, always an activist. Even in simply saying \u201cI am a black woman writer\u201d she was rejecting the opportunity to be swallowed up by all of these institutions and spaces that might have wanted to embrace her talent but minimise her race or gender. I think that modelled an identity that has been hugely important for many of us who have been made to think that we have to choose between being a great lawyer and a black lawyer, or a great writer and a black writer. She just rejected that dichotomy. She said you can be black and great. And she never stopped saying that. Right to the end she concerned herself with the day-to-day experience of people; I think what was going on at any moment in the lives of black people always shaped her writing and her vision for what was necessary. At a time when we are engaged in a new struggle over the narrative of our history of bigotry she showed what America can be. I loved her for that; we all did.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ea286d7ff0342dc3b863bad3d468e40d26c1800b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea286d7ff0342dc3b863bad3d468e40d26c1800b/3107_404_1426_1782/800.jpg\" alt=\"Kwame Kwei-Armah\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Kwame Kwei-Armah: \u2018She is magnificent. Her emotional intelligence is second to none\u2019</h2> <p><em>Artistic director of the Young Vic</em><em>. In </em><em>2017</em><em>, while Kwei-Armah was artistic director of </em><em>Center Stage theatre in Baltimore</em><em>, he directed an adaptation of Morrison\u2019s 19</em><em>92 novel, Jazz</em></p> <p>She came into my life in the late 80s when I was given a copy of <em>Beloved</em>. That was the first book of hers I read and in truth I was stunned by it. I didn\u2019t quite know how to negotiate it, in fact. At that point, there was so little literature about slavery and very little literature about people in slavery making huge decisions. From then on, of course, she became the <em>thing</em>, the being that you went to when you wanted absolute truth and poetry.</p> <p>She was an influence in that she affected my ability to not see myself as a minority when it came to writing, to not always centralise my fears around reaction to my work from, as she called it, \u201cthe white gaze\u201d. Also, I felt that while some of her contemporaries placed the black male as the antithesis of goodness or had [their characters] having to negotiate their way to freedom through or over the black male, Toni Morrison treated me \u2013 a black man \u2013 like a mother would, like a sister or a lover. She loved me for my flaws and explained them and the reasons for them to me and that\u2019s why she was my go-to writer. Every time she had a new novel I couldn\u2019t wait to read it because I knew there would be a part of my story that was new to me.</p> <p>My favourite book is <em>Jazz</em> because she\u2019s not writing for the audience. <em>Song of Solomon</em> is similar. Most people I knew had to pick up <em>Jazz</em> three or four times before they got through it, but when you did there\u2019s a complexity to the storytelling. I think I read it maybe six times and then I directed its world premiere on stage. Right at the beginning of the process, she said: \u201cListen, theatre\u2019s not my thing so\u2026 off you go. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d Which was just magnificent for the writer and magnificent for me as the director and producer of it.

      "bodyText": "Tracy K Smith: \u2018What consoles in the wake of her death is the monument she has left us, a lifetime of work\u2019 The 22nd poet laureate of the US, from 2017 to 2019, Smith is the author of four books of poetry, including the Pulitzer prize-winning Life on Mars (2011) The realisation has recurred in various forms now that Toni Morrison has died. There will be no more novels, no more essays, no more occasions where her living voice reaches across time and space to pierce us with insight. I feel the collective mind wrestling with disbelief, the way my own mind did in the days after my father died. Maybe this is a mistake. Maybe someone will tell us very soon that she has come back. What consoles in the wake of her death \u2013 which I want to think of as her ascension \u2013 is the monument Morrison has left us here on Earth, a lifetime of work in inspired exploration of selfhood and nationhood as informed by notions of race. In America, a country whose founding fallacies of white versus black, dominion versus enslavement and superiority versus inferiority reverberate ceaselessly through the fabric of daily life, there is no topic more urgently relevant. And yet, there is no topic that has been more consciously and unconsciously eschewed, mishandled or contested. In the preface to her 1992 essay collection Playing in the Dark, Morrison writes: \u201cUntil very recently, and regardless of the race of the author, the readers of virtually all of American fiction have been positioned as white. I am interested to know what that assumption has meant to the literary imagination.\u201d Across her celebrated career, in terms both critical and creative, Morrison went to work upon the question of what race has done to the American mind. \u201cMy project,\u201d She wrote in that volume\u2019s closing essay, \u201cis an effort to avert the critical gaze from the racial object to the racial subject; from the described and imagined to the describers and imaginers; from the serving to the served.\u201d Her critical project empowered readers to recognise that it is the needs and fantasies of whiteness that determine the manner in which blackness is depicted in the canon of American literature. And her novels chose black lives as their central subjects, enthralling readers with her commitment to the inner lives of black characters. I was in Morrison\u2019s presence just a few times. I joined Princeton\u2019s creative writing faculty just as Morrison was retiring from teaching, though she remained a presence on campus, and returned occasionally to the classroom. One afternoon, as I sat with my own students in what was essentially the anteroom outside Morrison\u2019s office, she walked through the space. I had been making some point about poetry. I had been very confident in the moments just prior to the sighting, then I felt myself grow small, afraid in the way that certain mountains, even from a distance, can make one feel the fear of falling. Once, before a reading on campus by a young black novelist in whom Morrison had taken an interest, the three of us sat on a bench smoking cigarettes. Stupefying awe having already set in, the most I had mustered to say was: \u201cIt\u2019s an honour to meet you.\u201d I sat silently as the two of them chatted, thinking it remarkable that Toni Morrison could do just that \u2013 chat \u2013 so easily, so naturally, like an ordinary mortal. Ten years later, I interviewed her onstage. I cringe recalling how I kept asking her, in each of my questions, to solve our nation\u2019s moral problems, to predict its future, when perhaps what she had wanted to talk about were her characters, her sentences, her ways of capturing the very real voices of her \u2013our \u2013 richly varied people. I didn\u2019t know Toni Morrison. But in another sense \u2013 one everyone who has read and loved her work will recognise \u2013 she and I were intimates. Near the end of my first marriage, I read Jazz, a novel about passion and violence, transcendence and futility. A part of me grew pained and alert when, in the final pages, the narrator admits to the wish to say, openly, \u201cthat I have loved only you, surrendered my whole self reckless to you and nobody else. That I want you to love me back and show it to me.\u201d During the year between the death of my father and the birth of my daughter, I sat in a different marriage, surrendering myself to the layers of feeling and consequence which speak directly to the condition of motherhood in Morrison\u2019s novels. If they had been visible to me before, now they stirred a layer of spirit I hadn\u2019t previously understood myself to possess. The new life dawning in me, ghostly and mysterious, was touched and classified by Morrison\u2019s voice. \u201cI\u2019m here. I lasted,\u201d says Sethe once she has claimed Beloved as her own true daughter returned from the dead. \u201cNow I can look at things again because she\u2019s here to see them too.\u201d Great novels enter us. They reconfigure our sense of who we are and what we feel. They urge a part of ourselves to take flight, to merge with something alive outside of us, the proxy for which is often the novelist herself. In this way, great literature helps us to feel recognised, comprehended, accompanied. In the days after Morrison\u2019s death was announced, I sat down to reread The Bluest Eye. It\u2019s a first novel and yet \u2013 astoundingly \u2013 everything is there. The voices, nimbly alive, don\u2019t just mimic or signal black life, but, rather, invoke and rejoice in it. The clarity and urgency of characters is telegraphed through indelible gestures: three pennies guarded in a child\u2019s shoe, the poor hunched shoulders and tilted head of the girl Pecola, who\u2019s lived her whole short life with an internalised sense of ugly unlovability. The various forms of rage that rise up in the face of lack stand revealed, as do the barbarous social conditions in place to perpetuate such lack \u2013 not just in America but everywhere that difference between people is recognised and leveraged. She was herself even then. What is she now? I find myself asking these days when the reality of her absence remains tenuous. Today, I believe her to be an abiding source of insight and force, coaxing still, from wherever she has gone. Jason Reynolds: \u2018She told those of us who would grow up to become black writers that we were free\u2019 Acclaimed American author of novels and poetry for young adults. His 2016 story Ghost was a National Book Award finalist in the US for young people\u2019s literature I didn\u2019t encounter Toni Morrison\u2019s work until I was in my early 20s. I wasn\u2019t much of a reader as a kid, let alone a reader of something as complex as Toni Morrison\u2019s work, so I came to it a little late. The first book I read was The Bluest Eye, which I found while working in a book store, and I loved it. After that, I read Sula, which is probably my favourite of her novels, but it took me much longer to read Beloved. I felt like I had to grow into it. I would try it over and over and it would fit a little better each time, and eventually it fit perfectly. For me, there is an audacity to her work. She was a maverick and she had an ability to write really complex and painful things in a way that felt boundless. For so long, we had been told how writers were supposed to write \u2013 this is the way it\u2019s supposed to sound, to look, to move \u2013 and she up-ended all those things, in Beloved in particular. I\u2019m thinking of the way she bleeds and conflates time, and the idea of spirit \u2013 how in our tradition, spirit doesn\u2019t necessarily mean something that is gone, but something that is present, that is always there. She really pushed the limits and told those of us who would grow up to become black writers that we were free \u2013 free to write however and whatever we wanted to write. There is only one other person that gave me that same feeling of freedom, and that\u2019s James Baldwin, but Baldwin pretty much kept with the concrete, whereas Morrison bled into the surrealism and the magic \u2013 the magic that makes us who we are. If you are a writer, and specifically a black writer, it feels almost impossible not to be influenced by Toni Morrison. There\u2019s that line in Beloved, one her most quoted sentences, where a character says: \u201cShe is a friend of my mind. She gather me, man.\u201d I think about that sentence all the time. It speaks to her ability to describe a man who is trying to express love. How does he articulate this love with limited language? Actually, that language is not so limited: it becomes expansive because he\u2019s forced to get creative in his explanation. So in trying to describe love, he says, \u201cShe gather me.\u201d None of us could ever come up with that. For a lot of us now, when we\u2019re approaching the page, we don\u2019t have to be afraid of our poetry. We don\u2019t have to be afraid to stretch language. And in being stretched, the language becomes more real. In my own book, Ghost, a young person is trying to describe his anger and he says: \u201cI got so much mad in me.\u201d I don\u2019t get to say that without Toni Morrison \u2013 I don\u2019t get to have the freedom to make the language feel familiar and fantastic at the exact same time. I wish I\u2019d met her. I\u2019ve got a lot of friends who knew her, but unfortunately I was never in a situation to shake her hand and say thank you. Several years back, I was at an event where they were auctioning a first edition, mint condition, signed copy of Beloved. I bid for it and won the bid, and I remember my friends saying: \u201cYou paid way too much money for that.\u201d But I looked at that book last night and thought, man, what a treasure. That\u2019s the closest I\u2019m ever going to come to her. I think she\u2019ll be remembered as someone who loved us \u2013 and loved us enough to scare us. I know that she scared the white establishment, and that made me feel safe. It made us feel bigger. She was unafraid. In a 1993 interview with Charlie Rose, she said: \u201cWhat are you without racism? \u2026 If you can only be tall because somebody is on their knees, then you have a serious problem. And my feeling is that white people have a very, very serious problem and they should start thinking about what they can do about it.\u201d As a kid of 18 or 19 watching that, and even now as a 35-year-old repeating that, I feel emboldened. Toni\u2019s irreverence was godly. Her irreverence felt miraculous. And I think it helped to spark the magic in a lot of us, who had been told over and over again, by every other faction in life, that we were less than and that we deserved invisibility. Bryan Stevenson: \u2018She was fearless. She said you can be black and great. And she never stopped saying that\u2019 Campaigning lawyer and founder of the Equal Justice Initiative, which has overturned the wrongful convictions of 135 prisoners on death row in the American south. Stevenson, 59, chose words by Toni Morrison for the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama, the first official monument to the 4,000 black Americans murdered by lynching The first book of Toni Morrison\u2019s I read was The Bluest Eye, and what amazed me about it was the honesty with which she expressed what it is like to be black in a world that so clearly values whiteness. I was 17 or 18, just heading to college. In the previously segregated school where I grew up in Delaware we were not exposed to black authors. I had to go and find Ralph Ellison\u2019s Invisible Man for myself, for example. I think because Morrison had worked as an editor in publishing she was mindful of an absence of a particular voice in that literature, a way of thinking and a way of talking. Storytelling is such a rich part of the tradition of any child of parents who grew up in the south; you were surrounded by adults who told stories with a particular kind of melody and magic. When my mother and her sisters and the neighbours in our community got talking together it would have that quality to it \u2013 there was nothing more entertaining or engaging than being at the table while these black women spoke to each other and expressed their fears and their sorrows and their joys and their insights. It was a truth-telling space. Toni Morrison brought that voice out into the world. We never met but we had hoped to honour her at our annual dinner for the Equal Justice Initiative in New York next month. When we opened our museum and memorial in Montgomery we had these monuments and sculptures and descriptions of the lynchings, and I felt like we needed something powerful to say to people when they left this really intense experience. I had read a little book Toni Morrison had put out just a couple of years ago of a lecture she had just done at Harvard, \u201cThe Origin of Others\u201d, and there was a quote from Beloved in it that was just so perfect for what we wanted to say. When we approached her for permission she could not have been more supportive and encouraging of us using it there, and was hoping to come to see it for herself. The quote contains an exhortation: \u201cAnd O, my people, out yonder, hear me, they do not love your neck unnoosed and straight. So love your neck... hear me now, love your heart. For this is the prize.\u201d This idea that if you have survived this violence and terror you can\u2019t just run and hide, you are actually going to have to dig deep and love the parts of yourself that other people would exploit and brutalise and injure \u2013 I just thought it was such a powerful way of suggesting how you could recover from that history. She was fearless, always an activist. Even in simply saying \u201cI am a black woman writer\u201d she was rejecting the opportunity to be swallowed up by all of these institutions and spaces that might have wanted to embrace her talent but minimise her race or gender. I think that modelled an identity that has been hugely important for many of us who have been made to think that we have to choose between being a great lawyer and a black lawyer, or a great writer and a black writer. She just rejected that dichotomy. She said you can be black and great. And she never stopped saying that. Right to the end she concerned herself with the day-to-day experience of people; I think what was going on at any moment in the lives of black people always shaped her writing and her vision for what was necessary. At a time when we are engaged in a new struggle over the narrative of our history of bigotry she showed what America can be. I loved her for that; we all did. Kwame Kwei-Armah: \u2018She is magnificent. Her emotional intelligence is second to none\u2019 Artistic director of the Young Vic. In 2017, while Kwei-Armah was artistic director of Center Stage theatre in Baltimore, he directed an adaptation of Morrison\u2019s 1992 novel, Jazz She came into my life in the late 80s when I was given a copy of Beloved. That was the first book of hers I read and in truth I was stunned by it. I didn\u2019t quite know how to negotiate it, in fact. At that point, there was so little literature about slavery and very little literature about people in slavery making huge decisions. From then on, of course, she became the thing, the being that you went to when you wanted absolute truth and poetry. She was an influence in that she affected my ability to not see myself as a minority when it came to writing, to not always centralise my fears around reaction to my work from, as she called it, \u201cthe white gaze\u201d. Also, I felt that while some of her contemporaries placed the black male as the antithesis of goodness or had [their characters] having to negotiate their way to freedom through or over the black male, Toni Morrison treated me \u2013 a black man \u2013 like a mother would, like a sister or a lover. She loved me for my flaws and explained them and the reasons for them to me and that\u2019s why she was my go-to writer. Every time she had a new novel I couldn\u2019t wait to read it because I knew there would be a part of my story that was new to me. My favourite book is Jazz because she\u2019s not writing for the audience. Song of Solomon is similar. Most people I knew had to pick up Jazz three or four times before they got through it, but when you did there\u2019s a complexity to the storytelling. I think I read it maybe six times and then I directed its world premiere on stage. Right at the beginning of the process, she said: \u201cListen, theatre\u2019s not my thing so\u2026 off you go. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d Which was just magnificent for the writer and magnificent for me as the director and producer of it. Later, she sent a beautiful message congratulating us on finding a way to tell our version of her story. When I met her at Princeton, she thanked me personally and I didn\u2019t know what to do with myself. I was with a group of writers who were involved with The Princeton Slavery project, where the university was doing an investigation into it\u2019s links to slavery and asked us to take a moment in that history to write about.

After many months of struggling for its life, Jim Callaghan\u2019s battered minority Labour government faced a confidence vote brought by the Conservative leader, Margaret Thatcher. It was nerve-shreddingly close. The Callaghan government lost by just one vote. Once the tellers for each side had marched up in front of the Speaker and read the result, there was uproar, during which Tories cheered with delight and some Labour leftwingers sang The Red Flag. Callaghan then got up to the dispatch box to make a brief and dignified statement in which he declared \u201cwe shall take our case to the country\u201d at an election that he promised to hold \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. This would be an election that Callaghan had concluded, rightly, that he was going to lose.</p> <p>In strict law, he didn\u2019t have to do that. The requirement that an election must be called by a government that has lost a confidence vote was \u201ca firm convention\u201d rather than solid legislation, as are the understandings that a government won\u2019t unreasonably delay an election and will not do anything contentious once a campaign is under way. When people refer to the British constitution, they are talking about a hotch-potch of such conventions, combined with ancient charters, precedents, international agreements, legislative bolt-ons and unwritten understandings.

I am sure Dom X is not advocating violence of the physical variety, but it does suggest that he might not be averse to inflicting GBH on constitutional norms. This would apparently include Boris Johnson refusing to leave Number 10 even if his government lost a Commons no-confidence vote, and turning himself into the world\u2019s most extraordinary squatter in order to delay polling day until after 31 October. That would make it impossible to stop a crash-out Brexit in the middle of an election campaign, possibly even on election day itself, and even if the country was about to vote for a different outcome.</p> <p>Now it is possible that Dom X has put this out as a piece of misdirection. It could be an elaborate feint from a government composed of many bluffers. Putting this threat into circulation might be intended to convince MPs, especially dissident Tories, that it won\u2019t get them anywhere if they try to prevent a no-deal Brexit by voting to collapse the Johnson government. It could also be part of the scheme to convince European leaders that they can\u2019t rely on the British parliament being able to stop a no-deal Brexit, so they had better offer some concessions if they want to prevent a crash-out that will hurt them as well as Britain.

No one can say with certainty whether it will be merely rough or utterly catastrophic, but even members of this Brexiter-dominated cabinet acknowledge that there will be what they coyly describe as \u201cbumps in the road\u201d. It will be astonishingly dangerous if Britain is driven down this perilous highway by a prime minister installed without reference to the country, who has lost a confidence vote and timed a no-deal Brexit for the middle of an election campaign when senior politicians will be on battle buses, the civil service parked in neutral and the identity of the next government unknown.</p> <p>How could such a hideous mockery of democracy even be possible? Here we must take a deep breath and dive into the murky waters of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act of 2011. That title gives this legislation a patina of solidity that is very misleading. This law, invented during the coalition years as a mechanism to lock the Tories and Lib Dems into their partnership, is full of voids and ambiguities. It is a superb example of an important constitutional change being improvised into existence without thinking through all the potential consequences. If a government loses a confidence vote, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/06/the-fight-over-no-deal-brexit-how-might-the-crisis-pan-out\" title=\"\">the law allows 14 days</a> for either the prime minister to regain a Commons majority or for someone else to assemble one. If no one can, there is then an election, the date of which is to some extent set at the prime minister\u2019s discretion. The law is mute on whether Mr Johnson is entitled to hole himself up at Number 10 during that fortnight and time the election so that Britain will have crashed out of the EU before the people get to vote. Labour has called this \u201can abuse of power\u201d and asked the cabinet secretary to give an opinion. Sir Mark Sedwill is thought to agree that it would be an abuse, but even if he did make that ruling, it is not clear how he could enforce it.</p> <p>John McDonnell has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/07/labour-prefers-election-to-unity-government-to-stop-hard-brexit\" title=\"\">suggested</a> that Jeremy Corbyn will simply oust Mr Johnson by asserting a right to form a Labour government. The shadow chancellor\u2019s cunning plan is to hail a taxi. \u201cI would be sending Jeremy Corbyn in a cab to Buckingham Palace to say \u2018we\u2019re taking over\u2019.\u201d That would be a wasted fare. The Queen\u2019s officials would tell Mr Corbyn that, much as she enjoyed their last chat about his allotment, he only becomes prime minister in these circumstances if he can demonstrate that he commands a majority in the Commons.</p> <p>The other suggestion, on which the Lib Dems are especially keen, is that some as yet unidentified senior MP should take over at the head of a multiparty \u201cletter-writing government\u201d. This would be formed for the sole purpose of asking the EU to delay Brexit until Britain has held an election. The EU would almost certainly grant such a request since it has said that there can be a postponement for \u201ca democratic event\u201d. The trouble with a \u201cletter-writing\u201d government is that putting it together would be like trying to resolve Rubik\u2019s Cube while blindfolded. Before he advised her to appoint a new prime minister, the Queen\u2019s private secretary would want to be utterly confident that the chief letter-writer could command a Commons majority. Labour is insistent that any alternative government must have Mr Corbyn as its leader. There is no conceivable parliamentary majority for installing him at Number 10, even on a temporary basis. There are other things MPs can do if they have the will and the numbers, though none is easy and some would be political dynamite. They could take control of parliament\u2019s agenda in order to declare a revocation of article 50. They could rush through changes to the relevant laws to ensure that an election happened before 31 October.</p> <p>All possible solutions depend on there being sufficient Conservative MPs capable of remembering that Britain\u2019s democratic fabric relies not so much on laws as assumptions that people will behave properly.</p> <p>The word unprecedented is overused, but not in this case. If Britain crashes out of the EU in the middle of an election campaign deliberately delayed by a prime minister with no mandate, it won\u2019t just be the constitution that will be plunged into the darkest crisis of our modern history.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

If a government loses a confidence vote, the law allows 14 days for either the prime minister to regain a Commons majority or for someone else to assemble one. If no one can, there is then an election, the date of which is to some extent set at the prime minister\u2019s discretion. The law is mute on whether Mr Johnson is entitled to hole himself up at Number 10 during that fortnight and time the election so that Britain will have crashed out of the EU before the people get to vote. Labour has called this \u201can abuse of power\u201d and asked the cabinet secretary to give an opinion. Sir Mark Sedwill is thought to agree that it would be an abuse, but even if he did make that ruling, it is not clear how he could enforce it. John McDonnell has suggested that Jeremy Corbyn will simply oust Mr Johnson by asserting a right to form a Labour government. The shadow chancellor\u2019s cunning plan is to hail a taxi. \u201cI would be sending Jeremy Corbyn in a cab to Buckingham Palace to say \u2018we\u2019re taking over\u2019.\u201d That would be a wasted fare. The Queen\u2019s officials would tell Mr Corbyn that, much as she enjoyed their last chat about his allotment, he only becomes prime minister in these circumstances if he can demonstrate that he commands a majority in the Commons. The other suggestion, on which the Lib Dems are especially keen, is that some as yet unidentified senior MP should take over at the head of a multiparty \u201cletter-writing government\u201d. This would be formed for the sole purpose of asking the EU to delay Brexit until Britain has held an election. The EU would almost certainly grant such a request since it has said that there can be a postponement for \u201ca democratic event\u201d. The trouble with a \u201cletter-writing\u201d government is that putting it together would be like trying to resolve Rubik\u2019s Cube while blindfolded. Before he advised her to appoint a new prime minister, the Queen\u2019s private secretary would want to be utterly confident that the chief letter-writer could command a Commons majority. Labour is insistent that any alternative government must have Mr Corbyn as its leader. There is no conceivable parliamentary majority for installing him at Number 10, even on a temporary basis. There are other things MPs can do if they have the will and the numbers, though none is easy and some would be political dynamite. They could take control of parliament\u2019s agenda in order to declare a revocation of article 50. They could rush through changes to the relevant laws to ensure that an election happened before 31 October. All possible solutions depend on there being sufficient Conservative MPs capable of remembering that Britain\u2019s democratic fabric relies not so much on laws as assumptions that people will behave properly. The word unprecedented is overused, but not in this case. If Britain crashes out of the EU in the middle of an election campaign deliberately delayed by a prime minister with no mandate, it won\u2019t just be the constitution that will be plunged into the darkest crisis of our modern history. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",

But those looking for original ingredients to recreate tastes of the past need to be cautious, says Professor Dorian Fuller, an archaeobotanist from University College London. \u201cYeast is everywhere. It\u2019s hard to know if something wasn\u2019t contaminated when it was dug out of the ground, or when it was put on a ship to Boston collecting yeasts along the way. These things haven\u2019t been kept in sterile conditions.\u201d</p> <p>Because human diets have been founded on grains for millennia, beer, bread and porridge are the main focus of attempts to recreate truly ancient foods. \u201cThe latest study that came out in the \u201880s said grain made up about 70% of the daily diet of Romans, although I think that\u2019s a little high,\u201d said Farrell Monaco, an archaeologist specialising Roman culture who has worked in Pompeii and Herculaneum. \u201cAlthough I think that\u2019s a little high, bread and pulses were the two vehicles to get calories into the Roman daily diet.\u201d Pompeii has commercial bakeries on every street corner, she said. \u201cAnd religion as well \u2013 bread was so valuable that you would offer it to the gods.\u201d</p> <p>Monaco uses replicas of <a href=\"https://tavolamediterranea.com/category/italy/\" title=\"\">Roman and Greek kitchen tools</a> to make dishes described by ancient writers such as Columella, Pliny and Cato: fig vinegar, <em>moretum</em> (salads), <em>hypotrimma</em> (a sweet paste) and <em>defrutum</em> (a grape syrup) as well as <em>panis quadratus</em>, a round loaf that has been excavated at many sites around Vesuvius. She believes making ancient food with original techniques is a vital archaeological tool. \u201cTo use your hand, your eyes, nose, tastebuds, to labour over something, to use a handmill to make a loaf of bread, so you understand how much labour and sweat went into making it \u2013 you start to understand how much value it had.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f221a7ab902ea61e855c49caf140b03cdba699a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f221a7ab902ea61e855c49caf140b03cdba699a/0_73_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The 4,500-year-old Egyptian pots Seamus Blackley extracted yeast spores from, for his bread.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 4,500-year-old Egyptian pots Seamus Blackley extracted yeast spores from, for his bread.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @SeamusBlackley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While some food reconstruction focuses on matching ingredients as Blackley has done and some use historical techniques like Monaco, others aim to replicate taste, says Dr Chris Kissane, a food historian. \u201cOur sense of taste has changed considerably as well, even in the last few hundred years,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople in the early modern period used a lot of sugar and things like that to preserve food, so they had a lot more tolerance for sweetness in savoury food.\u201d</p> <p>Examining the evolution of taste brings a barrel-full of other questions with it, he said. Heavily spiced medieval food gave way to potatoes, tomatoes, chilli and peppers from the Americas, while the 18th-century French cuisine revolution led to restaurants across the western world. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to think about food history without thinking about everything else.\u201d</p> <p>Blackley\u2019s samples from inside the pottery are being analysed by Bowman, who is trying to map the yeast genome to compare it with modern strains. \u201cWhat I\u2019m reminded of is mummy wheat,\u201d Fuller said. \u201cIn the 19th century people claimed to get wheat out of ancient Egyptian tombs associated with mummies and therefore to then cultivate it. You can possibly still buy some of these things. But none of them are actually really ancient.

These things haven\u2019t been kept in sterile conditions.\u201d Because human diets have been founded on grains for millennia, beer, bread and porridge are the main focus of attempts to recreate truly ancient foods. \u201cThe latest study that came out in the \u201880s said grain made up about 70% of the daily diet of Romans, although I think that\u2019s a little high,\u201d said Farrell Monaco, an archaeologist specialising Roman culture who has worked in Pompeii and Herculaneum. \u201cAlthough I think that\u2019s a little high, bread and pulses were the two vehicles to get calories into the Roman daily diet.\u201d Pompeii has commercial bakeries on every street corner, she said. \u201cAnd religion as well \u2013 bread was so valuable that you would offer it to the gods.\u201d Monaco uses replicas of Roman and Greek kitchen tools to make dishes described by ancient writers such as Columella, Pliny and Cato: fig vinegar, moretum (salads), hypotrimma (a sweet paste) and defrutum (a grape syrup) as well as panis quadratus, a round loaf that has been excavated at many sites around Vesuvius. She believes making ancient food with original techniques is a vital archaeological tool. \u201cTo use your hand, your eyes, nose, tastebuds, to labour over something, to use a handmill to make a loaf of bread, so you understand how much labour and sweat went into making it \u2013 you start to understand how much value it had.\u201d While some food reconstruction focuses on matching ingredients as Blackley has done and some use historical techniques like Monaco, others aim to replicate taste, says Dr Chris Kissane, a food historian. \u201cOur sense of taste has changed considerably as well, even in the last few hundred years,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople in the early modern period used a lot of sugar and things like that to preserve food, so they had a lot more tolerance for sweetness in savoury food.\u201d Examining the evolution of taste brings a barrel-full of other questions with it, he said. Heavily spiced medieval food gave way to potatoes, tomatoes, chilli and peppers from the Americas, while the 18th-century French cuisine revolution led to restaurants across the western world. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to think about food history without thinking about everything else.\u201d Blackley\u2019s samples from inside the pottery are being analysed by Bowman, who is trying to map the yeast genome to compare it with modern strains. \u201cWhat I\u2019m reminded of is mummy wheat,\u201d Fuller said. \u201cIn the 19th century people claimed to get wheat out of ancient Egyptian tombs associated with mummies and therefore to then cultivate it. You can possibly still buy some of these things. But none of them are actually really ancient. Seeds don\u2019t have that kind of viability.\u201d Pliny the Elder\u2019s leaven or starter dough, from Historia Naturalis, published about AD77-79 Ingredients 2 cups of millet or whole wheat flour 2 cups of grapes (rinsed) 2 cups of tepid water Cheesecloth Step 1 Rinse grapes and tie into a cheesecloth pouch. Smash them in a bowl. Drain, add water, mix in flour and cover the grapes with the mixture. Cover the bowl, leave in a warm place for 1-2 days. Step 2 When the starter is fermenting, bubbles appear. Remove the grape pouch and dispose. Start again if white or black mould has formed. Transfer into a fresh container, and add \u00bd cup flour and \u00bd cup water. Leave for another day. Step 3 Check if a strong-smelling liquid has formed. Stir it back in. Add more flour if the mixture seems wet. Step 4 After 4-5 days, you should see significant growth and bubbles forming. The leaven is ready. Step 5 Store in fridge in an air-tight container. Feed your leaven with flour after use. Adapted by Farrell Monaco: tavolamediterranea.com",

Cath has a bizarrely precise awareness of her age; she knows it down to the last minute.

The actual reason is that she is getting perilously close to the age her mother died \u2013 painfully young \u2013 in the very spot she now finds herself.</p> <p>As she sorts through old possessions in an abandoned air-raid shelter, now owned by another family, Cath is surrounded by memories of the past. She is also haunted by the thought of passing 32, and living a life with an outline no longer defined by the previous generation.</p> <p>At least, that\u2019s what you assume she\u2019s being haunted by, but Steiner\u2019s script is so elliptical you\u2019re lucky if she makes it to the end of a sentence, let alone a coherent thought. The text is all ums, errs and missing nouns, which, in Ed Madden\u2019s attractive production for Walrus theatre, creates a convincing conversational air but makes you wonder if what\u2019s left unsaid has subtextual meaning or is just left unsaid.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0eee828f4e3708f59c775e173fb19a767e9a161a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0eee828f4e3708f59c775e173fb19a767e9a161a/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Haunted \u2026 A Table Tennis Play.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Haunted \u2026 A Table Tennis Play.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a suspicion encouraged by the actors, graduates of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/phoebe-waller-bridge\">Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a> school of facial mannerisms, all big grins followed by puzzled expressions and mumbled replies. Impressively, they give the impression that some big revelation is on the cards, as Cath (Rosa Robson), her boyfriend Callum (Euan Kitson) and new occupant Mia (Beth Holmes) exchange their gnomic half-thoughts.

      "bodyText": "The premise of Sam Steiner\u2019s three-hander is so slight you have to work hard to remember what it is. Cath has a bizarrely precise awareness of her age; she knows it down to the last minute. At first, you assume she is blessed with some freaky mathematical gift, or perhaps suffering from a neurotic compulsion. The actual reason is that she is getting perilously close to the age her mother died \u2013 painfully young \u2013 in the very spot she now finds herself. As she sorts through old possessions in an abandoned air-raid shelter, now owned by another family, Cath is surrounded by memories of the past. She is also haunted by the thought of passing 32, and living a life with an outline no longer defined by the previous generation. At least, that\u2019s what you assume she\u2019s being haunted by, but Steiner\u2019s script is so elliptical you\u2019re lucky if she makes it to the end of a sentence, let alone a coherent thought. The text is all ums, errs and missing nouns, which, in Ed Madden\u2019s attractive production for Walrus theatre, creates a convincing conversational air but makes you wonder if what\u2019s left unsaid has subtextual meaning or is just left unsaid. It\u2019s a suspicion encouraged by the actors, graduates of the Phoebe Waller-Bridge school of facial mannerisms, all big grins followed by puzzled expressions and mumbled replies. Impressively, they give the impression that some big revelation is on the cards, as Cath (Rosa Robson), her boyfriend Callum (Euan Kitson) and new occupant Mia (Beth Holmes) exchange their gnomic half-thoughts. But there is only so much enigmatic conversation one can take before deciding there was probably no enigma in the first place. Even the ping-pong table that dominates the stage fails to generate a good metaphor, though it does lead to the neat idea of having table-tennis balls represent the artefacts of Cath\u2019s past. Several verbal rallies take place as the actors bat the balls back and forth. It\u2019s fun to watch but you wait in vain for the expected observations about competition, defensiveness or collaboration. Spirited enough to keep you interested, the show is too delicate to carry any weight. \u2022 At Underbelly, Cowgate, Edinburgh, until 25 August. \u2022 Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews.",

Other delegates and officials are being housed in grey two-storey demountable buildings along the length of the island\u2019s airport runway, which runs almost the entire length of the island and as the largest plot of land also gets used for football games, drying clothes and for people to sleep on.</p> <p>\u201cTuvalu taking on this task, it\u2019s mammoth \u2013 everything won\u2019t be perfect, but it will be [done] with the warmth and generosity of island people,\u201d Dame Meg Taylor, the general secretary of the PIF, said on Sunday in Funafuti. \u201cI think Tuvalu has been courageous to host this meeting,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The Tuvaluan prime minister, Enele Sopoaga, told Guardian Australia that hosting the conference, which officially begins on Tuesday, was an opportunity the country could not pass up.</p> <p>\u201cThe people of Tuvalu are very, very strong, they are very firm that they want to protect and save their island and their people and their way of life and their resources,\u201d said Sopoaga. \u201cSo they are looking at the forum as an opportunity to showcase their resilience.\u201d</p> <p>Morrison is likely to come under pressure from leaders of Pacific island nations, who have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/28/fiji-pm-decries-australias-climate-change-deniers-in-turnbull-cabinet\">repeatedly criticised Australia</a> for what they see as insufficient action to address the climate crisis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99a1ed082c4e0e9eb31e6e3a914444f1f42fa029\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99a1ed082c4e0e9eb31e6e3a914444f1f42fa029/0_78_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tuvaluan children sing a welcome for Pacific leaders\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tuvaluan children sing a welcome for Pacific leaders at Funafuti airport.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pacific Islands Forum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sopoaga said the Australian prime minister was a welcome guest in his country and he anticipated \u201cpositive and progressive discussions\u201d, but said he had concerns about Australia\u2019s coalmining policy and its use of carryover credits as a means of reducing emissions and said the positive relationship could change if the future of his people was not taken seriously.</p> <p>\u201cI hope we can be more understanding that the people of Tuvalu and small island countries are already submerged, are already going underwater,\u201d Sopoaga said.</p> <p>\u201cIf our friend Australia does not show them any regard, any respect, it is a different thing, we cannot be partner with that thinking.

      "bodyText": "As the leaders of Pacific countries step off their planes at Funafuti airport this week for the Pacific Islands Forum, they are being met by the children of Tuvalu, who sit submerged in water, in a moat built around the model of an island, singing: \u201cSave Tuvalu, save the world.\u201d The welcome sets the tone for a Pacific Islands Forum meeting that will not only have climate change at the top of the agenda \u2013 as it has been for many years \u2013 but is being hosted by a country that the UN says is one of the most vulnerable to rising sea levels, which could render it uninhabitable in the coming century. Apart from the important symbolism, Tuvalu\u2019s hosting of the event presents considerable logistical challenges for the nation, as more than a dozen world leaders and an estimated 600 people will descend upon the country with a population of just 11,000. Tuvalu, which is roughly three hours north of Fiji, is also grappling with an ongoing outbreak of dengue fever, the fact it has no supply of safe fresh water, and the fact that it is designated by the UN as a least-developed country. There are only three commercial flights a week to Tuvalu, so most attendees have had to fly in on chartered military planes and roughly 75% of all the accommodation that is being used for the forum has been constructed for the event. Pacific leaders, including the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, who both arrive on Wednesday, will be staying in bungalows. Other delegates and officials are being housed in grey two-storey demountable buildings along the length of the island\u2019s airport runway, which runs almost the entire length of the island and as the largest plot of land also gets used for football games, drying clothes and for people to sleep on. \u201cTuvalu taking on this task, it\u2019s mammoth \u2013 everything won\u2019t be perfect, but it will be [done] with the warmth and generosity of island people,\u201d Dame Meg Taylor, the general secretary of the PIF, said on Sunday in Funafuti. \u201cI think Tuvalu has been courageous to host this meeting,\u201d she said. The Tuvaluan prime minister, Enele Sopoaga, told Guardian Australia that hosting the conference, which officially begins on Tuesday, was an opportunity the country could not pass up. \u201cThe people of Tuvalu are very, very strong, they are very firm that they want to protect and save their island and their people and their way of life and their resources,\u201d said Sopoaga. \u201cSo they are looking at the forum as an opportunity to showcase their resilience.\u201d Morrison is likely to come under pressure from leaders of Pacific island nations, who have repeatedly criticised Australia for what they see as insufficient action to address the climate crisis. Sopoaga said the Australian prime minister was a welcome guest in his country and he anticipated \u201cpositive and progressive discussions\u201d, but said he had concerns about Australia\u2019s coalmining policy and its use of carryover credits as a means of reducing emissions and said the positive relationship could change if the future of his people was not taken seriously. \u201cI hope we can be more understanding that the people of Tuvalu and small island countries are already submerged, are already going underwater,\u201d Sopoaga said. \u201cIf our friend Australia does not show them any regard, any respect, it is a different thing, we cannot be partner with that thinking. I certainly hope we do not come to that juncture to say we cannot go on talking about partnerships regardless of whether it is [the Australian government\u2019s Pacific] Step-Up or [New Zealand\u2019s Pacific] Reset, while you keep pouring your coal emissions into the atmosphere that is killing my people and drowning my people into the water.\u201d Another key issue that may see Australia on opposing sides to its Pacific neighbours is that of human rights abuses in West Papua. A delegation from West Papua, including the Papuan independence leader Benny Wenda, was due to attend the forum as part of the Vanuatu government\u2019s delegation, but as of Sunday afternoon the West Papuan group had not been able to arrive in Tuvalu, with both Sopoaga and Taylor saying they knew nothing about the delegation\u2019s difficulties in reaching the country. Australia is strongly supportive of Indonesian sovereignty over Papua, while the independence movement has widespread support among several key Pacific island nations \u2013 particularly Melanesian neighbours Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. The forum may also mark a shift in the power balance of the forum. This year will be the first time a Fijian prime minister has attended the summit since the country was suspended in 2009 for refusing to call elections. Though Fiji was reinstated into the forum in 2014, its prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, has never attended, saying in 2010 that he would not attend while Australia and New Zealand were part of the group because they wielded too much influence, telling the ABC: \u201cI don\u2019t think they should be in the forum, they\u2019re not Pacific islanders.\u201d Bainimarama presided over the UN\u2019s leading climate change body in 2017, COP23, and is a high-profile global figure in the fight against global heating and will lend strength to other Pacific leaders such as Sopoaga and the Marshall Islands president, Hilda Heine, who are also key Pacific figures in this debate. China\u2019s battle for influence in the Pacific region is also likely to emerge as a key theme during discussions. Tuvalu is one of a handful of countries in the world \u2013 several of which are located in the Pacific \u2013 that have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, rather than mainland China, which is not a member of PIF but will send a delegation as a dialogue partner. The PIF secretariat will likely be looking to make sure there is not a repeat of last year\u2019s events, when the Chinese delegation walked out of one of the talks during the PIF meeting in Nauru, which also has diplomatic relations with Taiwan. China\u2019s presence in the region also might mean Australia finds itself with far less leverage than it once did, says the Australia-based Pacific analyst Tess Newton Cain. \u201cThis is the first time that I can remember that Australia hasn\u2019t been able to play the money card, and say: \u2018what if we took our aid money away? What if we didn\u2019t pay for that?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cFiji and Vanuatu would say \u2018well do what you like, I\u2019m off to Beijing next week\u2019.\u201d Because of Australia\u2019s potentially reduced leverage in the region and the increasing gulf between Australia and its Pacific neighbours on climate change, the meeting is likely to throw into relief questions about the identity of the Pacific Islands Forum, the region and Australia\u2019s place in it. \u201cFrom what I can see, I don\u2019t see that Morrison has a mandate to give Pacific leaders what they say they want,\u201d said Newton Cain. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t long ago that Australia was saying they wanted to be a leader in this region,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t say that anymore, the question is, do they even want to be on the team, is there even a place for them on the team, not to mention the captain of the team?\u201d",

A pit fire smokes on the stage.

Neil Armfield\u2019s staging reinforces a core feature of both play and novel: our shared humanity. The fire, for instance, represents the focal point both for the Darug camp and for the Thornhill home. Children, indifferent to differences, enjoy the wild pleasures of a mud slide (beware splashes, front row). This presentational emphasis on what unites peoples makes the settlers\u2019 violence against the Darug all the more horrific.</p> <p>Although the violence is stylised (puffs of flour, for example, represent smoking guns), the production is unflinching in its portrayal of the viciousness of some white settlers towards these indigenous people. Former convict Smasher\u2019s gleeful gloating about his torture and mutilation of Darug men and women is terrifyingly delivered by Jeremy Sims (part-explained, but not redeemed, by his accounts of his childhood experiences of violent abuse).</p> <p>Alternative attitudes are expressed by Colin Moody\u2019s terse Thomas Blackwell, \u201cmarried\u201d to a Darug woman, and Georgia Adamson\u2019s vibrant Sal, recognising the Darug are living there, \u201cjust like we was in London\u201d. William is presented, in Nathaniel Dean\u2019s vivid, nuanced performance, as a good man whose desperate need for land to support his family, shaped by his experiences of poverty and oppression in England, leads him to commit an atrocious act.</p> <p>Bovell\u2019s adaptation gives the Darug a voice (which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/02/kate-grenville-interview-why-perfumes-are-making-you-sick\" title=\"\">the novel, for good reasons, does not</a>). The intention is positive but feels only half-realised. Darug characters, by contrast with the settlers, are presented more as types than intricate individuals (nonetheless, powerfully embodied by the performers, including Ningali Lawford Wolf as the narrator, and Major \u201cMoogy\u201d Sumner as Yalamundi). The effect is to make them seem marginalised in their story, as well as on their land.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9996d6835872d6930d6daa6c4ea05599d287f7e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9996d6835872d6930d6daa6c4ea05599d287f7e0/0_0_4789_3627/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Part of the attack on Ihsane Jarfi in 2012, as staged in La Reprise at the Lyceum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"757\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of the attack on Ihsane Jarfi in 2012, as staged in La Reprise at the Lyceum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Also at the Edinburgh festival, <strong><a href=\"https://www.eif.co.uk/whats-on/2019/reprise\" title=\"\">La Reprise: Histoire(s) du th\u00e9\u00e2tre (I)</a></strong>, a co-production with <a href=\"http://international-institute.de/en/about-iipm-2/\" title=\"\">the IIPM</a> \u2013 International Institute of Political Murder \u2013 similarly left me with a sense that a victim of violence had been displaced from his own story. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/09/milo-rau-true-crime-murder-edinburgh\" title=\"\">Ihsane Jarfi, a gay man of Moroccan origin in his early </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/09/milo-rau-true-crime-murder-edinburgh\" title=\"\">30s</a>, was last seen in April 2012 getting into a car outside a disco in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium. His body was discovered a fortnight later. Jarfi had been tortured and left to die by four men.</p> <p>Director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/milo-rau\" title=\"\">Milo Rau</a> developed the concept of using Jarfi\u2019s death as a way to ask what is an actor, and what is the relation between theatre (particularly tragedy) and the real world? The questions are ancient, their treatment modern \u2013 stage action plays alongside filmed segments and live streaming; sometimes, live and pre-recorded action are collaged (raising the question: is what we are watching on the screen forming the back of the stage live or recorded or a mix of the two?).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/09/milo-rau-true-crime-murder-edinburgh\">Making a murder: true-crime stage show recreates a shocking killing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rau and his six actors have assembled their text from documentary sources. Facts are related about unemployment and hardship in Li\u00e8ge. Three amateur actors are \u201cauditioned\u201d: asked to speak to camera and say why they want to act in the play, they describe their personal struggles. This section is wittily done. Actors, ever-present to view, slip in and out of roles: as Jarfi\u2019s parents, lawyer, boyfriend. They communicate testimonies, including from at least one of the killers (whose experiences of disadvantage and hardship mirror those of one of the actors).</p> <p>Of Jarfi himself we see little: he kisses his boyfriend, smiles, leaves the disco, talks to the men and climbs into the fateful car. The production seems to lose focus. In one long scene (played inside a real, onstage VW Polo, filmed by a cameraman and projected in closeup), we see Jarfi repeatedly punched, see his bloodied face, see him pulled from the car, kicked, stripped, pissed on. Much of this follows the scenario later <a href=\"https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2014/12/23/four_convicted_inhomophobicmurder-1-2190952/\" title=\"\">described by the homophobic killers</a>.

His Desdemona is Uta Hagen (Emma Paetz), later to become a renowned acting teacher. Their British director, Margaret Webster (Pandora Colin), despairs at the woodenness of Robeson\u2019s acting; Hagen tries to help him achieve authenticity, through lessons and mutually adulterous love.</p> <p>In a distorted echo of Shakespeare\u2019s plot, Hagen\u2019s jealous husband, Jos\u00e9 Ferrer (Ben Cura), plays Iago. His opportunity to be revenged on Robeson comes when he testifies at the McCarthy hearings (also damaging Webster).

The fire, for instance, represents the focal point both for the Darug camp and for the Thornhill home. Children, indifferent to differences, enjoy the wild pleasures of a mud slide (beware splashes, front row). This presentational emphasis on what unites peoples makes the settlers\u2019 violence against the Darug all the more horrific. Although the violence is stylised (puffs of flour, for example, represent smoking guns), the production is unflinching in its portrayal of the viciousness of some white settlers towards these indigenous people. Former convict Smasher\u2019s gleeful gloating about his torture and mutilation of Darug men and women is terrifyingly delivered by Jeremy Sims (part-explained, but not redeemed, by his accounts of his childhood experiences of violent abuse). Alternative attitudes are expressed by Colin Moody\u2019s terse Thomas Blackwell, \u201cmarried\u201d to a Darug woman, and Georgia Adamson\u2019s vibrant Sal, recognising the Darug are living there, \u201cjust like we was in London\u201d. William is presented, in Nathaniel Dean\u2019s vivid, nuanced performance, as a good man whose desperate need for land to support his family, shaped by his experiences of poverty and oppression in England, leads him to commit an atrocious act. Bovell\u2019s adaptation gives the Darug a voice (which the novel, for good reasons, does not). The intention is positive but feels only half-realised. Darug characters, by contrast with the settlers, are presented more as types than intricate individuals (nonetheless, powerfully embodied by the performers, including Ningali Lawford Wolf as the narrator, and Major \u201cMoogy\u201d Sumner as Yalamundi). The effect is to make them seem marginalised in their story, as well as on their land. Also at the Edinburgh festival, La Reprise: Histoire(s) du th\u00e9\u00e2tre (I), a co-production with the IIPM \u2013 International Institute of Political Murder \u2013 similarly left me with a sense that a victim of violence had been displaced from his own story. Ihsane Jarfi, a gay man of Moroccan origin in his early 30s, was last seen in April 2012 getting into a car outside a disco in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium. His body was discovered a fortnight later. Jarfi had been tortured and left to die by four men. Director Milo Rau developed the concept of using Jarfi\u2019s death as a way to ask what is an actor, and what is the relation between theatre (particularly tragedy) and the real world? The questions are ancient, their treatment modern \u2013 stage action plays alongside filmed segments and live streaming; sometimes, live and pre-recorded action are collaged (raising the question: is what we are watching on the screen forming the back of the stage live or recorded or a mix of the two?). Rau and his six actors have assembled their text from documentary sources. Facts are related about unemployment and hardship in Li\u00e8ge. Three amateur actors are \u201cauditioned\u201d: asked to speak to camera and say why they want to act in the play, they describe their personal struggles. This section is wittily done. Actors, ever-present to view, slip in and out of roles: as Jarfi\u2019s parents, lawyer, boyfriend. They communicate testimonies, including from at least one of the killers (whose experiences of disadvantage and hardship mirror those of one of the actors). Of Jarfi himself we see little: he kisses his boyfriend, smiles, leaves the disco, talks to the men and climbs into the fateful car. The production seems to lose focus. In one long scene (played inside a real, onstage VW Polo, filmed by a cameraman and projected in closeup), we see Jarfi repeatedly punched, see his bloodied face, see him pulled from the car, kicked, stripped, pissed on. Much of this follows the scenario later described by the homophobic killers. Before our eyes, Jarfi becomes what they make him \u2013 a bloodied, broken victim. While I admired the intentions behind the performance and the powerful acting, I felt that, ultimately, the production denied Jarfi his voice. Nicholas Wright\u2019s 8 Hotels offers a very different exploration of theatre in its political and social context via the lives of actual people now dead. The action opens in 1943. Actor, singer and political activist Paul Robeson (Tory Kittles) is playing the lead in a production of Othello touring a United States still highly intolerant of racial integration. His Desdemona is Uta Hagen (Emma Paetz), later to become a renowned acting teacher. Their British director, Margaret Webster (Pandora Colin), despairs at the woodenness of Robeson\u2019s acting; Hagen tries to help him achieve authenticity, through lessons and mutually adulterous love. In a distorted echo of Shakespeare\u2019s plot, Hagen\u2019s jealous husband, Jos\u00e9 Ferrer (Ben Cura), plays Iago. His opportunity to be revenged on Robeson comes when he testifies at the McCarthy hearings (also damaging Webster). His career ruined, Robeson\u2019s love of Russia remains publicly unshakable (\u201cAin\u2019t no Jim Crow in the USSR\u201d), even though this means concealing what he knows of the Soviet regime and self-destructively betraying his own sense of goodness. This series of passionate, funny, wry encounters in hotel rooms over the years raises a key question: what does it mean to be authentic, in love and in politics, as well as in art? Under Richard Eyre\u2019s skilled direction, the cast offers a partial answer: excellent performances deliver convincingly authentic characters; Kittles, in particular, by not imitating Robeson, gives \u201cPaul\u201d complex life.

      "bodyText": "A fascinating fusion of documentary, poetry and theatre, Stones Have Laws is the result of a collaboration between artists Van Brummelen &amp; De Haan, co-director Tolin Erwin Alexander and the Maroon community of the former Dutch colony of Suriname, South America. Through haunting songs, oral histories and enacted scenes, the film explores the legacy of slavery, and the ritual and folk stories attached to lives lived by the rhythm and law of the forest. It\u2019s languid, immersive and hypnotic. Long periods of silence, punctuated by the metallic rattle of insects, allow the audience to soak in the atmosphere. But once these seemingly timeless cadences have started to weave their spell, the film-makers reveal just how precariously balanced life is on a land that is plundered by the multinational corporations laying claim to it.",

In recent years, Christopher Wheeldon (particularly with 2011\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/mar/06/alice-adventures-wonderland-review\" title=\"\">Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland</a></em>) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/may/07/alexei-ratmansky-shostakovich-trilogy-sadlers-wells-choreographer-san-francisco-ballet\" title=\"\">Alexei Ratmansky</a> (see below) have begun to find new themes that resonate. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/15/modern-masters-english-national-ballet-vincent-dance-theatre-review\" title=\"\">John Neumeier</a> keeps flying the torch in works that are popular on the continent.

A blazing interpretation of the story, it also feels as if it has the potential to become a modern classic.</p> <p>Pickett, formerly a dancer with William Forsythe\u2019s Ballett Frankfurt, also performed with the <a href=\"http://thewoostergroup.org/blog/\" title=\"\">Wooster Group</a>, and those radical antecedents are clearly visible in the expressionistic, theatrical style of her deeply individual choreography, full of expressive arms and fine details. She cleverly decides to start the action of her <em>Crucible</em> in the background events Miller only hints at: the sexual awakening of Abigail, John Proctor\u2019s maid, and their subsequent affair. Constance Devernay is beguiling as Abigail, moving from playing with dolls to the extended lines of sexual longing, her hands flicking out in movements of desire and self-realisation.</p> <p>Pickett also finds a vocabulary for the character of Proctor\u2019s wife, Elizabeth (lovely <a href=\"https://www.scottishballet.co.uk/profile/araminta-wraith\" title=\"\">Araminta Wraith</a>), her hunched shoulders and crossed arms indicative of repression and grief; her later softening a sign of reconciliation. When Elizabeth discovers John and Abigail together, it\u2019s like a lightning bolt, triggering the rejection that will tear the puritanical community apart, leading to tragedy and death.</p> <p>Lust, love, desire \u2013 these are all perfect subjects to express through dance, and they provide a brilliant frame and contrast for the group hysteria of the subsequent witch trials. If the ballet struggles fully to explain the crisis of conscience that sends Proctor (danced with searing intensity and soaring tormented jumps by <a href=\"https://www.scottishballet.co.uk/profile/nicholas-shoesmith\" title=\"\">Nicholas Shoesmith</a>) to his doom, it has already gripped so strongly by that point that it can be forgiven.</p> <p>Pickett is also superb at sending groups of dancers around the stage, creating her effects with great waves of movement \u2013 skittering steps on point for the teenage accusers; prim hands pushed up in prayer for the righteous; strong, sharp jumps for the dark-suited judges; terrified convulsions for upright citizens wrongly condemned. It\u2019s all brilliantly realised by the company, and supported by a shattering score by the aptly named <a href=\"http://petersalem.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Peter Salem</a>. With great skill he matches sound to action: a great clatter of drums for Proctor\u2019s unleashed passion; a whomp of violins for the wild and whirring Walpurgis night dances in the woods; screeches of strings as people meet their fate.</p> <p>Designed (by Emma Kingsbury and David Finn) in dark hues, leavened by soft, forest pastels, and danced in shadowy patches (Finn again) with a cross of light falling across the stage, <em>The Crucible</em> feels like a keeper.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX7v1JsXf5s\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aX7v1JsXf5s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX7v1JsXf5s\">Watch a trailer for Scottish Opera\u2019s The Crucible.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong><a href=\" https://www.roh.org.uk/productions/the-bright-stream-by-bolshoi-ballet\" title=\"\">The Bright Stream</a></strong>, choreographed in 2003 by Alexei Ratmansky, is already a rare and precious thing:<a href=\"https://www.bolshoi.ru/en/performances/61/libretto/\" title=\"\"> a narrative ballet </a>that actually makes you laugh out loud.

It consists of nothing but a sheet of white cloth, folded and unfolded in unceasing permutations. This occurs in near total darkness, the sheet appearing to transform itself as if by magic. Occasionally the screen splits, so that this beautiful origami doubles and redoubles, and sometimes a pair of hands becomes modestly visible. But that is all there is.

The experience slows everything down, a small mercy in the rush and thrum of Tate Modern; after a while, it doesn\u2019t seem to matter if there is a meaning or method.</p> <p>D\u00f3ra Maurer was born in Budapest in 1937. She works in almost every medium, from film and photography to painting, performance and sculpture. Her career began under communism, when the Hungarian government classified artworks as \u201csupported\u201d, \u201ctolerated\u201d or outright \u201cprohibited\u201d. Shows were shut down, artists threatened, art galleries suppressed. Maurer has said that her work is not overtly political, but it is very clearly a discreet form of defiance in its sheer experimentalism: worlds away from the regime\u2019s preference for social realism and sentimental schlock.</p> <p><em>What Can One Do </em><em>With a Paving Stone</em>, for instance, plays with gentle irony on the students\u2019 ready weapon in the May 68 uprisings in Paris. Maurer is seen cradling, dragging, kissing and eventually hiding her stone in a harvest field somewhere in rural Hungary. It is 1971, and the performance feels necessarily secret, documented here in black-and-white photographs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9f1774594f03a264bf616b85238a4822bae7b9d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f1774594f03a264bf616b85238a4822bae7b9d4/0_0_3956_5512/718.jpg\" alt=\"D\u00f3ra Maurer\u2019s Space Painting (1984\u201396).\" width=\"718\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Rich and original\u2019: D\u00f3ra Maurer\u2019s Space Painting, 1984\u201396.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 D\u00f3ra Maurer/Vintage Gal\u00e9ria/Andr\u00e1s Bozs\u00f3</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Likewise, she runs along the balcony of a block of flats in Budapest photographing another artist who is doing exactly the same thing, at the same time, on the opposite balcony. Dark and fugitive figures, they appear hauntingly human in the brutal cityscape.</p> <p>Maurer might simply show a pair of hands going through various motions \u2013 pointing, signalling, flexing, subsiding in open-palmed fatigue. The modesty of the means contrasts with the rhetorical force of the actions, as if to suggest that even one person\u2019s gestures might make a difference.</p> <p>There was no market to speak of behind the iron curtain, for most of Maurer\u2019s career, and thus no incentive to make expensive objects. But something in the spareness of her means speaks of the artist\u2019s characteristic defiance. She used coils of old wire to make prints, pressing the paper down on the sharp and rusting metal, then shifting the ring so that the image evolved into gorgeous spirals. She filmed the shifting shadows contained in a cup. She even took the printing plate and folded it over and again, printing the effects in spectral grey ink so that it seems like a ghost of itself.</p> <p>There is humour to her art, especially in the 70s, when Maurer was teaching to make a living, and working alongside other underground artists. Especially charming is <em>Reversible and Changeable Phases of Movements </em><em>No 3</em> from 1972, which could almost be a parody of the solemn conceptualism of the American and western European art scene of that time. Maurer photographed a man sitting on a chair, rising, standing, sitting, standing, mid-air and so on, in different sequences, until the seat is suddenly empty, the performer abruptly departed. He is depicted from behind, all the variations marked alongside like an algebraic sequence: the absurd mathematical relationship of a bottom and a chair.</p> <p>Not all of the work is so compelling. The more she proceeds by systems, the drier the work tends to be. A number of mirrors are divided into ever smaller slices and hung from the ceiling to disrupt our vision of reality; except that they only draw attention to themselves. Folding, adjusting or slightly rearranging lines, twigs or blocks of colour according to numbers may be exactingly minimal but the pleasures are slender, in every respect.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff4e6fb9b56537ec835b6512b39dfc773ee61193\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff4e6fb9b56537ec835b6512b39dfc773ee61193/0_0_3504_2460/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Overlappings 38, 2007 by D\u00f3ra Maurer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"702\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018All elation and freedom\u2019: Overlappings 38, 2007 by D\u00f3ra Maurer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 D\u00f3ra Maurer Photography \u00a9 Vintage Gal\u00e9ria / Andr\u00e1s Bozs\u00f3</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But in the 80s, Maurer began to make what she calls her <em>Space </em><em>Paintings</em>, and these are both rich and original. Planes of colour speed and shift along the walls, high-chrome skeins and grids shiver into the illusion of three dimensions, and sometimes it even looks as if the painting has been created on a curving surface.</p> <p>Most winning of all, in this show, is one of the works from her <em>Overlappings</em> series: 38, to be laconically precise, from 2007. Blue, yellow and green (or is it just blue and yellow, making green? \u2013 that\u2019s the riddle), these fabulously undulating forms appear to flutter down the wall like sheets of paper dropped from a window and slowly descending on a summer\u2019s breeze. The sight is all elation and freedom. Made in Hungary, but happening \u2013 as it seems \u2013 right here and right now, on the wall before you.</p> <p>\u25cf At <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/dora-maurer\" title=\"\">Tate Modern</a>, London, until 5 July 2020</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq_4zibt4a4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fq_4zibt4a4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq_4zibt4a4\">Watch a trailer for D\u00f3ra Maurer at Tate Modern.</a></figcaption> </figure>",

Dark and fugitive figures, they appear hauntingly human in the brutal cityscape. Maurer might simply show a pair of hands going through various motions \u2013 pointing, signalling, flexing, subsiding in open-palmed fatigue. The modesty of the means contrasts with the rhetorical force of the actions, as if to suggest that even one person\u2019s gestures might make a difference. There was no market to speak of behind the iron curtain, for most of Maurer\u2019s career, and thus no incentive to make expensive objects. But something in the spareness of her means speaks of the artist\u2019s characteristic defiance. She used coils of old wire to make prints, pressing the paper down on the sharp and rusting metal, then shifting the ring so that the image evolved into gorgeous spirals. She filmed the shifting shadows contained in a cup. She even took the printing plate and folded it over and again, printing the effects in spectral grey ink so that it seems like a ghost of itself. There is humour to her art, especially in the 70s, when Maurer was teaching to make a living, and working alongside other underground artists. Especially charming is Reversible and Changeable Phases of Movements No 3 from 1972, which could almost be a parody of the solemn conceptualism of the American and western European art scene of that time. Maurer photographed a man sitting on a chair, rising, standing, sitting, standing, mid-air and so on, in different sequences, until the seat is suddenly empty, the performer abruptly departed. He is depicted from behind, all the variations marked alongside like an algebraic sequence: the absurd mathematical relationship of a bottom and a chair. Not all of the work is so compelling. The more she proceeds by systems, the drier the work tends to be. A number of mirrors are divided into ever smaller slices and hung from the ceiling to disrupt our vision of reality; except that they only draw attention to themselves. Folding, adjusting or slightly rearranging lines, twigs or blocks of colour according to numbers may be exactingly minimal but the pleasures are slender, in every respect. But in the 80s, Maurer began to make what she calls her Space Paintings, and these are both rich and original. Planes of colour speed and shift along the walls, high-chrome skeins and grids shiver into the illusion of three dimensions, and sometimes it even looks as if the painting has been created on a curving surface. Most winning of all, in this show, is one of the works from her Overlappings series: 38, to be laconically precise, from 2007. Blue, yellow and green (or is it just blue and yellow, making green? \u2013 that\u2019s the riddle), these fabulously undulating forms appear to flutter down the wall like sheets of paper dropped from a window and slowly descending on a summer\u2019s breeze. The sight is all elation and freedom. Made in Hungary, but happening \u2013 as it seems \u2013 right here and right now, on the wall before you. \u25cf At Tate Modern, London, until 5 July 2020",

      "body": "<p>At Grace\u2019s school, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re the coolest girl in the class or the quietest, when you get up to go to the toilet, you take your Juul. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re 11 or 16, like Grace was when she first started smoking the sleek black electronic cigarette. Depending on your gender, you\u2019ll tuck the USB-like device into your pocket or your bra, knowingly risking suspension for a hit of mango- flavoured nicotine. Last year, Grace\u2019s school implemented a new policy: if two kids go to the toilet at the same time, they\u2019re automatically assumed to be Juuling.</p> <p>\u201cIt does impact people in school,\u201d says Grace, now 17, who, like all the teenagers in this piece, has had her name changed to protect her identity. Grace is originally from England but attends a private school in Switzerland. \u201cYou\u2019ve got kids getting up every five minutes to go to the bathroom because you can\u2019t focus without a hit.\u201d</p> <p>Like most kids in her school, Grace didn\u2019t smoke cigarettes before she began vaping Juul. The e-cigarette was developed by two American former smokers, Adam Bowen and James Monsees, in 2015. \u201cJuul was created to be a satisfying alternative to cigarettes,\u201d reads the company website, which calls the product \u201cunlike any e-cigarette or vape\u201d. Sales seem to support claims \u2013 just four years after it was founded, Juul Labs is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/20/juul-e-cigarette-marlboro-company-buys-stak\" title=\"\">valued at $38</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/20/juul-e-cigarette-marlboro-company-buys-stak\" title=\"\">bn</a> and has a 70% share of the US e-cigarette market. There\u2019s just one problem: Grace, and kids like her.</p> <p>You must be 18 or over to purchase vaping products in the United States, the United Kingdom and most of Europe, but that hasn\u2019t prevented what the US Surgeon General last year called a \u201cteen vaping epidemic\u201d. In February 2019, America\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/youth_data/tobacco_use/index.htm\" title=\"\">4.9m teens</a> in the country used e-cigarettes. In July, Juul\u2019s CEO Kevin Burns apologised to parents for the first time. \u201cI\u2019m sorry their child is using the product,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not intended for them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fab226af6e0356bab562ae9bed7a3e6087b2553b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fab226af6e0356bab562ae9bed7a3e6087b2553b/0_892_3564_2138/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It\u2019s clean, it\u2019s satisfying\u2019: but by law you must be over 18 to buy it: Juul.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s clean, it\u2019s satisfying\u2019: but by law you must be over 18 to buy it: Juul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elizabeth Renstrom/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Grace and her classmates (who are mostly English, though some are American) think Juul was intended for them. \u201cIt\u2019s just too convenient,\u201d the teenager says. \u201cOther brands of vapes are like huge, billowing smoke \u2013 you can\u2019t hide that.\u201d There are now a number of e-cigarettes and vape pens on the market, from those with bulky, refillable tanks like <a href=\"https://www.theelectroniccigarette.co.uk/e-cigarette-brands/guest-e-cigarette-brands/aspire-e-cigarettes.html\" title=\"\">Aspire</a>, to the thin black e-cigarette <a href=\"https://www.blu.com/en/GB/\" title=\"\">Blu</a>. Yet Juul captured teen imagination \u2013 Grace says its discreet size means it is easily kept out of sight. \u201cSo I do think they knew what they were doing.\u201d</p> <p>An American spokesperson denies Juul was ever intended for teenagers and says the product \u201cwas designed and developed exclusively with the adult smoker in mind,\u201d adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone who doesn\u2019t smoke or already uses nicotine to use Juul products.\u201d The reason the product is so sleek and small, they say, is to make the experience of switching from cigarettes \u201cas simple, clean and satisfying\u201d as possible.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m sorry their child is using the product. It\u2019s not intended for them</p> <footer> <cite>Kevin Burns, Juul CEO</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve created a product with no buttons or switches, no cleaning or messy juice replacement, as seen in most other vapes with open systems. It\u2019s clean, freeing the adult smoker from smoke, ash and odour that they would usually get from a combustible cigarettes, and most importantly it\u2019s satisfying, using regulated temperature controls, nicotine salts and varying strengths to meet the needs of cigarette smokers looking to switch.\u201d</p> <p>When Juul launched its first marketing campaigns in 2015, the models in its brightly coloured posters looked young, fresh and cool. America\u2019s Food and Drug Administration is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/health/fda-e-cigarettes-minors-juul.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">currently investigating</a> whether the company deliberately marketed its products towards young people, something Juul denies. After its UK launch in summer 2018, the brand has steered away from a youth-oriented image. All of the models in Juul ads are now over 30 and users of the product, and the company\u2019s upcoming UK billboards will be 200m away from any schools. Juul UK\u2019s managing director, Dan Thomson, emphasises that this is double the official guidance of 100m.</p> <p>It\u2019s an encouraging act of self-regulation, but it comes at a time when Juul is facing unprecedented pressure. In June, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/25/san-francisco-e-cigarettes-vaping-juul-ban\" title=\"\">San Francisco became the first US city to ban the sale of e-cigarettes</a>, despite the fact that Juul owns a 29-storey skyscraper in the city. In the UK, EU regulations mean that Juul\u2019s flavour capsules, known as pods, contain only 1.7% nicotine, roughly a third of the amount in the US. With bad press, bans and binding regulations, will Juul remain a vaping giant, or will its success disappear in a puff of smoke?</p> <p>\u201cWe are switching people in very significant numbers away from combustible cigarettes,\u201d says Thomson, who has worked with the brand for just over a year. When Juul debuted in the UK last July, its products were available in just a few hundred vape stores. They are now sold in nearly 10,000 outlets. Many Britons, who had been ordering Juul from abroad, were excited that the product was finally available at an affordable price at home. On social media, customers declared it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RISE0FSKYWALKER/status/1137325264550158336\" title=\"\">\u201ca dream come true\u201d</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Joshcastle01/status/1082761888478515202\" title=\"\">\u201camazing\u201d</a> when, in November 2018, the company struck a major deal with Sainsbury\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cWe are still relatively small in this marketplace,\u201d Thomson says. \u201cThere are still millions of smokers out there who are going to have very negative health outcomes if they do not either quit completely \u2013 which is what we would recommend \u2013 or find an alternative to switch to. In a careful and thoughtful way, and in a way that ensures the product does not get into the wrong hands, we want to continue to expand.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a89f0a9c4bbd37f4c4ff3a23299c251dffd40caa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a89f0a9c4bbd37f4c4ff3a23299c251dffd40caa/0_0_7765_10328/752.jpg\" alt=\"Cloud nine: nicotine salts in Juul provide what cigarette smokers need.\" width=\"752\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cloud nine: nicotine salts in Juul provide what cigarette smokers need.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Telfer/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vaping is a far healthier alternative to smoking \u2013 if you already smoke. In 2015, <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/733022/Ecigarettes_an_evidence_update_A_report_commissioned_by_Public_Health_England_FINAL.pdf\" title=\"\">Public Health England found</a> that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than their combustible counterparts; <a href=\"https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/awareness-and-prevention/e-cigarette-hub-information-for-health-professionals/safety\" title=\"\">there is none of the smoke, tar</a><a href=\"https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/awareness-and-prevention/e-cigarette-hub-information-for-health-professionals/safety\" title=\"\"> or carbon monoxide</a> that make cigarettes so dangerous.</p> <p>\u201cThere is widespread academic and clinical consensus that while not without risk, vaping is far less harmful than smoking,\u201d says Professor John Newton, director of health improvement at Public Health England. \u201cThere is no situation where it would be better for your health to continue smoking rather than switching completely to vaping. The sooner you stop smoking completely the better.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Juul pods do, obviously, contain nicotine, and while the substance itself isn\u2019t cancer-causing, it is addictive. Grace didn\u2019t smoke before picking up Juul, meaning she was introduced to nicotine for the first time because of the product. Newton says that in the UK, regular e-cigarette use among young people \u201cremains low\u201d, but in America, worries abound about the 20% of high-schoolers who vape.</p> <p>\u201cThere are concerns about exposure to nicotine at an early stage of life,\u201d says Maciej Goniewicz, a scientist at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in New York. Last year, Goniewicz and his colleagues published a study that found that <a href=\"https://www.roswellpark.org/media/news/adolescent-users-juul-other-e-cigarette-pods-exposed-nearly-much-nicotine-smokers-study\" title=\"\">adolescents who use Juul are exposed to nearly as much nicotine as traditional smokers</a>, owing to the product\u2019s use of nicotine salts. \u201cYoung people who never smoked are getting this highly effective nicotine-delivery product, and they might get addicted,\u201d Goniewicz says. He also emphasises that we don\u2019t yet know the long-term effects of e-cigarettes. \u201cEven though there is a consensus that e-cigarettes are less risky than tobacco cigarettes, we still see evidence that there is some respiratory cardiovascular risk associated with vaping,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In 2015, <a href=\"https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1510185\" title=\"\">researchers found that some e-cigarette flavours contain a chemical, diacetyl,</a> which has been linked to \u201cpopcorn lung\u201d, a disease characterised by irreversibly inflamed airways. Juul does not use diacetyl as an ingredient, but many teens like Grace use off-brand vape juice in their Juuls because it\u2019s cheaper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e4868edb8e6c951784cdaffa2acc73a87846f87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e4868edb8e6c951784cdaffa2acc73a87846f87/0_982_3485_2091/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peer pressure: \u2018My friends would be harassed to try it\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peer pressure: \u2018My friends would be harassed to try it\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elizabeth Renstrom/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYeaaaah,\u201d Grace muses when asked if she\u2019s concerned about the effect vaping will have on her health. \u201cBut, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s difficult, because obviously I don\u2019t want to have health problems in the future. But I know that it\u2019s a possibility. And if that does happen, if I end up with a lung condition, which is definitely possible, it\u2019s my own fault.\u201d</p> <p>A straight-A student interested in extracurricular activities and charity work, Grace understands the risks of vaping. So why does she do it anyway, and how did Juuling get so cool? Over the past year, Grace has supervised school dances for younger kids. At one event for 11 to 13-year-olds, one of her key duties was to stop children vaping in the loos. \u201cObviously the flavours make it appealing,\u201d says Grace, who spends roughly \u00a324 a week on Juul pods. Pods come in sweet flavours like creme, mint and cucumber. Grace\u2019s favourite used to be mango (\u201cLike, traditional,\u201d she says), but she now buys knock-off flavours including strawberry, watermelon and pineapple.</p> <p>In response to criticism about youth uptake, Juul stopped selling sweet and fruit-flavoured pods in US high-street shops in November 2018 (the flavours are still available online, where customers must be over 21 and verify their age by submitting ID). Yet in the UK, mango and mint-flavoured pods are still available nationwide.</p> <p>\u201cI know there has been some talk of flavours. We only have six flavours in the UK,\u201d says Thomson. \u201cWe are very conservative in the flavour choices. We are very conservative in the flavour name descriptions that we have.\u201d</p> <p>Of course it\u2019s not just flavours that make Juul appealing to teens, especially once they\u2019re already addicted. \u201cIt is not about the flavours. I can\u2019t stress that enough,\u201d says Andy, a 17-year-old high school student and former vape dealer from Atlanta. \u201cThey are trying to ban mango and all of that. That does not matter, we will just buy the next flavour\u2026 When they run out of their favourite flavour, all of a sudden the one that they hated is looking pretty good to them because they are addicted.\u201d</p> <p>Andy began Juuling when he was 15 and, like Grace, attributes his addiction to good old-fashioned peer pressure. \u201cI had a friend who didn\u2019t do it, but my friends would just about harass them to try it,\u201d he says. Both Grace and Andy say Juuling provides stress relief, especially before exams. As he is 6ft 7in and looks mature, Andy was able to buy Juul pods from local shops and sell them on to his classmates. \u201cEvery day after school I would have 20 or 30 people meeting me at my truck for pods,\u201d he says, estimating that he made nearly $4,000 in a year.</p> <p>Another reason teens became hooked on these pods, experts argue, is because of Juul\u2019s social media presence. Last year, Juul shut down its Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat accounts, and promised to use its Twitter for \u201cnon-promotional communications only\u201d. Yet many feared it was too late: teens had already set up their own Juul-based accounts, sharing tricks, memes and jokes, ensuring that Juuling remained a somewhat ironic, but nonetheless addictive, hobby.</p> <p>\u201cYou get a buzz off it, definitely\u2026 But it is also just like a fun thing to do. You\u2019ve got like your tricks and stuff,\u201d explains Grace.</p> <p>Jon-Patrick Allem is a professor of preventive medicine at Keck School of Medicine in California who has researched the impact of Juul\u2019s Twitter account. In a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325955349_Characterizing_JUUL-related_posts_on_Twitter\" title=\"\">2018 study</a>, Allem found that 3.6% of all Juul-related posts on Twitter mentioned \u201cschool\u201d, while only 0.29% mentioned \u201cquitting smoking\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(18)30358-6/abstract\" title=\"\">In a later study</a>, he discovered that even teens who don\u2019t follow the brand are frequently tagged into posts by their peers.</p> <p>\u201cTeens who are not necessarily signing up to follow Juul and Juul-related media are exposed to it on the social media platform,\u201d Allem says. \u201cIn our research and in the literature in general, we know that young people who are exposed to tobacco marketing, nicotine marketing, it raises awareness of the brand, and it changes susceptibility to use such products\u2026 Moving forward, the more Juul can do to remove their content from platforms that are popular among young people, the better.\u201d</p> <p>And yet as quickly as it rose to power, Juul\u2019s popularity is already declining among American teens. In May 2018, the <em>New Yorker</em> <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/14/the-promise-of-vaping-and-the-rise-of-juul\" title=\"\">chronicled</a> \u201cthe promise of vaping and the rise of Juul\u201d, but by November, they released a declaratively titled follow-up, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/goodbye-to-juul-season\" title=\"\">\u201cGoodbye to Juul season\u201d</a>. Meme-based Juul Instagram accounts were disappearing rapidly, the story announced, and teens suggested the trend was disappearing. Andy has already cut down on his personal use, and no longer sells pods.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You get a buzz off it, definitely\u2026 But it is also just like a fun thing to do</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI personally do not like Juul any more. I do not like the whole company,\u201d says Andy. \u201cI don\u2019t like what it has done to me.\u201d He does athletics and believes his race times would be better if he had never Juuled. When asked how Juuling has affected classmates, he says: \u201cThey are after pods like fools.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>In the UK,</strong></em> teens haven\u2019t fallen in love with Juul to the same extent as their US contemporaries. In 2019, Public Health England reported that only <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vaping-in-england-an-evidence-update-february-2019/vaping-in-england-evidence-update-summary-february-2019\" title=\"\">1.7% of 11 to 18-year-olds in Britain vape weekly</a> \u2013 although experimentation is increasing, and Juul has only been available in the country for a year.</p> <p>\u201cAs we launched the business in the UK, front and centre of our strategy was ensuring that we did not replicate some of the earlier issues that we saw in the US,\u201d Thomson says. Juul\u2019s strict measures in the UK include a \u201cChallenge 25\u201d policy in all retail stores; no UK social media accounts; underage mystery shoppers; sanctions against stockists who don\u2019t meet age-verification standards; and only using adult smokers in its advertising.</p> <p>\u201cI think the policies are working,\u201d Thomson says. \u201cI think the policies are above and beyond any other age-gated brand in almost any other sector.\u201d</p> <p>British teens don\u2019t really seem to care about Juul \u2013 I am variously told that \u201cpeople tend to go for cheaper vapes off Amazon\u201d; \u201cJuul is primarily a meme\u201d, and \u201cVapes are usually in year seven \u2013 people start smoking weed higher up.\u201d Yet without this extremely lucrative market, and with bans and regulations making life harder for adult Juulers (who now have to buy flavours online in the States, and deal with a lower nicotine content in the UK) will Juul continue to grow?</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at the numbers over the last few years, the number of people switching from smoking to vaping has started to flatten out. I think part of that is a lot of misinformation that surrounds the health impacts of switching,\u201d Thomson says. \u201cI hope that the government, charities and public health bodies continue to be supportive because there is a huge public health opportunity in front of them. There are a 100,000 people who die every year in this country from smoking cigarettes.\u201d Juul is currently fighting the San Francisco ban, instead pushing regulation and enforcement as an alternative.</p> <p>For many former smokers, Juul is undoubtedly a lifeline. But for teens such as Grace, vaping is an expensive and potentially dangerous new addiction. The 17-year-old has no plans to stop. \u201cA few kids quit, but they normally end up back on it within a week or so, just because so many people are doing it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to avoid.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "At Grace\u2019s school, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re the coolest girl in the class or the quietest, when you get up to go to the toilet, you take your Juul. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re 11 or 16, like Grace was when she first started smoking the sleek black electronic cigarette. Depending on your gender, you\u2019ll tuck the USB-like device into your pocket or your bra, knowingly risking suspension for a hit of mango- flavoured nicotine. Last year, Grace\u2019s school implemented a new policy: if two kids go to the toilet at the same time, they\u2019re automatically assumed to be Juuling. \u201cIt does impact people in school,\u201d says Grace, now 17, who, like all the teenagers in this piece, has had her name changed to protect her identity. Grace is originally from England but attends a private school in Switzerland. \u201cYou\u2019ve got kids getting up every five minutes to go to the bathroom because you can\u2019t focus without a hit.\u201d Like most kids in her school, Grace didn\u2019t smoke cigarettes before she began vaping Juul. The e-cigarette was developed by two American former smokers, Adam Bowen and James Monsees, in 2015. \u201cJuul was created to be a satisfying alternative to cigarettes,\u201d reads the company website, which calls the product \u201cunlike any e-cigarette or vape\u201d. Sales seem to support claims \u2013 just four years after it was founded, Juul Labs is valued at $38bn and has a 70% share of the US e-cigarette market. There\u2019s just one problem: Grace, and kids like her. You must be 18 or over to purchase vaping products in the United States, the United Kingdom and most of Europe, but that hasn\u2019t prevented what the US Surgeon General last year called a \u201cteen vaping epidemic\u201d. In February 2019, America\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4.9m teens in the country used e-cigarettes. In July, Juul\u2019s CEO Kevin Burns apologised to parents for the first time. \u201cI\u2019m sorry their child is using the product,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not intended for them.\u201d Grace and her classmates (who are mostly English, though some are American) think Juul was intended for them. \u201cIt\u2019s just too convenient,\u201d the teenager says. \u201cOther brands of vapes are like huge, billowing smoke \u2013 you can\u2019t hide that.\u201d There are now a number of e-cigarettes and vape pens on the market, from those with bulky, refillable tanks like Aspire, to the thin black e-cigarette Blu. Yet Juul captured teen imagination \u2013 Grace says its discreet size means it is easily kept out of sight. \u201cSo I do think they knew what they were doing.\u201d An American spokesperson denies Juul was ever intended for teenagers and says the product \u201cwas designed and developed exclusively with the adult smoker in mind,\u201d adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone who doesn\u2019t smoke or already uses nicotine to use Juul products.\u201d The reason the product is so sleek and small, they say, is to make the experience of switching from cigarettes \u201cas simple, clean and satisfying\u201d as possible. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a product with no buttons or switches, no cleaning or messy juice replacement, as seen in most other vapes with open systems. It\u2019s clean, freeing the adult smoker from smoke, ash and odour that they would usually get from a combustible cigarettes, and most importantly it\u2019s satisfying, using regulated temperature controls, nicotine salts and varying strengths to meet the needs of cigarette smokers looking to switch.\u201d When Juul launched its first marketing campaigns in 2015, the models in its brightly coloured posters looked young, fresh and cool. America\u2019s Food and Drug Administration is currently investigating whether the company deliberately marketed its products towards young people, something Juul denies. After its UK launch in summer 2018, the brand has steered away from a youth-oriented image. All of the models in Juul ads are now over 30 and users of the product, and the company\u2019s upcoming UK billboards will be 200m away from any schools. Juul UK\u2019s managing director, Dan Thomson, emphasises that this is double the official guidance of 100m. It\u2019s an encouraging act of self-regulation, but it comes at a time when Juul is facing unprecedented pressure. In June, San Francisco became the first US city to ban the sale of e-cigarettes, despite the fact that Juul owns a 29-storey skyscraper in the city. In the UK, EU regulations mean that Juul\u2019s flavour capsules, known as pods, contain only 1.7% nicotine, roughly a third of the amount in the US. With bad press, bans and binding regulations, will Juul remain a vaping giant, or will its success disappear in a puff of smoke? \u201cWe are switching people in very significant numbers away from combustible cigarettes,\u201d says Thomson, who has worked with the brand for just over a year. When Juul debuted in the UK last July, its products were available in just a few hundred vape stores. They are now sold in nearly 10,000 outlets. Many Britons, who had been ordering Juul from abroad, were excited that the product was finally available at an affordable price at home. On social media, customers declared it \u201ca dream come true\u201d and \u201camazing\u201d when, in November 2018, the company struck a major deal with Sainsbury\u2019s. \u201cWe are still relatively small in this marketplace,\u201d Thomson says. \u201cThere are still millions of smokers out there who are going to have very negative health outcomes if they do not either quit completely \u2013 which is what we would recommend \u2013 or find an alternative to switch to. In a careful and thoughtful way, and in a way that ensures the product does not get into the wrong hands, we want to continue to expand.\u201d Vaping is a far healthier alternative to smoking \u2013 if you already smoke. In 2015, Public Health England found that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than their combustible counterparts; there is none of the smoke, tar or carbon monoxide that make cigarettes so dangerous. \u201cThere is widespread academic and clinical consensus that while not without risk, vaping is far less harmful than smoking,\u201d says Professor John Newton, director of health improvement at Public Health England. \u201cThere is no situation where it would be better for your health to continue smoking rather than switching completely to vaping. The sooner you stop smoking completely the better.\u201d Yet Juul pods do, obviously, contain nicotine, and while the substance itself isn\u2019t cancer-causing, it is addictive. Grace didn\u2019t smoke before picking up Juul, meaning she was introduced to nicotine for the first time because of the product. Newton says that in the UK, regular e-cigarette use among young people \u201cremains low\u201d, but in America, worries abound about the 20% of high-schoolers who vape. \u201cThere are concerns about exposure to nicotine at an early stage of life,\u201d says Maciej Goniewicz, a scientist at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in New York. Last year, Goniewicz and his colleagues published a study that found that adolescents who use Juul are exposed to nearly as much nicotine as traditional smokers, owing to the product\u2019s use of nicotine salts. \u201cYoung people who never smoked are getting this highly effective nicotine-delivery product, and they might get addicted,\u201d Goniewicz says. He also emphasises that we don\u2019t yet know the long-term effects of e-cigarettes. \u201cEven though there is a consensus that e-cigarettes are less risky than tobacco cigarettes, we still see evidence that there is some respiratory cardiovascular risk associated with vaping,\u201d he says. In 2015, researchers found that some e-cigarette flavours contain a chemical, diacetyl, which has been linked to \u201cpopcorn lung\u201d, a disease characterised by irreversibly inflamed airways. Juul does not use diacetyl as an ingredient, but many teens like Grace use off-brand vape juice in their Juuls because it\u2019s cheaper. \u201cYeaaaah,\u201d Grace muses when asked if she\u2019s concerned about the effect vaping will have on her health. \u201cBut, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s difficult, because obviously I don\u2019t want to have health problems in the future. But I know that it\u2019s a possibility. And if that does happen, if I end up with a lung condition, which is definitely possible, it\u2019s my own fault.\u201d A straight-A student interested in extracurricular activities and charity work, Grace understands the risks of vaping. So why does she do it anyway, and how did Juuling get so cool? Over the past year, Grace has supervised school dances for younger kids. At one event for 11 to 13-year-olds, one of her key duties was to stop children vaping in the loos. \u201cObviously the flavours make it appealing,\u201d says Grace, who spends roughly \u00a324 a week on Juul pods. Pods come in sweet flavours like creme, mint and cucumber. Grace\u2019s favourite used to be mango (\u201cLike, traditional,\u201d she says), but she now buys knock-off flavours including strawberry, watermelon and pineapple. In response to criticism about youth uptake, Juul stopped selling sweet and fruit-flavoured pods in US high-street shops in November 2018 (the flavours are still available online, where customers must be over 21 and verify their age by submitting ID). Yet in the UK, mango and mint-flavoured pods are still available nationwide. \u201cI know there has been some talk of flavours. We only have six flavours in the UK,\u201d says Thomson. \u201cWe are very conservative in the flavour choices. We are very conservative in the flavour name descriptions that we have.\u201d Of course it\u2019s not just flavours that make Juul appealing to teens, especially once they\u2019re already addicted. \u201cIt is not about the flavours. I can\u2019t stress that enough,\u201d says Andy, a 17-year-old high school student and former vape dealer from Atlanta. \u201cThey are trying to ban mango and all of that. That does not matter, we will just buy the next flavour\u2026 When they run out of their favourite flavour, all of a sudden the one that they hated is looking pretty good to them because they are addicted.\u201d Andy began Juuling when he was 15 and, like Grace, attributes his addiction to good old-fashioned peer pressure. \u201cI had a friend who didn\u2019t do it, but my friends would just about harass them to try it,\u201d he says. Both Grace and Andy say Juuling provides stress relief, especially before exams. As he is 6ft 7in and looks mature, Andy was able to buy Juul pods from local shops and sell them on to his classmates. \u201cEvery day after school I would have 20 or 30 people meeting me at my truck for pods,\u201d he says, estimating that he made nearly $4,000 in a year. Another reason teens became hooked on these pods, experts argue, is because of Juul\u2019s social media presence. Last year, Juul shut down its Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat accounts, and promised to use its Twitter for \u201cnon-promotional communications only\u201d. Yet many feared it was too late: teens had already set up their own Juul-based accounts, sharing tricks, memes and jokes, ensuring that Juuling remained a somewhat ironic, but nonetheless addictive, hobby. \u201cYou get a buzz off it, definitely\u2026 But it is also just like a fun thing to do. You\u2019ve got like your tricks and stuff,\u201d explains Grace. Jon-Patrick Allem is a professor of preventive medicine at Keck School of Medicine in California who has researched the impact of Juul\u2019s Twitter account. In a 2018 study, Allem found that 3.6% of all Juul-related posts on Twitter mentioned \u201cschool\u201d, while only 0.29% mentioned \u201cquitting smoking\u201d. In a later study, he discovered that even teens who don\u2019t follow the brand are frequently tagged into posts by their peers. \u201cTeens who are not necessarily signing up to follow Juul and Juul-related media are exposed to it on the social media platform,\u201d Allem says. \u201cIn our research and in the literature in general, we know that young people who are exposed to tobacco marketing, nicotine marketing, it raises awareness of the brand, and it changes susceptibility to use such products\u2026 Moving forward, the more Juul can do to remove their content from platforms that are popular among young people, the better.\u201d And yet as quickly as it rose to power, Juul\u2019s popularity is already declining among American teens. In May 2018, the New Yorker chronicled \u201cthe promise of vaping and the rise of Juul\u201d, but by November, they released a declaratively titled follow-up, \u201cGoodbye to Juul season\u201d. Meme-based Juul Instagram accounts were disappearing rapidly, the story announced, and teens suggested the trend was disappearing. Andy has already cut down on his personal use, and no longer sells pods. \u201cI personally do not like Juul any more. I do not like the whole company,\u201d says Andy. \u201cI don\u2019t like what it has done to me.\u201d He does athletics and believes his race times would be better if he had never Juuled. When asked how Juuling has affected classmates, he says: \u201cThey are after pods like fools.\u201d In the UK, teens haven\u2019t fallen in love with Juul to the same extent as their US contemporaries. In 2019, Public Health England reported that only 1.7% of 11 to 18-year-olds in Britain vape weekly \u2013 although experimentation is increasing, and Juul has only been available in the country for a year. \u201cAs we launched the business in the UK, front and centre of our strategy was ensuring that we did not replicate some of the earlier issues that we saw in the US,\u201d Thomson says. Juul\u2019s strict measures in the UK include a \u201cChallenge 25\u201d policy in all retail stores; no UK social media accounts; underage mystery shoppers; sanctions against stockists who don\u2019t meet age-verification standards; and only using adult smokers in its advertising. \u201cI think the policies are working,\u201d Thomson says. \u201cI think the policies are above and beyond any other age-gated brand in almost any other sector.\u201d British teens don\u2019t really seem to care about Juul \u2013 I am variously told that \u201cpeople tend to go for cheaper vapes off Amazon\u201d; \u201cJuul is primarily a meme\u201d, and \u201cVapes are usually in year seven \u2013 people start smoking weed higher up.\u201d Yet without this extremely lucrative market, and with bans and regulations making life harder for adult Juulers (who now have to buy flavours online in the States, and deal with a lower nicotine content in the UK) will Juul continue to grow? \u201cIf you look at the numbers over the last few years, the number of people switching from smoking to vaping has started to flatten out. I think part of that is a lot of misinformation that surrounds the health impacts of switching,\u201d Thomson says. \u201cI hope that the government, charities and public health bodies continue to be supportive because there is a huge public health opportunity in front of them. There are a 100,000 people who die every year in this country from smoking cigarettes.\u201d Juul is currently fighting the San Francisco ban, instead pushing regulation and enforcement as an alternative. For many former smokers, Juul is undoubtedly a lifeline. But for teens such as Grace, vaping is an expensive and potentially dangerous new addiction. The 17-year-old has no plans to stop. \u201cA few kids quit, but they normally end up back on it within a week or so, just because so many people are doing it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to avoid.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u201cWithout film-making my life is meaningless,\u201d says Salvador Mallo, the depressed director at the heart of Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s new film. He\u2019s ageing, he\u2019s ailing and lives all by himself in a big flat full of memories. His friends have all left and he fears his best work is behind him. Time is ticking; his body is breaking down. When Mallo is wheeled into theatre for a routine operation, it could almost be a dress-rehearsal for his death.</p> \n<p>Almod\u00f3var points out that the film is a fiction. He has no interest in documentaries and would never dream of making one. So the character of Mallo is not him, not really, even if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/18/antonio-banderas-pedro-almodovar-film-pain-glory-penelope-cruz\" title=\"\">Antonio Banderas</a> dressed in the director\u2019s clothes to play the role, even if the film\u2019s interiors were shot inside the director\u2019s own flat, even if Mallo\u2019s life largely corresponds with his own. But his defence is crumbling; he throws up his hands. \u201cI\u2019m trying to convince myself I\u2019m talking about a character,\u201d he says. \u201cBut deep down I know I\u2019m talking about myself. So go ahead, ask me anything. I can no longer hide behind Salvador Mallo.\u201d</p> \n<p>We meet inside his production office in Madrid, on a nondescript side street just west of the bullring. Almod\u00f3var sits ramrod-straight at his desk, a snowy-haired man with a puckish smile and mournful eyes and a notepad in his hands that he doodles on as he speaks. The wall behind is studded with framed pictures: a peroxide Pen\u00e9lope Cruz; a signed portrait of Billy Wilder. Many of the pictures show the director in his younger days, when his hair was jet black and his stare more pugnacious. The ghosts of the past are literally lined at his back.</p> \n<p>Actually, I don\u2019t think Almod\u00f3var has ever hidden behind his movies. Or if he has, the disguise has never amounted to more than a playful fig-leaf, a bit of powder and paint. In his rude, boisterous youth he made rude, boisterous pictures. In well-upholstered middle-age he made plush melodramas and thrillers. But he\u2019s now knocking 70 and suffering through an undignified low comedy of back problems, tinnitus and spiritual malaise. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/17/pain-and-glory-review\" title=\"\">Pain and Glory</a></em>, then, is an old man\u2019s confessional. It may also turn out to be his late-life masterpiece.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a423fcff-c357-4741-96c3-639caca7120d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SILvQ3QQpcY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The director nods curtly. \u201cI\u2019m extremely proud of the film,\u201d he says and then hastens to clarify. All his films have flaws; some just have fewer imperfections than others. \u201cSo perhaps I should say I\u2019m extremely proud of certain scenes in this film.\u201d</p> \n<p>Joining us in the office is Claire, the translator. Almod\u00f3var\u2019s back is in uproar but Claire\u2019s left leg is even worse. She felt something give when the bus hit the brakes; she thinks she\u2019s pulled a muscle. The leg doesn\u2019t hurt when she\u2019s sitting down, but God only knows how she\u2019s going to get up from her chair. Almod\u00f3var decides we\u2019ll cross that bridge later. He\u2019ll carry her out if need be, assuming his dodgy back doesn\u2019t snap. The three of us sip at our drinks and exchange nervous glances. This could turn out to be a major issue.</p> \n<p>Almod\u00f3var\u2019s films are full of similar moments: anguished human dramas edged with knockabout farce. In <em>Pain and Glory</em>, Mallo squabbles with his friends, mangles a live interview and self-medicates with opiates. The tone is mercurial, offsetting pathos with humour. Almod\u00f3var\u2019s palette has darkened and his thoughts have turned inward. As a film-maker, though, his step is arguably lighter than it has ever been in the past. <em>Pain and Glory</em> leads us on a merry dance.</p> \n<p>Inside the office, Almod\u00f3var talks in a rush, slaloming from Spanish to English and back again. Without film-making, Mallo\u2019s life has no meaning. And yes, of course, that\u2019s what the director thinks too. It\u2019s probably how he\u2019s always felt. But these days the drumbeat is only getting louder. \u201cI rely on it, it\u2019s an addiction, the need to tell stories. If anything, my relationship with film has become more tense, more of a problem, because there is always that question: when will my time be up? Will this be the last film I make?\u201d He draws a horizontal line on the pad; puts a notch near the end. \u201cPerhaps this is the reason I haven\u2019t developed any other facets of my life. Quite the opposite, I think I\u2019ve cut back. So I\u2019ve now reached the point where film is the only thing that makes me feel whole. Cinema is the only thing I have. It\u2019s finished up being both the end and the means for me.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bac4add8c6fe4b3f8198b9c4616d46443532ead\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bac4add8c6fe4b3f8198b9c4616d46443532ead/0_165_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Antonio Banderas in a scene from Pain and Glory, shot in the director\u2019s own apartment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Antonio Banderas in a scene from Pain and Glory, shot in the director\u2019s own apartment.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pain and Glory by Pedro Almodovar film stills from organic publicity \u21d4</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>His lifestyle might make him feel whole as an artist. Does it make him incomplete as a person? He winces. \u201cGood question. It definitely dominates my life. But it\u2019s what you get used to. Personally, I\u2019ve got used to not needing other people. I\u2019ve let them go. I\u2019ve cut them off. I suppose I could get them back if I wanted. But I\u2019d need a spur. I\u2019d need a reason.\u201d</p> \n<p>Is this where most great artists wind up: in an ivory tower, contemplating the stars? It somehow runs counter to the abiding spirit of Almod\u00f3var\u2019s work, which has always been about noise, colour, incident; the rub and thrust of bodies in close quarters. His best films are like something you might pick up from Madrid\u2019s El Rastro flea-market: well-thumbed and outrageous, a gorgeous gift to the world.</p> \n<p>Almod\u00f3var was born in smalltown La Mancha. His dad ran a petrol station, his mum a bodega. Making <em>Pain and Glory</em> involved digging back into his past. So he cast 10-year-old Asier Flores as his childhood self: soulful, out of place and stirred to a state of swooning lust by the sight of a handsome labourer in the buff.</p> \n<p>Near the end of the film, Mallo turns to his dying mother and says: \u201cI\u2019ve failed you simply by being as I am.\u201d Again, this is a sentiment he can relate to himself.</p> \n<p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d he says and clears his throat. \u201cIn fact I was never the son my parents wanted. I mean, I think that they really loved me. But it\u2019s something I realised from a very young age.\u201d</p> \n<p>He doesn\u2019t blame them so much as the time and the place. Mum and dad were <em>manchegos</em>: the region made them what they were. \u201cI was born in 1949 and La Mancha was highly conservative, extremely backward. My parents were effectively living in the 19th century and they gave birth to a son who was almost like a 21st-century child.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo there was a massive gap between their expectations and mine. They wanted me to stay in the village, get married, get a job in a bank. In fact, they did find me a job in a bank and I turned it down.\u201d He glares at me; he glares at Claire. \u201cI just hated village life. I was horrified by it, even when I was little. So much inbreeding. Everyone looking inwards and at each other. The only thing that mattered was what your neighbours were doing and what they thought of you. So for me it was hell. All I wanted to do was get out, run away.\u201d</p> \n<p>In 1970s Madrid he was adopted by a wild new family. La Movida Madrile\u00f1a was a loose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/26/pedro-almodovar-podemos-indignados-spain\" title=\"\">coalition of artists</a> (musicians, artists, theatre groups) that flourished after the death of General Franco. Almod\u00f3var explains that La Movida took its lead from pretty much everything \u2013 British punk and glam, American new wave, the 60s sexual revolution, Andy Warhol\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/apr/11/inside-andy-warhol-factory-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Factory scene</a> \u2013 but that it was also a purely Spanish phenomenon, a great upsurge of creativity, a reaction to decades of oppression. His time with La Movida was a dream come true, the best experience of his life. And it was only possible because he had fled La Mancha and because ding-dong, the witch was dead. Or as he puts it: \u201cFranco had to die so that I could live.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2908337304af5015f193d4606a59fc5c04197470\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2908337304af5015f193d4606a59fc5c04197470/0_1646_6192_3715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pedro Alm\u00f3dovar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Envy arrives on the scene, and that\u2019s very unpleasant.

We had journalists coming every day to try to understand what was going on. Then I read the articles and it was clear they didn\u2019t understand it. It was too specific, too chaotic, and they were too chaotic themselves, too much a part of the story. They took too many drugs and it showed in their writing.\u201d</p> \n<p>I picture Almod\u00f3var at the time as a curious, Clark Kent figure. By night he wrote comic-strip stories, performed fringe theatre and sang in a band. He bought a Super-8 camera and shot silent sex comedies and profane Bible tales which he would then project on the walls at nightclubs and bars, often standing beside the screen to provide a bellowed running commentary. But by day he held down a job at Telef\u00f3nica, the state telephone company. For 12 years he worked as an office administrator, keeping tabs on faulty phones that had been returned, and only quit in the 80s after his film career took off. When 1988\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/sep/13/how-we-made-women-on-the-verge-of-a-nervous-breakdown-pedro-almodovar\" title=\"\">Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown</a></em> picked up an Oscar nomination, his mother said that thiswas probably a good time to call Telef\u00f3nica and ask for his old job back.</p> \n<p>Actually, he says, the salary was a safeguard, the job kept him grounded. \u201cLa Movida was open, it was permissive and the night just went on and on. And yes, I had first-hand experience of all that, the endless nights, but it was different for me because I had to get up the next day. And maybe that\u2019s what saved me. I was surrounded by all the excesses, all the drugs. But I knew I had to write my scripts at home and that I had to go to work every morning. Every party I went to, I was always the first one to go home.\u201d</p> \n<p>An assistant pokes her head around the door to check how we\u2019re doing. A dark-haired toddler is parked on her hip. Almod\u00f3var lights up at the sight of the child. He pulls frowning faces, plays peek-a-boo with his hands. Claire takes this opportunity to check her leg. If anything, it\u2019s worse; it won\u2019t take any weight. \u201cI think I must have torn some ligaments,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>Like La Movida, Almod\u00f3var\u2019s films pinched from a wide range of sources: the high-flown Hollywood melodramas of Douglas Sirk and George Cukor; the glossy perversities of Alfred Hitchcock; the grubby transgressions of Warhol and John Waters. Like La Movida, they came with a personal stamp and a distinct Spanish flavour. And as the director matured, his work changed too, shifting from the spiky exuberance of pictures like <em>Labyrinth of Passion</em> and <em>Tie Me Up</em><em>! Tie Me Down!</em> towards the lush, liquid exoticism of <em>All About My Mother</em> and <em>Broken Embraces</em>. Along the way he became arguably the country\u2019s most bankable cultural export, a global brand, very nearly a monopoly.</p> \n<p>Almod\u00f3var insists he was as surprised as anyone. He always assumed he\u2019d be a cult director at best. He says international stardom has been wonderful in that it\u2019s allowed him to retain complete control of his career. The downside is that it estranged him from most members of his old cohort. \u201cEnvy arrives on the scene, and that\u2019s very unpleasant. You find it\u2019s suddenly hard to talk to your friends. And the reason for that is the success that you\u2019ve had.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4d3083b4ce3abd57c272c737447a40911acbda33\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d3083b4ce3abd57c272c737447a40911acbda33/0_30_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Antonio Banderas as Salvador Mallo in Pain and Glory\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Antonio Banderas as Salvador Mallo in Pain and Glory.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Fame, perhaps, is the worst thing that can happen to a grassroots scene like La Movida. Every flash of the spotlight bleaches out its dark corners. Every giant leap forward risks betraying core principles. One minute Almod\u00f3var and Banderas, his regular player, were making polysexual comedies they figured would play to a dog and two transvestites. The next the director was being feted by high-profile fans like Madonna, while Banderas had remade himself as a bona fide Hollywood star, propping up studio fodder like <em>Spy Kids</em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/17/the-expendables-3-review-macho-sparring-sylvester-stallone\" title=\"\">The Expendables 3</a></em> and the <em>Zorro</em> pictures.</p> \n<p>Banderas once told me that Almod\u00f3var had felt annoyed and betrayed when the actor moved to the US. The director blinks when I mention this. \u201cDid he? I didn\u2019t know that I dared to tell him that to his face. But yes, I guess I was. I mean, I was happy for his success. But he had been the protagonist of almost all my movies in the 80s. And I felt like a mother who has lost her son. It was like he\u2019d left home. And obviously for me home meant being in Madrid, working for me.\u201d</p> \n<p>When <em>Pain and Glory</em> screened at Cannes in May it prompted speculation that here at last was a film to win Almod\u00f3var a Palme d\u2019Or to set alongside his Goyas, Oscars and Baftas. Instead it was Banderas who walked away with the best actor prize. The director approves. He says that this is Banderas\u2019s best performance since 1989\u2019s <em>Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!</em> \u2013 then realises that this might be construed as a double-edged compliment, given that <em>Tie Me Up</em> was the last film they made before the actor jumped ship. He doesn\u2019t want to cause offence; he\u2019s glad he has his actor back (they reconciled to collaborate on the 2011 thriller <em>The Skin I Live In</em>). \u201cActually,\u201d he concedes, \u201cit\u2019s probably his best performance ever.\u201d</p> \n<p>Every now and again, he considers tackling Hollywood himself. He came within a whisker of making both <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/jan/06/3\" title=\"\">Brokeback Mountain</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/mar/14/the-paperboy-review\" title=\"\">The Paperboy</a></em>. Back in the early 90s \u2013 rather more alarmingly \u2013 Touchstone Pictures wanted him to direct <em>Sister Act</em>, the Whoopi Goldberg vehicle about singing nuns. But on balance he has decided he\u2019s better off in Madrid. He lives alone, surrounded by his books and his paintings and 3,000 DVDs, in a large apartment near the Malasa\u00f1a district. Once, long ago, Malasa\u00f1a was the base of La Movida. It was a barrio of crumbling brick warehouses and dingy clubs. Since then the cash has poured in and the place has been gentrified. The director has changed. The city has too.</p> \n<p>Before she died in 1999, Almod\u00f3var\u2019s mother sat down to map out her own funeral. She decided how the service would be and what dress she would wear. She\u2019d heard that the morticians had a habit of binding the corpse\u2019s feet so that they didn\u2019t splay out in the casket and stipulated that, if this should happen, her children should immediately untie her. She didn\u2019t want her feet bound; she planned to run free. evisiting this exchange when writing the script for <em>Pain and Glory</em>, Almod\u00f3var abruptly found himself breaking down in tears.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/17/pain-and-glory-review\">Pain and Glory review \u2013 life meets art in Almod\u00f3var's wistful extravaganza</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>His mother, he says, wasn\u2019t scared of dying; he always admired that about her. \u201cBut it\u2019s one of my worries, I can\u2019t get over it in my mind. I mean, I can\u2019t even reconcile myself to the fact that death is real. Plus I\u2019m an atheist, so I have no belief in the afterlife and no creed to help me out. I see the whole thing as unnatural, I know that sounds odd.\u201d He snorts. \u201cSo yes, I\u2019m definitely afraid of dying.\u201d</p> \n<p>Claire isn\u2019t dying, but her left leg is useless, the tendons are definitely torn. Try as she might, she can\u2019t walk unassisted or get downstairs to the car. In the end, after a hasty discussion, she agrees to loop one arm over Almod\u00f3var\u2019s shoulders and the other over mine. It\u2019s a weirdly intimate moment; it must look as though we\u2019re drunk. We come lurching out of the room all tangled together, like three sailors on shore leave.</p> \n<p>Almod\u00f3var casts over his life from the vantage of old age. But how would it look from the other end of the telescope, if the boy in La Mancha could see him today and understand just how far he has travelled? I think he\u2019d be cock-a-hoop, but the director has his doubts. First off, he says, it\u2019s an impossible question. Also, he wonders if his life and career would even make any sense. As a boy, he loved movies and film stars. But he wouldn\u2019t have known anything about directors. The question is foolish, but answering it makes him sad. \u201cIf I could have looked ahead and seen myself now, I don\u2019t think my view of myself would be positive. I wouldn\u2019t like what I\u2019ve turned into. I\u2019d look over and think: \u2018Who\u2019s that lonely solitary old man?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Pain and Glory opens on 23 August</em></p> \n<h2>Six of Almod\u00f3var\u2019s best, chosen by Xan Brooks</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77b1166bd977a0bafd7205f470b23730e803371e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77b1166bd977a0bafd7205f470b23730e803371e/0_0_1280_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from Pepi, Luci, Bom (1980)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Pepi, Luci, Bom (1980)</strong><br>Almod\u00f3var\u2019s feature debut is a campy revengers\u2019 comedy, fleshed out from his own comic-strip story and pinballing through a newly liberated Spain.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWithout film-making my life is meaningless,\u201d says Salvador Mallo, the depressed director at the heart of Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s new film. He\u2019s ageing, he\u2019s ailing and lives all by himself in a big flat full of memories. His friends have all left and he fears his best work is behind him. Time is ticking; his body is breaking down. When Mallo is wheeled into theatre for a routine operation, it could almost be a dress-rehearsal for his death. Almod\u00f3var points out that the film is a fiction. He has no interest in documentaries and would never dream of making one. So the character of Mallo is not him, not really, even if Antonio Banderas dressed in the director\u2019s clothes to play the role, even if the film\u2019s interiors were shot inside the director\u2019s own flat, even if Mallo\u2019s life largely corresponds with his own. But his defence is crumbling; he throws up his hands. \u201cI\u2019m trying to convince myself I\u2019m talking about a character,\u201d he says. \u201cBut deep down I know I\u2019m talking about myself. So go ahead, ask me anything. I can no longer hide behind Salvador Mallo.\u201d We meet inside his production office in Madrid, on a nondescript side street just west of the bullring. Almod\u00f3var sits ramrod-straight at his desk, a snowy-haired man with a puckish smile and mournful eyes and a notepad in his hands that he doodles on as he speaks. The wall behind is studded with framed pictures: a peroxide Pen\u00e9lope Cruz; a signed portrait of Billy Wilder. Many of the pictures show the director in his younger days, when his hair was jet black and his stare more pugnacious. The ghosts of the past are literally lined at his back. Actually, I don\u2019t think Almod\u00f3var has ever hidden behind his movies. Or if he has, the disguise has never amounted to more than a playful fig-leaf, a bit of powder and paint. In his rude, boisterous youth he made rude, boisterous pictures. In well-upholstered middle-age he made plush melodramas and thrillers. But he\u2019s now knocking 70 and suffering through an undignified low comedy of back problems, tinnitus and spiritual malaise. Pain and Glory, then, is an old man\u2019s confessional. It may also turn out to be his late-life masterpiece. The director nods curtly. \u201cI\u2019m extremely proud of the film,\u201d he says and then hastens to clarify. All his films have flaws; some just have fewer imperfections than others. \u201cSo perhaps I should say I\u2019m extremely proud of certain scenes in this film.\u201d Joining us in the office is Claire, the translator. Almod\u00f3var\u2019s back is in uproar but Claire\u2019s left leg is even worse. She felt something give when the bus hit the brakes; she thinks she\u2019s pulled a muscle. The leg doesn\u2019t hurt when she\u2019s sitting down, but God only knows how she\u2019s going to get up from her chair. Almod\u00f3var decides we\u2019ll cross that bridge later. He\u2019ll carry her out if need be, assuming his dodgy back doesn\u2019t snap. The three of us sip at our drinks and exchange nervous glances. This could turn out to be a major issue. Almod\u00f3var\u2019s films are full of similar moments: anguished human dramas edged with knockabout farce. In Pain and Glory, Mallo squabbles with his friends, mangles a live interview and self-medicates with opiates. The tone is mercurial, offsetting pathos with humour. Almod\u00f3var\u2019s palette has darkened and his thoughts have turned inward. As a film-maker, though, his step is arguably lighter than it has ever been in the past. Pain and Glory leads us on a merry dance. Inside the office, Almod\u00f3var talks in a rush, slaloming from Spanish to English and back again. Without film-making, Mallo\u2019s life has no meaning. And yes, of course, that\u2019s what the director thinks too. It\u2019s probably how he\u2019s always felt. But these days the drumbeat is only getting louder. \u201cI rely on it, it\u2019s an addiction, the need to tell stories. If anything, my relationship with film has become more tense, more of a problem, because there is always that question: when will my time be up? Will this be the last film I make?\u201d He draws a horizontal line on the pad; puts a notch near the end. \u201cPerhaps this is the reason I haven\u2019t developed any other facets of my life. Quite the opposite, I think I\u2019ve cut back. So I\u2019ve now reached the point where film is the only thing that makes me feel whole. Cinema is the only thing I have. It\u2019s finished up being both the end and the means for me.\u201d His lifestyle might make him feel whole as an artist. Does it make him incomplete as a person? He winces. \u201cGood question. It definitely dominates my life. But it\u2019s what you get used to. Personally, I\u2019ve got used to not needing other people. I\u2019ve let them go. I\u2019ve cut them off. I suppose I could get them back if I wanted. But I\u2019d need a spur. I\u2019d need a reason.\u201d Is this where most great artists wind up: in an ivory tower, contemplating the stars? It somehow runs counter to the abiding spirit of Almod\u00f3var\u2019s work, which has always been about noise, colour, incident; the rub and thrust of bodies in close quarters. His best films are like something you might pick up from Madrid\u2019s El Rastro flea-market: well-thumbed and outrageous, a gorgeous gift to the world. Almod\u00f3var was born in smalltown La Mancha. His dad ran a petrol station, his mum a bodega. Making Pain and Glory involved digging back into his past. So he cast 10-year-old Asier Flores as his childhood self: soulful, out of place and stirred to a state of swooning lust by the sight of a handsome labourer in the buff. Near the end of the film, Mallo turns to his dying mother and says: \u201cI\u2019ve failed you simply by being as I am.\u201d Again, this is a sentiment he can relate to himself. \u201cOh yes,\u201d he says and clears his throat. \u201cIn fact I was never the son my parents wanted. I mean, I think that they really loved me. But it\u2019s something I realised from a very young age.\u201d He doesn\u2019t blame them so much as the time and the place. Mum and dad were manchegos: the region made them what they were. \u201cI was born in 1949 and La Mancha was highly conservative, extremely backward. My parents were effectively living in the 19th century and they gave birth to a son who was almost like a 21st-century child. \u201cSo there was a massive gap between their expectations and mine. They wanted me to stay in the village, get married, get a job in a bank. In fact, they did find me a job in a bank and I turned it down.\u201d He glares at me; he glares at Claire. \u201cI just hated village life. I was horrified by it, even when I was little. So much inbreeding. Everyone looking inwards and at each other. The only thing that mattered was what your neighbours were doing and what they thought of you. So for me it was hell. All I wanted to do was get out, run away.\u201d In 1970s Madrid he was adopted by a wild new family. La Movida Madrile\u00f1a was a loose coalition of artists (musicians, artists, theatre groups) that flourished after the death of General Franco. Almod\u00f3var explains that La Movida took its lead from pretty much everything \u2013 British punk and glam, American new wave, the 60s sexual revolution, Andy Warhol\u2019s Factory scene \u2013 but that it was also a purely Spanish phenomenon, a great upsurge of creativity, a reaction to decades of oppression. His time with La Movida was a dream come true, the best experience of his life. And it was only possible because he had fled La Mancha and because ding-dong, the witch was dead. Or as he puts it: \u201cFranco had to die so that I could live.\u201d What made La Movida so special was that it was instant, spontaneous, a banquet of street food to be consumed on the run. \u201cIt was a revolution in Madrid, almost. We had journalists coming every day to try to understand what was going on. Then I read the articles and it was clear they didn\u2019t understand it. It was too specific, too chaotic, and they were too chaotic themselves, too much a part of the story. They took too many drugs and it showed in their writing.\u201d I picture Almod\u00f3var at the time as a curious, Clark Kent figure. By night he wrote comic-strip stories, performed fringe theatre and sang in a band. He bought a Super-8 camera and shot silent sex comedies and profane Bible tales which he would then project on the walls at nightclubs and bars, often standing beside the screen to provide a bellowed running commentary. But by day he held down a job at Telef\u00f3nica, the state telephone company. For 12 years he worked as an office administrator, keeping tabs on faulty phones that had been returned, and only quit in the 80s after his film career took off. When 1988\u2019s Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown picked up an Oscar nomination, his mother said that thiswas probably a good time to call Telef\u00f3nica and ask for his old job back. Actually, he says, the salary was a safeguard, the job kept him grounded. \u201cLa Movida was open, it was permissive and the night just went on and on. And yes, I had first-hand experience of all that, the endless nights, but it was different for me because I had to get up the next day. And maybe that\u2019s what saved me. I was surrounded by all the excesses, all the drugs. But I knew I had to write my scripts at home and that I had to go to work every morning. Every party I went to, I was always the first one to go home.\u201d An assistant pokes her head around the door to check how we\u2019re doing. A dark-haired toddler is parked on her hip. Almod\u00f3var lights up at the sight of the child. He pulls frowning faces, plays peek-a-boo with his hands. Claire takes this opportunity to check her leg. If anything, it\u2019s worse; it won\u2019t take any weight. \u201cI think I must have torn some ligaments,\u201d she says. Like La Movida, Almod\u00f3var\u2019s films pinched from a wide range of sources: the high-flown Hollywood melodramas of Douglas Sirk and George Cukor; the glossy perversities of Alfred Hitchcock; the grubby transgressions of Warhol and John Waters. Like La Movida, they came with a personal stamp and a distinct Spanish flavour. And as the director matured, his work changed too, shifting from the spiky exuberance of pictures like Labyrinth of Passion and Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! towards the lush, liquid exoticism of All About My Mother and Broken Embraces. Along the way he became arguably the country\u2019s most bankable cultural export, a global brand, very nearly a monopoly. Almod\u00f3var insists he was as surprised as anyone. He always assumed he\u2019d be a cult director at best. He says international stardom has been wonderful in that it\u2019s allowed him to retain complete control of his career. The downside is that it estranged him from most members of his old cohort. \u201cEnvy arrives on the scene, and that\u2019s very unpleasant. You find it\u2019s suddenly hard to talk to your friends. And the reason for that is the success that you\u2019ve had.\u201d Fame, perhaps, is the worst thing that can happen to a grassroots scene like La Movida. Every flash of the spotlight bleaches out its dark corners. Every giant leap forward risks betraying core principles. One minute Almod\u00f3var and Banderas, his regular player, were making polysexual comedies they figured would play to a dog and two transvestites. The next the director was being feted by high-profile fans like Madonna, while Banderas had remade himself as a bona fide Hollywood star, propping up studio fodder like Spy Kids, The Expendables 3 and the Zorro pictures. Banderas once told me that Almod\u00f3var had felt annoyed and betrayed when the actor moved to the US. The director blinks when I mention this. \u201cDid he? I didn\u2019t know that I dared to tell him that to his face. But yes, I guess I was. I mean, I was happy for his success. But he had been the protagonist of almost all my movies in the 80s. And I felt like a mother who has lost her son. It was like he\u2019d left home. And obviously for me home meant being in Madrid, working for me.\u201d When Pain and Glory screened at Cannes in May it prompted speculation that here at last was a film to win Almod\u00f3var a Palme d\u2019Or to set alongside his Goyas, Oscars and Baftas. Instead it was Banderas who walked away with the best actor prize. The director approves. He says that this is Banderas\u2019s best performance since 1989\u2019s Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! \u2013 then realises that this might be construed as a double-edged compliment, given that Tie Me Up was the last film they made before the actor jumped ship. He doesn\u2019t want to cause offence; he\u2019s glad he has his actor back (they reconciled to collaborate on the 2011 thriller The Skin I Live In). \u201cActually,\u201d he concedes, \u201cit\u2019s probably his best performance ever.\u201d Every now and again, he considers tackling Hollywood himself. He came within a whisker of making both Brokeback Mountain and The Paperboy. Back in the early 90s \u2013 rather more alarmingly \u2013 Touchstone Pictures wanted him to direct Sister Act, the Whoopi Goldberg vehicle about singing nuns. But on balance he has decided he\u2019s better off in Madrid. He lives alone, surrounded by his books and his paintings and 3,000 DVDs, in a large apartment near the Malasa\u00f1a district. Once, long ago, Malasa\u00f1a was the base of La Movida. It was a barrio of crumbling brick warehouses and dingy clubs. Since then the cash has poured in and the place has been gentrified. The director has changed. The city has too. Before she died in 1999, Almod\u00f3var\u2019s mother sat down to map out her own funeral. She decided how the service would be and what dress she would wear. She\u2019d heard that the morticians had a habit of binding the corpse\u2019s feet so that they didn\u2019t splay out in the casket and stipulated that, if this should happen, her children should immediately untie her. She didn\u2019t want her feet bound; she planned to run free. evisiting this exchange when writing the script for Pain and Glory, Almod\u00f3var abruptly found himself breaking down in tears. His mother, he says, wasn\u2019t scared of dying; he always admired that about her. \u201cBut it\u2019s one of my worries, I can\u2019t get over it in my mind. I mean, I can\u2019t even reconcile myself to the fact that death is real. Plus I\u2019m an atheist, so I have no belief in the afterlife and no creed to help me out. I see the whole thing as unnatural, I know that sounds odd.\u201d He snorts. \u201cSo yes, I\u2019m definitely afraid of dying.\u201d Claire isn\u2019t dying, but her left leg is useless, the tendons are definitely torn. Try as she might, she can\u2019t walk unassisted or get downstairs to the car. In the end, after a hasty discussion, she agrees to loop one arm over Almod\u00f3var\u2019s shoulders and the other over mine. It\u2019s a weirdly intimate moment; it must look as though we\u2019re drunk. We come lurching out of the room all tangled together, like three sailors on shore leave. Almod\u00f3var casts over his life from the vantage of old age. But how would it look from the other end of the telescope, if the boy in La Mancha could see him today and understand just how far he has travelled? I think he\u2019d be cock-a-hoop, but the director has his doubts. First off, he says, it\u2019s an impossible question. Also, he wonders if his life and career would even make any sense. As a boy, he loved movies and film stars. But he wouldn\u2019t have known anything about directors. The question is foolish, but answering it makes him sad. \u201cIf I could have looked ahead and seen myself now, I don\u2019t think my view of myself would be positive. I wouldn\u2019t like what I\u2019ve turned into. I\u2019d look over and think: \u2018Who\u2019s that lonely solitary old man?\u2019\u201d Pain and Glory opens on 23 August Six of Almod\u00f3var\u2019s best, chosen by Xan Brooks Pepi, Luci, Bom (1980) Almod\u00f3var\u2019s feature debut is a campy revengers\u2019 comedy, fleshed out from his own comic-strip story and pinballing through a newly liberated Spain. The cult classic was shot at weekends, on 16mm, with a budget of 500,000 pesetas. It wound up playing for three years to packed houses at Madrid\u2019s Alphaville theatre. Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (1988) Taking his lead from a Cocteau play, the director whipped up a pitch-black screwball, propelled by pop-art visuals and peacockish characters. The plot pivoted around a blender of gazpacho dosed with sleeping pills. The film itself played like caffeine laced with catnip. All About My Mother (1999) Cecilia Roth and Penelope Cruz starred in this sumptuous melodrama about makeshift families, shifting identities and the comfort of strangers. Twenty years on, Almod\u00f3var\u2019s mid-period walk on the wild side remains an ideal gateway for anyone still unfamiliar with his work. Talk to Her (2002) Still Almod\u00f3var\u2019s favourite of his films, the Oscar-winning Talk To Her mounts a Sleeping Beauty-style romance about two coma victims and the lovestruck guardians at their bedside. In any other hands, this would be too queasy for comfort. The director keeps it buoyant, fluid and quietly radical. Volver (2006) Almod\u00f3var beat back to his native La Mancha for a capricious, intoxicating murder story of sorts. Penelope Cruz headlines as the film\u2019s avenging angel, a hardscrabble mum with a smear of blood at her neck. \u201cWomen\u2019s trouble,\u201d she explains \u2013 and this is technically true. The Skin I Live In (2011) Returning from his adventures in Hollywood, Antonio Banderas played a demented plastic surgeon in Almod\u00f3var\u2019s giddying, psychosexual Frankenstein yarn; a film that delights in changing its costumes and turning the audience in circles. \u201cSometimes I thought I was playing Shakespeare,\u201d the actor confided. \u201cAnd sometimes, swear to God, this cheap Mexican soap opera.\u201d",

There was major disruption to the country\u2019s railways and London underground during the busy Friday night commute.</p> <p>\u201cWhy did this happen now?\u201d Adonis asked. \u201cThis is the middle of August, not the end of November. Why were key transport installations affected when they should have been protected from any but the most extreme power breakdowns? National Grid haven\u2019t been able to answer either of those two questions.

This was less than the 1.8 gigawatts lost in 2008 when two different generators failed. Then, about 500,000 people lost power, but major infrastructure systems were unaffected.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a big wake-up call for National Grid,\u201d Adonis said. \u201cTheir resilience is below par. They need to improve their processes for ensuring the resilience of national transport and medical installations in the event of power shortages.\u201d</p> <p>The failure of the two generators on Friday caused a frequency drop in the electricity system which, while sizable, should not have troubled it unduly, according to experts.</p> <p>\u201cThe frequency went down to less than 49Hz, so certain parts of the network started to disconnect automatically, causing the power cuts until the system came back into balance and the frequency stabilised,\u201d said Phil Hewitt, a director at energy consultancy EnAppSys. \u201cWe would have expected the system to cope with this size of loss of generation but the double hit may have destabilised it.\u201d</p> <p>National Grid has to maintain the system close to 50Hz to keep it stable. But industry sources said that, the frequency had previously fallen to dangerously low levels three times in the last 12 weeks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ff729f7fa869f71d25a3776cb557f88793bbd3f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff729f7fa869f71d25a3776cb557f88793bbd3f2/0_376_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Offshore Wind Farm\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The power failure was partially caused by the failure of an offshore windfarm on the Humber.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ashley Cooper/Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The company said: \u201cFollowing the event, the other generators on the network responded to the loss by increasing their output as expected. However, due to the scale of the generation losses this was not sufficient, and to protect the network and ensure that restoration to normal operation could be completed as quickly as possible, a backup protection system was triggered which disconnects selected demand across GB.\u201d</p> <p>How this backup system functioned is now expected to form part of the investigation into what went wrong on Friday.</p> <p>The failure of the two power stations in 2008, and the resulting fluctuation in energy frequency on the grid, caused some smaller generators \u2013 of which there are around 50,000 across the UK \u2013 to detect the disturbance and shut down in a safety operation that the energy industry refers to as \u201closs of mains protection\u201d.</p> <p>A National Grid presentation in March suggested the system might be \u201ctoo sensitive,\u201d causing smaller generators to shut down prematurely when disturbances were detected, leading to blackouts. In a July 2018 presentation, the National Grid claimed such widespread shutdowns were a risk that occurred once every 12 years.</p> <p>The company\u2019s director of operations, Duncan Burt, said its safety protection systems had worked well to keep the grid safe.</p> <p>But he conceded that the industry needed to examine whether it was set up correctly to have \u201cminimal impact\u201d on people\u2019s daily lives.</p> <p>David Hunter, an analyst at Schneider Electric, told the BBC that the UK\u2019s transition to clean energy could also be creating \u201cgreater stresses\u201d on the system because energy such as wind power is less effective as a \u201cshock absorber\u201d compared to nuclear or gas turbines when there are shifts in supply and demand on the grid.</p>",

They need to improve their processes for ensuring the resilience of national transport and medical installations in the event of power shortages.\u201d The failure of the two generators on Friday caused a frequency drop in the electricity system which, while sizable, should not have troubled it unduly, according to experts. \u201cThe frequency went down to less than 49Hz, so certain parts of the network started to disconnect automatically, causing the power cuts until the system came back into balance and the frequency stabilised,\u201d said Phil Hewitt, a director at energy consultancy EnAppSys. \u201cWe would have expected the system to cope with this size of loss of generation but the double hit may have destabilised it.\u201d National Grid has to maintain the system close to 50Hz to keep it stable. But industry sources said that, the frequency had previously fallen to dangerously low levels three times in the last 12 weeks. The company said: \u201cFollowing the event, the other generators on the network responded to the loss by increasing their output as expected. However, due to the scale of the generation losses this was not sufficient, and to protect the network and ensure that restoration to normal operation could be completed as quickly as possible, a backup protection system was triggered which disconnects selected demand across GB.\u201d How this backup system functioned is now expected to form part of the investigation into what went wrong on Friday. The failure of the two power stations in 2008, and the resulting fluctuation in energy frequency on the grid, caused some smaller generators \u2013 of which there are around 50,000 across the UK \u2013 to detect the disturbance and shut down in a safety operation that the energy industry refers to as \u201closs of mains protection\u201d. A National Grid presentation in March suggested the system might be \u201ctoo sensitive,\u201d causing smaller generators to shut down prematurely when disturbances were detected, leading to blackouts. In a July 2018 presentation, the National Grid claimed such widespread shutdowns were a risk that occurred once every 12 years. The company\u2019s director of operations, Duncan Burt, said its safety protection systems had worked well to keep the grid safe. But he conceded that the industry needed to examine whether it was set up correctly to have \u201cminimal impact\u201d on people\u2019s daily lives. David Hunter, an analyst at Schneider Electric, told the BBC that the UK\u2019s transition to clean energy could also be creating \u201cgreater stresses\u201d on the system because energy such as wind power is less effective as a \u201cshock absorber\u201d compared to nuclear or gas turbines when there are shifts in supply and demand on the grid.",

      "body": "<p>When faced with tribulation, Glaswegian males often feel compelled to reach for humour. This can seem inappropriate, brutal even, but it\u2019s not intended as such. It\u2019s a psychological reflex and one to which we have become genetically predisposed.</p> <p>I feel that much of this stems from decades of fighting adversity when death and sickness were the most persistent neighbourhood pests. To make light of them was to make a statement to your community that you wouldn\u2019t be defeated by them. Besides, if these twin impostors were intent on becoming a part of the local fabric for a while, then best to apply some emotional cosmetics rather than make everyone else miserable. In time, all of them would be expected to take their turn.</p> <p>I always advise debutants at a Glasgow funeral to keep their ears open. Thus, they\u2019ll be treated to a crash course in Glaswegian humour and come to an understanding of one of its greatest charisms. Here, you will see men talking very quickly out of the sides of their mouths between puffs of cigarettes held artfully between thumb and middle finger. As liquor begins to dilute the tension, stiff handshakes give way to manly hugs and nieces and nephews fill their boots with the jingling swag of the occasion.</p> <p>Nor can the deceased expect to be spared the vitriol merely on account of being dead. Soon, all their delinquencies and infractions are discussed, but gently and with something approaching love. This is part of a healing for the living where old wounds are finally dressed and unreconciled debts cancelled.</p> <p>Alongside death and physical suffering, we also like to joke about religion, sex and conflict resolution, mainly as a means of masking our inadequacies in such endeavours. Each of these feature heavily in the sharpest dramas inspired by the look and feel of Glasgow and its people, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1998/nov/08/features.review7\" title=\"\"><em>My Name Is Joe</em></a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/12/john-mackenzie-obituary\" title=\"\"><em>Just Another Saturday</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.timeout.com/london/film/orphans-1997\" title=\"\"><em>Orphans</em></a>. It\u2019s almost impossible to make a film or drama featuring Glasgow that doesn\u2019t make you laugh.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>As liquor begins to dilute the tension, stiff handshakes give way to manly hugs and nieces and nephews fill their boots with the jingling swag of the occasion</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Four years ago, it was my turn to apply the cosmetic wit when I had a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/26/my-heart-attack-mortality\" title=\"\">heart attack at 30,000 feet</a> on a plane to Australia to visit my daughter, Clare. Not long afterwards, I made a deal with the editor of these pages that I would only address my brush with mortality if I could do so lightly and while lampooning the Glaswegian inevitability about having your fate handed to you in an aircraft with \u201cgetting you there\u201d emblazoned on its side. Astutely, this slogan didn\u2019t add \u201cdead or alive\u201d. I also wanted to acknowledge the role that speculative lifestyle choices had played in my airborne drama and to record my appreciation for the staff at Melbourne\u2019s St Vincent\u2019s Hospital for making my first stay in a medical facility a pleasant one.</p> <p>In characteristically forthright Aussie style, my consultant said he couldn\u2019t believe his luck that he had been handed a real (if barely alive) manifestation of the fabled \u201cGlasgow effect\u201d that blights the lives of working-class, west of Scotland males and that had featured in his tutorials to final-year medical students. Thus I was pleased to fill his boots with an exaggerated account of the challenges of living on the edge and provide my tuppence-worth for medical research just short of actually dying. The great Glaswegian playwright <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/arts_ents/16253476.firebrand-writer-peter-mcdougall-on-friends-foes-and-falling-apart/\" title=\"\">Peter McDougall</a>, who wrote <em>Just Another Saturday</em>, once told me of his concerns for a close friend whom he hadn\u2019t seen for a while.

      "bodyText": "When faced with tribulation, Glaswegian males often feel compelled to reach for humour. This can seem inappropriate, brutal even, but it\u2019s not intended as such. It\u2019s a psychological reflex and one to which we have become genetically predisposed. I feel that much of this stems from decades of fighting adversity when death and sickness were the most persistent neighbourhood pests. To make light of them was to make a statement to your community that you wouldn\u2019t be defeated by them. Besides, if these twin impostors were intent on becoming a part of the local fabric for a while, then best to apply some emotional cosmetics rather than make everyone else miserable. In time, all of them would be expected to take their turn. I always advise debutants at a Glasgow funeral to keep their ears open. Thus, they\u2019ll be treated to a crash course in Glaswegian humour and come to an understanding of one of its greatest charisms. Here, you will see men talking very quickly out of the sides of their mouths between puffs of cigarettes held artfully between thumb and middle finger. As liquor begins to dilute the tension, stiff handshakes give way to manly hugs and nieces and nephews fill their boots with the jingling swag of the occasion. Nor can the deceased expect to be spared the vitriol merely on account of being dead. Soon, all their delinquencies and infractions are discussed, but gently and with something approaching love. This is part of a healing for the living where old wounds are finally dressed and unreconciled debts cancelled. Alongside death and physical suffering, we also like to joke about religion, sex and conflict resolution, mainly as a means of masking our inadequacies in such endeavours. Each of these feature heavily in the sharpest dramas inspired by the look and feel of Glasgow and its people, such as My Name Is Joe; Just Another Saturday and Orphans. It\u2019s almost impossible to make a film or drama featuring Glasgow that doesn\u2019t make you laugh. Four years ago, it was my turn to apply the cosmetic wit when I had a heart attack at 30,000 feet on a plane to Australia to visit my daughter, Clare. Not long afterwards, I made a deal with the editor of these pages that I would only address my brush with mortality if I could do so lightly and while lampooning the Glaswegian inevitability about having your fate handed to you in an aircraft with \u201cgetting you there\u201d emblazoned on its side. Astutely, this slogan didn\u2019t add \u201cdead or alive\u201d. I also wanted to acknowledge the role that speculative lifestyle choices had played in my airborne drama and to record my appreciation for the staff at Melbourne\u2019s St Vincent\u2019s Hospital for making my first stay in a medical facility a pleasant one. In characteristically forthright Aussie style, my consultant said he couldn\u2019t believe his luck that he had been handed a real (if barely alive) manifestation of the fabled \u201cGlasgow effect\u201d that blights the lives of working-class, west of Scotland males and that had featured in his tutorials to final-year medical students. Thus I was pleased to fill his boots with an exaggerated account of the challenges of living on the edge and provide my tuppence-worth for medical research just short of actually dying. The great Glaswegian playwright Peter McDougall, who wrote Just Another Saturday, once told me of his concerns for a close friend whom he hadn\u2019t seen for a while. He called his friend\u2019s mum who put his mind at ease by telling McDougall that her son had merely encountered \u201ca wee touch of leukaemia\u201d. Thus inspired, I duly began to refer to my \u201cwee cardiac issue\u201d. The adjective \u201cwee\u201d is often deployed by Glaswegians to reduce a crisis to something manageable. Others might call this denial. And so, thanks to the Australian (and Scottish) health service, four years and a few lifestyle tweaks later, I find myself making this trip to the other side of the world once more. This is partly to complete my first rudely interrupted visit but it\u2019s also to spend time with Clare, who was recently diagnosed with B-cell lymphoma cancer.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s bold, it\u2019s controversial, it\u2019s a \u00a33m footbridge reuniting two ends of a medieval castle that gave birth to the myths of Merlin and King Arthur. Now, after a delay caused by bad weather last week, Tintagel Castle will finally reopen to the public. Visitors will be able to walk between the two ruins, separated when the original land bridge collapsed several centuries ago. The project has seen English Heritage accused of \u201cDisneyfying\u201d one of the most beautiful sites in Britain, with the Cornwall Association of Local Historians expressing outrage that the head of the wizard Merlin has been carved into a rock face \u2013 proof, for them, that the charity has attempted to turn the site into a \u201cfairytale theme park\u201d devoted to the legend of King Arthur. (And don\u2019t even get them started on the Arthurian bronze that towers over the headland.) But chief executive Kate Mavor has hit back, denying the project is dumbing down history. \u201cIt\u2019s not Mount Rushmore. [The Merlin carving] is really small and actually really hard to find,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cThe generation coming through now are constantly stimulated by imagery, and if you just write something down and say \u2018read this and then imagine\u2019, it\u2019s very hard. If you just put a few interventions very carefully and sensitively \u2026 you can get people excited by history.\u201d Local enthusiasm for the bridge appears to have slightly dampened. \u201cIt looks like the golden gate in the middle of a medieval ruin,\u201d said one resident. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t exactly fit, does it?\u201d But the structure, which uses engineering honed in the Alps and was designed in a competition won by engineering firm Ney &amp; Partners and architects William Matthews, has drummed up huge interest. The response from tourists has been overwhelmingly keen; fed up with constant questions about when the bridge would open, one hotel reception posted a notice directing guests to the beach. The 68-metre bridge will mean visitors are no longer faced with climbing 148 steps to get round the popular tourist site. It is one of the most ambitious, complicated and at times controversial heritage projects seen in Britain in recent years. But, as it opens, Mavor is battling to maintain the organisation that made it happen. How will English Heritage credibly survive? It\u2019s an existential question as much as a financial one \u2013 the charity has to become entirely self-funding by 2023, when an \u00a380m government grant runs out. Balancing the need to draw in large numbers of people and stay true to the organisation\u2019s core purpose is the problem Mavor faces every day. \u201cYou won\u2019t please everyone. We try to stick to what we are for, and that is bringing history to life and basing everything on thorough research and evidence,\u201d she says. Mavor makes a strong case for audiences understanding the past to navigate the future. \u201cBeing connected with the past is really important. Research shows that wellbeing improves when you can see yourself as part of a whole. Belonging and purpose are the two biggest things to feeling a sense of place,\u201d she said. Yet English Heritage, much like the National Trust, has been accused of enforcing a narrow and prescriptive take on English history that has often erased the contribution of women and of black and Asian Britons. Activist and journalist George Monbiot railed against the heritage industry on Thursday, tweeting: \u201cCurators of stately homes leave us, in most cases, entirely ignorant of the enclosure, expulsion, murder and slavery on which they were built.\u201d How important is broadening English Heritage\u2019s remit? \u201cTo be under-represented is something we really understand,\u201d said Mavor. \u201cWe have started to address that and are specifically looking for examples of history that haven\u2019t been told.\u201d She points to Portchester Castle in Hampshire, which in the late 18th century held over 2,500 African Caribbean prisoners of war, as well as the appointment of Professor David Olusoga to English Heritage\u2019s board. She is excited by a forthcoming podcast in partnership with comedian Josie Long on women\u2019s history as another way to help achieve this. \u201cThat\u2019s the joy of online, because there is so much you can do without having to invest in the bricks and mortar of buying a site.

Stonehenge is the biggest money-maker, providing a quarter of admissions income, and Hadrian\u2019s Wall is one of the most visited. The organisation also looks after London\u2019s blue plaque scheme, which honours notable figures in English history. \u201cBack in the day we were accused of being too worthy and dull and focused on the academic, so there will always be people who see things in a different way when you\u2019re trying to appeal to the whole nation and looking after the nation\u2019s assets,\u201d said Mavor. The Rausing family, heirs to the Tetra Pak fortune, donated \u00a32.5m to make the Tintagel project happen after it was mentioned to them by English Heritage chairman Tim Laurence. \u201cThey were very excited by it and they will give us further money later in the year because they\u2019re very enthused by what we do,\u201d said Mavor.

The absence so far of the promised deal with China, the imposition of tariffs and the prospect of a worsening trade war will directly hit consumers and producers.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is interesting is that in every one of these issues, Trump saw a domestic political benefit: getting tough on China, Iran, on Venezuela, with voters in Florida in mind, the spectacle of meeting Kim Jong-un,\u201d said Ben Rhodes, Barack Obama\u2019s speechwriter and foreign policy adviser. \u201cBut whatever short-term benefit there was has been more than eclipsed by the long-term mess he has created.\u201d</p> <p>Trump appears to be aware of his foreign policy deficit as he barrels towards full campaign mode, and is seeking to address it.</p> <p>In the short term, that has amounted to redefining success.</p> <p>In relation to North Korea, that means playing down the original claim that diplomacy with Kim would lead to nuclear disarmament. The emphasis instead has been on Pyongyang\u2019s moratorium on nuclear and missile tests. When North Korea stepped up short range missile launches, the red line was shifted to a block on intercontinental missiles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e710ef1f3ab87e99fb17c47713d09ba2e906ea7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e710ef1f3ab87e99fb17c47713d09ba2e906ea7f/0_369_2958_1774/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un meet in the demilitarized zone on 30 June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un meet in the demilitarized zone on 30 June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy against Iran was intended to change the Tehran government\u2019s behaviour in the region, ending uranium enrichment, making it pull back from involvement, directly or through proxies, in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, and persuade it open new negotiations with the US, outside the multilateral 2015 deal, that Trump abandoned.</p> <p>By those measures, so far the strategy is backfiring. Iran is stepping up its nuclear programme beyond the limits of the 2015 deal. It has become more aggressive in the Persian Gulf, harassing shipping, and it has rejected several overtures from intermediaries offering talks with Trump.</p> <p>However, the Trump administration argues it is making gains by cutting down Tehran\u2019s disposable cash.</p> <p>\u201cWe have denied the regime tens of billions of dollars in revenue they would otherwise spend on strengthening the regime and strengthening their proxies,\u201d said Brian Hook, the US Iran envoy, adding that consequently the Iranian defence budget in 2020 is 28% down on the previous year.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the necessary foreign policy to change the paradigm of Iran\u2019s destabilizing efforts in the Middle East. There\u2019s no other way to accomplish this \u2026 As Cicero said, money is the sinews of war. And Iran does not have the money that it used to.\u201d</p> <p>It is unclear whether tactic of lowering the success threshold will carry Trump through to the election in November next year, as North Korea fires off ever more provocative missiles tests, and Iran breaks free of its nuclear constraints.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s other option would be retake the initiative with bold action. That could take military form, though that would be the last resort. A new conflict on the Korean peninsula or the Persian Gulf would be disastrous, electorally and otherwise. The president was \u201ccocked and loaded\u201d to strike Iran in June but called off the operation at the last moment, when he was warned it could cost him his second term.</p> <p> His instinct is to make an eye-catching deal. He has signaled his interest in another summit with Kim <strong>\u2013 </strong>jubilantly announcing the arrival of another \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/09/trump-kim-jong-un-letter-talks\">very beautiful</a>\u201d letter from the North Korean dictator<strong> -</strong> where he could offer a partial easing of sanctions for the destruction of some of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons infrastructure.</p> <p> Trump\u2019s attempt to talk directly to Iran\u2019s leadership have thus far been rebuffed, but September\u2019s UN general assembly offers another opportunity for a meeting with the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani. It would probably take a significant easing of economic pressure to pull that off.</p> <p>Trump may just think it is worth the risk, even if entailed the departure of his ultra-hawk national security adviser, John Bolton.</p> <p>A partial trade deal might also be engineered with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in which China restarts imports of US agricultural products in return perhaps for the easing of ban on dealing with the Huawei tech giant.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing from what the president has said in the past he\u2019s willing to give more than other people [in his team] are willing to give, but that\u2019s usually the case since he\u2019s transactional and he wants a deal,\u201d said Bonnie Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cSo maybe there could be a prospect for some small deal that emerges in September.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump will be trying to grab the headlines and portray himself as a leader</p> <footer> <cite>Julianne Smith</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trump could seize any such agreement and proclaim it deal of the century. The question would be whether Pyongyang, Tehran or Beijing is prepared to play along, and that depends on whether they see an interest in helping the president win a second term.</p> <p>\u201cIt is remarkable how much agency these countries have,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cCertainly, Iran, China and North Korea will be aware that anything they do will have an impact on the elections \u2026 They have a vote.\u201d</p> <p>Kim has good reason to assist a president who has showered recognition and praise on its leader, so could well consider concessions. Tehran would most certainly like to see him gone, and will be unwilling to help stage diplomatic photo ops. Beijing too is showing signs it would rather not face a second Trump term.</p> <p>In the faces of such challenges from abroad, Trump has demonstrated a willingness to take brinksmanship ever closer to the edge of an all out trade war, or a shooting war.</p> <p>\u201cTrump will be trying to grab the headlines and portray himself as a leader,\u201d said Julianne Smith, a former senior national security official in the Obama White House. \u201cWe will see a series of rash and reckless moves and a lot more drama in the next 18 months.

The absence so far of the promised deal with China, the imposition of tariffs and the prospect of a worsening trade war will directly hit consumers and producers. \u201cWhat is interesting is that in every one of these issues, Trump saw a domestic political benefit: getting tough on China, Iran, on Venezuela, with voters in Florida in mind, the spectacle of meeting Kim Jong-un,\u201d said Ben Rhodes, Barack Obama\u2019s speechwriter and foreign policy adviser. \u201cBut whatever short-term benefit there was has been more than eclipsed by the long-term mess he has created.\u201d Trump appears to be aware of his foreign policy deficit as he barrels towards full campaign mode, and is seeking to address it. In the short term, that has amounted to redefining success. In relation to North Korea, that means playing down the original claim that diplomacy with Kim would lead to nuclear disarmament. The emphasis instead has been on Pyongyang\u2019s moratorium on nuclear and missile tests. When North Korea stepped up short range missile launches, the red line was shifted to a block on intercontinental missiles. The \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy against Iran was intended to change the Tehran government\u2019s behaviour in the region, ending uranium enrichment, making it pull back from involvement, directly or through proxies, in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, and persuade it open new negotiations with the US, outside the multilateral 2015 deal, that Trump abandoned. By those measures, so far the strategy is backfiring. Iran is stepping up its nuclear programme beyond the limits of the 2015 deal. It has become more aggressive in the Persian Gulf, harassing shipping, and it has rejected several overtures from intermediaries offering talks with Trump. However, the Trump administration argues it is making gains by cutting down Tehran\u2019s disposable cash. \u201cWe have denied the regime tens of billions of dollars in revenue they would otherwise spend on strengthening the regime and strengthening their proxies,\u201d said Brian Hook, the US Iran envoy, adding that consequently the Iranian defence budget in 2020 is 28% down on the previous year. \u201cThis is the necessary foreign policy to change the paradigm of Iran\u2019s destabilizing efforts in the Middle East. There\u2019s no other way to accomplish this \u2026 As Cicero said, money is the sinews of war. And Iran does not have the money that it used to.\u201d It is unclear whether tactic of lowering the success threshold will carry Trump through to the election in November next year, as North Korea fires off ever more provocative missiles tests, and Iran breaks free of its nuclear constraints. Trump\u2019s other option would be retake the initiative with bold action. That could take military form, though that would be the last resort. A new conflict on the Korean peninsula or the Persian Gulf would be disastrous, electorally and otherwise. The president was \u201ccocked and loaded\u201d to strike Iran in June but called off the operation at the last moment, when he was warned it could cost him his second term. His instinct is to make an eye-catching deal. He has signaled his interest in another summit with Kim \u2013 jubilantly announcing the arrival of another \u201cvery beautiful\u201d letter from the North Korean dictator - where he could offer a partial easing of sanctions for the destruction of some of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons infrastructure. Trump\u2019s attempt to talk directly to Iran\u2019s leadership have thus far been rebuffed, but September\u2019s UN general assembly offers another opportunity for a meeting with the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani. It would probably take a significant easing of economic pressure to pull that off. Trump may just think it is worth the risk, even if entailed the departure of his ultra-hawk national security adviser, John Bolton. A partial trade deal might also be engineered with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in which China restarts imports of US agricultural products in return perhaps for the easing of ban on dealing with the Huawei tech giant. \u201cI\u2019m guessing from what the president has said in the past he\u2019s willing to give more than other people [in his team] are willing to give, but that\u2019s usually the case since he\u2019s transactional and he wants a deal,\u201d said Bonnie Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cSo maybe there could be a prospect for some small deal that emerges in September.\u201d Trump could seize any such agreement and proclaim it deal of the century. The question would be whether Pyongyang, Tehran or Beijing is prepared to play along, and that depends on whether they see an interest in helping the president win a second term. \u201cIt is remarkable how much agency these countries have,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cCertainly, Iran, China and North Korea will be aware that anything they do will have an impact on the elections \u2026 They have a vote.\u201d Kim has good reason to assist a president who has showered recognition and praise on its leader, so could well consider concessions. Tehran would most certainly like to see him gone, and will be unwilling to help stage diplomatic photo ops. Beijing too is showing signs it would rather not face a second Trump term. In the faces of such challenges from abroad, Trump has demonstrated a willingness to take brinksmanship ever closer to the edge of an all out trade war, or a shooting war. \u201cTrump will be trying to grab the headlines and portray himself as a leader,\u201d said Julianne Smith, a former senior national security official in the Obama White House. \u201cWe will see a series of rash and reckless moves and a lot more drama in the next 18 months. So hold on to your hats.\u201d",

Kim provides a unique and, at times, upsetting insight into what it\u2019s like to be at the centre of such a bizarre, OTT murder case and trial. Aided by producer/former TV and radio host Nancy Glass, she revisits the case, interviewing several witnesses and jurors, some of the legal team on the prosecutors\u2019 side and others involved in the case.</p> <p>For those who are too young to remember, and for those of us who have a vague recall of detail, OJ Simpson was a beloved sportsman-turned-Hollywood-actor prosecuted for the murder of his ex-wife and Ron Goldman. He was acquitted, amid much controversy. Before the trial, Simpson absconded with a friend in a white Ford Bronco and there was a farcical car chase at very slow speed as the cops chased him down, until he eventually gave himself up. This car chase, and the subsequent trial, became some of the most-viewed TV ever in the US. The public furore and commercial brouhaha around the case was unprecedented and, at times, appeared utterly mad. As the podcast recalls, \u201cthere were <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=bxsxUxBiJeM\" title=\"\">Jell-o moulds</a> of Judge Ito for sale outside the courtroom\u201d.</p> <p>The first episode does what every true crime podcast promises it will do but doesn\u2019t: focuses on the victim. Kim Goldman talks to her dad and some of Ron\u2019s friends to establish what kind of person her brother was (and also to nix the prevalent idea that Ron was Nicole Brown Simpson\u2019s lover). At times it strays into good ol\u2019 American mawkishness, but it does highlight the \u201cwhat if\u201d feeling that can afflict those close to sudden death victims. One of Ron\u2019s closest friends still blames herself for not going out with him that night, as she\u2019d promised.</p> <p>In the episodes that follow, Kim unpicks much of what went on. Why, she wonders, wasn\u2019t certain evidence presented to the jury? Why were certain witnesses for the prosecution so badly prepared or, at worst, hostile? There are revelations as to whether the prosecutors were actually ready for the trial, which took place very quickly.</p> <p>The podcast expands its remit to include a recent phone call between OJ Simpson\u2019s very aggressive lawyer and Glass (OJ Simpson has joined Twitter since the podcast started, presumably to put his own version of events forward). There are interviews with jury members, with journalists, a discussion of the civil case that the Goldmans successfully brought against Simpson, as well as what domestic violence means and what it\u2019s like to live your life having lost a member of your family in such a way. Though some episodes work better than others, Goldman is dignified and insightful throughout, holding your sympathy and attention from start to finish.

The controversial move by India\u2019s Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, has led to fears of widespread unrest and paralysed normal life as tens of thousands of extra troops and security personnel were dispatched to add to the estimated 500,000 already present, making it one of the world\u2019s most militarised zones.

Standing order 24, paragraph 2.7 of the cabinet manual and section 2(3) of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act have become the must-reads of the summer. Family outings have been interrupted by battles to find phone reception at various beauty spots to talk to opposition MPs.</p> <p>After a week that saw Boris Johnson and his key adviser <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2017/jul/18/dominic-cummings-career-psychopath-david-davis-thick-as-mince\" title=\"\">Dominic Cummings</a> make clear threats about leaving the EU whatever the cost at the end of October, concerned MPs have already begun to plan. New governments, emergency legislation, breaches of convention and court cases are already being proposed by what several described as the \u201crebel alliance\u201d. Many anti-no deal MPs are also concerned about the lack of coherence so far. All those who spoke to the <em>Observer</em> had doubts that no-deal Brexit could be avoided.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone has to pull together, and that is never a guarantee,\u201d said one former Tory minister trying to coordinate efforts. \u201cWe are trying to hold together an unholy coalition of moderate Labour, Labour frontbench, Lib Dems, Scottish Nationalists, minor parties, independents and moderate Tories. It\u2019s difficult.\u201d However, details of some of the plans are already emerging.</p> <p><strong>Anti-</strong><strong>no </strong><strong>deal laws</strong></p> <p>Senior figures within both the Labour and Conservative parties believe that the simplest way to stop no deal is through a new law, forcing the prime minister to ask for an extension to Britain\u2019s EU membership. This is the focus of early efforts.</p> <p>The rebels see two possible routes. The easiest move is to hijack any legislation that the government proposes in the autumn. Yet the plotters know that the government may simply refuse to propose any new laws to avoid such an ambush. \u201cThe moment there is legislation, we can amend away,\u201d said one plotter. \u201cBut their strategy is clearly not to legislate about anything and have endless debates in parliament about the colour green instead.\u201d A senior Labour figure added: \u201cThere is legislation needed to do a no-deal Brexit in a responsible way, but we can\u2019t assume that Johnson and Cummings will do it.\u201d</p> <p>There is a second route that most believe will have to be tried \u2013 the unusual move of backbenchers seizing the parliamentary timetable from the government in order to pass their own laws. It will not be easy and will probably require breaches in convention by the Commons Speaker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-bercow\" title=\"\">John Bercow.</a> There is talk of MPs calling an emergency debate and amending it for their purposes \u2013 something that is not normally allowed. Precedents are set to be parked.</p> <p><strong>Toppling the government</strong></p> <p>While some in Labour are pushing for an immediate vote of no confidence in Johnson when MPs return in September, it is already becoming clear that this would have a better chance of succeeding closer to the Brexit cliff edge. One anti-no deal Tory explained: \u201cI would find it hard to no-confidence the prime minister before he had really done anything.\u201d Others, like the former Tory attorney general and rebel figurehead <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dominicgrieve\" title=\"\">Dominic Grieve,</a> have said they will do it if necessary. Voting to remove Johnson, however, is the easy bit. A no-confidence vote starts the clock on a two-week period to find a new government \u2013 and an election is called if a replacement cannot be found. Proposing the date of that election technically falls to Johnson \u2013 with suggestions that he could set it for immediately after Brexit day.</p> <p>An obvious problem with the alternative government plan has already emerged. As leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn states that it should be led by him. Yet the Lib Dems and moderate Tories will support only a temporary administration headed by a neutral figure. The stand-off has led to an outbreak of what has been dubbed \u201cMeatloaf Remainerism\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X_ViIPA-Gc\" title=\"\">(I would do anything to stop no deal, but I won\u2019t do that).</a></p> <p>The latest iteration of the \u201calternative government\u201d plan assumes that Corbyn has the right to try and fail to form a government. Then, a third option \u2013 a government probably headed by a moderate Conservative such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/david-lidington\" title=\"\">David Lidington</a> \u2013 is being considered.</p> <p>It would request a Brexit extension and call an election. \u201cIt is not a government of national unity \u2013 it is an emergency government,\u201d said one supporter of the idea. Without the Labour leadership\u2019s support, it is hard to build a majority for such an idea, but a surprising number of MPs are at least entertaining it. \u201cI think it would be very challenging to get a parliamentary majority behind one name, but anything might be possible in the autumn,\u201d said a senior Tory rebel.</p> <p><strong>The courts</strong></p> <p>Could Johnson <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/occasions/prorogation/\" title=\"\">prorogue parliament?</a> Could he refuse to resign after a no-confidence vote? Could he name an election date that falls after Britain has left the EU? Should the Queen simply dismiss him? These are all threats that have been raised by Johnson allies \u2013 and steps are already being taken to test them in the courts.</p> <p>The <em>Observer</em> understands that a legal action aimed at preventing Johnson from shutting down parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit, lodged last week, has been given permission to proceed. A timetable for the case is expected to be agreed this week. The case has been lodged in Scotland by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jolyon-maugham\" title=\"\">Jo Maugham QC\u2019s</a> <a href=\"https://goodlawproject.org/\" title=\"\">Good Law Project.</a></p> <p>Other legal teams are drawing up a case designed to prevent Johnson from refusing to resign should he face a no-confidence vote \u2013 and also limit his powers to circumvent parliament more generally. They believe that the sabre-rattling from No 10 could help them, as it may help prove a willingness by the executive to exclude parliament.</p> <p><strong>Hold fire...</strong></p> <p>There is already frustration that all the talk of constitutional tweaks and breaches of convention is exactly what Johnson and Cummings want \u2013 the spectacle of Remain MPs using obscure devices to prevent Britain leaving the EU. They argue that it is the perfect context for Downing St to wage a \u201cpeople vs parliament\u201d election campaign that unites Leave voters under the Conservative banner, giving a majority to Johnson. They are proposing an alternative approach: allow some of the real effects of a no-deal Brexit to become clearer, and concentrate on the fact that such an outcome is profoundly undemocratic.</p> <p>As one recently departed cabinet minister puts it: \u201cThe focus on process helps Cummings, frames the debate as people vs parliament and crowds out the focus on the big questions about the substance of no deal. My side of the argument needs to get away from process on to substance.\u201d</p> <p>The People\u2019s Vote campaign for a second referendum has similar concerns. \u201cCummings wants to pretend anyone against the imposition of no-deal is somehow undemocratic by focusing on arcane procedures and parliamentary instruments,\u201d said a senior campaign source. \u201cWe will be using the next few days to reassert fundamental democratic principles about why Johnson cannot force no-deal on the British people when he himself ruled it out in 2016.\u201d</p>",

Should the Queen simply dismiss him? These are all threats that have been raised by Johnson allies \u2013 and steps are already being taken to test them in the courts. The Observer understands that a legal action aimed at preventing Johnson from shutting down parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit, lodged last week, has been given permission to proceed. A timetable for the case is expected to be agreed this week. The case has been lodged in Scotland by Jo Maugham QC\u2019s Good Law Project. Other legal teams are drawing up a case designed to prevent Johnson from refusing to resign should he face a no-confidence vote \u2013 and also limit his powers to circumvent parliament more generally. They believe that the sabre-rattling from No 10 could help them, as it may help prove a willingness by the executive to exclude parliament. Hold fire... There is already frustration that all the talk of constitutional tweaks and breaches of convention is exactly what Johnson and Cummings want \u2013 the spectacle of Remain MPs using obscure devices to prevent Britain leaving the EU. They argue that it is the perfect context for Downing St to wage a \u201cpeople vs parliament\u201d election campaign that unites Leave voters under the Conservative banner, giving a majority to Johnson. They are proposing an alternative approach: allow some of the real effects of a no-deal Brexit to become clearer, and concentrate on the fact that such an outcome is profoundly undemocratic. As one recently departed cabinet minister puts it: \u201cThe focus on process helps Cummings, frames the debate as people vs parliament and crowds out the focus on the big questions about the substance of no deal. My side of the argument needs to get away from process on to substance.\u201d The People\u2019s Vote campaign for a second referendum has similar concerns. \u201cCummings wants to pretend anyone against the imposition of no-deal is somehow undemocratic by focusing on arcane procedures and parliamentary instruments,\u201d said a senior campaign source. \u201cWe will be using the next few days to reassert fundamental democratic principles about why Johnson cannot force no-deal on the British people when he himself ruled it out in 2016.\u201d",

Coombs Marr promised nothing but jokes, just gag after gag, with no clever conceits to distract from the daftness. Anyone who has seen her previous adventurous and form-bending work as her alter ego, the sexist comedian Dave, would be wise to be suspicious of that promise, but her return to performing as herself after seven years is wonderful. She pulls that abject silliness \u2013 just gag after gag, as promised \u2013 and still sneaks it all into a clever conceit that circles and spirals into mind-melting joy. I left, as a punter should, with my face aching. Six more shows to see Bryony Kimmings: I\u2019m a Phoenix, Bitch (Pleasance One) The word-of-mouth, you-must-see-this, beg-a-ticket show. Performance artist Kimmings turns a terrible year \u2013 postnatal depression, relationship breakdown, desperately ill child \u2013 into a magical feminist musical. Anguis (Gilded Balloon Teviot, Dining Room) There are few things more anxiety-inducing for a journalist than watching a play about an interview going badly, but this is so much more than that. Actor-turned-playwright Sheila Atim puts Cleopatra in a Desert Island Discs-ish chair, slowly shifting the steady ground beneath the three players. Eddie Izzard: Wunderbar (Gilded Balloon Teviot) A second chance to catch Izzard in addition to his work-in-progress Dickens reading, Expectations of Great Expectations. Wunderbar, his first show in five years, will preview from 12-14 August before he takes it on tour in September. Sarah Keyworth: Pacific (Pleasance, Baby Grand) Following her best newcomer nomination for Dark Horse last year, Keyworth (above) returns to the theme of gender with Pacific, while offering the other side of the relationship that Catherine Bohart mines for her show Lemon (reviewed opposite). Total Immediate Collective Imminent Terrestrial Salvation (The Studio) Playwright Tim Crouch recently made the jump to TV with the low-key brilliance of Don\u2019t Forget the Driver. You\u2019d be a fool not to see what he\u2019s up to now, with a play that makes the audience part of the performance. Phoebe Robinson: Sorry, Harriet Tubman (Assembly George Square) US comedian Robinson arrives in Edinburgh on 12 August. Fans of her podcasts 2 Dope Queens and Sooo Many White Guys will be thrilled to catch her debut UK standup show.",

Unlike most, I avoided south-east Asia and instead spent two months living in Nepal, working in a school that educates children from areas affected by the 2015 earthquake. It was so rewarding to fully immerse myself in their lifestyle rather than spend only a few days visiting the main attractions. The whole experience of adjusting to a new environment made me a much more self-assured individual, far less afraid to step outside my comfort zone. </p> <p><strong>Phoebe, 22<br></strong>I, on the other hand, took the \u201cclassic\u201d gap year route, spending three months travelling around south-east Asia and Australia. My time away strengthened my character considerably and for the first time in my life I felt what it was like to be truly independent. Experiences such as losing my passport at the Cambodian border, or the feeling of arriving on the night train into a bustling Vietnamese city at 5am, were daunting, but the cultures we were immersed in and the places we saw far exceeded my expectations. I was not originally considering a gap year, but I am hugely grateful for the time it allowed me to rest and mature before the next stage of my life. </p> <h2><strong>No time for a gap year but want to expand your horizons pre-university?</strong></h2> <p>Five tips for summer breaks:</p> <p><strong>1 Travel bargains<br></strong>Super-cheap breaks to interesting places are readily available on an ongoing basis to those who know where to look \u2013 sign up to email services such as <a href=\"https://jacksflightclub.com/\">Jack\u2019s Flight Club</a> and keep an eye on sites such as <a href=\"http://flynous.com\">flynous.com</a> and <a href=\"http://holidaypirates.com\">holidaypirates.com</a> for the latest sales and error fares.</p> <p><strong>2 Staycations<br></strong>From <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/jul/09/10-best-new-places-to-stay-on-uk-coast-huts-cottages\">Devon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/feb/18/cornwall-celtic-walk-coast-path-trail-hike\">Cornwall</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/apr/16/easy-bikepacking-peak-district-camping-cycling-trip\">Peak District</a> and all the way up to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/may/25/dark-side-scotland-north-coast-500-route-speeding-congestion-protest\">North Coast 500</a> road trip around the north of Scotland, the UK is teeming with bucolic staycation options. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/oct/12/the-east-london-hotel-bethnal-green-review\">London</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/jun/15/alt-city-guide-tp-glasgow-bars-clubs-restaurants-galleries\">Glasgow</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/feb/27/craft-beer-enthusiasts-guide-to-manchester\">Manchester</a> are top picks if the bright lights are more your thing.</p> <p><strong>3 Language learning<br></strong>Intensive language-learning courses can be a great way to cram some serious personal development into a short time, and they often entail travelling to a fascinating location.

      "bodyText": "A government report has recommended slashing tuition fees and bringing back maintenance grants. This might sound like cause for celebration, but it won\u2019t mean much until the changes are implemented. Even then, students would actually pay more to go to university, says Martin Lewis, from Money Saving Expert. The amount you owe in tuition fees is irrelevant because most people never pay it back in full, he says. But the government\u2019s Augar review proposes increasing the loan repayment period from 30 to 40 years, so students will likely end up paying more overall. So, should you take a gap year with the hope of paying less for tuition later on? \u201cI would say no,\u201d says Michael McTeague, welfare and funding adviser at the University of Northumbria. The proposed changes, which would come into effect in September 2021, might never happen, he points out. What you should consider, however, is parental contribution. In England, the amount you get for your maintenance loan is determined by how much your parents earn. Whereas tuition fees are paid directly to the university rather than the individual student, maintenance loans are paid into a student\u2019s account in instalments over the year.

      "body": "<p>They always had a little light in the window,\u201d Gabriele Tottenham says, of my grandparents\u2019 house. Her late husband Ashley had grown up two doors down. \u201cHe loved going there,\u201d she says, \u201cwhere there was always a candle burning.\u201d</p> <p>Ashley\u2019s father, George Tottenham, was landlord here at Blaney, a medium-sized rural estate eight miles outside Enniskillen, on the western bank of Lower Lough Erne. He and his family lived in the main house, while my grandfather, James McGullion, his cattle master, was housed in a small cottage near the entrance to their land. From the 1940s until his retirement 30 years later, his home housed as many as eight people: himself, his wife May, her mother Catherine, and the pair\u2019s five children. The youngest of these was my mother Sheila, who died in 1991, shortly before I turned six.</p> <p>This estate is now home to Blaney Spa and Yoga Centre and its holiday homes, the Inishbeg Cottages, which are rented out for spa guests and tourists. Having always loved hearing about the vaguely <em>Downton</em>-esque trappings of my mother\u2019s childhood, I set off from Derry with my family to check it out for myself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"885ef68f911804e36e1ec7cce80e07c44bb20aec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/885ef68f911804e36e1ec7cce80e07c44bb20aec/0_117_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Devenish Island, a monastic site from the early Christian period.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Spectacular\u2019 \u2026 Devenish Island, a monastic site from the early Christian period.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The estate is a little different to when my mother knew it, as is evident when I pop into the spa area and find that morning\u2019s yoga class sipping coffee on the sun-drenched porch. The centre isn\u2019t bustling, but offers massage, sauna, hot tub and Gabriele\u2019s own yoga classes. One of her pupils, a woman in her 70s, approaches as I enter, squinting at my face like an eye chart. \u201cOh my gosh, you\u2019re like her,\u201d she says, meaning my mother, who, it turns out, she used to bus to school with as a child.</p> <p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re digging up the roots?\u201d she says, when I describe my trip. \u201cYes,\u201d I reply. \u201cI guess I am.\u201d</p> <p>And the roots are easily found. We are shown inside my mother\u2019s house, which still stands but is currently between renovations. My dad tells us how it looked when he last saw it in the early 70s, gesturing to long-gone fittings and appliances, rearranging the floorplan with points and waves. \u201cI was never allowed upstairs, of course,\u201d he reminds us, since his last visits were before they were married, and he a good Catholic boy. It\u2019s my wife who discreetly challenges him on this point, when we ascend the staircase, and find he is immediately able to tell us how the top floor looked as well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62a6a8d97d0d3c929ebc8f77591e6e51103a22dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62a6a8d97d0d3c929ebc8f77591e6e51103a22dc/375_702_3170_1902/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Old town road: Blaney long ago.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Old town road \u2026 Blaney long ago.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seamas O'Reilly</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Our own home for the trip is the nine-bed Blaney Island Cottage. It is one of several cottages within the estate, all self-catering. Far from the clay floors and outdoor toilet of my mother\u2019s youth, these are beautifully turned out. Our bedroom has been equipped with a cot and we are issued instructions for the boiler and the fire, opting to use the latter, which soon suffuses the house with the soft, boggy sweetness of woodsmoke.</p> <p>The real showstopper, however, is the extraordinary view from the front window. The hills round here don\u2019t roll so much as leap in great big blobs, like children\u2019s toys hastily swept under a dark green rug. County Fermanagh is like Ireland in miniature: its vistas wide, its towns tidy, its 4G variable. It has no coast, but makes up for that with the long, winding, picture-postcard grandeur of the Lough, and the 365 islands that lie within it. The Erne is split into two portions, Upper and Lower but, in a fit of confusing nomenclature which is very much a Fermanagh trademark, these are situated paradoxically, with the Lower \u201cabove\u201d its Upper counterpart on the map. My father takes great delight in telling me this as we drive from the cottages and take in some local sights.</p> <p>Aside from being an expert on Fermanagh\u2019s lesser-spotted nooks and crannies, my dad also spent 40 years with the Northern Irish Water Service as an engineer, so this trip handily combines three of his specialist subjects: the extraordinary natural beauty of his home county; the intricacies of Northern Ireland\u2019s waterways; and schooling his know-it-all son on things about which he actually-knows-nothing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fba142e616cf6432c941f0ba06cb9da666d7a9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fba142e616cf6432c941f0ba06cb9da666d7a9f/0_459_3674_4593/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Two faced stone / On burial ground, / God-eyed, sex-mouthed\u2019: Boa Island.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Two faced stone / On burial ground, / God-eyed, sex-mouthed\u2019 \u2026 Boa Island.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Munday/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We journey to Boa Island and step out to see the remarkable Janus figures of Caldragh Cemetery, the sixth-century stoneworks captured in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/14/seamus-heaney-helps-heal-wounds-ireland-border-brexit\" title=\"\">Seamus Heaney</a>\u2019s poem January God: \u201ctwo faced stone / On burial ground, / God-eyed, sex-mouthed\u201d. Here, Fermanagh\u2019s nomenclature proves, again, deceptive. They don\u2019t depict the Roman god Janus at all, but a different, two-faced Celtic deity whose true name has been lost to antiquity; more roots well dug, but clinging to secrets still.</p> <p>We travel by ferry to Devenish Island, a spectacular monastic site also from the early Christian period and famous for having the finest preserved round tower in Ireland. It is also among the more stunning places from which to view the surrounding lough.</p> <p>The best view, however, comes from the cottages the following morning. Knowing how much I love scenery, my infant son is good enough to rouse me at 5am, where I catch the eerie, milk-like fog ambling in across the placid surface of the Lough. As mid-morning arrives, the mist departs, replaced by perfect sun and crystal-clear sky; an effect enhanced by the gorgeous, complacent prattle of birdsong, ubiquitous here from every angle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"af29d7d4154bf86b7e70d1f5d14402a6775e68b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af29d7d4154bf86b7e70d1f5d14402a6775e68b3/0_559_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Great position: one of Blaney Spa and Yoga Centre\u2019s cottages.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Great position \u2026 one of Blaney Spa and Yoga Centre\u2019s cottages.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seamas O'Reilly</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gabriele, a gracious host and delightful company, offers a massage treatment overlooking the Lough in all its magnificence; its dotted islands, its darting, diving swifts and the distant reeling of hobbyist fishermen languidly drifting along the glassy lake. Patricia, my mother\u2019s dearest friend, once said she thought my mum gained her calm from this place. \u201cHow could it not?\u201d she emphasised. Lying here I find myself agreeing.</p> <p>Gabriele speaks movingly of how practising yoga and massage have been therapeutic for her, both in grieving for her husband \u2013 who, like my mother, died tragically young of cancer \u2013 but also as a salve for the wounds of the wider community. The yoga centre was part-funded by a grant from the Reconciliation Fund set up after the Good Friday Agreement. Blaney is, in every sense, a place of peace; non-denominational, unsectarian, a hub for community and a platform for quiet reflection.</p> <p>An oasis of calm that reflects the stately beauty of Fermanagh, while also preserving the roots of what went here before, Blaney is a light in the window, and one I hope never goes out.</p> <h2><strong>Way to to</strong></h2> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.ryanair.com/gb/en/\">Ryanair</a> </em><em>flies from several UK airports to several on the island of Ireland </em><em>from around \u00a340 return.

My dad tells us how it looked when he last saw it in the early 70s, gesturing to long-gone fittings and appliances, rearranging the floorplan with points and waves. \u201cI was never allowed upstairs, of course,\u201d he reminds us, since his last visits were before they were married, and he a good Catholic boy. It\u2019s my wife who discreetly challenges him on this point, when we ascend the staircase, and find he is immediately able to tell us how the top floor looked as well. Our own home for the trip is the nine-bed Blaney Island Cottage. It is one of several cottages within the estate, all self-catering. Far from the clay floors and outdoor toilet of my mother\u2019s youth, these are beautifully turned out. Our bedroom has been equipped with a cot and we are issued instructions for the boiler and the fire, opting to use the latter, which soon suffuses the house with the soft, boggy sweetness of woodsmoke. The real showstopper, however, is the extraordinary view from the front window. The hills round here don\u2019t roll so much as leap in great big blobs, like children\u2019s toys hastily swept under a dark green rug. County Fermanagh is like Ireland in miniature: its vistas wide, its towns tidy, its 4G variable. It has no coast, but makes up for that with the long, winding, picture-postcard grandeur of the Lough, and the 365 islands that lie within it. The Erne is split into two portions, Upper and Lower but, in a fit of confusing nomenclature which is very much a Fermanagh trademark, these are situated paradoxically, with the Lower \u201cabove\u201d its Upper counterpart on the map. My father takes great delight in telling me this as we drive from the cottages and take in some local sights. Aside from being an expert on Fermanagh\u2019s lesser-spotted nooks and crannies, my dad also spent 40 years with the Northern Irish Water Service as an engineer, so this trip handily combines three of his specialist subjects: the extraordinary natural beauty of his home county; the intricacies of Northern Ireland\u2019s waterways; and schooling his know-it-all son on things about which he actually-knows-nothing. We journey to Boa Island and step out to see the remarkable Janus figures of Caldragh Cemetery, the sixth-century stoneworks captured in Seamus Heaney\u2019s poem January God: \u201ctwo faced stone / On burial ground, / God-eyed, sex-mouthed\u201d. Here, Fermanagh\u2019s nomenclature proves, again, deceptive. They don\u2019t depict the Roman god Janus at all, but a different, two-faced Celtic deity whose true name has been lost to antiquity; more roots well dug, but clinging to secrets still. We travel by ferry to Devenish Island, a spectacular monastic site also from the early Christian period and famous for having the finest preserved round tower in Ireland. It is also among the more stunning places from which to view the surrounding lough. The best view, however, comes from the cottages the following morning. Knowing how much I love scenery, my infant son is good enough to rouse me at 5am, where I catch the eerie, milk-like fog ambling in across the placid surface of the Lough. As mid-morning arrives, the mist departs, replaced by perfect sun and crystal-clear sky; an effect enhanced by the gorgeous, complacent prattle of birdsong, ubiquitous here from every angle. Gabriele, a gracious host and delightful company, offers a massage treatment overlooking the Lough in all its magnificence; its dotted islands, its darting, diving swifts and the distant reeling of hobbyist fishermen languidly drifting along the glassy lake. Patricia, my mother\u2019s dearest friend, once said she thought my mum gained her calm from this place. \u201cHow could it not?\u201d she emphasised. Lying here I find myself agreeing. Gabriele speaks movingly of how practising yoga and massage have been therapeutic for her, both in grieving for her husband \u2013 who, like my mother, died tragically young of cancer \u2013 but also as a salve for the wounds of the wider community. The yoga centre was part-funded by a grant from the Reconciliation Fund set up after the Good Friday Agreement. Blaney is, in every sense, a place of peace; non-denominational, unsectarian, a hub for community and a platform for quiet reflection. An oasis of calm that reflects the stately beauty of Fermanagh, while also preserving the roots of what went here before, Blaney is a light in the window, and one I hope never goes out. Way to to Ryanair flies from several UK airports to several on the island of Ireland from around \u00a340 return.

It seemed to have got its strategy right by owning its own hotels, airline and cruise ships instead of packaging others\u2019 together for slim margins. It bought extra ships to meet booming demand for cruises and became adept at selling its customers \u201cexperiences\u201d, such as a visit to a ruin or a water park.</p> <p>As recently as December, Tui reported a fourth consecutive year of earnings up 10% or more and was confident about its prospects. But after two profit warnings this year, investors are braced for bad news when the Anglo-German tour operator reports third-quarter results on Tuesday.</p> <p>The first profit warning was in February. Demand for holidays weakened as consumers, still reeling from the boiling-hot summer of 2018, held off booking foreign trips. Many of those who did plan to travel opted for Turkey and north Africa, leaving the company with too much capacity in Spain. The weak pound also made it more expensive for Tui\u2019s tour business to buy holidays in sterling.</p> <p>When Tui issued a second warning in March, the problem was the grounding of Boeing\u2019s 737 Max <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/17/boeing-737-max-ethiopian-airlines-crash\" title=\"\">after two fatal crashes</a>.

      "bodyText": "In what feels like an increasingly volatile world, it wasn\u2019t long ago that Tui was steering a smooth course through the ups and downs of the tourist trade. While its rival Thomas Cook went from one mishap to another, Tui, which traded as Thomson in the UK until 2017, kept reporting solid results. It seemed to have got its strategy right by owning its own hotels, airline and cruise ships instead of packaging others\u2019 together for slim margins. It bought extra ships to meet booming demand for cruises and became adept at selling its customers \u201cexperiences\u201d, such as a visit to a ruin or a water park. As recently as December, Tui reported a fourth consecutive year of earnings up 10% or more and was confident about its prospects. But after two profit warnings this year, investors are braced for bad news when the Anglo-German tour operator reports third-quarter results on Tuesday. The first profit warning was in February. Demand for holidays weakened as consumers, still reeling from the boiling-hot summer of 2018, held off booking foreign trips. Many of those who did plan to travel opted for Turkey and north Africa, leaving the company with too much capacity in Spain. The weak pound also made it more expensive for Tui\u2019s tour business to buy holidays in sterling. When Tui issued a second warning in March, the problem was the grounding of Boeing\u2019s 737 Max after two fatal crashes. Tui\u2019s fleet of about 150 aircraft included 15 of the 737 Max, with eight more due to start flying in May. The company estimated the cost of the grounding, including leasing replacement planes, at about \u20ac300m (\u00a3280m) if the Max stayed on the ground till the end of the summer. In that scenario, underlying annual earnings would be 26% less than the \u20ac1.18bn in 2018, it said. Airlines have since signalled the planes will not be flying any time soon and there are doubts if the 737 Max will go back into service at all. Ian Forrest, an analyst at online stockbroker the Share Centre, said: \u201cPeople will want to hear more detail from the company about what their current estimate is [for the 737 Max grounding] because the situation is shifting all the time.\u201d The grounding has reverberated throughout the travel industry. Ryanair has curbed expansion plans as a result and has said it may shut some airport bases. If things weren\u2019t bad enough, Brexit is hitting consumer confidence, forcing travel companies to battle for bookings and sending prices down. Tui\u2019s shares have lost almost half their value in the past year and with an unusually high dividend yield of about 8%, the payout looks to be under threat. Forrest said: \u201cHotels and cruises should still be a positive, but things are changing so much that it\u2019s hard to know what to expect.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "I continue to recommend re-reading Joseph Heller\u2019s great novel Catch-22 for those of us who want to avoid being driven crazy by this Brexit farce. As we are told that the cabinet is operating on a \u201cwar footing\u201d and that frantic preparations are made for the austerity and hardship that would follow no deal, my mind goes back to the shortages I witnessed as a small boy during and after the second world war. But they were not self-inflicted. The prospect of no deal is. In Catch\u201122, Milo Minderbinder bombs his own men: \u201cHe had landed another contract with the Germans, this time to bomb his own outfit.\u201d There is no getting away from it: this is a rightwing coup. I agree with Ferdinand Mount, once head of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s policy unit at Downing Street in what now look like less disturbing times. Writing in the current London Review of Books, Mount sees echoes of Mussolini\u2019s rise to power, in that \u201cyes, [Johnson] has come to power by strictly constitutional means\u201d; it is what happens after that matters, and the do-or-die approach of Johnson and his warlord Dominic Cummings is truly disturbing. As my former Observer colleague Neal Ascherson says in the same vintage issue of the LRB: \u201cWe have leading Tories \u2013 not only Johnson \u2013 apparently prepared to suspend a sovereign parliament in order to force through a Brexit meant to restore the sovereignty of parliament.\u201d In Heller\u2019s tale, Minderbinder did it for the money.

To less financially sophisticated Leave voters \u2013 if there are any still prepared to read this anti-Brexit column \u2013 I say, citing the old Chinese proverb: be careful what you wish for, especially as you contemplate the foreign-exchange cost of holidays abroad. The media are now replete with speculation about how the Remain cause might be able to thwart Johnson and his gang. But we are told that Cummings has come up with the idea of a \u201cpeople versus the politicians\u201d election.

In which context I was delighted recently to meet a Cambridge undergraduate, Lara Spirit, who is a leading light behind a countrywide movement to energise the young in protesting against \u201cthe government\u2019s intention of forcing a hard Brexit on our generation without our consent\u201d. By needlessly inflicting the referendum and all that follows on this nation, David Cameron has occasionally (and often not jokingly) been labelled \u201cthe worst prime minister since Lord North\u201d \u2013 the man who is historically blamed for losing the American colonies.

      "body": "<p>When Boris Johnson, as editor of the <em>Spectator,</em> published a poem in 2004 calling the Scots a \u201cverminous race\u201d that deserved \u201ccomprehensive extermination\u201d, he may not have imagined it could come back to haunt him 15 years later in his first weeks as prime minister.</p> <p>\u201cThe Scotch \u2013 what a verminous race!\u201d begins Friendly Fire by James Michie. \u201cCanny, pushy, chippy, they\u2019re all over the place / Battening off us with false bonhomie / Polluting our stock, undermining our economy.\u201d</p> <p>The purportedly satirical poem is no longer available on the <em>Spectator</em>\u2019s website, but it is remembered with cold fury by some in the fractured, but relatively conservative market town of Inverurie in Aberdeenshire. \u201cIf you\u2019re at the receiving end to being likened to vermin, you\u2019re not impressed,\u201d Rae Jardine, a local Scottish National Party member, said with restraint.</p> <p>Jardine was speaking last week just after <a href=\"https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2019/08/my-scotland-poll-yes-to-independence-takes-the-lead/\" title=\"\">an opinion poll</a> showed the first lead for an independent Scotland for more than two years, and shortly before shadow chancellor John McDonnell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/06/john-mcdonnell-open-to-second-scottish-independence-vote\" title=\"\">triggered a row</a> by saying his party would allow a second independence referendum north of the border if Labour was in government.</p> <p>Next weekend, thousands of people are expected to join a pro-independence march in Aberdeen. The city voted 58.6% to 41.4% against independence in 2014 but some say it is now shifting behind Yes in the face of a no-deal Brexit \u2013 opposed by a majority north of the border \u2013 and an instinctive antipathy to Johnson. The prime minister, seen by many as dismissive of Scottish views, was recently described by Ian Blackford, leader of the SNP at Westminster, as a \u201crecruiting tool\u201d for the independence cause.</p> <p>Indeed, these twin factors, Johnson and a hard Brexit, could be a tipping point which threatens the very survival of the United Kingdom.</p> <p>In Inverurie, Andrew Jenkins voted No to an independent Scotland in 2014 but is now tilting reluctantly towards Yes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like Brexit and Johnson to change my mind but it may well do,\u201d he said. If there was a referendum in the next couple of years, \u201cit would certainly be a more difficult choice this time than last time\u201d.</p> <p>Libbie Allison was too young to take part in the 2014 referendum, but her vote would have been No. \u201cI felt that Scotland might not be strong enough to be independent,\u201d she said. Now, aged 19, \u201cI would vote Yes, which is sad because I love Britain. I don\u2019t feel England\u2019s views match with Scotland\u2019s any more. We can still have our shared history and culture, but it feels we have been dragged into something [Brexit] we didn\u2019t vote for.\u201d Asked what she thought of Johnson, she threw her head back and groaned. \u201cOh my God. He has made us look like a joke.\u201d</p> <p>About 17 miles northwest of Aberdeen, Inverurie is a quietly prosperous town, cleaving to tradition, resistant to upheaval. Its population is growing; there are jobs to be had in the dominant industries of agriculture, oil and gas; crime and antisocial behaviour are rare; house prices and rents are high, pushed up by demand. The town lies in what has been a Lib Dem-Tory marginal constituency.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/scot_poll-zip/giv-39029Lb47X0L8ISX/\" data-alt=\"Scottish graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/scot_poll-zip/giv-39029Lb47X0L8ISX/\">Scottish graphic</a> </figure>  <p>In the past five years, the public here has gone to the polls six times against the backdrop of an increasingly complex and turbulent political landscape. After Scottish, UK (twice) and European elections plus two referendums, the broad-brush picture is a place opposed to both independence and Brexit, and see-sawing between the Tories and the Nationalists.</p> <p>In the first of those votes, the 2014 referendum, Aberdeenshire voted 60-40 against independence. Yet the following year, Alex Salmond, the former leader of the SNP and first minister, took the Westminster seat of Gordon, in which Inverurie sits.</p> <p>In the 2016 Brexit referendum, the area voted Remain by 55.5% to 44.5%. In Scottish parliament elections the same year, it backed the SNP. Then, in the UK parliament election of 2017, Salmond was turfed out in favour of Colin Clark, a pro-Brexit Conservative whose campaign, some say, was aided by anti-nationalist tactical voting by Liberal Democrat supporters. Earlier this year, in the EU elections, the SNP took three out of six seats in Scotland, with the Tories, Lib Dems and Brexit party gaining one each. Labour polled less than 3% of the total vote in Aberdeenshire; \u201cthey\u2019re finished round here,\u201d said one local.</p> <p>Although many people are reticent about discussing politics, the underlying mood is \u201cextremely divisive\u201d, according to a local Conservative official. One lunchtime customer in the Gordon Highlander pub said he was staunchly pro-Union but declined to give his name in case he got \u201ca brick through the window\u201d from the nationalists. Johnson, he warned, was \u201cmanna from heaven for Nicola Sturgeon\u201d, the SNP leader and first minister.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People understand what Boris is on about... The SNP have poured out this bile that he's anti-Scottish</p> <footer> <cite>Colin Clark MP</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Clark, the local MP and now a Scottish minister in Johnson\u2019s government, flatly rejected such a notion. \u201cBoris is a hugely popular figure, full stop, because he connects with the general public. People understand what Boris is on about. The press has tried to paint him as being divisive.</p> <p>\u201cNicola Sturgeon and the SNP and the press in Scotland have poured out this bile that he\u2019s somehow anti-Scottish, but people need to judge him as prime minister by what he achieves.\u201d He will, Clark added, \u201cmake all of the United Kingdom prosperous\u201d.</p> <p>At least two reports have suggested otherwise. In 2017, the Centre for Cities thinktank concluded that Aberdeen would be the UK city <a href=\"https://www.centreforcities.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/17-07-26-Brexit-trade-and-the-economic-impacts-on-UK-cities.pdf\" title=\"\">most adversely affected by Brexit</a>, especially a hard exit, mainly due to the impact of increasing costs in the oil sector.</p> <p>Earlier this year, a report from the Scottish government said <a href=\"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/fp/news/local/no-deal-brexit-would-be-devastating-for-aberdeen-warns-msp/\" title=\"\">25% of Aberdeenshire\u2019s workforce</a> was employed in sectors \u201cmost exposed\u201d in a no-deal Brexit, especially farming and fisheries.</p> <p>Even Clark \u2013 generally an enthusiast for Johnsonian positive thinking \u2013 conceded that agriculture, especially sheep farming, could be in for \u201ca headache\u201d.</p> <p>According to last week\u2019s poll, conducted by Lord Ashcroft, 47% of respondents in Scotland now want another independence referendum, with 45% disagreeing. And if a second poll was held, 46% would vote Yes to independence, and 43% No \u2013 a 52-48% majority if \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d and \u201cwon\u2019t vote\u201d are excluded. The shift from 2014 is small, but only a modest movement would be needed to get Yes over the line.</p> <p>John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde university and the UK\u2019s foremost poll analyst, said the Ashcroft survey was \u201cof a piece\u201d with four other Scottish opinion polls conducted earlier this year. \u201cIt is further evidence that seemingly the race has narrowed. The figures reflect exactly what voters said they would do if Boris Johnson became prime minister and if the UK crashed out of Europe. One of those things has happened, and the other is coming into view.\u201d</p> <p>Another analyst, Michael Keating, chair in Scottish politics at Aberdeen university, said the country \u201cmay be approaching a tipping point. Certainly, the union is looking a lot weaker than it was coming out of the 2014 referendum\u201d.</p> <p>As with the Leave-Remain balance across the UK, demographics may be a factor. Some say older voters tend to be more pro-union; young people coming into the electorate tend to be more open to independence. And, in Scotland in 2014, 16-year-olds were permitted to vote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bcc594ae9715667bf34763a20d0dd58d320b424\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bcc594ae9715667bf34763a20d0dd58d320b424/0_279_2151_1290/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Labour\u2019s Donald Dewar celebrates winning his Glasgow seat in 1978, re-entering Parliament after eight years.

Of course, not everyone is champing at the bit to have another referendum \u2013 people are weary of the amount of times they\u2019ve been asked to go to the ballot box in the past few years.</p> <p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s still a nervousness about independence. But Aberdeenshire is a bellwether. If we could get past 50% here, there would be a landslide across Scotland.\u201d</p> <p>A no-deal Brexit would spark a \u201cchain reaction\u201d, she said. \u201cIn cold political terms, of course it would have an effect [in increasing support for independence]. But do I want that to happen? No. I\u2019m the person who refers people to food banks and deals with the fallout of economic disaster.\u201d</p> <p>She insisted the SNP has never been about \u201cblood and soil nationalism. We want self-government, self-determination. We\u2019re not interested in Trumpian, build-the-wall nationalism. We want open-the-doors, progressive internationalism. But we want for Scotland all the powers that other nations enjoy.\u201d</p> <p>In 2014, the No campaign was boosted by Gordon Brown\u2019s powerful interventions, making the case for solidarity between nations. Five years on, the former prime minister is still a forceful advocate of the union, arguing in the pages of this newspaper today that, \u201cto prevent the rise and rise of dysfunctional nationalism the first step is to stop No Deal in its tracks\u201d.</p> <p>Brown recently warned that Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/18/gordon-brown-boris-johnson-could-be-uk-last-prime-minister-\" title=\"\">could be the UK\u2019s last prime minister</a>, saying \u201cno matter what he may say now, two decades of anti-Scottish invective will come back to haunt him\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>No matter what Boris may say now, two decades of anti-Scottish invective will come back to haunt him</p> <footer> <cite>Gordon Brown</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Brexit had \u201ccreated a new dimension to the debate,\u201d Brown told the <em>Observer </em>last week<em>.</em> \u201cTwo forces are coming together \u2013 Boris Johnson being seen as hostile to Scottish aspirations, and Scotland voting against Brexit in the referendum. So the future of the union has moved centre stage, and it\u2019s got to be taken into account now in what decisions governments make.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cdescent into nationalism across the UK is a worrying feature\u201d, he said. \u201cBut people have not heard what the true consequences of independence for Scotland actually are\u201d. The SNP was in favour of \u201ca hard independence as opposed to a soft independence\u201d, which would result in a \u201cdecade of hyper-austerity\u201d. And the Conservatives only had \u201ca negative message, a holding operation for the union\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cI\u2019ve always argued you need to put the positive case for Scotland staying in Britain, to lead in Britain rather than leave Britain. I will keep fighting, all the time I have, for Britain to stay in the European Union and for Britain to maintain its connections with Europe.</p> <p>\u201cI will also fight for the idea of a multinational state, which is what Britain is. And I\u2019m optimistic about young people in this country, who don\u2019t see that you\u2019ve got to make a choice between being Scottish or British, or between being British and European. The idea that we\u2019re all islands separated off from each other does not make sense. So I won\u2019t give up on these ideas.\u201d</p> <p>In Inverurie\u2019s market square, most of those willing to express a view appeared to favour independence. But they may not be representative. Many who declined to discuss their political leanings may be supporters of the union. Danny Henderson said he voted No in 2014 but now would vote Yes \u201cif they had the basic questions sorted\u201d, including \u201cmoney and the currency question\u201d, healthcare provision and the armed forces.</p> <p>Rory Pearce, a teacher originally from Northern Ireland, declared himself pro-Europe and pro-independence. \u201cI\u2019m in favour of independence for Northern Ireland too, and I hope Scotland will be a stepping stone to that. \u201cThe break-up of the UK is definitely more likely now. Johnson is hellbent on no deal. So let Scotland decide its own future.\u201d</p> <h2>Years of separation</h2> <p><strong>1979</strong></p> <p>A referendum on Scottish devolution is held but not backed by the necessary 40% of the electorate. Donald Dewar, who would go on to become the inaugural first minister, campaigned for a Yes vote alongside the Conservative Alick Buchanan-Smith and the Liberal Russell Johnston.</p> <p><strong>1989</strong></p> <p>The introduction of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s deeply unpopular poll tax lead to mass demonstrations in Scotland and helps revive the independence movement.</p> <p><strong>1997</strong></p> <p>Tony Blair promises devolution for Scotland. A referendum backs a Scottish parliament with tax-raising powers. In 1998 the Scottish Act assigns devolved powers to a 129-member Scottish parliament, elected in 1999.

      "bodyText": "When Boris Johnson, as editor of the Spectator, published a poem in 2004 calling the Scots a \u201cverminous race\u201d that deserved \u201ccomprehensive extermination\u201d, he may not have imagined it could come back to haunt him 15 years later in his first weeks as prime minister. \u201cThe Scotch \u2013 what a verminous race!\u201d begins Friendly Fire by James Michie. \u201cCanny, pushy, chippy, they\u2019re all over the place / Battening off us with false bonhomie / Polluting our stock, undermining our economy.\u201d The purportedly satirical poem is no longer available on the Spectator\u2019s website, but it is remembered with cold fury by some in the fractured, but relatively conservative market town of Inverurie in Aberdeenshire. \u201cIf you\u2019re at the receiving end to being likened to vermin, you\u2019re not impressed,\u201d Rae Jardine, a local Scottish National Party member, said with restraint. Jardine was speaking last week just after an opinion poll showed the first lead for an independent Scotland for more than two years, and shortly before shadow chancellor John McDonnell triggered a row by saying his party would allow a second independence referendum north of the border if Labour was in government. Next weekend, thousands of people are expected to join a pro-independence march in Aberdeen. The city voted 58.6% to 41.4% against independence in 2014 but some say it is now shifting behind Yes in the face of a no-deal Brexit \u2013 opposed by a majority north of the border \u2013 and an instinctive antipathy to Johnson. The prime minister, seen by many as dismissive of Scottish views, was recently described by Ian Blackford, leader of the SNP at Westminster, as a \u201crecruiting tool\u201d for the independence cause. Indeed, these twin factors, Johnson and a hard Brexit, could be a tipping point which threatens the very survival of the United Kingdom. In Inverurie, Andrew Jenkins voted No to an independent Scotland in 2014 but is now tilting reluctantly towards Yes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like Brexit and Johnson to change my mind but it may well do,\u201d he said. If there was a referendum in the next couple of years, \u201cit would certainly be a more difficult choice this time than last time\u201d. Libbie Allison was too young to take part in the 2014 referendum, but her vote would have been No. \u201cI felt that Scotland might not be strong enough to be independent,\u201d she said. Now, aged 19, \u201cI would vote Yes, which is sad because I love Britain. I don\u2019t feel England\u2019s views match with Scotland\u2019s any more. We can still have our shared history and culture, but it feels we have been dragged into something [Brexit] we didn\u2019t vote for.\u201d Asked what she thought of Johnson, she threw her head back and groaned. \u201cOh my God. He has made us look like a joke.\u201d About 17 miles northwest of Aberdeen, Inverurie is a quietly prosperous town, cleaving to tradition, resistant to upheaval. Its population is growing; there are jobs to be had in the dominant industries of agriculture, oil and gas; crime and antisocial behaviour are rare; house prices and rents are high, pushed up by demand. The town lies in what has been a Lib Dem-Tory marginal constituency. In the past five years, the public here has gone to the polls six times against the backdrop of an increasingly complex and turbulent political landscape. After Scottish, UK (twice) and European elections plus two referendums, the broad-brush picture is a place opposed to both independence and Brexit, and see-sawing between the Tories and the Nationalists. In the first of those votes, the 2014 referendum, Aberdeenshire voted 60-40 against independence. Yet the following year, Alex Salmond, the former leader of the SNP and first minister, took the Westminster seat of Gordon, in which Inverurie sits. In the 2016 Brexit referendum, the area voted Remain by 55.5% to 44.5%. In Scottish parliament elections the same year, it backed the SNP. Then, in the UK parliament election of 2017, Salmond was turfed out in favour of Colin Clark, a pro-Brexit Conservative whose campaign, some say, was aided by anti-nationalist tactical voting by Liberal Democrat supporters. Earlier this year, in the EU elections, the SNP took three out of six seats in Scotland, with the Tories, Lib Dems and Brexit party gaining one each. Labour polled less than 3% of the total vote in Aberdeenshire; \u201cthey\u2019re finished round here,\u201d said one local. Although many people are reticent about discussing politics, the underlying mood is \u201cextremely divisive\u201d, according to a local Conservative official. One lunchtime customer in the Gordon Highlander pub said he was staunchly pro-Union but declined to give his name in case he got \u201ca brick through the window\u201d from the nationalists. Johnson, he warned, was \u201cmanna from heaven for Nicola Sturgeon\u201d, the SNP leader and first minister. Clark, the local MP and now a Scottish minister in Johnson\u2019s government, flatly rejected such a notion. \u201cBoris is a hugely popular figure, full stop, because he connects with the general public. People understand what Boris is on about. The press has tried to paint him as being divisive. \u201cNicola Sturgeon and the SNP and the press in Scotland have poured out this bile that he\u2019s somehow anti-Scottish, but people need to judge him as prime minister by what he achieves.\u201d He will, Clark added, \u201cmake all of the United Kingdom prosperous\u201d. At least two reports have suggested otherwise. In 2017, the Centre for Cities thinktank concluded that Aberdeen would be the UK city most adversely affected by Brexit, especially a hard exit, mainly due to the impact of increasing costs in the oil sector. Earlier this year, a report from the Scottish government said 25% of Aberdeenshire\u2019s workforce was employed in sectors \u201cmost exposed\u201d in a no-deal Brexit, especially farming and fisheries. Even Clark \u2013 generally an enthusiast for Johnsonian positive thinking \u2013 conceded that agriculture, especially sheep farming, could be in for \u201ca headache\u201d. According to last week\u2019s poll, conducted by Lord Ashcroft, 47% of respondents in Scotland now want another independence referendum, with 45% disagreeing. And if a second poll was held, 46% would vote Yes to independence, and 43% No \u2013 a 52-48% majority if \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d and \u201cwon\u2019t vote\u201d are excluded. The shift from 2014 is small, but only a modest movement would be needed to get Yes over the line. John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde university and the UK\u2019s foremost poll analyst, said the Ashcroft survey was \u201cof a piece\u201d with four other Scottish opinion polls conducted earlier this year. \u201cIt is further evidence that seemingly the race has narrowed. The figures reflect exactly what voters said they would do if Boris Johnson became prime minister and if the UK crashed out of Europe. One of those things has happened, and the other is coming into view.\u201d Another analyst, Michael Keating, chair in Scottish politics at Aberdeen university, said the country \u201cmay be approaching a tipping point. Certainly, the union is looking a lot weaker than it was coming out of the 2014 referendum\u201d. As with the Leave-Remain balance across the UK, demographics may be a factor. Some say older voters tend to be more pro-union; young people coming into the electorate tend to be more open to independence. And, in Scotland in 2014, 16-year-olds were permitted to vote. Gillian Martin, the SNP\u2019s MSP for Aberdeenshire East, said she had detected a shift in mood among her constituents. \u201cEveryone I know knows someone who\u2019s changed their mind from No to Yes. Of course, not everyone is champing at the bit to have another referendum \u2013 people are weary of the amount of times they\u2019ve been asked to go to the ballot box in the past few years. \u201cAnd there\u2019s still a nervousness about independence. But Aberdeenshire is a bellwether. If we could get past 50% here, there would be a landslide across Scotland.\u201d A no-deal Brexit would spark a \u201cchain reaction\u201d, she said. \u201cIn cold political terms, of course it would have an effect [in increasing support for independence]. But do I want that to happen? No. I\u2019m the person who refers people to food banks and deals with the fallout of economic disaster.\u201d She insisted the SNP has never been about \u201cblood and soil nationalism. We want self-government, self-determination. We\u2019re not interested in Trumpian, build-the-wall nationalism. We want open-the-doors, progressive internationalism. But we want for Scotland all the powers that other nations enjoy.\u201d In 2014, the No campaign was boosted by Gordon Brown\u2019s powerful interventions, making the case for solidarity between nations. Five years on, the former prime minister is still a forceful advocate of the union, arguing in the pages of this newspaper today that, \u201cto prevent the rise and rise of dysfunctional nationalism the first step is to stop No Deal in its tracks\u201d. Brown recently warned that Johnson could be the UK\u2019s last prime minister, saying \u201cno matter what he may say now, two decades of anti-Scottish invective will come back to haunt him\u201d. Brexit had \u201ccreated a new dimension to the debate,\u201d Brown told the Observer last week. \u201cTwo forces are coming together \u2013 Boris Johnson being seen as hostile to Scottish aspirations, and Scotland voting against Brexit in the referendum. So the future of the union has moved centre stage, and it\u2019s got to be taken into account now in what decisions governments make.\u201d The \u201cdescent into nationalism across the UK is a worrying feature\u201d, he said. \u201cBut people have not heard what the true consequences of independence for Scotland actually are\u201d. The SNP was in favour of \u201ca hard independence as opposed to a soft independence\u201d, which would result in a \u201cdecade of hyper-austerity\u201d. And the Conservatives only had \u201ca negative message, a holding operation for the union\u201d. He added: \u201cI\u2019ve always argued you need to put the positive case for Scotland staying in Britain, to lead in Britain rather than leave Britain. I will keep fighting, all the time I have, for Britain to stay in the European Union and for Britain to maintain its connections with Europe. \u201cI will also fight for the idea of a multinational state, which is what Britain is. And I\u2019m optimistic about young people in this country, who don\u2019t see that you\u2019ve got to make a choice between being Scottish or British, or between being British and European. The idea that we\u2019re all islands separated off from each other does not make sense. So I won\u2019t give up on these ideas.\u201d In Inverurie\u2019s market square, most of those willing to express a view appeared to favour independence. But they may not be representative. Many who declined to discuss their political leanings may be supporters of the union. Danny Henderson said he voted No in 2014 but now would vote Yes \u201cif they had the basic questions sorted\u201d, including \u201cmoney and the currency question\u201d, healthcare provision and the armed forces. Rory Pearce, a teacher originally from Northern Ireland, declared himself pro-Europe and pro-independence. \u201cI\u2019m in favour of independence for Northern Ireland too, and I hope Scotland will be a stepping stone to that. \u201cThe break-up of the UK is definitely more likely now. Johnson is hellbent on no deal. So let Scotland decide its own future.\u201d Years of separation 1979 A referendum on Scottish devolution is held but not backed by the necessary 40% of the electorate. Donald Dewar, who would go on to become the inaugural first minister, campaigned for a Yes vote alongside the Conservative Alick Buchanan-Smith and the Liberal Russell Johnston. 1989 The introduction of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s deeply unpopular poll tax lead to mass demonstrations in Scotland and helps revive the independence movement. 1997 Tony Blair promises devolution for Scotland. A referendum backs a Scottish parliament with tax-raising powers. In 1998 the Scottish Act assigns devolved powers to a 129-member Scottish parliament, elected in 1999. Labour wins 56 seats, SNP 35 seats, Conservatives 18, Lib Dems 17. 2011 The SNP wins a majority in the Scottish parliament and Alex Salmond, left, becomes first minister. The following year, the Edinburgh Agreement is signed by Salmond and UK prime minister David Cameron, paving the way for a referendum on Scottish independence. 2014 The people of Scotland vote in a referendum on the question: Should Scotland be an independent country? 55% no, 45% yes. Just before the vote, Alex Salmond says: \u201cThis is a once in a generation opportunity, perhaps even a once in a lifetime opportunity for Scotland.\u201d 2016 The EU referendum. Scotland votes to stay in the EU, 62% to 38%. First minister Nicola Sturgeon says the result \u201crepresents a significant and a material change of the circumstances in which Scotland voted against independence\u201d. A second referendum \u201cmust be on the table\u201d. 2019 Boris Johnson becomes prime minister, pledging to take Britain out of the EU on 31 October, deal or no deal. An opinion poll shows a small lead among Scots in favour of independence amid talk of a break-up of the UK. Shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, says Labour would allow another referendum if in power. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 August 2019 to correct a reference to the SNP and clarify that Ian Blackford leads the SNP at Westminster, not in the Scottish parliament.",

It says much about the times we live in and how we are ruled.

The first is the dominant career woman, selfishly putting off having kids until they are too old to look after them properly (no matter that we don\u2019t judge men who have children in their 50s in the same way). The second is that women only want to prolong their fertility because they are forced into a choice between having kids and sacrificing some career success, and that if you take away that trade-off, that is the problem solved.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Is it not better to wait rather than settle into a loveless partnership in your early 30s just so you can have children?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In fact, the evidence suggests that involuntary childlessness has less to do with careers than romantic success.

I will never stop arguing that we have to address the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/25/paternity-leave-women-equality-gender\" title=\"\">structural inequalities</a> that mean women\u2019s biology acts as a drag on their careers. But those inequalities are not why I do not yet have children. Even though I shouldn\u2019t have to, I would have made the choice to sacrifice career progress to have had children at this point.</p> <p>Women in their mid-to-late 30s who want children are all too aware of another biological inequality at play: the vastly different rates at which the male and female fertility clocks tick down. Dating at this age means contending with the awful stereotypes of women desperate to bag a man before it is too late. Imagine how liberating it would be to know you have 15 years of fertility left, just as many men of your age do. That is something feminists who have had their children by their early 30s should care about, just as female solidarity behoves women who choose to be childfree to fight the fact that having children curtails mothers\u2019 careers.</p> <p>There will be those who argue that women have only themselves to blame if they are still in the dating pool at 35; in a world where women are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/aug/28/university-gender-gap-at-record-high-as-30000-more-women-accepted\" title=\"\">a third more likely to go to university</a> than men, they should stop being so fussy. This rather assumes that these women are single because they will not settle for men less educated than they are, rather than vice versa. And \u2013 surprisingly, if you buy into the stereotype of men being less keen on kids \u2013 similar proportions of male and female graduates born in 1970 were <a href=\"https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/381164/1/2015_WP69_Childlessness_in_the_UK.pdf\" title=\"\">childless</a> at age 42 (about one in four), and similar proportions of those (about one in three) said it was because they had not met the right partner.</p> <p>Perhaps prolonging female fertility could benefit men who meet their partner later in life too. And perhaps, as fertility science develops, this is not to be discouraged. Is it not better to wait a little if need be to raise a child with someone you can spend decades with, rather than settle into a loveless partnership in your early 30s just so you can have children?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65a2ff1423bb768be3ed0d12545e16846ee39656\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65a2ff1423bb768be3ed0d12545e16846ee39656/0_163_4902_2941/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An IVF embryologist works on a petri dish at a London fertility clinic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Just one in five IVF treatments using frozen eggs result in a live birth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sang Tan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The problem is the existing science is not good enough: just one in five IVF treatments using frozen eggs <a href=\"https://www.hfea.gov.uk/treatments/fertility-preservation/egg-freezing/\" title=\"\">results in a live birth</a>. That is partly because the \u00a37,000 or so cost and the invasiveness of the process mean that the average age at which <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/12/hundreds-women-conned-freezing-eggs-age-almost-no-chance-success/\" title=\"\">women freeze their eggs is 38</a>, far beyond their fertility peak. That\u2019s why this new treatment to delay menopause is so exciting: a single 30-minute procedure could give women access to thousands of their eggs rather than just a handful years late. It could one day be a less intrusive, more effective and cheaper insurance policy for childless women in their early 30s.</p> <p>Developing a scientific fix for the female fertility cliff edge will not change the fact that for the vast majority of women, the right time for them to have children will be during their naturally fertile years. But there is a small but significant minority who miss the boat because they do not find the right partner in time. It is time to grapple with the fact that the profoundly positive social development of women\u2019s increased educational and professional success might mean that we need to use science to rethink aspects of our biology. To recoil at that is sexism, pure and simple.</p> <p>\u2022 Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist</p> <p><em>Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

There will be those who argue that women have only themselves to blame if they are still in the dating pool at 35; in a world where women are a third more likely to go to university than men, they should stop being so fussy. This rather assumes that these women are single because they will not settle for men less educated than they are, rather than vice versa. And \u2013 surprisingly, if you buy into the stereotype of men being less keen on kids \u2013 similar proportions of male and female graduates born in 1970 were childless at age 42 (about one in four), and similar proportions of those (about one in three) said it was because they had not met the right partner. Perhaps prolonging female fertility could benefit men who meet their partner later in life too. And perhaps, as fertility science develops, this is not to be discouraged. Is it not better to wait a little if need be to raise a child with someone you can spend decades with, rather than settle into a loveless partnership in your early 30s just so you can have children? The problem is the existing science is not good enough: just one in five IVF treatments using frozen eggs results in a live birth. That is partly because the \u00a37,000 or so cost and the invasiveness of the process mean that the average age at which women freeze their eggs is 38, far beyond their fertility peak. That\u2019s why this new treatment to delay menopause is so exciting: a single 30-minute procedure could give women access to thousands of their eggs rather than just a handful years late. It could one day be a less intrusive, more effective and cheaper insurance policy for childless women in their early 30s. Developing a scientific fix for the female fertility cliff edge will not change the fact that for the vast majority of women, the right time for them to have children will be during their naturally fertile years. But there is a small but significant minority who miss the boat because they do not find the right partner in time. It is time to grapple with the fact that the profoundly positive social development of women\u2019s increased educational and professional success might mean that we need to use science to rethink aspects of our biology. To recoil at that is sexism, pure and simple. \u2022 Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

Chilli in particular seems to have the same counter-intuitive effect as a cup of tea, working on the principle that you have to heat yourself up to bring that core temperature down. Beer and cider may be the traditional British partners for spicy food, but wine can be just as effective. Even red wines can do the trick, provided there\u2019s plenty of fruit and the tannin\u2019s been dialled down. In summer, I prefer not to go too heavy with my reds anyway, which means a bottle of the light, juicy red Beaujolais, is often to hand \u2013 and Waitrose\u2019s frisky own-label, chilled down, worked very nicely with a Vietnamese-style beef salad with basil, coriander, mint, lime and a good dose of fresh red chilli.</p> <p><strong>Chaffey Bros D\u00fcfte Punke Riesling Gewurtztraminer Kerner, Australia, 2017 (</strong><em><strong>from \u00a315.95, <a href=\"https://www.nywines.co.uk/\">Noel Young Wines</a></strong></em><strong>) </strong>If I\u2019d switched the beef in that salad for white fish or prawns, but retained the rest of the ingredients (including a healthy splash of fish sauce), then an aromatic white would have been a better bet. With its succulent lime and unrestrained floral exuberance, the D\u00fcfte Punke Alsace-style blend is a taste of the summer, while Tesco Finest CSG Aromatico 2018 (\u00a39) from Chile does a similar job with more tropical fruit. For the combination of smoky flavour and spice heat you\u2019d find in a bowl of chilli con carne or a dish using a piquant chorizo or a good sprinkling of smoked paprika, however, I\u2019d go back to red. Something a little plusher than beaujolais, but still easy on the tannin: a youthful grenache, say, such as the vividly brambly fruity Co-op Old Vine Garnacha 2018 (\u00a35.35).</p> <p><strong>Bortolin Angelo Extra Dry Prosecco di Valdobbiadene, Italy 2018 (</strong><em><strong>\u00a339.95, <a href=\"https://jeroboams.co.uk/\">Jeroboams</a></strong></em><strong>) </strong>Sugar is another useful ingredient in wine if you\u2019re looking to match heat-busting hot food, provided there\u2019s decent acidity, too. That sweet-acid-heat mix is, after all, the key to many a spicy classic dish, from the korma to a basic Thai curry paste. The gentle sweetness and redcurranty acidity of Plessis-Duval Ros\u00e9 d\u2019Anjou 2018 (\u00a38, Marks &amp; Spencer) \u2013 as well as its rather lovely strawberry fruit, creamy texture and relative lightness (10.5% abv) of alcohol \u2013 works very well with both those dishes. Equally effective is the sweeter end of Prosecco, the sort that is labelled, confusingly, Dry or Extra Dry (Brut in fact being drier than either). One of the best I\u2019ve tried recently is Bortolin Angelo\u2019s very smart Extra Dry, its sweetness immaculately presented with a gorgeous ping of fresh citrus.</p> <p><em>Follow David on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daveydaibach?lang=en\">@Daveydaibach</a></em></p>",

The gentle sweetness and redcurranty acidity of Plessis-Duval Ros\u00e9 d\u2019Anjou 2018 (\u00a38, Marks &amp; Spencer) \u2013 as well as its rather lovely strawberry fruit, creamy texture and relative lightness (10.5% abv) of alcohol \u2013 works very well with both those dishes. Equally effective is the sweeter end of Prosecco, the sort that is labelled, confusingly, Dry or Extra Dry (Brut in fact being drier than either). One of the best I\u2019ve tried recently is Bortolin Angelo\u2019s very smart Extra Dry, its sweetness immaculately presented with a gorgeous ping of fresh citrus.

Two decades ago, <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/julia-roberts-underarm-armpit-hair-notting-hill-premiere-1999-busy-tonight-interview\" title=\"\">Julia Roberts</a> caused a furore by flashing tufts at the <em>Notting Hill</em> film premiere. Considering the fuss, you\u2019d have thought that Roberts had nuclear missiles tucked in her pits. Now <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a28577727/emily-ratajkowski-sexuality-essay/\" title=\"\">Emily Ratajkowski</a> has appeared in <em>Harper\u2019s Bazaar </em>magazine flashing her underarm hair in a portrait by Michael Avedon, leading to the model being criticised as <a href=\"https://www.inquisitr.com/5571766/emily-ratajkowski-hairy-armpit-lingerie-fans-unfollowing/\" title=\"\">unclean and disgusting</a>. In the accompanying essay, Ratajkowski cites Roxane Gay\u2019s book, <em>Bad Feminist</em>, and says that sometimes she shaves her armpits, sometimes she doesn\u2019t and that\u2019s her choice. Bravo, Ms Ratajkowski.</p> <p>Some may sneer at Ratajkowski\u2019s brand of feminism. A lingerie model who appeared in the notorious <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyDUC1LUXSU\" title=\"\">Blurred Lines</a> video, she <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a23606109/emily-ratajkowski-and-amy-schumer-arrested-brett-kavanaugh/\" title=\"\">was </a><a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a23606109/emily-ratajkowski-and-amy-schumer-arrested-brett-kavanaugh/\" title=\"\">arrested</a> for protesting against Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s supreme court nomination. But since when did being a model make someone stupid or irrelevant? What Ratajkowski has to say about body hair is especially interesting: if anyone is in the frontline of the \u201cmale gaze\u201d and idealised perceptions of beauty, it\u2019s her. Moreover, for someone in her line of work, subverting her image is a huge commercial risk and therefore a statement.</p> <p>What\u2019s astonishing is that, 20 years after Roberts\u2019s flash, anyone cares. Women are human. Hair grows on women\u2019s bodies. If they want to get rid of hair (leg, armpit, bikini, anywhere), then they do so. If they don\u2019t wish to get rid of it (for aesthetic or socio-political reasons or they just forgot), they don\u2019t have to. It is that simple.</p> <p>Young men are coming under similar pressure to get rid of body hair, although whether this is good or bad news is open to debate. Regarding female underarm hair, everyone might at least consider getting over the fact that it exists. Come 2039, will we still be having the same conversation?</p> <h2>All football, not just Rooney, is tainted by gambling ties<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f64047640f69802cc08e911ec48996999a7ef9a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f64047640f69802cc08e911ec48996999a7ef9a5/21_219_3473_2084/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wayne Rooney with his 32Red shirt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wayne Rooney proudly holds his number 32 shirt at the Derby County stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Clarke/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wayne Rooney has been criticised by the Church of England for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/09/church-criticises-wayne-rooney-over-derby-gambling-tie-up\" title=\"\">promoting gambling</a> with his \u00a37.8m player-coach signing with Derby County, where part of his salary will be paid by sponsors, the betting company 32Red, with him wearing the number 32 on his shirt.</p> <p>Dr Alan Smith, the bishop of St Albans, said it was harmful to impressionable young fans to see gambling promoted in this way. Rooney had his own gambling problems, so the decision is even odder. Still, why are people focusing on Rooney in particular?</p> <p>This is beyond one player \u2013 this is about the greed and irresponsibility of football clubs and English football generally. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/19/half-of-premier-league-clubs-to-have-gambling-sponsors-for-201920\" title=\"\">Half of the Premier League\u2019s football shirts will feature a gambling company\u2019s logo this season</a>, while 17 out of 24 Championship shirts will sport a betting logo.

Of course, Rooney could have turned down the Derby County deal. However, it seems unfair to concentrate on him when the problems run far deeper.

In the accompanying essay, Ratajkowski cites Roxane Gay\u2019s book, Bad Feminist, and says that sometimes she shaves her armpits, sometimes she doesn\u2019t and that\u2019s her choice. Bravo, Ms Ratajkowski. Some may sneer at Ratajkowski\u2019s brand of feminism. A lingerie model who appeared in the notorious Blurred Lines video, she was arrested for protesting against Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s supreme court nomination. But since when did being a model make someone stupid or irrelevant? What Ratajkowski has to say about body hair is especially interesting: if anyone is in the frontline of the \u201cmale gaze\u201d and idealised perceptions of beauty, it\u2019s her. Moreover, for someone in her line of work, subverting her image is a huge commercial risk and therefore a statement. What\u2019s astonishing is that, 20 years after Roberts\u2019s flash, anyone cares. Women are human. Hair grows on women\u2019s bodies. If they want to get rid of hair (leg, armpit, bikini, anywhere), then they do so. If they don\u2019t wish to get rid of it (for aesthetic or socio-political reasons or they just forgot), they don\u2019t have to. It is that simple. Young men are coming under similar pressure to get rid of body hair, although whether this is good or bad news is open to debate. Regarding female underarm hair, everyone might at least consider getting over the fact that it exists. Come 2039, will we still be having the same conversation? All football, not just Rooney, is tainted by gambling ties Wayne Rooney has been criticised by the Church of England for promoting gambling with his \u00a37.8m player-coach signing with Derby County, where part of his salary will be paid by sponsors, the betting company 32Red, with him wearing the number 32 on his shirt. Dr Alan Smith, the bishop of St Albans, said it was harmful to impressionable young fans to see gambling promoted in this way. Rooney had his own gambling problems, so the decision is even odder. Still, why are people focusing on Rooney in particular? This is beyond one player \u2013 this is about the greed and irresponsibility of football clubs and English football generally. Half of the Premier League\u2019s football shirts will feature a gambling company\u2019s logo this season, while 17 out of 24 Championship shirts will sport a betting logo. Football is awash with advertising revenue, not just from gambling but also from alcohol and unaffordable designer labels. Advertising is as defining a feature of high-level football culture as the pitch itself, but what advertising should be permitted? Of course, Rooney could have turned down the Derby County deal. However, it seems unfair to concentrate on him when the problems run far deeper. In this case, the celebrity footballer is the symptom, not the cause. \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

It was clearly a local commonplace because Young wrote \u201cAgain!\u201d in his notes.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s nothing quite so guffaw-making to an Anglo-Saxon sensibility in need of its funny bone being tickled than a French worthy having a fit of the vapours. Last week didn\u2019t disappoint. And all over the delightful word \u201clove\u201d. Apparently, French online advertisers prefer it to \u201cl\u2019amour\u201d, which has got the culture minister, Franck Riester, in a right royal Gallic tizzy. \u201cIn this linguistic globalisation, our duty is to refuse any tendency to move towards a single [world] language [and] any weakening of the diversity, as of cultures, in France and elsewhere.\u201d Sorry, Franck, that particular cheval has long bolted. The Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, created in 1635, has sought to preserve the sanctity of the language, but has been fighting a losing battle. The French have been long been happy to order a Big Mac. I admire the spirit but, in a time of universal online accessibility, it might well be better to take it on the chin. After all, the British have easily assimilated any number of French words and phrases into everyday use, enhancing, not diminishing, our language - m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois, pied \u00e0 terre, t\u00eate \u00e0 t\u00eate. So far be it for me to tell them to unbend a little, but perhaps a more laissez-faire attitude would be in order. I occasionally uncover delightful and underused words and damn me if I haven\u2019t found a couple that have appropriately French roots. So let\u2019s welcome \u201cseigniorage\u201d, as in: \u201cThe Bank of England makes \u00a3450m in seigniorage, earnings on the money that high street banks hand it in return for notes and coins.\u201d Wonderful word, but tricky to slip into a passing conversation. As is cabotage \u2013 the transport of goods or people in the same country by an operator from another country. Probably neither will enter everyday usage \u2013 oh well, c\u2019est la vie. \u2022Jonathan Bouquet is an Observer columnist",

All dishes \u00a34-\u00a312; wines from \u00a324</strong></p> <p>The best restaurants have a cracking narrative at their heart; a story that nourishes the soul as well as the belly. The narrative behind the newly opened Nandine in Camberwell, south London, is utterly compelling. It is what us old hacks call a good yarn. The headlines are strong enough: Nandine is a simple caf\u00e9, all plywood and painted brick walls, knocking out huge plates of big-flavoured Kurdish food at the sort of prices that restore your faith not just in eating out, but quite possibly in humanity in general. Every plate is a vivid rush of saturated tones, worthy of Technicolor in its pomp. Colours like that promise flavour; the promise is not broken.</p> <p>Behind those headlines is an ancient story: of displacement by war, of immigration and the refreshing of memory and identity through cooking. It belongs to the Baban family, led by the matriarch, Pary. In 1989, then in her late teens, she was forced to leave her home in Qaladze, in what is today Iraqi Kurdistan, when it was attacked by Saddam Hussein\u2019s forces. As she explained to <em><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/wjzxkz/meet-the-brothers-helping-their-mum-remember-the-taste-of-kurdistan\" title=\"\">Vice</a></em> last year, Pary went in search of safety, travelling from village to village and picking up recipes as she went, noting the regional differences in a journal that she retains to this day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a7fb36bfed258be5376b1ea47442c48565aea1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a7fb36bfed258be5376b1ea47442c48565aea1d/0_127_4708_2825/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The prettiest bowl of chips in Britain\u2019: baharat fries.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The prettiest bowl of chips in Britain\u2019: baharat fries.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some villages flavoured their food with wild herbs yanked from the rough, stony ground. Others roasted large cuts of lamb. Kurdish food may feel familiar to those who think they know their Turkish or Middle Eastern dishes, but there can be ingredients like dill or celery that are unexpected. Rosewaters play their part. It\u2019s all good.</p> <p>Pary met her husband Pola while travelling across Kurdistan. In 1995 they settled in south London\u2019s Elephant and Castle where, for many years, they ran a newsagent\u2019s. Soon they had a kiosk, offering sandwiches, filled with the likes of stir-fried spiced spinach. The punters appreciated them. That led the family to take over their first space on Vestry Road in Camberwell, which was originally meant for sandwich prep but soon became a caf\u00e9. Pary\u2019s baklava became a talking point. Soon they were invited to open a concession at the <a href=\"https://www.peckhamlevels.org/\" title=\"\">Peckham Levels</a> food market.</p> <p>And now they have this small restaurant seating just three dozen, called Nandine, which means kitchen in Kurdish. It is a family business. Pary\u2019s boys Rang and Raman also work across the group. But there is the feeling of a broader familial enterprise; of a bunch of people determined to bring a more obscure strand of regional cooking to an eager, cosmopolitan south London crowd. We visit on a Sunday lunchtime, as brunch gives way to a few dishes off the main menu. It\u2019s too early for booze for me, so they leave the gin out of a pomegranate and sumac G&amp;T. It\u2019s a sparkling candy pink colour and both sweet and sour, and just slightly salty in the right way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"916756ef96cae932fe29b919d67dee0626873d5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/916756ef96cae932fe29b919d67dee0626873d5d/62_128_5468_3569/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Tender and crisp\u2019: the \u20187 spice\u2019 chicken shish.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Tender and crisp\u2019: the \u20187 spice\u2019 chicken shish.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We have a set of mezze dips: of hummus, made sprightly and bright by the addition of lime, then dressed with olive oil and sprinkled with white and black sesame seeds; of yogurt and tahini with the fresh crunch of diced cucumber, with a crown of salty capers and a purple dusting with the citrus burst of sumac; of sweet and smoky red pepper pur\u00e9e, the colour of rust, with shining beads of pomegranate. On the side are warm pieces of lightly oiled, spice-dusted and quilted flatbreads, with which to pull and dredge. It is an extremely diverting plateful for just \u00a35.50.</p> <p>From the brunch menu comes a shakshuka of long-cooked tomatoes, onions and spices, with baked eggs, their yolks still runny and, on the side, pieces of crisp-crusted, springy bread baked at their other site. The most expensive dish today, at a mighty \u00a312, is the lula kebab, of boldly spiced minced lamb, but that money gets you a trayful. The two thick slabs of charred and seared minced meat are laid on more flatbread into which, generously, they leak their juices. To one side are pieces of grilled onion, tomato and green pepper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7ee15fdfb52e471432d451f5a36a7cfa3761981\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7ee15fdfb52e471432d451f5a36a7cfa3761981/63_222_5358_3215/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018From the brunch menu\u2019: shakshuka.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018From the brunch menu\u2019: shakshuka.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a dish of a yogurt dip with, in the middle, some bright yellow pickled cauliflower, which is on more than friendly nodding terms with piccalilli. Up from that is another dish with, at one end, a robustly dressed onion and tomato salad, and, at the other, pickled red cabbage full of vigorous crunch and bite. There is a dusting of sumac and what I take to be za\u2019atar as well as chopped green herbs. The same accessories turn up with pieces of \u201c7 spice\u201d chicken shish, rendered a bright shade of yellow by their marinade. If I was any cop as a journalist, I\u2019d have asked for a list of all seven. Instead, I was too involved in eating it. Too often grilled pieces of breast like this are dry enough to lodge in your throat; this is tender and crisp. It is a better end for the chicken.</p> <p>In the spirit of enquiry and, of course, pure greed, we have ordered too much. Our waiter tells us that in the evenings the best thing to do is come in a group of six and order the entire menu. \u201cIt will work out at about \u00a312 to \u00a314 a head,\u201d he says. The point is that we do not have space to finish or even really begin the baharat fries. Instead we stare at what must be one of the prettiest bowls of chips in Britain, dusted with spice, then dressed with a little purple-tinged yogurt, pomegranate and sesame seeds, and more chopped herbs. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c11077743acbddecd28283a5d84e7841bf8edc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c11077743acbddecd28283a5d84e7841bf8edc5/172_280_5390_3234/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Fragile crowns of crisp pastry\u2019: Pary\u2019s famed baklava.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Fragile crowns of crisp pastry\u2019: Pary\u2019s famed baklava.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We do, however, have space for Pary\u2019s famed baklava; for fragile crowns of crisp pastry, filled with crushed nuts and drenched in sugar syrup and made fragrant by the application of dried rose petals and attention to detail. Like everything here, first you look at it and sigh. Then you taste it, and sigh again. Another dessert of an unsweetened coconut milk cream has an odd, jelly-like texture, but makes sense once you get some of the spun sugar from the top, and the baklava from the bottom. And with the last scoop of the spoon, we are in love. Pary has made a long journey of so many kinds to get to this point. She has told us her story through the food on the plate. And we are all the richer for it.</p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p>Nandine does indeed mean Kitchen in Kurdish. It\u2019s a blunt name for a restaurant but it works, both in Camberwell and Inverness. The Kitchen Restaurant, in a modernist town house overlooking the city\u2019s river, is a buzzy bistro with cheery, encouraging food. Try the cod and smoked applewood cheese fishcakes, the seared chicken with haggis bon bons and make sure to ask whether the general manager has made one of her glorious cheesecakes for dessert (<a href=\"http://kitchenrestaurant.co.uk\">kitchenrestaurant.co.uk</a>).</p> <p>There\u2019s failed restaurant hygiene inspections, and then there\u2019s what happened to a Gloucestershire Pizza restaurant. During a November 2018 inspection a rat ran over the inspector\u2019s foot. Recently they were fined nearly \u00a32000 for offences under food safety legislation. Coincidentally, The Caterer magazine, which reported the story, has just relaunched its diary column. Its name: Kitchen Rat.</p> <p>Wahaca, the Mexican restaurant chain, which faced a PR disaster recently when diners took to social media to berate the company for apparently making a waiter cover part of the bill of a table that had done a runner, has a new plan to tackle staffing issues. They\u2019ve set up a confidential phone line so staff can leave anonymous messages for co-founder Mark Selby about company practises.</p> <p><em>Jay Rayner will be appearing in a special Guardian Live event at London\u2019s Cadogan Hall on 9 September.

As she explained to Vice last year, Pary went in search of safety, travelling from village to village and picking up recipes as she went, noting the regional differences in a journal that she retains to this day. Some villages flavoured their food with wild herbs yanked from the rough, stony ground. Others roasted large cuts of lamb. Kurdish food may feel familiar to those who think they know their Turkish or Middle Eastern dishes, but there can be ingredients like dill or celery that are unexpected. Rosewaters play their part. It\u2019s all good. Pary met her husband Pola while travelling across Kurdistan. In 1995 they settled in south London\u2019s Elephant and Castle where, for many years, they ran a newsagent\u2019s. Soon they had a kiosk, offering sandwiches, filled with the likes of stir-fried spiced spinach. The punters appreciated them. That led the family to take over their first space on Vestry Road in Camberwell, which was originally meant for sandwich prep but soon became a caf\u00e9. Pary\u2019s baklava became a talking point. Soon they were invited to open a concession at the Peckham Levels food market. And now they have this small restaurant seating just three dozen, called Nandine, which means kitchen in Kurdish. It is a family business. Pary\u2019s boys Rang and Raman also work across the group. But there is the feeling of a broader familial enterprise; of a bunch of people determined to bring a more obscure strand of regional cooking to an eager, cosmopolitan south London crowd. We visit on a Sunday lunchtime, as brunch gives way to a few dishes off the main menu. It\u2019s too early for booze for me, so they leave the gin out of a pomegranate and sumac G&amp;T. It\u2019s a sparkling candy pink colour and both sweet and sour, and just slightly salty in the right way. We have a set of mezze dips: of hummus, made sprightly and bright by the addition of lime, then dressed with olive oil and sprinkled with white and black sesame seeds; of yogurt and tahini with the fresh crunch of diced cucumber, with a crown of salty capers and a purple dusting with the citrus burst of sumac; of sweet and smoky red pepper pur\u00e9e, the colour of rust, with shining beads of pomegranate. On the side are warm pieces of lightly oiled, spice-dusted and quilted flatbreads, with which to pull and dredge. It is an extremely diverting plateful for just \u00a35.50. From the brunch menu comes a shakshuka of long-cooked tomatoes, onions and spices, with baked eggs, their yolks still runny and, on the side, pieces of crisp-crusted, springy bread baked at their other site. The most expensive dish today, at a mighty \u00a312, is the lula kebab, of boldly spiced minced lamb, but that money gets you a trayful. The two thick slabs of charred and seared minced meat are laid on more flatbread into which, generously, they leak their juices. To one side are pieces of grilled onion, tomato and green pepper. There is a dish of a yogurt dip with, in the middle, some bright yellow pickled cauliflower, which is on more than friendly nodding terms with piccalilli. Up from that is another dish with, at one end, a robustly dressed onion and tomato salad, and, at the other, pickled red cabbage full of vigorous crunch and bite. There is a dusting of sumac and what I take to be za\u2019atar as well as chopped green herbs. The same accessories turn up with pieces of \u201c7 spice\u201d chicken shish, rendered a bright shade of yellow by their marinade. If I was any cop as a journalist, I\u2019d have asked for a list of all seven. Instead, I was too involved in eating it. Too often grilled pieces of breast like this are dry enough to lodge in your throat; this is tender and crisp. It is a better end for the chicken. In the spirit of enquiry and, of course, pure greed, we have ordered too much. Our waiter tells us that in the evenings the best thing to do is come in a group of six and order the entire menu. \u201cIt will work out at about \u00a312 to \u00a314 a head,\u201d he says. The point is that we do not have space to finish or even really begin the baharat fries. Instead we stare at what must be one of the prettiest bowls of chips in Britain, dusted with spice, then dressed with a little purple-tinged yogurt, pomegranate and sesame seeds, and more chopped herbs. We do, however, have space for Pary\u2019s famed baklava; for fragile crowns of crisp pastry, filled with crushed nuts and drenched in sugar syrup and made fragrant by the application of dried rose petals and attention to detail. Like everything here, first you look at it and sigh. Then you taste it, and sigh again. Another dessert of an unsweetened coconut milk cream has an odd, jelly-like texture, but makes sense once you get some of the spun sugar from the top, and the baklava from the bottom. And with the last scoop of the spoon, we are in love. Pary has made a long journey of so many kinds to get to this point. She has told us her story through the food on the plate. And we are all the richer for it. News bites Nandine does indeed mean Kitchen in Kurdish. It\u2019s a blunt name for a restaurant but it works, both in Camberwell and Inverness. The Kitchen Restaurant, in a modernist town house overlooking the city\u2019s river, is a buzzy bistro with cheery, encouraging food. Try the cod and smoked applewood cheese fishcakes, the seared chicken with haggis bon bons and make sure to ask whether the general manager has made one of her glorious cheesecakes for dessert (kitchenrestaurant.co.uk). There\u2019s failed restaurant hygiene inspections, and then there\u2019s what happened to a Gloucestershire Pizza restaurant. During a November 2018 inspection a rat ran over the inspector\u2019s foot. Recently they were fined nearly \u00a32000 for offences under food safety legislation. Coincidentally, The Caterer magazine, which reported the story, has just relaunched its diary column. Its name: Kitchen Rat. Wahaca, the Mexican restaurant chain, which faced a PR disaster recently when diners took to social media to berate the company for apparently making a waiter cover part of the bill of a table that had done a runner, has a new plan to tackle staffing issues. They\u2019ve set up a confidential phone line so staff can leave anonymous messages for co-founder Mark Selby about company practises.

Despite its hardcore looks, it wasn\u2019t built for the harshest mountain climbs (if that\u2019s what gets you out of bed on a Sunday, you\u2019d be better off considering the meatier Moterra). The Habit was designed for those easier but no less exciting fast and flowing rides down forest paths.

      "body": "<p>Don\u2019t despair. We may be living through an attempted rightwing revolution, but its foundations are rotten. There may be a counter-revolution, as there is after every revolution, and it will be built on much firmer ground. The charlatans may be in control in both Britain and the US, but their time is limited. Their programmes are self-defeating and destructive and they do not speak to the dynamic and increasingly ascendant forces in both our societies.</p> <p>What has happened in the US after the atrocities in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/09/el-paso-shooting-suspect-confessed-attack-mexicans\" title=\"\">El Paso </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/aug/06/trump-obama-news-today-el-paso-shooting-dayton-ohio-politics-latest\" title=\"\">Dayton </a>is instructive. It is a tipping point. The National Rifle Association may tell Donald Trump repeatedly that any attempt at gun control will not fly with his political base, but Trump can read the runes. For the Republicans to become the party in de facto defence of what has suddenly become crystallised as white supremacist terrorism would be electoral suicide. The president has to move, not least because, faced with this reality, even his base is shifting. Too many Americans now fear becoming the victims of random murder.</p> <p>Few can dispute that, astonishingly, while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/02/us-gun-control-ownership-violence-statistics\" title=\"\">US has 5% of the world\u2019s population, it has </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/02/us-gun-control-ownership-violence-statistics\" title=\"\">35%-50% of civilian gun ownership,</a> a trend that simply has to be reversed. Within a decade, I am sure, the debate will move on, as white supremacists continue their killing spree, from hardening background checks to debating the constitutional right to bear arms. This must and will happen and it will highlight the marginalisation of rightwing republicanism. And when the political wind changes in the US, it also changes in Britain.</p> <p>Trump in the US and Boris Johnson in the UK are the extreme culmination of what Reagan and Thatcher began 40 years ago. It started as a legitimate if contestable desire to reframe the postwar settlement, limit the state, promote business and individual self-reliance. But as the great political scientist Samuel Beer famously argued, it was, paradoxically, supported culturally by the individualism, anti-state instincts and nonconformism of the Woodstock generation.</p> <p>Forty years on, continued rightwing political ascendancy has morphed into today\u2019s menacing rightwing ideologies. The role of US republicanism as the libertarian champion of guns is matched by the descent of the Conservative party into English nationalism, with a no-deal Brexit as its talismanic policy, even if it means breaking up the UK. But a no-deal Brexit will become an inflection point for a parallel fightback in Britain. The devastating economic and political consequences \u2013 a long <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/22/no-deal-brexit-uk-recession-niesr-british-eu-trade\" title=\"\">recession</a>, a broken housing market, collapsed sterling, chronically unfair trade deals \u2013 will inevitably raise the question of how it ever happened. Suddenly, the British constitution, the long sleeper issue in British politics, will become the new political battleground.</p> <p>Britain is almost alone in having no written constitution. Whoever commands a majority in the House of Commons can do what they like without constitutional constraint \u2013 hold a referendum transforming Britain\u2019s treaty obligations with no requirement for a super-majority or ignore a no-confidence vote in the House of Commons for long enough to deliver a no-deal Brexit. The constitution does empower the monarch to assert fair play and the public interest, but a non-elected head of state can never actually act.</p> <p>This is no longer sustainable. We needed the Queen to insist that a referendum as important as that on EU membership required a super-majority; we will need her to sack Boris Johnson if he tries to stay in office after losing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/06/no-deal-brexit-legally-possible-even-after-no-confidence-vote\" title=\"\">no-confidence vote </a>or to time a general election for after 31 October, so bypassing the Commons to effect a no-deal Brexit. But she knows she can only act politically once. If she sacks Johnson she makes enemies of the English nationalists; if she doesn\u2019t, she makes enemies of everyone else. Either way, her legitimacy is ruined. Only an elected head of state has the legitimacy to hold the ring at times like these \u2013 facing electoral consequences if they get it wrong.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The case for the EU will be as an agent for Europe-wide sustainability</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The question of how we want to be governed is no longer abstract: it goes to the heart of giant new cultural forces that want good government. The generations championing individualistic hedonism and social atomisation \u2013 the unwitting cultural accomplices of the right \u2013 are being succeeded by the Extinction Rebellion generation who are rediscovering collectivism. As the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/08/climate-crisis-reducing-lands-ability-to-sustain-humanity-says-ipcc\" title=\"\">last week spelled out</a>, how we all collectively behave, in particular the food we consume, will be crucial in determining the future of life. Livestock are environmentally dangerous. Around the world, there is a boom in substitutes for meat, as consumers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/16/new-plant-focused-diet-would-transform-planets-future-say-scientists\" title=\"\">switch to </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/16/new-plant-focused-diet-would-transform-planets-future-say-scientists\" title=\"\">plant-based diets</a> \u2013 including 39% of US consumers.</p> <p>Nor is it just eating. Decisions on everything from the use of plastics to the frequency of flying have a collective and awesome impact on everyone, particularly those young enough to expect to see the end of the century.</p> <p>Companies are finding their record on sustainability is under the microscope as never before. Whether public utilities or global multinationals in the fossil fuel or food businesses, no one escapes the new requirement to do business sustainably. This dynamic is driving the imperative to reshape capitalism around stakeholder principles.</p> <p>But only so much can come from pressure from below: governments must act from above and how we are governed is moving to the centre of the political debate. Wise and activist government \u2013 checked, balanced, accountable, sufficiently federal to accommodate the demands of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and serviced by an impartial civil service \u2013 is going to be crucial in creating a greener society, a reformed capitalism and reduction of disfiguring inequalities.</p> <p>The need for such governance will extend internationally. The case for the EU will increasingly be as an agent for Europe-wide sustainability: the ESU \u2013 European Sustainable Union. Its actions will become the global standard-setter for the environment. If we leave the EU, at the heart of the case for rejoining will be the need to make the greening of our continent a common cause.</p> <p>So don\u2019t despair. The no-deal Brexiters do not have the force behind them, any more than does Trump. They are losers, on the wrong side of history. Better people will enter politics. Old parties will be rejuvenated: new ones take life. There will be a counter-revolution \u2013 it\u2019s already in the making.</p> <p>\u2022 Will Hutton is an Observer columnist</p>",

Few can dispute that, astonishingly, while the US has 5% of the world\u2019s population, it has 35%-50% of civilian gun ownership, a trend that simply has to be reversed. Within a decade, I am sure, the debate will move on, as white supremacists continue their killing spree, from hardening background checks to debating the constitutional right to bear arms. This must and will happen and it will highlight the marginalisation of rightwing republicanism. And when the political wind changes in the US, it also changes in Britain. Trump in the US and Boris Johnson in the UK are the extreme culmination of what Reagan and Thatcher began 40 years ago. It started as a legitimate if contestable desire to reframe the postwar settlement, limit the state, promote business and individual self-reliance. But as the great political scientist Samuel Beer famously argued, it was, paradoxically, supported culturally by the individualism, anti-state instincts and nonconformism of the Woodstock generation. Forty years on, continued rightwing political ascendancy has morphed into today\u2019s menacing rightwing ideologies. The role of US republicanism as the libertarian champion of guns is matched by the descent of the Conservative party into English nationalism, with a no-deal Brexit as its talismanic policy, even if it means breaking up the UK. But a no-deal Brexit will become an inflection point for a parallel fightback in Britain. The devastating economic and political consequences \u2013 a long recession, a broken housing market, collapsed sterling, chronically unfair trade deals \u2013 will inevitably raise the question of how it ever happened. Suddenly, the British constitution, the long sleeper issue in British politics, will become the new political battleground. Britain is almost alone in having no written constitution. Whoever commands a majority in the House of Commons can do what they like without constitutional constraint \u2013 hold a referendum transforming Britain\u2019s treaty obligations with no requirement for a super-majority or ignore a no-confidence vote in the House of Commons for long enough to deliver a no-deal Brexit. The constitution does empower the monarch to assert fair play and the public interest, but a non-elected head of state can never actually act. This is no longer sustainable. We needed the Queen to insist that a referendum as important as that on EU membership required a super-majority; we will need her to sack Boris Johnson if he tries to stay in office after losing a no-confidence vote or to time a general election for after 31 October, so bypassing the Commons to effect a no-deal Brexit. But she knows she can only act politically once. If she sacks Johnson she makes enemies of the English nationalists; if she doesn\u2019t, she makes enemies of everyone else. Either way, her legitimacy is ruined. Only an elected head of state has the legitimacy to hold the ring at times like these \u2013 facing electoral consequences if they get it wrong. The question of how we want to be governed is no longer abstract: it goes to the heart of giant new cultural forces that want good government. The generations championing individualistic hedonism and social atomisation \u2013 the unwitting cultural accomplices of the right \u2013 are being succeeded by the Extinction Rebellion generation who are rediscovering collectivism. As the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last week spelled out, how we all collectively behave, in particular the food we consume, will be crucial in determining the future of life. Livestock are environmentally dangerous. Around the world, there is a boom in substitutes for meat, as consumers switch to plant-based diets \u2013 including 39% of US consumers. Nor is it just eating. Decisions on everything from the use of plastics to the frequency of flying have a collective and awesome impact on everyone, particularly those young enough to expect to see the end of the century. Companies are finding their record on sustainability is under the microscope as never before. Whether public utilities or global multinationals in the fossil fuel or food businesses, no one escapes the new requirement to do business sustainably. This dynamic is driving the imperative to reshape capitalism around stakeholder principles. But only so much can come from pressure from below: governments must act from above and how we are governed is moving to the centre of the political debate. Wise and activist government \u2013 checked, balanced, accountable, sufficiently federal to accommodate the demands of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and serviced by an impartial civil service \u2013 is going to be crucial in creating a greener society, a reformed capitalism and reduction of disfiguring inequalities. The need for such governance will extend internationally. The case for the EU will increasingly be as an agent for Europe-wide sustainability: the ESU \u2013 European Sustainable Union. Its actions will become the global standard-setter for the environment. If we leave the EU, at the heart of the case for rejoining will be the need to make the greening of our continent a common cause. So don\u2019t despair. The no-deal Brexiters do not have the force behind them, any more than does Trump. They are losers, on the wrong side of history. Better people will enter politics. Old parties will be rejuvenated: new ones take life. There will be a counter-revolution \u2013 it\u2019s already in the making. \u2022 Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p>A row has broken out between conservation groups over the wellbeing of one of Britain\u2019s most critically endangered birds of prey: the hen harrier. The dispute reveals a basic divide between experts on how to save the birds from eradication in Britain.</p> <p>Natural England announces on Sunday that 2019 has been a record year for breeding success in England. A total of 15 nests had 12 successful breeding pairs and produced 47 chicks \u2013 improving on the previous high point of 46 set in 2006, news that was hailed \u201cas a positive result\u201d by the organisation.</p> <p>\u201cIt is very welcome to see this improvement,\u201d said Natural England\u2019s chairman, Tony Juniper. But the announcement was immediately condemned by the RSPB.</p> <p>\u201cThis success is tarnished by the clear evidence that illegal killing [of hen harriers] continues with no sign of it coming to an end,\u201d said Chris Corrigan, the RSPB\u2019s director for England.</p> <p>\u201cBy the government\u2019s own figures we should have over 300 pairs of hen harriers sky dancing above the English countryside, and yet the species remains on the brink of local extinction.\u201d</p> <p>Hen harriers have been targeted for decades because the raptors \u2013 which eat mainly small birds and mammals \u2013 are considered a threat to the profitability of grouse shooting estates. As a result, some gamekeepers trap or shoot them illegally.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ed5399261790b4f624d2c1f658a2b4a91066286f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed5399261790b4f624d2c1f658a2b4a91066286f/809_105_2094_2617/800.jpg\" alt=\"Hen harrier\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The birds are considered a threat to the profitability of grouse shooting estates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In February, Natural England <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hen-harriers-tracking-programme-update/hen-harrier-annual-tracking-update\" title=\"\">published</a> a study paper that analysed the findings of satellite tagging data collected over 10 years. The study revealed that young hen harriers in England suffer abnormally high mortality, with the most likely cause being illegal killing. This point is acknowledged by Juniper.</p> <p>\u201cThe hen harrier is still very far from where it should be as a breeding species in England, not least due to illegal persecution,\u201d he admitted.</p> <p>To maintain hen harrier numbers, Natural England \u2013 working in collaboration with other conservation groups such as the Moorland Association \u2013 has placed emphasis on encouraging brood management schemes that help chicks survive. In some cases, supplementary food is provided to help chicks\u2019 survival and divert adult birds\u2019 attention from taking grouse chicks.</p> <p>Natural England said this \u201cpositive result\u201d meant the past two years had produced 81 fledged chicks, surpassing the total for the previous five years put together.</p> <p>\u201cThe chicks have also hatched in a wider variety of areas this year, including in Northumberland, Yorkshire Dales, Derbyshire and Lancashire \u2013 leading to hopes that a corner has been turned in the restoration of the hen harrier population,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Amanda Anderson, director of the Moorland Association, was also enthusiastic. She said: \u201cIt has been a fantastic year for hen harriers with a year-on-year increase in both the geographical range of the nests and the type of land on which they have successfully fledged.\u201d</p> <p>But this suggestion is flatly rejected by Corrigan. \u201cUntil something is done to stop illegal killing it is hard to see a bright future for this year\u2019s chicks. We believe licensing of driven grouse moors is the best chance we have of ensuring these wonderful birds will be seen by future generations.\u201d</p> <p>The RSPB is one of many organisations who believe the best way to protect raptors, and to improve the management of peatlands, is to license grouse moors and give authorities the power to ban shooting estates where protected species are disappearing.</p> <p>\u201cThe pervasiveness of illegal killing means many of this year\u2019s young hen harriers will not get the chance to raise a family of their own and so the population continues to dwindle,\u201d said Corrigan.</p> <p>These views were recently backed by television wildlife presenter Chris Packham. Commenting after a hen harrier was found with an almost severed leg in an illegally set trap on a South Lanarkshire grouse moor, he said the incident \u2013 which meant the bird had to be destroyed \u2013 showed that the UK shooting industry \u201cwas out of control, obviously beyond any form of self-regulation, and tolerant of an utter contempt for the laws which are meant to protect our wildlife\u201d.</p> <h2>Birds under threat</h2> <p><strong>The merlin</strong><br>Britain\u2019s smallest raptor preys on other birds such as the meadow pipit but suffered a serious decline in the 1960s due to pesticide poisoning. Habitat loss, primarily due to afforestation and overgrazing, has since hampered its recovery.</p> <p><strong>The montagu harrier</strong></p> <p>One of the most endangered of our birds of prey, this now rarely breeds in the UK. Its status is so precarious that every pair needs special protection, according to the RSPB.</p> <p><strong>The </strong><strong>marsh harrier</strong></p> <p>The largest of the harriers, the marsh harrier\u2019s numbers declined last century but have recovered in recent years, though it is still given special protection as a schedule 1 listed bird under the wildlife and countryside act.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A row has broken out between conservation groups over the wellbeing of one of Britain\u2019s most critically endangered birds of prey: the hen harrier. The dispute reveals a basic divide between experts on how to save the birds from eradication in Britain. Natural England announces on Sunday that 2019 has been a record year for breeding success in England. A total of 15 nests had 12 successful breeding pairs and produced 47 chicks \u2013 improving on the previous high point of 46 set in 2006, news that was hailed \u201cas a positive result\u201d by the organisation. \u201cIt is very welcome to see this improvement,\u201d said Natural England\u2019s chairman, Tony Juniper. But the announcement was immediately condemned by the RSPB. \u201cThis success is tarnished by the clear evidence that illegal killing [of hen harriers] continues with no sign of it coming to an end,\u201d said Chris Corrigan, the RSPB\u2019s director for England. \u201cBy the government\u2019s own figures we should have over 300 pairs of hen harriers sky dancing above the English countryside, and yet the species remains on the brink of local extinction.\u201d Hen harriers have been targeted for decades because the raptors \u2013 which eat mainly small birds and mammals \u2013 are considered a threat to the profitability of grouse shooting estates. As a result, some gamekeepers trap or shoot them illegally. In February, Natural England published a study paper that analysed the findings of satellite tagging data collected over 10 years. The study revealed that young hen harriers in England suffer abnormally high mortality, with the most likely cause being illegal killing. This point is acknowledged by Juniper. \u201cThe hen harrier is still very far from where it should be as a breeding species in England, not least due to illegal persecution,\u201d he admitted. To maintain hen harrier numbers, Natural England \u2013 working in collaboration with other conservation groups such as the Moorland Association \u2013 has placed emphasis on encouraging brood management schemes that help chicks survive. In some cases, supplementary food is provided to help chicks\u2019 survival and divert adult birds\u2019 attention from taking grouse chicks. Natural England said this \u201cpositive result\u201d meant the past two years had produced 81 fledged chicks, surpassing the total for the previous five years put together. \u201cThe chicks have also hatched in a wider variety of areas this year, including in Northumberland, Yorkshire Dales, Derbyshire and Lancashire \u2013 leading to hopes that a corner has been turned in the restoration of the hen harrier population,\u201d it said. Amanda Anderson, director of the Moorland Association, was also enthusiastic. She said: \u201cIt has been a fantastic year for hen harriers with a year-on-year increase in both the geographical range of the nests and the type of land on which they have successfully fledged.\u201d But this suggestion is flatly rejected by Corrigan. \u201cUntil something is done to stop illegal killing it is hard to see a bright future for this year\u2019s chicks. We believe licensing of driven grouse moors is the best chance we have of ensuring these wonderful birds will be seen by future generations.\u201d The RSPB is one of many organisations who believe the best way to protect raptors, and to improve the management of peatlands, is to license grouse moors and give authorities the power to ban shooting estates where protected species are disappearing. \u201cThe pervasiveness of illegal killing means many of this year\u2019s young hen harriers will not get the chance to raise a family of their own and so the population continues to dwindle,\u201d said Corrigan. These views were recently backed by television wildlife presenter Chris Packham. Commenting after a hen harrier was found with an almost severed leg in an illegally set trap on a South Lanarkshire grouse moor, he said the incident \u2013 which meant the bird had to be destroyed \u2013 showed that the UK shooting industry \u201cwas out of control, obviously beyond any form of self-regulation, and tolerant of an utter contempt for the laws which are meant to protect our wildlife\u201d. Birds under threat The merlin Britain\u2019s smallest raptor preys on other birds such as the meadow pipit but suffered a serious decline in the 1960s due to pesticide poisoning. Habitat loss, primarily due to afforestation and overgrazing, has since hampered its recovery. The montagu harrier One of the most endangered of our birds of prey, this now rarely breeds in the UK. Its status is so precarious that every pair needs special protection, according to the RSPB. The marsh harrier The largest of the harriers, the marsh harrier\u2019s numbers declined last century but have recovered in recent years, though it is still given special protection as a schedule 1 listed bird under the wildlife and countryside act.",

      "bodyText": "The Victorian parliament is gearing up for a debate over the rights of transgender and non-binary people to be able to choose the sex listed on their birth certificates. Under current law in Victoria, in order for transgender people to have their birth certificate changed to affirm their gender, they have to have undergone sex affirming surgery, often at great cost. It is something many transgender people do not wish to undertake, it is not covered by Medicare, and often the surgery is not available in Australia. On Tuesday the legislative assembly will debate the births, deaths and marriages registration bill, which will mean people will be able to change the recorded sex on their birth certificate to male, female or a sex descriptor of their choice. The reason for the proposed change is that often when providing documentation, trans people will need to out themselves as trans to prospective employers, landlords and other situations where identification documents are required. The person making the application must make a statutory declaration when nominating the sex to be recorded, and must include a statement from an adult who has known them for 12 months or more who believes the application is being made in good faith and supports the change. \u201cThis choice is important because a list of descriptive terms to describe a person\u2019s sex in their birth registration has not otherwise been widely agreed within the general community,\u201d Victoria\u2019s attorney general, Jill Hennessy, said in the second reading speech for the bill. \u201cThe only limitation on the use of sex descriptors in the bill is a discretion for the registrar to refuse to register a descriptor that is obscene or offensive, or cannot practicably be established by repute or usage.\u201d People will need to have been living in Victoria for 12 months before being able to apply to change their birth certificate, too. Parents or guardians can make applications on behalf of their child, but children under the age of 16 will only be able to change their birth certificate with an assessment by a doctor or registered psychologist that the child has the capacity to consent to the application, and the alteration is in their best interests. The Labor government last attempted to pass similar legislation in 2016, but it failed in the legislative council by one vote after the Coalition opposed it. Tasmania passed similar laws earlier this year, and it is similar to laws in the ACT, Western Australia and South Australia. In the debate on that bill at the time, Coalition MPs raised concern about the implications of the bill for single-sex facilities like gyms, domestic violence shelters, or in the sporting world. The Coalition is again set to vote against the legislation. The shadow attorney general, Edward O\u2019Donohue, told the Age while the Coalition supported people living as their identified gender, birth certificates \u201care intended to record biological sex rather than gender identity\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A new feminist group called Victoria Women\u2019s Guild opposes the bill being put through parliament without public consultation. Included in the guild are a number of academics and radical lesbian feminists. They argue that the bill should be delayed to give time for more scrutiny. \u201cThe governments of Scotland and New Zealand both recently deferred similar legislation due to concerns from women\u2019s groups and a recognition that they had not properly consulted with affected communities,\u201d a guild spokesperson, Nina Vallins, said in a statement. \u201cVictoria similarly needs to allow further scrutiny and a chance for women\u2019s voices to be heard.\u201d A group of around 100 protesters gathered on Thursday night outside an event put on by the organisation at the University of Melbourne to discuss their concerns with the bill. Despite the vocal opposition to the legislation, this time it is expected to pass, with the support of the Greens, the Reason Party and the Animal Justice Party. But it is not guaranteed. The Reason MP Fiona Patten told Joy FM\u2019s The Informer last week she had met with a number of women\u2019s groups and flagged potential amendments to address issues with other legislation such as equal opportunity law to reflect the change in recognised sex descriptors. Patten remains a supporter of the bill, however, saying she told the women\u2019s groups that they were unlikely to change her mind on the legislation. She urged people to contact politicians with personal stories of how the law change would affect them. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 August 2019.

Hastie, a conservative MP from Western Australia who chairs parliament\u2019s joint committee on intelligence and security, penned a column last week for the Nine newspapers that compared China\u2019s rise with that of Nazi Germany. Ministers have split over the remarks, with Peter Dutton backing in his fellow conservative, but others \u2013 including the finance minister Mathias Cormann and the attorney general Christian Porter \u2013 dismissing the remarks as clumsy and inappropriate. Birmingham, who was in China for trade talks centring on the regional comprehensive economic partnership, said the comments had not been helpful. \u201cI would certainly encourage any colleague or indeed anybody making comments around sensitive foreign policy matters to pose a couple of questions,\u201d he told ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday. \u201cIs the making of those comments in a public way necessary? Is it helpful to Australia\u2019s national interests?\u201d China has strongly condemned the remarks as evidence of a \u201ccold war mentality\u201d that was unhelpful to the bilateral relationship with Australia. In the case of China, he said the national interest was best served by ensuring Australia engaged in a constructive way to make sure it was a responsible citizen in the region and globally, and respected the sovereignty of other nations. Labor\u2019s defence spokesman, Richard Marles, said China was a complex issue, given its economic ties with Australia and how it asserts itself in the region. \u201cThat does present challenges for us,\u201d Marles told Sky News, while describing Hastie\u2019s comments as \u201cincendiary\u201d. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a cold war going on here, China is not the Soviet Union.\u201d But the deputy opposition leader said he believed there must be a bipartisan approach to how Australia handles the growing power of China. He said it was very important that Australia was confident enough to speak its mind and assert its national interest when it might differ from Chinese action. He said if there was to be a settled approach to China, there needed to be a bigger discussion between the government and the opposition, given Australia\u2019s federal governments have three-year terms. \u201cWe have got to have a settled position going forward over the next few decades and that does require bipartisanship,\u201d he said.

Part of the United States gold medal winning squad in the team foil event, Imboden dropped to one knee during Friday\u2019s award\u2019s ceremony as the US flag was raised in a political protest. Imboden, a Tampa native and 2016 Olympic team event bronze medalist, later explained his actions on Twitter. \u201cWe must call for change,\u201d wrote Imboden. \u201cThis week I am honored to represent Team USA at the Pan-Am Games, taking home gold and bronze. \u201cMy pride however has been cut short by the multiple shortcomings of the country I hold so dear to my heart. Racism, gun control, mistreatment of immigrants, and a president who spreads hate are at the top of a long list. \u201cI chose to sacrifice my moment today at the top of the podium to call attention to issues that I believe need to be addressed. I encourage others to please use your platforms for empowerment and change.\u201d Athletes taking a knee has become a way of protesting injustice in the United States. The protest was first started in 2016 by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick to draw attention to police shootings of unarmed black men. Imboden\u2019s gesture preceded a similar protest on Saturday by American hammer thrower Gwen Berry, who raised her fist at the end of the national anthem after winning gold. \u201cI love representing my country. America is a great country.

It is unknown what discipline Imboden could face but could impact his chances of competing at next year\u2019s Olympics, where protests of a political nature are also banned. Imboden previously knelt during the anthem at a World Cup event in Egypt in 2017.
