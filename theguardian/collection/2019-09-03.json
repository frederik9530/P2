Last month it was announced Jill Ellis, the two-times World Cup winning head coach, is to step down from arguably the top job in women\u2019s football, following the retention of their title in France. Before England\u2019s 2-1 defeat to Norway the Daily Mail reported Neville was the top target of US Soccer for the vacant position having impressed Ellis. Neville has been named on the shortlist alongside Ellis and Netherlands\u2019 coach, Sarina Wiegman, for the Fifa women\u2019s coach of the year award. However when asked about the alleged interest, Neville batted it away, telling BBC Sport: \u201cThere has been no approach.\u201d Neville is under contract with the Lionesses until 2021 and, at present, is committed to leading Team GB into the 2020 Olympics and England into a home European Championship finals in 2021.

      "body": "<h2>What happened?</h2> \n<p>In brief: a cross-party group of backbench MPs have succeeded in their attempt to take control of the Commons order paper and try to push through a bill seeking an extension to Brexit to at least 31 January, blocking a seemingly likely no-deal departure on 31 October. The Speaker, John Bercow, allowed the motion led by the Tory MP Oliver Letwin, and it was passed by 328 votes to 301.</p> \n<h2>What happens now?</h2> \n<p>The bill, signed by MPs including Philip Hammond, David Gauke and Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn, will now be debated, and one plan is to push the bill through all its Commons stages in a single day. It would then move to the Lords, where peers have been trying to clear space for it on Thursday. The rebels\u2019 aim is to secure royal assent \u2013 making the bill a law \u2013 before parliament is suspended next week.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/majority-zip/giv-39022eVZSjNxntbB/\" data-alt=\"Graph\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/majority-zip/giv-39022eVZSjNxntbB/\">Graph</a> \n</figure> \n<h2>How has the government responded?</h2> \n<p>By saying it will seek an election. Boris Johnson said the \u201conly way to resolve this\u201d would be for the government to table a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, which allows five-year parliaments to be broken if two-thirds of MPs back an election.</p> \n<h2>Will an election happen, and when?</h2> \n<p>Yes, even if not straight away, it seems.

      "bodyText": "What happened? In brief: a cross-party group of backbench MPs have succeeded in their attempt to take control of the Commons order paper and try to push through a bill seeking an extension to Brexit to at least 31 January, blocking a seemingly likely no-deal departure on 31 October. The Speaker, John Bercow, allowed the motion led by the Tory MP Oliver Letwin, and it was passed by 328 votes to 301. What happens now? The bill, signed by MPs including Philip Hammond, David Gauke and Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn, will now be debated, and one plan is to push the bill through all its Commons stages in a single day. It would then move to the Lords, where peers have been trying to clear space for it on Thursday. The rebels\u2019 aim is to secure royal assent \u2013 making the bill a law \u2013 before parliament is suspended next week. How has the government responded? By saying it will seek an election. Boris Johnson said the \u201conly way to resolve this\u201d would be for the government to table a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, which allows five-year parliaments to be broken if two-thirds of MPs back an election. Will an election happen, and when? Yes, even if not straight away, it seems. The two-thirds majority means the government requires Labour votes, and Jeremy Corbyn told MPs his party would only back an election once the bill to block no-deal Brexit completes its passage through the Commons. So any vote on Wednesday would be expected to fail. With the precise date to prorogue parliament still not fixed, the government could allow time for a second attempt, perhaps on Monday. Mooted election dates include 14 or 15 October. Who rebelled for the Conservatives, and what happens to them? There were 21 rebels \u2013 at the very top end of estimates \u2013 including party grandees and ex-ministers Kenneth Clarke, Philip Hammond, David Gauke, Justine Greening and Dominic Grieve. No 10 had promised that any Tories who voted for the motion would immediately lose the party whip and be barred from standing at the next election, and government sources said this would happen. This means the government very much no longer has a majority \u2013 and in theory has to select 21 new parliamentary candidates at top speed. Here is the list of the 21 Conservative MPs: Guto Bebb, Aberconwy Richard Benyon, Newbury Steve Brine, Winchester Alistair Burt, North East Bedfordshire Greg Clark, Tunbridge Wells Kenneth Clarke, Rushcliffe David Gauke, South West Hertfordshire Justine Greening, Putney Dominic Grieve, Beaconsfield Sam Gyimah, East Surrey Philip Hammond, Runnymede and Weybridge Stephen Hammond, Wimbledon Richard Harrington, Watford Margot James, Stourbridge Sir Oliver Letwin, West Dorset Anne Milton, Guildford Caroline Nokes, Romsey and Southampton North Antoinette Sandbach, Eddisbury Sir Nicholas Soames, Mid Sussex Rory Stewart, Penrith and The Border Edward Vaizey, Wantage Can the government block or ignore the bill? The clear majority for the measure to proceed would appear to indicate that it will also pass, and it seems unlikely ministers could find a way to somehow delay it or deny royal assent. Ministers, notably Michael Gove, had hinted the government could simply ignore an instruction to extend Brexit, even one in law.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has announced that he will ask parliament to support plans for a snap October general election after suffering a humiliating defeat in his first House of Commons vote as prime minister. Former cabinet ministers including Philip Hammond and David Gauke were among 21 Conservative rebels who banded together with opposition MPs to seize control of the parliamentary timetable on a dramatic day in Westminster. The move was aimed at paving the way for a bill tabled by the Labour backbencher Hilary Benn, which is designed to block a no-deal Brexit by forcing the prime minister to request an extension to article 50 if he cannot strike a reworked deal with the EU27. Johnson lost the vote by 328 to 301, a convincing majority of 27 for the rebels. The PM had earlier described the legislation, drawn up by a cross-party coalition including the senior Tories Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve, as \u201cJeremy Corbyn\u2019s surrender bill\u201d. After his defeat, Johnson said he would never request the delay mandated in the rebels\u2019 bill, which he said would \u201chand control of the negotiations to the EU\u201d. If MPs passed the bill on Wednesday, he said, \u201cthe people of this country will have to choose\u201d in an election that he would seek to schedule for 15 October. The prime minister will need a two-thirds majority to secure a general election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, and Jeremy Corbyn quickly made clear his party would not vote for the motion unless and until the anti no-deal bill had passed. \u201cGet the bill through first in order to take no deal off the table,\u201d the Labour leader said. The rebels hope to push the legislation through all its parliamentary stages by the end of the week \u2013 though they face a fierce battle in the Lords, where scores of Conservative peers are lining up to table wrecking amendments. Johnson held a series of meetings with potential rebels on Tuesday seeking to reassure them he was determined to strike a fresh Brexit deal with the EU27 and that MPs would be given plenty of time to debate and approve it. But several Tories appear to have been emboldened rather than deterred by the threat of losing the party whip for the remainder of the parliament \u2013 and by Johnson\u2019s decision last week to suspend parliament. They expressed concerns about Johnson\u2019s failure to show any evidence of concrete progress in the negotiations with the EU27.

Hammond, who less than six months ago was delivering his spring statement as chancellor, had said on Tuesday morning he was ready for the \u201cfight of a lifetime\u201d to hold his place in the Conservative party. \u201cI am going to defend my party against incomers, entryists, who are trying to turn it from a broad church to a narrow faction,\u201d he said. In a thinly veiled swipe at the prime minister\u2019s chief strategist, Dominic Cummings, who is not a Conservative member, he said: \u201cPeople who are at the heart of this government, who are probably not even members of the Conservative party, care nothing about the future of the Conservatives and I intend to defend my party against them.\u201d The Tory MP Phillip Lee took the more radical step of crossing the floor of the Commons to join the Liberal Democrats, removing the PM\u2019s majority just as Johnson prepared to address MPs about last week\u2019s G7 meeting. Johnson\u2019s G7 statement was just his second appearance at the dispatch box in parliament since he became prime minister in July. Addressing a raucous House of Commons, the PM claimed the motion drawn up by the cross-party coalition was \u201cwithout precedent in our history\u201d and would \u201cdestroy any chance of negotiation\u201d. He said: \u201cThere is only one way to describe the bill: it is Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s surrender bill. That is what it is. It means running up the white flag. The bill is shameful. \u201cI want to make it clear to everybody in this house: there are no circumstances in which I will ever accept anything like it. I will never surrender the control of our negotiations in the way that the leader of the opposition is demanding.\u201d Corbyn said the measure was \u201ca last chance to stop this government riding roughshod over constitutional and democratic rights in this country, so that a cabal in Downing Street cannot crash us out without a deal, without any democratic mandate and against the majority of public opinion. \u201cThe prime minister is not winning friends in Europe; he is losing friends at home. His is a government with no mandate, no morals and, as of today, no majority,\u201d he said. Lee\u2019s defection to the Lib Dems came after two moderate Tory former ministers, Justine Greening and Alistair Burt, said they would step down from parliament at the next general election. Lee, in his resignation letter, said the Brexit process had transformed his \u201conce great party\u201d into \u201csomething more akin to a narrow faction\u201d. While some of those MPs supporting the rebels\u2019 motion on Tuesday want to block Brexit, others would like to leave the EU with a deal. A group of Labour MPs, including Stephen Kinnock and Gloria De Piero, plan to table two amendments to Wednesday\u2019s bill, calling for the Brexit delay to be used to secure a deal \u2013 and a vote to be held on Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement \u2013 including the last-ditch concessions she made shortly before she was forced to resign. Urging MPs to support the rebel motion on Tuesday, Letwin said that due to the imminent suspension of parliament, this was the final opportunity for MPs to legislate and have that legislation \u201cenforced on a reluctant government\u201d. The West Dorset MP said Johnson\u2019s threat of a no-deal Brexit appeared to mean \u201cif they do not do what he wishes, he will throw himself into the abyss\u201d. Asked via an intervention whether the plan to delay Brexit until at least 31 January would not simply create confusion, Letwin said it was the best option on offer. \u201cIt\u2019s to provide the government with the time to seek to solve this problem and to enable parliament to help to resolve an issue which has proved very difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t say it\u2019s easy to do by 31 January, but I\u2019m sure that it will not be done by 31 October. We are between a rock and a hard place, and in this instance the hard place is better than the rock. It is as simple as that. It\u2019s decision time. \u201cIf honourable members across the house want to prevent a no-deal exit on 31 October, they will have the opportunity to do so if, but only if they vote for this motion this evening. I hope they will do so.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It was one of the most consequential debates in parliamentary history. Indeed, the grave subject of whether or not to hand control of the Brexit process to those seeking to avoid no deal appeared to weigh particularly heavily on the shoulders of Jacob Rees-Mogg, who spent a significant portion of the time slouched on the government front bench. The leader of the House of Commons was heavily criticised by fellow MPs, who accused him of showing contempt for parliament as he reclined on the green benches. \u201cNow, there\u2019s been a lot of talk about democracy tonight and the Leader of the House, who \u2013 I have to say \u2013 with his body language throughout this evening has been so contemptuous of this house and of the people,\u201d said the Green party MP, Caroline Lucas, as other MPs shouted at him to sit up. She added, for the benefit of parliament\u2019s written record, that Rees-Mogg had been \u201cspread across three seats, lying out as if that was something very boring to listen to tonight\u201d. The Labour MP, Anna Turley, called Rees-Mogg\u2019s slouching the \u201cphysical embodiment of arrogance, entitlement, disrespect and contempt for our parliament\u201d. A lesser man might have jumped up, suitably admonished. Not Rees-Mogg, who remained in repose, grinning and shaking his head as he adjusted his glasses. He was sitting bolt upright, however, when the tellers returned soon afterwards to deliver the result: MPs had handed his government a crushing defeat in its very first Commons vote. \u201cMr Speaker, tonight\u2019s vote made even the Leader of the House sit up,\u201d quipped the former Tory MP, Anna Soubry. As well as anger and dismay inside parliament, Rees-Mogg\u2019s deportment prompted a slew of parodies on Twitter.",

Should they stumble after a week\u2019s break away from home in front of 90-odd thousand against a Collingwood side that has rediscovered its joie de vivre, the curse will be a thing, as will the noise coming down the highway about not hosting a final in Geelong. On stumbling, there\u2019s been plenty of that from Greater Western Sydney in the back end of the season. On Saturday they host a Bulldogs team that has quietly gone about establishing what is arguably the game\u2019s best midfield that, with Marcus Bontempelli, Josh Dunkley and Jack Macrae, has plenty of bite. But the game\u2019s old salts will tell you that it\u2019s hard-nosed defence that wins you finals, and this is where questions over the Bulldogs remain. While they may be an irresistible force their backline is far from an immovable object \u2013 something that will be brought into relief with this year\u2019s Coleman medallist, Jeremy Cameron lining up at full-forward for the Giants. How it all plays out of course is a question that remains unanswered, and with the possible exception of Thursday night, this weekend represents one of the most intriguing week of finals for some time\u2026 although not perhaps as long as 15 years.",

      "bodyText": "The chancellor, Sajid Javid, will commit an extra \u00a32bn for no-deal Brexit planning, the Treasury has announced, taking the running total for preparations to more than \u00a38.3bn since the 2016 referendum. Javid is due to formally unveil the money as part of his spending round statement to MPs on Wednesday, although it remains to be seen whether this will take place as planned given moves by backbench MPs to take control of the Commons agenda. Downing Street insisted the spending review would happen in some form. However, it is understood that if the order paper is revised to make space for the backbench bill seeking to delay Brexit, it could take place as a written statement. The Treasury said the extra \u00a32bn would be spent on post-Brexit projects and would include cash for the Border Force, for the Department for Transport to assist ports, and for a possible UK replacement for the EU\u2019s Galileo satellite navigation system. The \u00a38.3bn running total for no deal comprises the original \u00a34.2bn, an extra \u00a32.1bn allocated in August for contingencies such as stockpiling medicines, an additional 500 border officials and a public awareness campaign, and the new \u00a32bn. In a statement before the spending round, Javid said: \u201cOne of my first acts as chancellor was to announce \u00a32.1bn additional funding to prepare to leave the EU. We\u2019ve now provided \u00a38.3bn to help departments prepare for Brexit. This new funding will ensure that departments can grasp the opportunities created by Brexit after we leave on 31 October.\u201d In an earlier update to MPs on no-deal planning, Michael Gove, who leads on the issue for the government, said the Operation Yellowhammer dossier on no-deal risks \u2013 which has been leaked but not published \u2013 depicted a \u201creasonable\u201d worst-case scenario. \u201cOperation Yellowhammer assumptions are not a prediction of what is likely to happen. They are not a best-case scenario or a list of probable outcomes, they are projections of what may happen in a worst-case scenario,\u201d he said. Gove conceded there would be issues connected to no deal, such as tariffs and checks on the Irish border. He added that while businesses and the public should not be \u201cblithe or blase\u201d about the challenges, the risks could be mitigated and \u201cwe can be ready\u201d. Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, said Gove\u2019s statement was \u201crather vacuous\u201d, adding that if a general election was called he would ask the civil service to publish all documents related to no-deal preparations.",

Svitolina takes the second serve early, slams it back with interest and Konta can\u2019t get her response over the net.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019ll be no more senior singles matches until Serena Williams plays her quarter-final against Qiang Wang at 7pm local time, 12am BST, and I will thus bid you adieu. Thanks for your company. Bye! There is one senior match on court currently. In the women\u2019s doubles the No1 seeds, Kristina Mladenovic and Timea Babos, are 5-2 up in the first set against the all-star Victoria Azarenka-Ash Barty pairing, with two breaks. It hasn\u2019t been a good day for the Brits: not only did Konta lose, but in the juniors Arthur Fery lost 7-6, 6-1 in the singles and has just gone down 6-1, 6-1 in the doubles, alongside Hungary\u2019s Peter Makk (to the No4 seeds), while Harry Wendelken lost his juniors doubles match 6-2, 6-2 (to the No5 seeds). Here\u2019s a bit from Medvedev\u2019s post-match on-court interview: The match was really strange. I had really big pain in my quadriceps and I didn\u2019t feel i could continue the match in the first set. I feel really strange about this match but I\u2019m happy to be in my first major semi-final. Before the match I was feeling perfect and all these tapes were for protection. In the first game of the match I pulled my quadriceps. I took a painkiller and by the fourth set I was feeling normal. I\u2019ll see how I feel and will try my best to be fit for the semis. So many people support me, so many people don\u2019t like me. I can just say, I try to be myself guys. I have to say, sorry guys, and thankyou. Fourth set: Wawrinka 6-7, 3-6, 6-3, 1-6 Medvedev* Medvedev strolls out and holds to 15, Wawrinka\u2019s point coming from a double fault. He ends the match with an inch-perfect backhand lob, and raises his hands in apology to a crowd that have veered between noisy Swiss-supporting and complete silence. There\u2019s no doubt that he was genuinely troubled by a thigh injury, but he conjured up a winning tactic and now has three days to recuperate before his semi-final! Fourth set: Wawrinka 6-7, 3-6, 6-3, 1-5 Medvedev* At 0-15 Medvedev conjures the most absurd angle on his forehand. Clearly a complete mishit, as he holds up a hand to apologise when Wawrinka fails to get it back. Wawrinka then misses a couple of backhands, and he\u2019s down a double break, with Medvedev serving for the match! Fourth set: Wawrinka 6-7, 3-6, 6-3, 1-4 Medvedev* At 15-0 Medvedev comes to the net but completely fluffs his volley, which plops apologetically in midcourt. But he correctly guesses the direction of Wawrinka\u2019s pass, flings out a racket and the ball comes off the edge and dribbles over the net, barely bouncing, for a winner. At 15-30 Medvedev serves wide and then slams his backhand into an empty court for a winner, making the game look easy. Fourth set: Wawrinka* 6-7, 3-6, 6-3, 1-3 Medvedev Hello again! Such a fascinating match, this. Wawrinka, aided by Medvedev\u2019s decision to halt the point at 30-15 to incorrectly challenge a line call, holds to gain a foothold in the set. Fourth set: Wawrinka 6-7, 3-6, 6-3, 0-3 Medvedev* A hiccup in Medvedev\u2019s game plan here, as Stan scraps his way to a break-back point. He drives a deep forehand, and scampers into the net \u2013 only for a flailing Medvedev to somehow return it with interest, forcing Wawrinka into an awkward volley that floats wide. Stan gets back to deuce, but misses an opportunity to pass in the next rally, and gets outlasted in the next. The Russian is three games away \u2013 and with that, I\u2019ll hand back to Simon. Fourth set: *Wawrinka 6-7, 3-6, 6-3, 0-2 Medvedev Will Medvedev come to regret that failed effort to break his opponent at the end of the third? Perhaps he\u2019s just feeling better now \u2013 he takes the first two points, and is unerringly accurate in another long rally. Three break points for the Russian \u2013 and a floating lob messes with Stan\u2019s head. He bunts it into the net, and Medvedev breaks! Fourth set: Wawrinka 6-7, 3-6, 6-3, 0-1 Medvedev* So, we have a match on here. Medvedev on serve to begin the fourth set, and he holds with a terrific volley, guided low beyond Wawrinka\u2019s despairing dive. Third set: *Wawrinka 6-7, 3-6 6-3 Medvedev Can Stan close it out this time? No \u2013 he goes long after a tense, tentative rally. And now Stan double faults! Oh my. Break point number four \u2013 saved with a huge serve and a crashing overhead smash. Another big body serve brings up his third set point \u2013 and this time, Medvedev nets a backhand! Third set: *Wawrinka 6-7, 3-6 5-3 Medvedev At 30-15, a Wawrinka error gives Medvedev a sniff. The next rally is a punishing one, Medvedev letting out a scream as the big forehands rain down, one too many. Set point \u2013 and with the set on his racket, Wawrinka blazes a forehand wide! Deuce, and Wawrinka has tightened up here, netting to surrender a break point. Stan digs out an ace, but his opponent goes toe-to-toe with him in the next rally, a 20-shot epic that Medvedev wins! Another ace rescues Wawrinka again, but he misjudges a backhand, and Medvedev has a third break point. Can he make this extra effort count? The umpire calls his slice-shot out, and another Wawrinka ace brings up set point. What a game this is ... Third set: Wawrinka 6-7, 3-6 5-3 Medvedev* Stan challenges the call on a Medvedev ace, but it was in by a millimetre. Another ace, and two netted returns, and Wawrinka will have to serve this out. Third set: *Wawrinka 6-7, 3-6 5-2 Medvedev A hefty return from the Russian, a looping mishit from Wawrinka, and it\u2019s 15-30. A shorter kicking second serve helps Stan take control of the next rally, followed up with an ace. Wawrinka then gets Medvedev running with a drop shot, and powers a volley home to move one game from the set. Third set: *Wawrinka 6-7, 3-6 4-2 Medvedev Another service hold, this time wrapped up in less than a minute. Third set: *Wawrinka 6-7, 3-6 4-1 Medvedev They\u2019re certainly whipping through this set \u2013 five games down in barely 10 minutes. This time, Stan goes wide with his first serves, not letting Medvedev get into the points. Third set: Wawrinka 6-7, 3-6 3-1 Medvedev* Stan has played 50 five-set matches in his career; Medvedev is yet to win a five-setter. So it\u2019s not in Medvedev\u2019s interests for this to go the distance. He gets on the board here in another low-energy game, big serves getting the job done. Third set: *Wawrinka 6-7, 3-6 3-0 Medvedev Wawrinka powers his way to 40-15, then fires an ace down the middle that Medvedev doesn\u2019t bother moving for. A terrific start to this set for Stan \u2013 is his opponent saving energy, or feeling a bit of tension? Third set: Wawrinka 6-7, 3-6 2-0 Medvedev* Two double faults in succession hand Wawrinka two break points. Can he get ahead in this set. Yes he can \u2013 he outlasts Medvedev in a rally. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how hard Medvedev pushes himself in the rest of this set. Third set: *Wawrinka 6-7, 3-6 1-0 Medvedev This is Niall here, stepping in while Simon has a short break. Wawrinka opens the third set with a hold to love, finishing it off with a feathered drop shot with Medvedev adrift at the baseline. Second set: Wawrinka 6-7, 3-6 Medvedev* \u201cIt seems playing an seemingly injured Medvedev is equally difficult,\u201d says @chuks_ceekay on Twitter. \u201cHe is using a lot of smart thinking.\u201d This is really intriguing stuff. Medvedev swoops through the set in 33 minutes. Second set: Wawrinka* 6-7, 3-5 Medvedev Medvedev, holding a break, seems happy to surrender Wawrinka\u2019s service games to concentrate on his own. The Swiss holds to 15, without much of a fight. Second set: Wawrinka 6-7, 2-5 Medvedev* And then Medvedev holds to 15. He looks comfortable right now, tactically if not physically (though we haven\u2019t seen the trainer for a while). Second set: Wawrinka* 6-7, 2-4 Medvedev Wawrinka holds to love. Second set: Wawrinka 6-7, 1-4 Medvedev* Wawrinka is being out-thought here, and it\u2019s really quite fascinating to watch. My suspicion is that Medvedev will falter before the finish line, but it\u2019s very far from certain. Second set: Wawrinka* 6-7, 1-3 Medvedev At 30-30 Wawrinka plays an absolutely remorseless point, thrashing the ball hither and yon while Medvedev throws himself about gamely but ultimately in vain. Then he hits a second serve straight into his opponent\u2019s backhand sweet spot, it whistles back past him and all that hard work is undone. Another winning backhand return and an unforced error from Wawrinka and Medvedev is up a set and a break! Second set: Wawrinka 6-7, 1-2 Medvedev* There is always a point, between a player getting injured and them giving up, when they are wildly improvising alternative strategies and it looks like they might actually work. This is where we are at the moment, with Medvedev hitting an unusual number of drop shots (which aren\u2019t really paying off), increasing the power of his forehands and going for broke with his first serve. There are a couple of aces in this game, which he holds to 30, but the question is whether his body will last as long as his tactics. Second set: Wawrinka* 6-7, 1-1 Medvedev Medvedev runs forward for an easy shot, but gets to the ball before he\u2019s decided what to do with it and in the end scoops something pretty sad back towards Wawrinka, which is put away with maximum violence. A hold to love. Second set: Wawrinka 6-7, 0-1 Medvedev* An email from David Sweet: \u201c\u2018Having spent an age strapping up Medvedev\u2019s left thigh, this time the trainer slices it off. This doesn\u2019t work as well.\u2019 I\u2019m surprised it worked at all to be honest. Must be tough playing with a thigh sliced off: credit to Medvedev for winning the 12th game!\u201d Fair point. It was the strapping that was sliced off, rather than the thigh itself. On court, Medvedev keeps on hobbling productively. First set: Wawrinka 6-7 Medvedev Medvedev\u2019s lovely topspun lob wins him the first point, the ball spinning away from the scampering Wawrinka, and the next two as well. He\u2019s throwing everything at this, despite the injury. Later he almost assassinates a ball girl with a first serve that arrows just wide of her head, and then serves up another delicious drop-shot/lob double-whammy. That takes it to 5-2. A few moments later it\u2019s 5-6, thanks mainly to a brilliant Wawrinka backhand, with the ball already behind him, that turned an apparently lost cause into a point won. Medvedev saves the set point, and then wins one of his own with another drop shot. Wawrinka\u2019s next return floats long, and the Russian has won the set! Whether he can win another two, or even stay vertical long enough to have a chance, is now the question. First set: Wawrinka 6-6 Medvedev* A ninth double fault takes the score to 0-30. Medvedev then comes to the net, which reduces the need to run around the baseline even if he doesn\u2019t look at home there. Still, he wins the point, and the next after Wawrinka\u2019s return floats long, and the next after sneaking to the net again and landing his first volley on the back of the line, and holds when Wawrinka\u2019s forehand clips the top of the net and floats wide. We have ourselves a tiebreak. First set: Wawrinka* 6-5 Medvedev Wawrinka makes his opponent run around a bit, as of course you must when your opponent looks to be suffering. Medvedev wins the first couple of points anyway, the second after really quite a lot of to-and-fro sprinting, but loses the next four and must now serve to stay in the set. First set: Wawrinka 5-5 Medvedev* Having spent an age strapping up Medvedev\u2019s left thigh, this time the trainer slices it off. This doesn\u2019t work as well: Wawrinka streaks to a 0-30 lead, then Medvedev double-foot-faults to give his opponent three break points. The Swiss takes the third, when Medvedev nets a backhand. First set: Wawrinka* 4-5 Medvedev At 30-0 Medvedev hits a brilliant winning forehand return, and then another forehand puts him in a winning position in the next point. A couple of excellent serves later it\u2019s 5-4, and the trainer is back out. First set: Wawrinka 3-5 Medvedev* The Russian gets up, dusts himself down and holds to 30. Wawrinka, whose last opponent, Novak Djokovic, didn\u2019t complete the match, must be sniffing a potential repeat. Medvedev\u2019s thigh is now getting some significant strapping. The trainer is on, and prodding Medvedev\u2019s left thigh. First set: Wawrinka* 3-4 Medvedev Medvedev wins a point with a lovely angled wrong-footing forehand. However, he loses all the other points. First set: Wawrinka 2-4 Medvedev* Medvedev, meanwhile, continues to flirt with disaster without ever quite finding it. He hits a puzzlingly poor forehand a foot wide to gift Wawrinka a break point at 30-40, then another double fault surrenders another. They\u2019re both saved, mind, and he holds again. First set: Wawrinka* 2-3 Medvedev Wawrinka has had absolutely no hassle on his serve since he lost it. First set: Wawrinka 1-3 Medvedev* Medvedev, at 40-15, produces his fourth double fault, followed by his fifth. That matches the number of double faults he served in the entirety of his last match, against Dominik Koepfer, which he won in four sets. He does like a double fault, but this is ridiculous. He holds anyway. First set: Wawrinka* 1-2 Medvedev Wawrinka gets on the board. First set: Wawrinka 0-2 Medvedev* There was a period during the second set of the Konta match when watching the action wasn\u2019t rendered awkward by an annoying shadow, but really this court isn\u2019t at its best during daylight hours. Anyway, I digress. Medvedev soars to a 40-0 lead and then gives away four points, the last three with double faults, to present Wawrinka with a break point. Finally he lands a serve (at the second attempt), and the Swiss is so surprised he hits his return wide. Medvedev refocuses and takes the game from there. First set: Wawrinka* 0-1 Medvedev An early break! Medvedev goes 15-40 up after forcing Wawrinka into three desperate stretching volleys, each more improbable than the last, and then an overhit backhand ends the game. The warm-up is over, and Wawrinka is about to serve. Medvedev wins the toss, and chooses to receive. \u201cI hope it\u2019s going to be fair to both players and I hope it\u2019s going to be electric,\u201d says Medvedev of the atmosphere on Arthur Ashe. \u201cHopefully it\u2019s going to be a great match to watch.\u201d And with that he too is off to the court, to loud pantomime booing. Stan Wawrinka is about to take to the court. \u201cThe emotion I get here is always great and hopefully I can play at a good level today,\u201d he says. In other British-based news, Arthur Fery lost his second-round match against Canada\u2019s Liam Draxl 7-6, 6-1. This wasn\u2019t as bad as the French Open, when she was absolutely phenomenal in the quarter-final but fell apart in the semi. Svitolina is a fine player who gave nothing away. But the more often Konta reaches the final stages of Grand Slams without reaching the final of one, and the more often she comes out of major matches feeling that she lost rather than being beaten, the more problems with self-belief are likely to trouble her. Final unforced error count: Konta 35-13 Svitolina. The Ukrainian was excellent, and her court coverage forced Konta to go for shots she might ordinarily have held back from, but there were just too many mistakes. Second set: Konta 4-6, 4-6 Svitolina Konta takes the first point of the game, but that\u2019s as good as it gets. At 30-15 Konta comes to the net but fails to put away a difficult first volley, allowing Svitolina to sprint across the court and hit an excellent backhand pass! That sets up two more match points, and after one more overcooked Konta forehand it\u2019s all over! Second set: Konta* 4-6, 4-5 Svitolina At 30-30 Konta has a straightforward forehand, which balloons off her racket to give her opponent a first match point. It\u2019s saved with a strong serve, and when she concedes another with an overhit backhand that too is saved with a strong serve. This, she works out, is a decent tactic, and with two more service winners she takes the game and forces Svitolina to serve this out! Second set: Konta 4-6, 3-5 Svitolina* Sometimes it\u2019s like every fourth Konta shot is rubbish, and so long as Svitolina keeps a point going long enough she\u2019s sooner or later going to be gifted it. At 40-30 Konta hits a great return which Svitolina can only scoop back. Konta runs forward, raises her racket, and slams her volley into the net, which just about sums up her afternoon. Second set: Konta* 4-6, 3-4 Svitolina The comeback ends here. At 0-15 Konta hits another fine drop shot, but she is caught on her heels when Svitolina reaches it leading to her losing that point, and then there\u2019s another unforced error, and a fine down-the-line pass, and the Ukrainian is a break up once again! Second set: Konta 4-6, 3-3 Svitolina* At 15-30, down a break, down a set, Konta winds up a forehand in midcourt. Svitolina, at the other end, isn\u2019t sure which way to run. Konta thwacks it three yards wide and a couple long. Thus what might have been two break points become 30-30, and the Konta fightback continues to falter under the weight of unnecessary errors. At deuce Svitolina hits a weak second serve and Konta piles into the forehand return ... which lands long. But then Svitolina fails to put away an easy backhand, Konta reads her intentions and wins a point that should have been over, and buoyed by this she takes the next couple of points, breaking back with a perfect forehand drop shot. Svitolina had an easy shot to go 4-2 up; instead it\u2019s 3-3! Second set: Konta* 4-6, 2-3 Svitolina At 30-15 Konta hits a backhand into the net, when had it cleared it was a straightforward winner. Then she unnecessarily hits another backhand well wide to concede a break point. Svitolina this time fails to punish a second serve, but she does so to win the next point, and another unforced error gives Svitolina the break! Konta has hit 25 unforced errors to her opponent\u2019s 11, and there have simply been too many, at bad times. Second set: Konta 4-6, 2-2 Svitolina* There is an absolute stonker of a point from Konta here, as she races back to chase down a lob, lifts up a defensive lob of her own, and then reaches Svitolina\u2019s crosscourt backhand before thundering one of her own down the line. It doesn\u2019t really help, and she eventually overhits a backhand to surrender the game. Second set: Konta* 4-6, 2-1 Svitolina Konta holds to 15 and wins the game with an ace, though until then it had been a real scrap. It\u2019s been a fun match so far, and has potential to give us quite a bit more. Second set: Konta 4-6, 1-1 Svitolina* A second fairly straightforward hold as the players rein in the throttle a little. Second set: Konta* 4-6, 1-0 Svitolina For the first time, a game is won to love. First set: Konta 4-6 Svitolina* Konta\u2019s thunderous backhand is a serious exocet, and when she hits it sweetly Svitolina cannot deal with it at all. She wins a couple of points with its assistance, including the first set point, but then on the second she opts for a slice, floats it long and that\u2019s the set. First set: Konta* 4-5 Svitolina Svitolina will have to serve for the set, after Konta serves her first ace on her way to a relatively straightforward hold. The final point is won on the second serve, which Svitolina has been tucking into like they\u2019re an all-you-can-eat buffet, but this time she significantly overhits her forehand. First set: Konta 3-5 Svitolina* From 30-0 Konta turns the game around to eventually have a break point at 30-40. Svitolina wins it with an ace (Konta has had three break points, and laid a racket on one of the resulting serves), and the next after an excellent rally, and then Konta fails to land her next service return. First set: Konta* 3-4 Svitolina Another break! Svitolina breaks to 15 this time, pouncing on an indecisive volley when Konta could have killed the point to pass the Briton with a stretching crosscourt backhand. As the game ends, Konta is 11-6 up on both winners and unforced errors. First set: Konta 3-3 Svitolina* Konta starts the game with her two best points of the match so far, the first won with a vicious backhand down the line, the second with a matching forehand after manoeuvring her opponent out of position. Svitolina recovers to 40-30 at which Konta clicks back into gear with a massive winning forehand, and she takes the game from there to break back instantly. She may have hit more unforced errors than her opponent, but she is also 11-4 up on winners. First set: Konta* 2-3 Svitolina Konta goes 0-30 down by overhitting a forehand to end a long rally, and Svitolina goes on to have the match\u2019s first break point. Konta saves that one, but when she concedes another and fluffs her first serve the writing is on the wall. Svitolina takes the second serve early, slams it back with interest and Konta can\u2019t get her response over the net. The key metric here is unforced errors: Konta has hit nine, and Svitolina four. First set: Konta 2-2 Svitolina* Tom Hiddlestone is once again in attendance, as he has been for each of Konta\u2019s matches in this tournament, setting the tongues of tennis\u2019s gossipmongers wildly wagging. Svitolina holds to 15, also hitting ferociously but also less error-strewn. First set: Konta* 2-1 Svitolina There are two point-winning backhands here, one down the line at ferocious pace and one crosscourt with a fine angle. She holds to 15, and it\u2019s been a very encouraging start. First set: Konta 1-1 Svitolina* Konta has a glimmer of a chance at 15-30, but from there Svitolina serves an ace, Konta misses a return and Svitolina serves another ace, and that\u2019s the end of that. First set: Konta 1-0 Svitolina Not a perfect opening game from Konta, who hits a forehand wide, a first serve long and a backhand into the top of the net. But despite a couple of unforced errors it was a very promising start, the Briton hitting with power and depth. Warm-ups have been warmed up, and Konta will serve first as the match gets under way. It is a very sunny day, and apparently quite still. The temperature in New York is apparently a pleasant 26C. Perhaps everyone is out enjoying the weather, which is why they are so late to take their seats. The stands are less filling up than very gradually de-emptying. Elina Svitolina has an even briefer chat, in which she reveals how she managed to beat Konta on each of their four previous meetings: \u201cI think I was really focused from the beginning and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got to do today.\u201d Action on the show courts! Jo Konta gives a brief pre-match interview before going out: I\u2019m just looking forward to going out there, to playing on Ashe for the first time in this tournament and hopefully playing some great tennis. I know I\u2019m going to be in for a tough match and my record hasn\u2019t been great against her, but there\u2019s always another day to try and I\u2019m looking forward to doing that. The live feed from Arthur Ashe has started. Play is due to get under way in eight minutes and there are about 35 people in the world\u2019s largest tennis stadium. The only senior match currently ongoing is on the Louis Armstrong Stadium, where the German No12 seeds, Andreas Mies and Kevin Krawietz, are playing Leonardo Mayer and Joao Sousa in the men\u2019s doubles quarter-finals. The German\u2019s lead 4-3 in the first set, with the match going with serve. Here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell\u2019s quarter-final preview: Day nine dawns, a day in which Roger Federer faces Grigor Dimitrov for the eighth time (he has lost two sets and no matches) and Stan Wawrinka faces Daniil Medvedev for the second time (having lost the first at Wimbledon a couple of years back). In the women\u2019s quarter-finals, Serena Williams attempts to avenge her Miami Masters defeat to Qiang Wang. Meanwhile on the outer courts Britain\u2019s Arthur Fery plays in the junior singles on Court 10 and the junior doubles on Court 7. Interesting fact: Fery\u2019s dad, Lo\u00efc Fery, is chairman of French Ligue 2 football club Lorient. Before all that, though, comes the latest chapter in the Jo Konta story, as the Briton seeks her first win against Elina Svitolina, at the fifth attempt, and it is here that my focus will initially fall. If Konta plays as well as she can and often does, it should be an absolute cracker. Welcome!",

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 4 September.</p> <h2>Top stories</h2> <p><strong>British MPs have voted to allow a bill to prevent a no-deal Brexit </strong>on 31 October by 328 to 301, after Conservative MPs rebelled against their own party. Boris Johnson threatened to force an early election after losing the vote. During the debate MPs reacted furiously to a speech from the leader of the House, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who said the move to prevent no deal was nothing but \u201clegislative legerdemain\u201d and then ostentatiously lay down and closed his eyes on the Commons benches. Earlier Johnson watched his one-vote Commons majority <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/03/phillip-lee-quits-tories-leaving-government-without-a-majority\">vanish before his eyes</a> thanks to the defection of the Conservative MP Phillip Lee to the Liberal Democrats. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/03/commons-showdown-looms-in-battle-over-no-deal-brexit-live\">Follow our live blog</a> for all the reaction to the vote.</p> <p><strong>Australians have largely tuned out of federal politics</strong>, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll, which suggests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/04/the-big-tune-out-few-australians-follow-politics-closely-guardian-essential-poll-shows\">only 15% are following events in Canberra closely</a>. A further 15% of the sample professed no interest in politics at all, with the rest casual consumers of national affairs. The fortnightly survey of 1,075 respondents found that 38% monitored political events sufficiently to know what\u2019s afoot, 23% said they tuned in when something big was happening, and 8% engaged only during elections. The general disengagement is consistent with a range of other surveys that suggest Australians are disillusioned with politics after a decade of leadership infighting and hyper-partisan battles over important policy issues, including climate change.</p> <p><strong>A council in South Australia has vowed to crack down on the \u201cnuisance behaviour\u201d of local cats</strong>, passing regulations to limit the number of felines per property and forcing owners to keep their pets inside at night. Residents of Mount Barker in Adelaide are the latest in the state to face penalties if their cats are found roaming the streets at night, after several other councils passed tough regulations. There will be penalties for cats caught outside curfew hours, and potentially covert surveillance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/04/curfews-and-covert-surveillance-sa-council-declares-war-on-nuisance-cats\">suspected nuisance cats</a>.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 4 September. Top stories British MPs have voted to allow a bill to prevent a no-deal Brexit on 31 October by 328 to 301, after Conservative MPs rebelled against their own party. Boris Johnson threatened to force an early election after losing the vote. During the debate MPs reacted furiously to a speech from the leader of the House, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who said the move to prevent no deal was nothing but \u201clegislative legerdemain\u201d and then ostentatiously lay down and closed his eyes on the Commons benches. Earlier Johnson watched his one-vote Commons majority vanish before his eyes thanks to the defection of the Conservative MP Phillip Lee to the Liberal Democrats. Follow our live blog for all the reaction to the vote. Australians have largely tuned out of federal politics, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll, which suggests only 15% are following events in Canberra closely. A further 15% of the sample professed no interest in politics at all, with the rest casual consumers of national affairs. The fortnightly survey of 1,075 respondents found that 38% monitored political events sufficiently to know what\u2019s afoot, 23% said they tuned in when something big was happening, and 8% engaged only during elections. The general disengagement is consistent with a range of other surveys that suggest Australians are disillusioned with politics after a decade of leadership infighting and hyper-partisan battles over important policy issues, including climate change. A council in South Australia has vowed to crack down on the \u201cnuisance behaviour\u201d of local cats, passing regulations to limit the number of felines per property and forcing owners to keep their pets inside at night. Residents of Mount Barker in Adelaide are the latest in the state to face penalties if their cats are found roaming the streets at night, after several other councils passed tough regulations. There will be penalties for cats caught outside curfew hours, and potentially covert surveillance of suspected nuisance cats. The mayor, Ann Ferguson, said: \u201cWe had a lengthy consultation over a month and received over 500 responses, so it was obvious that people are quite passionate about cats roaming the streets.\u201d World Hurricane Dorian continues to pummel the northern Bahamas, as the south-eastern US braces for its turn. Footage from the Caribbean islands show terrifying scenes as residents tried to escape the huge storm surge. Britain, the US and France may be complicit in war crimes in Yemen, by arming and providing support to a Saudi-led coalition that starves civilians as a war tactic, a UN report has said. Walmart has announced it will discontinue the sale of handgun ammunition, and will ask customers not to carry firearms openly in stores. Top US envoys to Afghanistan have condemned the US approach to negotiating a troop withdrawal, warning it risked a return to \u201ctotal civil war\u201d. Members of Italy\u2019s anti-establishment Five Star Movement have overwhelmingly backed a coalition with the centre-left Democratic party in an online vote, giving the final backing to a deal between traditional foes intended to pull Italy out of a political crisis. Opinion and analysis There will always be people who call for an additional review of science when the results of a rigorous process don\u2019t yield the outcomes they want. A case in point is the scientific consensus statement on the Great Barrier Reef, writes the former Australian chief scientist Ian Chubb: \u201cThere is a small handful of scientists who have argued that the overwhelming majority are wrong, notwithstanding that the most prominent concedes that he is \u2018not the authority on the issue\u2019. If there is evidence that leads to an alternative conclusion, it should be put into the public domain and be subjected to the same scrutiny as the work critiqued in the consensus statement. There has been plenty of time for the work to be done. This is no time for hunches; it is time for evidence.\u201d Boris Johnson\u2019s actions on Brexit are best explained by his \u201ccongenital aversion to things that are hard\u201d, writes Rafael Behr. \u201cHe wants a deal but not the effort of getting a deal. He is lying to the public when he blames the opposition or Brussels for his predicament \u2013 but lying also, one suspects, to himself. A man who spent years in estrangement from the truth is unlikely to seek its company now \u2026 He wins applause by making Brexit sound easy, and the credulous ovation sustains him in refusal to consider the prospect that he is wrong.\u201d But if Britain is taken in, the EU is not. \u201cThey are just waiting for the inevitable moment when the pantomime must end, and British politics emerges blinking into the cold daylight of a true-life Brexit.\u201d Sport Ukrainian Elina Svitolina has won her US Open quarter-final 6-4, 6-4 against the UK\u2019s Johanna Konta. Unforced errors cost Konta a second slam semi-final place this year. \u201cCome Thursday night it will have been 5,479 days since Essendon won a final \u2013 the best part of 15 years. If you want to catch it on your iPhone, open YouTube, search \u2018AFL 2004 elimination final\u2019 and note that neither of these things existed at that time,\u201d writes Craig Little. Thinking time: \u2018The cruelty is the point\u2019 \u201cOn a personal level I couldn\u2019t understand why \u2013 after so much documenting of how horrific that split had been in the predawn raid \u2013 I thought surely they wouldn\u2019t do this again. Surely they\u2019ll do this in a way that\u2019s not traumatic. But the department dialled it right back up again. I find that completely impossible to metabolise.\u201d Over the past year, the freelance journalist Rebekah Holt has regularly visited two families in Melbourne immigration detention, writes Helen Davidson. This week one of those families \u2013 Priya and Nades, and their two daughters, Tharnicaa and Topika \u2013 have been the focus of an extraordinary amount of community grief, anger, and support, after the Australian government attempted to deport them to Sri Lanka. At 7.43pm last Thursday, Holt received a video call. \u201cAll I could see was them surrounded by guards, and a guard reading out the deportation notice,\u201d she says. \u201cI was watching for 20 or 30 seconds and we were cut off, and that\u2019s when I rang [the family\u2019s lawyer] Carina Ford and told her it was happening, but she hadn\u2019t been given any of the paperwork, hadn\u2019t been told it was happening.\u201d Other asylum seekers called Holt and told her they couldn\u2019t get to see the family. Separated into different vans, Priya and Nades each called Holt to tell her where they were, as they were driven to a waiting plane. Media roundup The Tamil asylum case sets the path for 6,000 others, the Australian claims. The Sydney Morning Herald reveals that two NSW Liberal MPs have threatened to defect to the crossbench, a move that would push the Coalition into minority government, if certain amendments are not made to the abortion bill. Trade surplus to the rescue is the Australian Financial Review\u2019s take on the economy, as concerns over growth are partly relieved by an export surge. Coming up A federal court hearing in Melbourne over the deportation of the Biloela Tamil asylum seeker family starts at 9.30am. Australia\u2019s GDP figures will be released at 11.30am, and are expected to point to a weakening economy. Follow the numbers, as well as reaction and expert analysis, on our live blog.

      "bodyText": "England will finally unleash Bath\u2019s uncapped Ruaridh McConnochie on Friday as they seek to conclude their World Cup preparations with a flourish against Italy in Newcastle. McConnochie will be named on Wednesday morning in the starting lineup as part of a seriously quick back three alongside Anthony Watson and Jonny May. McConnochie was expected to make his debut during the warm-up games last month but was twice forced to pull out with injury niggles. The former Great Britain sevens player, who collected a silver medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics, is in line to make it third time lucky at St James\u2019 Park. According to his roommate May, the 27-year-old McConnochie was extremely disappointed to miss out against Wales last month. \u201cRuaridh was upset on the Friday, immediately after training, before we played Wales,\u201d May said. \u201cOther than that, though, he\u2019s just got on with it. For him not to mope around is a credit to him. That\u2019s probably one of the reasons Eddie Jones likes him.\u201d May, consequently, believes there could be an immediate McC-flurry of tries from the newcomer. \u201cI\u2019ve told him to look after himself, be smart and don\u2019t push it. He\u2019s here for a reason. He\u2019s had a brilliant season with Bath, he\u2019s got experience at an Olympic Games and he\u2019s a really great guy. He\u2019s going to do well \u2026 he\u2019s got good energy about him.\u201d England already have enviable depth in the back three, with Joe Cokanasiga and Elliot Daly also heading for Japan and the recuperating Jack Nowell in reserve. It will be interesting, even so, to see how Watson fares at 15, where he played with conspicuous success for the 2017 Lions in New Zealand. Another striking performance, in concert with his two flanking greyhounds McConnochie and May could yet earn him a more prominent role in the coming weeks. Joe Marler has been practising as an emergency tighthead in case he is required to fulfil that role in a World Cup emergency.

Over a Neptunes-style slinky beat, L-Fresh asks: \u201cWhy blend in when you\u2019re born to stand out?\u201d\u2013&#xa0; a slogan lifted from a hoodie the rapper says he bought five years ago and wore to the point of disintegration. A trippy vaporwave bridge slams this inspiration song to a halt mid-track for a comedic conversation about a Sony Discman. It rings a little like one of those obligatory skits on early hip-hop albums \u2013 an odd touch, but perfectly in line with the theme of the song. A solid contender to make the crossover to commercial radio \u2013 it would certainly be a welcome addition.</p> <p><strong>For more:</strong> L-FRESH the LION tours the east coast of Australia next month</p> <h2>Even \u2013 Mark the Days</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Ice Cream Hands, Bob Mould, Redd Kross</p> <p>One of Australian music\u2019s finest and most under-appreciated rock bands are touring this month to celebrate 25 years since they formed. To mark the occasion they have casually pumped out a new single that easily sits among their very best work. Mark the Days sounds as though it was spawned in Minnesota in the 80s and dragged through the Melbourne suburbs throughout the 90s, with plenty of time spent in pubs hammering together the riffs and sanding down the rough edges. The production is warm and rounded, sonically landing somewhere between Big Star and Teenage Fanclub, while the song swings confidently from hook to hook, suggesting that Even have some of their finest work still ahead of them.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Listen to any of their seven albums, or catch their 25-year anniversary tour, which starts in late September and carries through until November</p> <h2>Tones and I \u2013 Never Seen the Rain</h2> <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> the Jackson 5, Hanson, Macy Gray</p> <p>Last month Tones and I became the first Australian artist to top the singles chart for more than a year, with the infectious Dance Monkey. The song hit the top spot a few weeks after Toni Watson\u2019s festival-stealing performance at Splendour in the Grass, where a crowd of 20,000 gathered at noon to watch her play the opening slot. Dance Monkey is still sitting at No 1, where it has been for five weeks now. Never Seen the Rain is an even better tune. And, while this is going to sound like a back-handed compliment but it is meant with the utmost respect: this song sounds a hell of a lot like Hanson. Watson\u2019s voice is a dead-ringer for a 15-year-old Taylor, and skips deftly across a sprinkling piano and drum-machine claps like the Motown singers of old. It\u2019s breezy and economically produced, the chorus sounds like a gospel rave-up, and it\u2019s one of the most interesting and infectious songs I\u2019ve heard this year.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Tones and I tours the country in September and October</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fb2428e18933ca7e7c3c788c7705dd87b37dfe86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb2428e18933ca7e7c3c788c7705dd87b37dfe86/0_321_4928_2959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luca Brasi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tasmanian band Luca Brasi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Laidlaw</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Luca Brasi \u2013 Tangled; Content</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Jimmy Eat World, the Starting Line, Yellowcard</p> <p>Tasmania\u2019s finest are back with a slice of mid-tempo emo that sounds as though it belongs on the mix CD in Seth Cohen\u2019s starter pack. Open-hearted punk rock is hard to master without sounding adolescent or cloying, especially after four albums, but Luca Brasi have honed their songwriting to a point where they can channel and command nostalgia without wallowing in it. \u201cIt\u2019s not the length of the years / It\u2019s the length of the days,\u201d Tyler Richardson sings, echoing the US author Gretchen Rubin\u2019s self-help edict. It\u2019s a story of living for the moment, if only in order to later pore over every detail. This song is so well-crafted, it asks the question: can Luca Brasi\u2019s forthcoming fifth album be their best yet?</p> <p><strong>For more:</strong> Luca Brasi headlines the <a href=\"https://www.tilthewheelsfalloff.com.au/\">Til the Wheels Fall Off festival</a> in Launceston, November 1-3.</p> <h2>Tkay Maidza \u2013 Awake</h2> <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> Nicki Minaj, Santigold, MIA</p> <p>Musicians are prone to insomnia. The combination of travel, blurred timezones, hotel pillows and periods of intense boredom, interspersed with rocketing adrenaline and varying states of sobriety lead to less-than-ideal sleeping patterns. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how to be tired,\u201d Maidza claims in Awake, returning for the first time this year with a huge, hypnotic home run. Technology looms large in lethargic lyrics, with a woozy and warped trap beat adding a dystopian drone to the insomnia-riddled lyrics \u2013 the aural equivalent of a screen-induced headache. A minute-long barrage from the Baltimore rapper Jpegmafia peppers the listener with violent imagery quite removed from the song\u2019s theme but it still works a treat. A beautiful bridge floats in and threatens slumber at one point, but the dream is stillborn.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Listen to Maidza\u2019s singles Flexin\u2019 and Ghost, and catch Jpegmafia at the <a href=\"https://www.listenout.com.au/\">Listen Out festival</a> in late September and early October</p> <h2>Alex the Astronaut \u2013 I Like to Dance</h2> <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> Josh Pyke, Kasey Chambers, Dolly Parton</p> <p>I Like to Dance will make you sigh, make you angry, make you cry. One of the most heartbreaking and visceral songs released in years, this tale of puppy love slowly soured by violence is told bluntly and steadily, never couched in easy metaphor or reliant upon clever wordplay. The escalation of events is sickening and rings all too true, iwth details unspooling and being related in a casually muted way. \u201cI\u2019m mostly like everyone else,\u201d the protagonist quivers nervously, the use of the qualifier being perhaps the most striking moment of a breathtaking song. Towards the end, she lists reasons not to leave \u2013 financial, parental, fear-based \u2013 but also allows herself to imagine a life free of domestic abuse, where she could be a doctor, an artist, anything she desires. Tragically, it sounds a lot like like wishful thinking.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Alex the Astronaut is touring nationally from September</p> <h2>Kate Ceberano, Steve Kilbey and Sean Sennett \u2013 Monument City Lights, 1973</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>the Church, Pretenders, Nancy and Lee.</p> <p>This is late-night driving music: wind roaring in where the windows should be, green and red lights reflecting in the rain, a lost highway, a Lynchian mood. The Church\u2019s Steve Kilbey and Kate Ceberano didn\u2019t meet during the recording process, instead they transmitted their voices to each other. Both are much richer vocalists now than they were during the 80s, and here they follow in the tradition of Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazelwood, lazily harmonising then sliding into unison, and delivering rich, cracked and wonderful textures over a chugging rhythm. This recalls the best elements of Australian rock: chiming guitars, thwacking drums and a dark propulsion that threatens to soar over the cliff into the abyss at any given moment. \u201cIt\u2019s tight jeans, bad skin and kissing in dark places,\u201d explained Ceberano of the nostalgic air of this track. \u201cAn indelible tattoo on the psyche.\u201d</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>The trio are now recording their debut album. Maybe they will meet in person. Stay tuned</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8226a73cb8758f05e5704c2aabbe772bfccd0c2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8226a73cb8758f05e5704c2aabbe772bfccd0c2a/0_0_3000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julia Why?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julia Why?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Julia Why? \u2013 Holden On</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>the Cocteau Twins, My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive</p> <p>Halfway through this MBV-indebted slice of cloud-skipping shoegaze, a surprising one-liner comes out of nowhere and slaps the listener across the face. It\u2019s a relatively depressing scenario delivered in a dreamy deadpan and repeated ad nauseam for the rest of the song, as if to indelibly print the image on to the inside of your eyelids. I won\u2019t spoil the surprise aside from warning you to expect one, but the shock of it somehow lifts this dreamy dirge closer to heaven. Along with this majestic left turn, there is plenty else to love here: luscious layers of Julia Wylie\u2019s vocals, blasts of infinity guitars, earworm melodies, reverb on reverb on reverb.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>The second Julia Why? album Hysteria! is out now</p> <h2>Holy Holy \u2013 Maybe You Know</h2> <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> Echo and the Bunnymen, Tears for Fears, late-era Death Cab for Cutie</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/08/cub-sport-ft-mallrat-the-rubens-dyson-stringer-cloher-best-australian-music-for-august\">Cub Sport ft Mallrat, the Rubens, Dyson Stringer Cloher:\u00a0best Australian music for August</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is perhaps the slowest-burning Holy Holy single to date, which might not bode well for a generation of streamers who demand immediacy, but it will be richly rewarding for those willing to indulge the band with more than a single listen. There is the hypnotic sway of the falsetto vocals, subtle synths and guitars that bleed together into an unholy wave of noise. There are subtle drum pattern shifts that masterfully change the momentum of the song, an urgent vocal crack on the line \u201cand it felt like nothing\u201d, a satisfying sonic build that creeps up like a killer \u2013 and the final pull of the rug just as you feel the track is about to engulf you. What a delight.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Holy Holy\u2019s third album My Own Pool of Light is out now; the band tour nationally in September and October</p> <h2>Sui Zhen \u2013 Matsudo City Life</h2> <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> M83, Spacemen 3, Animal Collective</p> <p>Matsudo is known as a \u201cbedroom community\u201d, a Japanese city filled with hotels frequented by businessmen who use them only to sleep in between work shifts. It\u2019s a stark and unsettling image: a city of sleep pods. Sui Zhen, who recorded her forthcoming album in one of these Matsudo hotels, manages to perfectly escapulate the ghostly, desolate mood of the city streets while also acknowledging the lonely romance of wandering through an empty metropolis designed for slumber. This song channels and draws together sonic touchstones as diverse as Annie Lennox, Animal Collective and Spacemen 3 to arrive at a glassy, claustrophobic dystopia where men \u201conly come home to dream\u201d.</p> <p><strong>For more:</strong> Sui Zhen\u2019s album Losing, Linda is out on 27 September</p>",

Stay tuned Julia Why? \u2013 Holden On For fans of: the Cocteau Twins, My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive Halfway through this MBV-indebted slice of cloud-skipping shoegaze, a surprising one-liner comes out of nowhere and slaps the listener across the face. It\u2019s a relatively depressing scenario delivered in a dreamy deadpan and repeated ad nauseam for the rest of the song, as if to indelibly print the image on to the inside of your eyelids. I won\u2019t spoil the surprise aside from warning you to expect one, but the shock of it somehow lifts this dreamy dirge closer to heaven. Along with this majestic left turn, there is plenty else to love here: luscious layers of Julia Wylie\u2019s vocals, blasts of infinity guitars, earworm melodies, reverb on reverb on reverb. For more: The second Julia Why? album Hysteria! is out now Holy Holy \u2013 Maybe You Know For fans of: Echo and the Bunnymen, Tears for Fears, late-era Death Cab for Cutie This is perhaps the slowest-burning Holy Holy single to date, which might not bode well for a generation of streamers who demand immediacy, but it will be richly rewarding for those willing to indulge the band with more than a single listen. There is the hypnotic sway of the falsetto vocals, subtle synths and guitars that bleed together into an unholy wave of noise. There are subtle drum pattern shifts that masterfully change the momentum of the song, an urgent vocal crack on the line \u201cand it felt like nothing\u201d, a satisfying sonic build that creeps up like a killer \u2013 and the final pull of the rug just as you feel the track is about to engulf you. What a delight. For more: Holy Holy\u2019s third album My Own Pool of Light is out now; the band tour nationally in September and October Sui Zhen \u2013 Matsudo City Life For fans of: M83, Spacemen 3, Animal Collective Matsudo is known as a \u201cbedroom community\u201d, a Japanese city filled with hotels frequented by businessmen who use them only to sleep in between work shifts. It\u2019s a stark and unsettling image: a city of sleep pods. Sui Zhen, who recorded her forthcoming album in one of these Matsudo hotels, manages to perfectly escapulate the ghostly, desolate mood of the city streets while also acknowledging the lonely romance of wandering through an empty metropolis designed for slumber. This song channels and draws together sonic touchstones as diverse as Annie Lennox, Animal Collective and Spacemen 3 to arrive at a glassy, claustrophobic dystopia where men \u201conly come home to dream\u201d. For more: Sui Zhen\u2019s album Losing, Linda is out on 27 September",

      "bodyText": "Thanks all! Competition stepped up this week, and we have a clearer sense of who everyone is, so things are going to start getting tense. Will miss Jamie, one of the worst and most lovable contestants in recent memory. The kind of lad who once confused kitchen and bathroom scales, and now gives his weight in fluid ounces. Probs caught the wrong plane for his Love Island audition anyway. Bless. Thanks for the insights and laughs and bowel analysis, everyone. See you all for Bread Week? Come say hello on twitter or Insta or if you want to make me do a little dance, buy my book! Lol at Alice\u2019s mum on speakerphone freaking out that she has cress between her teeth \u201con camera\u201d. Alice did deserve the crown this week, and I\u2019m pleased for her. But Jamie canters off into the sunset. What an adorable lad. Happy that Helena has saved herself. Wait, so will they one week send two bakers home? For when it\u2019s too obvious who\u2019s the worst? EEEk Alice or David? David or Alice? OMG, Sandi DOES look like Tom Cruise. SO. The big question. Will Jamie be getting a pre-paid cab home, or does he have to schlep it by train? \u201cQuite simple, thick and clumsy.\u201d Prue on Jamie (\u2018s guitar) I actually think it is mistakeably a guitar Hmm. Who do we think for star baker? Amelia\u2019s golem dolphin disgusts the judges, but Rosie is described as \u201ca very very clever vet.\u201d Sam Neill in Jurassic Park could have delivered that Prue line. David\u2019s fennel and no fun tuiles go down well, Michael had nothing to worry (hurrah!), Prue is disappointed by the length of Henry\u2019s organ, but also complains it\u2019s too thick. Some people are never happy. @lovejonsnow I imagine Jamie applied for this by swiping up too slowly on a mate\u2019s Instagram story and accessing promoted content by mistake Jamie\u2019s biscuit has the complexity of a beginner Scalextric track, without cars Michael, now 90% blue plaster by volume, has lost faith. For...some reason. Priya gives him a hug. Bless him. And her. Why is Michael crying? Things are mobving to quickly Jamie literally just produced a totally bare cake tin, having scraped all his biscuit onto the floor of the oven, and was only slightly disappointed. If he had spontaneously combusted, the last thing we\u2019d hear would be him laughing Sandi hammering away on those organ jokes Oh Alice went to art school in New Zealand. I didn\u2019t know they had art school in New Zealand. Rosie is making a vintage Ralph Lauren leather football? Why does Alice keep going on about New Zealand. Have I missed something I find it quite beguiling WHO DOES ROSIE\u2019S VOICE REMIND ME OF Amelia is making some sort of IKEA flat pack furniture situation Paul asks Henry how big his organ is going to be. Sandi escorts Paul off the premises. It\u2019s 2019, best to nip these things in the bud. Michelle is making a dragon scoring a winning try over England on St David\u2019s Day or something Michael is adding 5 teaspoons of chilli to his gingerbread cow. Probably enough to kill a cow. I know we need to talk about David\u2019s pout, but I\u2019m not entirely sure what to say. Helena is making a biscuit Nosferatu sucking a ghost through a trapdoor or something Noel\u2019s foundation is blinding us to the fact Sandi is dressed like a Care Bear this week. I like it. Big arse biscuit, innit I will miss Jamie though. He\u2019s like a beautiful horse. @jdsworld imagine what Jamie showstopper Jamie would have to pull off to stay in. A 4 dimensional representation of Hawking Time made of Iced Gems I guess the question is whether producers will throw Helena under the bus to save the beautiful zygote Phil\u2019s phig rolls are phlat. Priya\u2019s figgy pillows are too spicy for Paul. Jamie\u2026has made a sausage roll. Helena and Jamie come in last, while David and Alice take the top spots. \u201cDo you like your fig rolls, Phil?\u201d \u201cNah.\u201d Phil may be my favourite. I definitely did eleven. I am a moroon.\u201d She\u2019s not Helena Bonham-Counter, we know that That closeup of someone shaking a floppy roll of fig loose from plastic wrap reminds me I need to walk the dog. She looks like a character from Matilda this week Is Helena\u2019s surname Bonham-Carter by any chance Paul clearly laughing at the flimsiness of Prue\u2019s \u201croll on fig rolls\u201d patter. Take a fig and roll it up, on jammy hands the wasps will sup Yes, Noel\u2019s foundation is making him look a bit like Jigsaw from the Saw movies Michelle wows Paul with her unique bake. David chunters on about open wounds, which puts Prue off her Penguin bar. Paul doesn\u2019t like the shortness of Steph\u2019s shortbread. Obviously a terrible idea to use semolina, who would think of such a thing. I\u2019ve eaten ruby chocolate AND I know what matcha is. Wondering why I\u2019m sat on this side of the screen to be honest. Rosie\u2019s feathering is as even as a sieismic graph of the moon, of course I ALWAYS laugh when someone says \u201cthank you\u201d chirpily following a withering comment from Paul. Good approach to life too. RUUUUUSTICCCC!! The cry of the Spartans struck fear into their enemies Thank you for drawing the matter of Noel\u2019s too matte foundation to my attention @emilyscatnaps. I shall be holding a Farrow n Ball swatch up to the screen @lulamay yes I\u2019ve warmed to Henry too. That VT vignette of him in Oxford(?) was just him swinging his legs around like an untethered weathersock Jamie\u2019s unset slabs of caramel(?) look like someone stepped in hot chewing gum in a wellington boot. He\u2019s delighted, naturally. ALICE\u2019S PERPETUALLY HORRIFIED EYES. Like someone just told her there hasn\u2019t been a caretaker here for 200 years I know here type. The \u201cOh I didn\u2019t revise I\u2019m really worri- oh look I got an A\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s as nicely as I can feather\u201d says Rosie, as she feathers a slab to actual perfection. Priya\u2019s ruby barfi ironically sounds absolutely delish. She\u2019s a very strong contender, isn\u2019t she. Her and Michelle the top dogs? David too? Who don\u2019t like\u2026fudge??\u201d Still laughing at Phil asking this. As if half way through the statement he actually started picturing some faceless anti-fudge person, then got angry with them. WOOOAH WHAT WAS THAT HELLSPAWN ON THE BIKE \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have toasted nuts\u201d David. He should be running in joggers then, not shorts. Hang on did Jamie say his shortbread has never worked in practice but it\u2019s fine because the chocolate will hold it together? Never mind surviving elimination, I\u2019m not convinced he\u2019ll make it to the end of the episode Because respect if so Did that VT say Helena used to be some sort of professional card sharp? Is this The Sting? Is she here on some monumentally long con, that ends with her identity frauding Noel? Imagine jamming with Jamie and Alex. They\u2019re the boys your parents worry about you hanging out with this close to your exams. This is my life\u201d Rosie, discussing a worm in a horse\u2019s tear duct. Can\u2019t wait for that showstopper. Hilarious editing of Michael\u2019s family playing music together. Sounded like the dying fall of the Titanic\u2019s string quartet. What the hell am I talking about I love semolina in biscuit dough, a la Steph\u2019s effort. (You might think this not worth mentioning, but the textural trumps the textual.) Henry just self-described as \u201ca pre-pubescent American schoolboy.\u201d Putting me out of a job, #whyIoughtta Paul doesn\u2019t want \u201cmostly chocolate with a little biscuit\u201d but that is EXACTLY what I want. The M&amp;S ones of the same name are basically my religion. Accidentally wrote \u201cchocolate bras\u201d and now genuinely think I\u2019m onto something. Isn\u2019t this how penicillin was discovered? I\u2019m not implying he\u2019s a donkey. (Although how would I know, even with an HD screen.) Am I the only one who cannot WAIT to meet Phil\u2019s wife? He makes her sound like the dragon from Shrek. Biscuit Week is the nightmare, for everyone.\u201d I WISH that were true Michael Mmm, this is more comforting. Introduction features a Beano-esque prank involving a glued-together sponge finger jenga. Now datsa MILDA meatball. Hi all! Did anyone else accidentally turn on too early and catch the news, only to be reminded we\u2019re living in immediately pre-Mad Max times? Brilliant stuff. Let\u2019s forget that, and do this I mean talks with their mouth full obviously. Damn right this blog is in safe hands Ooh, let\u2019s do a bingo! Drink a drink, if and when: Anyone talking with their mouth full Paul breaks something delicate and smiles, also delicately Prue describes a Palace of Versailles sculpted from cream horns and tuile as \u2018rustic\u2019 Helena and Noel goth off in a marzipan graveyard Jamie makes a cup of tea milk first, then forgets the teabag Bienvenue souffl\u00e9 sisters, frangipane fr\u00e8res, and non-binary bakeaholics. Welcome to the live blog for the most talked-about show that isn\u2019t The Repair Shop. Tonight sees the second episode of The Great British Bake Off\u2019s 10th anniversary series, and no clear frontrunner has emerged.

      "bodyText": "The mining giant BHP is facing increasing pressure from investors to suspend its membership of industry groups, including Australia\u2019s Minerals Council and Business Council, accused of lobbying efforts that are at odds with the goals of the Paris climate agreement. A shareholder resolution filed with BHP calling for the suspension is backed by Grok Ventures, the private investment company of software billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and his wife, Annie, and superannuation and pension funds from Australia, Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands. In a major speech in July, BHP\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Mackenzie, declared that global warming was indisputable, said drastic action was needed and committed the company to ramping up efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But the company has been criticised for continuing to fund groups including the Minerals Council and affiliated body Coal21, which is planning a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign that aims to \u201cinvoke national pride\u201d in coal. The shareholder resolution was filed by activist group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility. In a statement in support of the resolution, Cannon-Brookes said: \u201cUntil BHP stops funding for coal lobbyists, we\u2019re extremely sceptical of their environmental or green credentials.\u201d The centre for corporate responsibility said BHP-funded groups had been undeniably successful in promoting fossil fuels and obstructing climate policy in Australia. It lists nine groups including the Minerals Council, which it says called for new coal-fired plants and the development of a new coal basin, and the Business Council, which wanted \u201cgreen schemes\u201d to be scrapped, new investment in existing coal-fired plants and said a 45% emissions cut by 2030, as proposed by Labor following scientific advice, would be \u201ceconomy wrecking\u201d and likely to lead to deindustrialisation. The centre\u2019s executive director, Brynn O\u2019Brien, said BHP was probably the most influential company in Australia and how it chose to spend shareholders\u2019 money on policy advocacy had \u201creal world impacts\u201d. \u201c[We have] met with BHP on multiple occasions and we have given them a long list of examples of adverse climate lobbying by their industry associations,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cThe company does acknowledge that there is a serious issue but has been unable or unwilling to resolve it.\u201d BHP declined to comment ahead of its 5pm Thursday deadline to notify the Australian stock exchange of the resolution. Co-filers of the resolution are Australia\u2019s Vision Super, the Netherlands\u2019 ACTIAM, Denmark\u2019s MP Pension and the Church of England Pensions Board. It is the latest step in an ongoing campaign targeting BHP over its industry group memberships. In November 2017, a centre for corporate responsibility resolution requesting that BHP review its direct and indirect involvement in climate policy advocacy won 9% support from shareholders. The miner subsequently reviewed its association memberships, left the World Coal Association and played a part in forcing a change of management at the minerals council. In his July speech, Mackenzie said BHP would spend US$400m on developing technologies to reduce emissions from its own operations and the \u201cscope 3\u201d emissions from the companies that buy its resources, have net-zero emissions by 2050 and strengthen the link between emissions performance and executive pay from 2021. The Guardian subsequently reported BHP was again reviewing its membership of the Minerals Council following disagreements over climate policy and has been accused of hypocrisy. Some of the tension has been over Coal21, an organisation created to research low-emissions technology that is was revealed last month was planning a cross-media advertising campaign to enhance \u201cthe public standing and reputation of Australia\u2019s coal industry\u201d. O\u2019Brien said she expected the resolution would be heard at BHP\u2019s annual general meetings in London on 17 October and Sydney on 7 November.",

It has been unclear if the election would go ahead, but the letter warned against the suggestion that the polling should be delayed if a deal with the US paves the way for inter-Afghan talks.</p> <p>\u201cAfghans deserve to determine their government and who will represent them in peace negotiations. For this to happen, there is a strong argument that presidential elections planned for September should go forward,\u201d the ambassadors wrote.</p> <p>Between them, the signatories have 12 years of experience at the US embassy in Kabul over the past two decades. They also include John Negroponte, the former deputy secretary of state and the first ever US director of national intelligence.</p> <p>Only four ambassadors from the period since the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent US-backed removal of the Taliban government are missing from the list of signatories. One of them is the incumbent, and the other is the lead US envoy to peace talks, Zalmay Khalilzad.</p> <p>After a year of negotiations, Khalilzad has reached a draft deal with the Taliban for a US troop withdrawal.

      "bodyText": "The majority of America\u2019s ambassadors to Afghanistan since the removal of the Taliban government have condemned the US approach to negotiating a troop withdrawal, warning it risked a return to \u201ctotal civil war\u201d. Writing the day after a draft agreement was announced, the nine men, including a former deputy secretary of state, said they supported peace talks in Afghanistan. But they warned the current approach risks spawning more violence and insecurity, because negotiators have cut the Afghan government out of discussions and have planned the departure of US troops before sealing a full peace agreement. \u201cWe believe that US security and values, including support for women, require that a full troop withdrawal come only after a real peace,\u201d said the open letter, published by the Atlantic Council. \u201cWe must not yank so much support from our Afghan friends that they are unable to protect themselves or the chance to keep moving forward with a representative democracy.\u201d Adding to the political turmoil in Afghanistan, a presidential election is set for 28 September. It has been unclear if the election would go ahead, but the letter warned against the suggestion that the polling should be delayed if a deal with the US paves the way for inter-Afghan talks. \u201cAfghans deserve to determine their government and who will represent them in peace negotiations. For this to happen, there is a strong argument that presidential elections planned for September should go forward,\u201d the ambassadors wrote. Between them, the signatories have 12 years of experience at the US embassy in Kabul over the past two decades. They also include John Negroponte, the former deputy secretary of state and the first ever US director of national intelligence. Only four ambassadors from the period since the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent US-backed removal of the Taliban government are missing from the list of signatories. One of them is the incumbent, and the other is the lead US envoy to peace talks, Zalmay Khalilzad. After a year of negotiations, Khalilzad has reached a draft deal with the Taliban for a US troop withdrawal. But Afghan officials were excluded from the talks, and the draft deal was only shown to President Ashraf Ghani this week. That decision, driven by the Taliban\u2019s refusal to speak to officials they denounce as \u201cpuppets\u201d, was unwise and damaging to the Afghan government, the ambassadors said. \u201cWhether or not the United States wants or is willing to keep some forces engaged, we should not undercut the legitimate government in Afghanistan by keeping them out of negotiations.\u201d The draft withdrawal deal also does not define how Afghanistan should be governed once American troops have gone. Critics say that could set the stage for an intensified civil war. Although US support has been critical to Afghan security forces, they are still several hundred thousand strong and backed up by militia which have been fighting the Taliban since before US troops first arrived. Most are likely to have a strong incentive to keep on fighting. \u201cThere is an outcome far worse than the status quo, namely a return to the total civil war that consumed Afghanistan as badly as the war with the Russians, and something that could follow a breakdown in negotiations if we remove too much support from the Afghan state,\u201d the letter said. \u201cIf the state totters, those with nasty memories of life under the Taliban will fight on.\u201d The deal would allow for an initial drawdown of nearly 5,000 US troops.

Katrina Lawrie, 41, received an additional two months suspended for two years.</p> <p>Friends of the Earth said the sentences were \u201cdisproportionate and harsh\u201d. Last year three protesters jailed for their part in a much longer fracking protest ended up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/17/court-quashes-excessive-sentences-of-fracking-protesters\">having their sentences reduced to conditional discharges</a> on appeal \u2013 much lighter sentences \u2013 after judges ruled their jailing \u201cmanifestly excessive\u201d.</p> <p>The latest three campaigners were found guilty three months ago of breaching the injunction during protests outside the site in Lancashire. On 24 July 2018, they and others had blocked the entrance for around three hours, Judge Mark Pelling told Manchester high court on Tuesday.</p> <p>Lawrie was given a longer suspended sentence because she had also stood in front of a delivery lorry on two other occasions, which the judge said caused \u201ca serious risk of death or injury\u201d to the driver. Lawrie had not apologised or given reassurances that it would not happen again, he noted.</p> <p>The judge, who granted Cuadrilla the injunction in the first place, refused permission to appeal against the decision as he saw \u201cno reasonable grounds or compelling reason to do so\u201d. He also awarded Cuadrilla\u2019s costs against the protesters.</p> <p>Adam Wagner, who represented Lawrie and Walsh, told the court the case \u201cconcerns fundamentally important issues of law relating to the rights of free expression and assembly as protected by the Human Rights Act. At issue is an order which severely curtails the right to protest against fracking at Cuadrilla\u2019s Preston New Road fracking site.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt is not my clients who are the real danger here. It is Cuadrilla.\u201d</p> <p>Afterwards, Wilson vowed to continue to protest against fracking.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an absolute obscenity that a corporation can put private profit over the health and wellbeing of people \u2013 my kids and everybody else\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir \u2018might is right\u2019 approach has been used to override our human rights and criminalise our protest. We\u2019ve seen enough evidence that their activity \u2013 which Lancashire did not want \u2013 endangers everyone living there. The fight goes on.\u201d</p> <p>Katie de Kauwe, a lawyer with Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cWe are disappointed with the severity of the sentences that have been handed down. We think they are disproportionate and hard and don\u2019t accord with the tradition in English law of treating peaceful protesters motivated by good faith and beliefs with some leniency in sentencing.\u201d</p> <p>The next step for the campaigners will be to seek permission from the court of appeal to challenge the terms of the injunction.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Three anti-fracking activists have been given suspended prison sentences after breaking a ban on demonstrations which their lawyers argued \u201cseverely curtails the right to protest\u201d. The trio were convicted after ignoring an injunction brought by the energy company Cuadrilla to protect its Preston New Road site near Blackpool, Lancashire. A week earlier Cuadrilla had to halt fracking at the shale gas site after triggering what is believed to be the biggest fracking-related tremor seen in Britain. Christopher Wilson, 55, and Lee Walsh, 44, were both given four-week sentences suspended for two years after being found in contempt of court for breaching the injunction. Katrina Lawrie, 41, received an additional two months suspended for two years. Friends of the Earth said the sentences were \u201cdisproportionate and harsh\u201d. Last year three protesters jailed for their part in a much longer fracking protest ended up having their sentences reduced to conditional discharges on appeal \u2013 much lighter sentences \u2013 after judges ruled their jailing \u201cmanifestly excessive\u201d. The latest three campaigners were found guilty three months ago of breaching the injunction during protests outside the site in Lancashire. On 24 July 2018, they and others had blocked the entrance for around three hours, Judge Mark Pelling told Manchester high court on Tuesday. Lawrie was given a longer suspended sentence because she had also stood in front of a delivery lorry on two other occasions, which the judge said caused \u201ca serious risk of death or injury\u201d to the driver. Lawrie had not apologised or given reassurances that it would not happen again, he noted. The judge, who granted Cuadrilla the injunction in the first place, refused permission to appeal against the decision as he saw \u201cno reasonable grounds or compelling reason to do so\u201d. He also awarded Cuadrilla\u2019s costs against the protesters. Adam Wagner, who represented Lawrie and Walsh, told the court the case \u201cconcerns fundamentally important issues of law relating to the rights of free expression and assembly as protected by the Human Rights Act. At issue is an order which severely curtails the right to protest against fracking at Cuadrilla\u2019s Preston New Road fracking site.\u201d He added: \u201cIt is not my clients who are the real danger here. It is Cuadrilla.\u201d Afterwards, Wilson vowed to continue to protest against fracking. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute obscenity that a corporation can put private profit over the health and wellbeing of people \u2013 my kids and everybody else\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir \u2018might is right\u2019 approach has been used to override our human rights and criminalise our protest. We\u2019ve seen enough evidence that their activity \u2013 which Lancashire did not want \u2013 endangers everyone living there. The fight goes on.\u201d Katie de Kauwe, a lawyer with Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cWe are disappointed with the severity of the sentences that have been handed down. We think they are disproportionate and hard and don\u2019t accord with the tradition in English law of treating peaceful protesters motivated by good faith and beliefs with some leniency in sentencing.\u201d The next step for the campaigners will be to seek permission from the court of appeal to challenge the terms of the injunction.",

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap things up \u2013 here\u2019s Suzanne Wrack\u2019s report from Bergen. Thanks for joining me, and for all your emails. Goodnight! \u201cEngland will not win a major tournament \u2013 EVER \u2013 with Millie Bright playing center back,\u201d writes Chad Noyes. \u201cShe is a huge liability defensively and her passing out of the back is frequently calamitous. Surely Neville sees this.\u201d Strong words, Chad. Admittedly, she didn\u2019t have her best game today, and was culpable for the Norway winner. It\u2019s not all doom and gloom department: here\u2019s Suzanne Wrack on how England\u2019s World Cup has transformed the women\u2019s game back home. Casey Stoney on co-comms was pretty damning about that England performance. There are issues that need addressing \u2013 England looked sluggish going forward, and disorganised defensively. That said, the WSL season is yet to kick off, and the visitors did create a couple of good chances in that second half. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need to panic, but a win over Brazil next month would help allay a few nagging concerns. Moments before England went behind, the FA announced another friendly this Autumn. Brazil are bringing the samba to Middlesbrough, in October. https://twitter.com/Lionesses/status/1168942985154846720 Lord Beaverbrook! Clement Attlee! Henry Cooper! Can you hear me, Henry Cooper? Beth England can\u2019t quite connect with the corner, and that\u2019s that. Norway win, and deservedly so on balance. England wilted in that second half. 94 mins: No. One more corner ... 93 mins: Bronze, who has grown into her midfield role, gets forward again but fires a scruffy shot wide of the near post. Is time up? 92 mins: A decent opening for England, led by Bronze from midfield, who takes a fraction too long to play Mead in down the right. Norway regroup, and the move runs out of steam. Four added minutes for England to snatch an equaliser. Phil Neville is cutting a forlorn figure on the bench. Bright\u2019s pass was cut out by Hansen, who zipped effortlessly upfield and into the area. Houghton tries to stop her with a despairing lunge, which would surely have resulted in a penalty had she connected. Instead, Hansen pulled clear, took a touch and fired high into the net beyond Roebuck. The game\u2019s best player has surely won the match for Norway! 87 mins: An England attacking move breaks down as Beth England loses her bearings. It hasn\u2019t clicked for England up front today ... 85 mins: Ingrid Hjelmeseth is coming off to a standing ovation. The veteran goalkeeper is replaced by Cecilie Fiskerstrand, marking the end of a long and illustrious international career. She looks emotional as she gets a group hug from teammates, and is presented with a shirt marking her 138 caps. 84 mins: Parris is still making her way around the perimeter. Not sure if he\u2019s injured, or just observing the new rule, where players should go off the pitch at the nearest point. Fair play to her if so, because nobody else is. 83 mins: Mead cuts inside from the right and takes aim, but her shot is one to file under \u201coptimistic\u201d. 82 mins: Beth Mead replaces Nikita Parris, who has been one of England\u2019s better performers today. 81 mins: England looking marginally more likely, although Graham Hansen remains a threat, carrying the ball silkily through midfield before Bronze makes a timely interception. 80 mins: Ten minutes for either team to win this, if they fancy. 78 mins: From the corner, Bronze pounces as the ball bobbles across goal \u2013 but can only fire over from 10 yards out. Beth England on for Taylor, who wasn\u2019t quite sharp enough up front. Williamson is on for Daly, who did a decent job at right-back, but was caught out for the equaliser. There\u2019s a change in goal, too, with 19-year-old Ellie Roebuck replacing Telford. 75 mins: The ball still hasn\u2019t gone out of play \u2013 first Parris kept it in, then teed up a Norway counter with a poor ball back towards midfield \u2013 and then England rallied upfield again. They win a corner, and here come those changes ... 74 mins: England try to slow the pace a little, with a couple of substitutes about to come on \u2013 Beth England and Leah Williamson. 73 mins: Hansen swaggers into the England area again and wins a corner. You can\u2019t help but wonder how good Norway would be if Ada Hegerberg was playing alongside her up front. England clear this time. 72 mins: Norway win a free kick midway inside the England half and Reiten launches it towards the far post, where the hosts are waiting in numbers. Houghton does very well to nod the ball away from Lisa-Marie Utland, who has just come on for Eikeland. 70 mins: Graham Hansen has become the game\u2019s dominant attacking force, firing another shot low at Telford, then resurfacing on the right flank to test Demi Stokes with a jinking run into the box. 68 mins: England almost retake the lead from nowhere! Toni Duggan, back on the left flank, plays a brilliant cross from deep, into the fabled corridor of uncertainty, and Taylor meets it, sending her header just wide! That was a great chance. 67 mins: Hansen again has the England defence on the back foot, but her cross is hacked away by Keira Walsh. 65 mins: A long ball almost lets Hansen in, but Telford comes flying a full 20 yards off her line to clear. 64 mins: Stanway is urging her teammates to push forward, with her and Taylor isolated up front. England are missing some key attacking players \u2013 Fran Kirby, Ellen White \u2013 but they\u2019ve looked short of ideas. England, as you may have heard, are hosting the next Euros in 2021 \u2013 so there\u2019s no qualifying for them. The downside is that each friendly takes on extra significance. The Lionesses\u2019 only other slated fixture (at time of writing) is against Germany at Wembley in November. 62 mins: Daly pushes forward on the right and swings in a cross that Moe Wold has to head behind. Duggan aims her corner at the near post, where Bright is steaming in, but a Norway boot hoofs the ball clear just in time. 60 mins: Taylor almost pounces on a loose pass in the Norway area, but with her back to goal she can\u2019t find a white shirt in space. 58 mins: Hansen is given too much space on the edge of the box, and cracks a shot that\u2019s straight at Telford. England started this game so well, but they look second best just now. 55 mins: Ooooh, England nearly retake the lead immediately, as a quick break allows Bronze to get into the box \u2013 but her header from Parris\u2019 cross flashes just wide! Goalscorer Maanum goes off, replaced by another emerging talent in Wolfsburg\u2019s Ingrid Engen. 54 mins: That\u2019s a deeply frustrating goal for England to concede, with a familiar weakness at set-pieces resurfacing. Maanum missed a very similar chance in the first half, but England didn\u2019t learn from it. After bailing out her centre-backs once, this is the thanks Carly Telford gets. Maanum easily gets above Daly from the corner, and powers a close-range header home! Norway are level, and deservedly so. 52 mins: Hansen slaloms into the area and lays the ball off to Saevik. Her low ball catches the England defence too deep, with Eikeland unmarked near the penalty spot. Her shot looks destined for the bottom corner, but Telford gets down brilliantly to turn it behind ... 50 mins: Graham Hansen overcooks a long pass to Moe Wold, but Norway have started this half the better... 49 mins: It\u2019s been scrappy so far in the second half; perhaps some changes are needed. Jon Elvebakk, watching on in Bergen, has sent me a snap of the teams heading out for the second half. The modern world, eh? By the way, there can\u2019t be many finer views from a seat in a European football stadium. Give us a wave! No changes for either side. Stanway gets the first shot of the second half away, albeit a mistimed effort that flies a long way wide. Elsewhere in qualifying, Wales host Northern Ireland later on in Newport. Both teams are in Group C alongside Norway, who beat Northern Ireland 6-0 in their first game. Wales also hit six, against the Faroe Islands \u2013 and will be hoping to finish as one of the highest-ranked runners-up, earning a direct ticket to the finals in England. In response to a couple of emails I\u2019ve had about this and other games not appearing on our live scores service, I hear you and will pass it on. Also, an overdue mention for Scotland who began their Euro 2021 qualifying campaign with a thumping 8-0 win over debutantes Cyprus. Kim Little bagged five of the goals in a dominant display. That flukey-looking effort from Caroline Graham Hansen reminded me of this, in that I\u2019m not entirely sure she didn\u2019t meant it: England lead a lively, if occasionally scrappy game thanks to an absolute thunderbolt from Georgia Stanway 10 minutes in. More soon. 46 mins: Norway almost level in bizarre fashion! A lovely bit of skill from S\u00e6vik sets Graham Hansen away down the right, and she tries to lift a cross towards the far post \u2013 but it almost loops into the net, with Telford forced to tip it away from under the bar! 45 mins: Three added minutes. 44 mins: One last foray upfield for England, led by Jodie Taylor, who holds the ball up nicely. Stanway hits a deep cross that\u2019s far too close to Hjelmeseth in the Norway goal. 42 mins: Graham Hansen almost unpicks the England defence, but her pass is just too far behind strike partner Reiten. Hansen then goes into a 50-50 with Bronze, who lands heavily, but is OK to carry on. 39 mins: A tactical switch from England, with Duggan and Parris swapping wings. Duggan cuts in from the right flank, creating space for Daly at full-back, but she\u2019s closed down by Minde. 37 mins: Stanway almost undoes Norway again with a lovely piece of skill, shaping to shoot and then slipping a through ball towards Taylor \u2013 but again, she just can\u2019t pull the trigger in time, and Hjelmeseth denies her. 35 mins: Duggan takes it, but pings it back to Daly, whose low ball in pings around the area. It\u2019s a bit messy, but Norway don\u2019t deal with it and after an errant defensive pass, Jodie Taylor has the ball at her feet in front of goal \u2013 but she can\u2019t get a shot away. 34 mins: Nikita Parris, a lively presence on the right, wins a free kick, and England\u2019s centre-backs march upfield ... 32 mins: Reiten curls a left-footed effort from distance that Telford is happy to leave \u2013 but it whips dangerously close to her far post, missing it by inches! 29 mins: Norway, perhaps surprisingly, haven\u2019t really tried to test Daly at right back. Now Graham Hansen does take on the makeshift defender, who does well to hold her off and drill the ball back to Carly Telford. 27 mins: Bronze, looking composed pulling the strings in midfield, plays a one-two with Parris, whose cross ends up at the feet of Stanway. Her cross-shot flies wide, and Duggan almost gets a toe to turn the ball in! 26 mins: Norway get your joy down the right-hand side and S\u00e6vik\u2019s pull back falls to Risa \u2013 but she swings and misses, and England can break ... 24 mins: England try to play it out from the back \u2013 Neville channelling his inner Pep again \u2013 but Daly gets surrounded by red and blue shirts, and has to hurriedly clear. 22 mins: A long break, but Thorisdottir is able to carry on, and both coaches take the opportunity to fire a few tactical instructions at their players. 19 mins: Maria Thorisdottir goes down after being buffeted off the ball by Stanway. She needs a bit of treatment; it was a heavy challenge, one that could have earned a booking. 17 mins: Much better from the hosts since going behind, and S\u00e6vik picks out Guro Reiten, whose shot through a forest of legs flashes just wide of the near post. Here\u2019s the goal. Oof! 14 mins: Caroline Graham Hansen leads another slick Norway move, slotting a diagonal ball to S\u00e6vik \u2013 but the winger\u2019s shot, from a tight angle, is high and wide. 13 mins: The corner is met by Maanum at the near post \u2013 England second best at a set piece, a recurring theme \u2013 but her header flies over. 12 mins: England are good value for their lead, but need to be careful \u2013 Moe Wold gets in down the right again, and Bright has to cut out a dangerous cross ... Parris passes to Georgia Stanway, 25 yards out, who absolutely lashes a first-time shot that crashes in off the bar, right in the corner. Hjelmeseth was never stopping that. What a hit! 9 mins: Bronze collects a pass from Parris and has a strike from 20 yards that\u2019s charged down. She does like a long-range belter against Norway. Speaking of which ... 8 mins: S\u00e6vik gets the better of Stokes close to the byline, but her prodded low cross is cleared away. A half-chance for the hosts, there. 6 mins: Parris tries a cheeky, chipped cross inside the area, perhaps hoping to catch a Norwegian hand. She fails, but England come again and a tidy diagonal pass nearly sets Jodie Taylor in on goal \u2013 but Hjelmeseth is off her line to collect. The Norwegian keeper is winning her 138th and final cap today. 5 mins: Neville prowls the touchlines, urging his players to be as aggressive as his pre-match comments: \u201cI have a vision that nobody else has. I\u2019ve got bravery that no other coach has probably ever had. Do you know what? Thank your lucky stars. I\u2019m here to stay. And I\u2019m going to continue to keep improving\u201d. 4 mins: Keira Walsh whips a cross in that\u2019s too close to Hjelmseth, and Norway break with Houghton having to chase back to cover a through ball towards Reiten. Had the ball been better, England might have been in trouble. 2 mins: Norway clear but England win it back in midfield and build from the back. 1 min: Rachel Daly, filling in at right-back, gets forward straight away. Nikita Parris appeals for a handball, and England have an early free kick. The teams are out, anthems played, and we\u2019re ready to go. It looks a fine early evening in Bergen, and there\u2019s a bumper crowd in the Brann Stadion. More on Bronze starting in midfield \u2013 Phil Neville is trying Europe\u2019s best player in a new position, inspired by Pep Guardiola. \u201cWe have a two-year period now where playing Lucy in midfield might be one of the risks we take. Guardiola did it with Philip Lahm [at Bayern]. He was voted one of the best right-backs, but he put him into midfield.\u201d Lucy Bronze will be wearing the No 8 shirt today, so one assumes she is going to be in midfield. Neville is keen for her to play there as she is so good, meaning it will be interesting who she performs in her secondary position. Bergen is very nice. So here are some fine photos from Norway ... The impact of the World Cup on women\u2019s football ... Norway: Hjelmseth, Moe Wold, Mjelde, Thorisdottir, Minde, S\u00e6vik, Risa, Maanum, Eikeland, Reiten, Graham Hansen England: Telford, Daly, Stokes, Walsh, Houghton, Parris, Bronze, Taylor, Duggan, Bright, Stanway After a bit of a struggle away to Belgium in the previous match, Phil Neville will be hoping his England players can put on a more convincing display against the far tougher opposition of Norway. The success of the World Cup is starting to be forgotten and they need to focus on the next prize and showing what they can do against Norway will certainly be a fine starting point, even if Neville does do some tinkering. This is a crucial time for the women\u2019s team who need to make the most of the hype following the World Cup, as midfielder Jade Moore is already frustrated by the failings in the aftermath. Kick-off: 5pm BST, 6pm local, with Niall McVeigh.",

      "bodyText": "A group of the world\u2019s leading business organisations, including from the US, Japan and Australia, have warned the UK that a no-deal Brexit would damage its reputation with some of its biggest trading partners. In an open letter signed by some of the biggest lobby groups in the western world, representing more than 4m companies from eight countries, the organisations said they had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about the rising chance of a no-deal departure on 31 October. The organisations said such a scenario would \u201ccreate substantial disruption for businesses, workers, farmers and regulators\u201d in the UK and the countries they were representing. \u201cSuch disruptions are bound to affect jobs, consumer choices, and the cost of goods and services,\u201d the lobby groups wrote. Coming as political chaos in Westminster over Brexit escalates this week, with less than two months before the article 50 deadline, the letter was signed by the US Chamber of Commerce and leading industrial groups in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Brazil and Egypt. Supporters of no deal have consistently pushed for the UK to leave the EU in order to embrace new trading relationships elsewhere around the world \u2013 in a vision for a \u201cglobal Britain\u201d that would tap into fast-growing markets, including with firms represented by lobby groups in the letter. In a blow to their argument, the organisations warned the UK that abruptly reneging on its treaty obligations with the EU \u201csends concerning signals to others considering bilateral agreements in the future\u201d. Boris Johnson has attempted to show that the UK would be able to quickly agree new trade deals outside the EU after Brexit, including with the US. Donald Trump has said that Washington is moving rapidly towards signing a \u201cvery big trade deal, bigger than we\u2019ve ever had\u201d, once the UK is freed from the \u201canchor\u201d of the EU around its \u201cankle\u201d. MPs opposed to no deal have warned that the UK would probably struggle to strike new trade deals after leaving the EU any time soon, saying that talks typically take years to conclude and that some nations would seek to extract a heavy price to allow the UK greater access to their markets. Critics have warned that nations such as the US could demand more relaxed regulations for food standards. Malaysia\u2019s prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, has said that Britain would have a historic opportunity to strike a trade deal \u2013 provided restrictions on imports of palm oil imposed by the EU are relaxed. Economists have also warned that new trade deals would be unlikely to offset the impact of curtailing access to the EU, which is Britain\u2019s biggest single trading partner accounting for about half of all exports and imports. Sounding the alarm over the UK\u2019s future international status, the lobby groups warned that firms in their countries invested about \u00a348.1bn in the UK in 2017 \u2013 helping to support jobs and growth across the country. The organisations wrote: \u201cFirms would be forced to make decisions about supply chains and investments in the UK without knowing what the future terms of trade will be. They will also need to evaluate the legal, contractual and geographic changes needed to ensure their continued ability to serve customers in the UK and across Europe.\u201d The lobby groups urged Johnson to swiftly conclude a deal with Brussels that included a \u201cmeaningful transition period\u201d to an \u201cambitious agreement\u201d over the future trading relationships between the UK and the EU. \u201cWe deeply value our economic relationship with the UK given its favorable business climate, characterised by transparency, regulatory stability, respect for the rule of law, and a longstanding commitment to international collaboration,\u201d the groups said.",

      "body": "<p>\u2018I saw a man who had lost his way,\u201d says the narrator of Roy Andersson\u2019s droll, divine comedy. She is referring to the lanky, bemused fellow who has just ascended the stairs of the basement cafe. She could, by rights, be talking about anyone: About Endlessness arrives brimful with lost souls and lonely hearts, all framed in a series of static vignettes, all making vague efforts to connect with their neighbours. \u201cIt\u2019s September already,\u201d a woman remarks to her husband. \u201cHmph,\u201d he replies, gazing out at the city from a park bench on the hill.</p> <p>The Swedish director won Venice\u2019s 2014 Golden Lion award for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/02/a-pigeon-sat-on-a-branch-reflecting-on-existence-review-roy-andersson-venice-film-festival\">his beguiling A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence</a>. If About Endlessness risks feeling like that movie\u2019s B-side, it\u2019s still delicious, odd and utterly unlike anything else in competition; a film that makes the humdrum seem unique and the banal otherworldly. Andersson likes to frame his subjects in medium shot, posing them in drab offices, cafes or train stations, observing them for a few minutes before moving on. These people might be exhibits in some tatty museum of human curiosities. If so, it would be the sort of establishment where the labels on the cases have long since peeled off and the postcards in the gift shop have gone yellow at the edges.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Iud9lPZpN0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1Iud9lPZpN0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cI saw a man who was begging for his life,\u201d says the narrator, and again, this could be any one of them. The distracted old waiter pouring red wine on the table; the man lashing out at his wife in the market; the commuter sobbing on the bus because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know what he wants\u201d. About Endlessness contains moments of devilish wit, but at heart it is a sad, sweet picture, threaded with themes of estrangement and separation. Andersson isn\u2019t exactly asking us to laugh at or pity these people. Instead, we\u2019re being encouraged to wonder at their predicament \u2013 and perhaps relate it to our own.</p> <p>Somewhere in the city a priest is suffering a crisis of faith. He sits at the doctor\u2019s surgery, desolate and despairing, like Pagliacci the clown. \u201cMaybe be content with being alive,\u201d the doctor suggests. This seems to be good advice. There are dancers on the street and a child who needs walking through the rain to attend a classmate\u2019s birthday party \u2013 and these are the things the people need to focus on while they can. It\u2019s September already. It\u2019s later than they think.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018I saw a man who had lost his way,\u201d says the narrator of Roy Andersson\u2019s droll, divine comedy. She is referring to the lanky, bemused fellow who has just ascended the stairs of the basement cafe. She could, by rights, be talking about anyone: About Endlessness arrives brimful with lost souls and lonely hearts, all framed in a series of static vignettes, all making vague efforts to connect with their neighbours. \u201cIt\u2019s September already,\u201d a woman remarks to her husband. \u201cHmph,\u201d he replies, gazing out at the city from a park bench on the hill. The Swedish director won Venice\u2019s 2014 Golden Lion award for his beguiling A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence. If About Endlessness risks feeling like that movie\u2019s B-side, it\u2019s still delicious, odd and utterly unlike anything else in competition; a film that makes the humdrum seem unique and the banal otherworldly. Andersson likes to frame his subjects in medium shot, posing them in drab offices, cafes or train stations, observing them for a few minutes before moving on. These people might be exhibits in some tatty museum of human curiosities. If so, it would be the sort of establishment where the labels on the cases have long since peeled off and the postcards in the gift shop have gone yellow at the edges. \u201cI saw a man who was begging for his life,\u201d says the narrator, and again, this could be any one of them. The distracted old waiter pouring red wine on the table; the man lashing out at his wife in the market; the commuter sobbing on the bus because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know what he wants\u201d. About Endlessness contains moments of devilish wit, but at heart it is a sad, sweet picture, threaded with themes of estrangement and separation. Andersson isn\u2019t exactly asking us to laugh at or pity these people. Instead, we\u2019re being encouraged to wonder at their predicament \u2013 and perhaps relate it to our own. Somewhere in the city a priest is suffering a crisis of faith. He sits at the doctor\u2019s surgery, desolate and despairing, like Pagliacci the clown. \u201cMaybe be content with being alive,\u201d the doctor suggests. This seems to be good advice. There are dancers on the street and a child who needs walking through the rain to attend a classmate\u2019s birthday party \u2013 and these are the things the people need to focus on while they can. It\u2019s September already. It\u2019s later than they think.",

The total value of the companies that comprise the FTSE 100, often referred to as \u201cblue chip\u201d businesses, currently stands at about two trillion pounds;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/support_document/ftse_uk_index_series_history_and_heritage_screen.pdf\">about 80% of the value of all publicly listed companies in the UK</a>. The FTSE 100 was founded in 1984 as a joint venture between the Financial Times and LSE.</p>\n    <p><b>What are the benefits of being in the FTSE 100?</b><br>London is one of the world\u2019s major financial centres and there are significant benefits attached to the status of being included on the capital\u2019s main market. Benefits for blue chip companies include increased profile, particularly internationally.</p>\n    <p>It is still regarded by many as a proxy for the health of business in Britain although, in fact, the FTSE 250 index is more representative of domestic-focused companies, as a about 75% of FTSE 100 company earnings come from overseas.</p>\n    <p>Gaining a place in the FTSE 100 can improve demand for a company\u2019s shares as some investors are more comfortable investing in companies in the blue chip index. It can also help with raising capital.</p>\n    <p>Many funds are linked to the FTSE 100. These passive, low-cost investments, known as tracker or index funds, do not use highly-paid fund managers to pick stocks but invest instead in the constituents of the main stock market index, thus tracking its performance.</p>\n    <p><b>Why would a company be ejected from the FTSE 100?<br></b>A falling share price is the main reason for a company being demoted from the index, as this will reduce its value. Companies are also removed from the index when they have been taken over and no longer have a separate stock market listing.</p>\n    <p><b>I don\u2019t own any shares \u2013 why does the FTSE 100 matter to me?<br></b>The FTSE 100 affects most people even if they don\u2019t directly invest themselves, as pension funds are often linked to the main market and its performance directly affects returns.</p>\n    <p>What are the rules under which companies get promoted and demoted in each quarterly review?</p>\n    <p>There are a number of rules in place to ensure that there isn\u2019t a constant turnover of businesses exiting and entering the main index on a quarterly basis.</p>\n    <p>Any company outside the FTSE 100 which has a market capitalisation equal to 90th position or better in the main market is guaranteed promotion.</p>\n    <p>Conversely, any company which ranks it 111th position or lower is automatically demoted. Depending on how many companies automatically fit these criteria at the time of each quarterly review, the main market is \u201crebalanced\u201d to reflect the top 100 listed companies total.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Nick Bubb, a retail analyst, said M&amp;S had been in the relegation zone for some time. \u201cM&amp;S has been declining remorselessly for many years, as a result of weak and arrogant management, and stronger, more focused competition [such as Primark].

Relegation to the FTSE 250 comes as the company is closing 120 stores as part of an overhaul designed to shore up profits. M&amp;S\u2019s demotion reflects a share price at nearly a 20-year low as a long-running sales slump at the retailer\u2019s clothing arm is compounded by the high street crisis affecting rivals including Debenhams and House of Fraser. The FTSE 100, which was established in 1984, contains the UK\u2019s biggest listed companies by market value, with membership considered a mark of business prestige. The index is reshuffled four times a year according to share price movements, allowing a handful of companies to move up and down. Tony Shiret, an analyst at the stockbroker Whitman Howard, said: \u201cIt is significant [for M&amp;S] in the sense that it is a fairly objective measure of the diminished scale of the company.\u201d M&amp;S shares closed down 1.5% at 187p, valuing the company at \u00a33.6bn.

Indigenous Australians in the sample are also more likely to agree with the statement \u201cAustralia is a racist country\u201d (41%) than the sample as a whole (36%). There has been controversy post-election about the reliability of opinion polling because none of the major surveys \u2013 Newspoll, Ipsos, Galaxy or Essential \u2013 correctly predicted a Coalition victory on 18 May, projecting Labor in front on a two-party-preferred vote of 51-49 and 52-48. The lack of precision in the polling has prompted public reflection at Essential, as has been flagged by its executive director, Peter Lewis. Guardian Australia is not now publishing measurements of primary votes or a two-party-preferred calculation, but is continuing to publish survey results of responses to questions about the leaders and a range of policy issues. The poll\u2019s margin of error is plus or minus 3%.",

His observation has never been more pertinent following the indignation with which Wales\u2019 albeit brief rise to the summit of the World Rugby rankings was received.</p> <p>The outrage was unsurprisingly at its greatest in New Zealand \u2013 where All Blacks\u2019 coach Steve Hansen openly questioned the methodology employed \u2013 but the scepticism spread far beyond the dethroned former top rankers. Even Warren Gatland got drawn in, with the Wales coach understandably playing down his side\u2019s achievement and joking that they would \u201chand the ranking back\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/03/rugby-world-cup-preparations-hit-bump-with-concerns-over-readiness-of-pitch\">Rugby World Cup preparations hit bump with concerns over readiness of pitch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gatland\u2019s response was understandable. The last thing he would want to do was to antagonise the New Zealand media and public, given he is returning to his homeland next year to coach in Super Rugby, and still undoubtedly has one eye on his long-held ambition of coaching the All Blacks.</p> <p>Even so, and even though Wales did hand the ranking back <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/31/wales-ireland-rugby-world-cup-warm-up-match-report\">by losing to Ireland</a> while fielding an under-strength XV last weekend, Gatland is still entitled to a quiet sense of satisfaction, having led Wales on a 14-match winning streak that propelled the country from eighth to first on the global standings.</p> <p>The critics contest that Wales didn\u2019t beat New Zealand during that run \u2013&#xa0;but the two countries didn\u2019t cross paths, and you can\u2019t beat who you don\u2019t play. Wales did beat each of Ireland, South Africa and Australia. Significantly, each of those countries beat New Zealand during that same period. And that\u2019s the essence of the rankings. Consistency of performance is recognised, with the points allocation weighted by games played home and away, and against teams rated higher or below on the ratings, at the time the outcome was achieved.</p> <p>While Hansen was dismissive, in the afterglow of his team\u2019s 36-0 wipeout of Australia the previous evening, he failed to acknowledge that the Wallabies are only the sixth-ranked side in the world. It was largely because the sixth-ranked team had beaten the All Blacks by 21 points the previous weekend that New Zealand had slipped, so as to allow Wales to edge above them. If anything, Hansen more than most, should have appreciated the level of the current Wales side\u2019s achievement, on the back of their record winning streak.</p> <p>A former coach of Wales himself, Hansen once lost 10 straight. Not only was it the most consecutive defeats suffered by any Wales coach, it also left the country ranked eighth when he departed in 2004, the exact position Wales occupied prior to their recent winning run.</p> <p>Since they were introduced in 2003, the rankings have generally been a more accurate guide as to how teams are performing at any given time, than has the four-yearly World Cup sample. </p> <p>England won the tournament in 2003, when ranked No 1 in the world, but that status was hardly relevant by 2007, having lost 25 matches by an average of 17 points per-defeat in the intervening period. And even though England did make the final again in 2007, the post-tournament performances of losing finalists through the next four years is further evidence as to why the rankings provide a much more accurate indication.</p> <p>The last four beaten World Cup finalists have all performed terribly through the following four years, making a lie of their perceived \u201cstatus\u201d as the second-best team in the world.</p> <p>While the 42% win ratio of the Wallabies since 2015 is one of the worst, France plumbed even lower depths, winning just 40% of their games in the four years after making the 2011 final. England won just one more game than they lost between 2007 and 2011, while even the Australian side that made the 2003 final plummeted, winning just one more game than they lost in the 2005-07 period. Perhaps ominously for the Wallabies looking ahead to Japan, the last three beaten finalists have all been eliminated in the quarter-finals the next time around.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/aug/31/warren-gatland-wales-ireland-joe-schmidt-rugby-world-cup\">Ireland show no signs of ageing to dampen Gatland\u2019s home farewell | Michael Aylwin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of all the recent criticism, perhaps the most ironic came from World Rugby vice chairman Agustin Pichot, who dismissed the ranking formula as a marketing tool, insisting he would make changes in the advent of his rise to the global rugby chairmanship.</p> <p>Pichot was the architect of the Nations League proposal which, while defeated, had been championed as a means of providing more relevance to non-World Cup Test matches by attaching qualifying points, thereby generating additional interest.</p> <p>Since the All Blacks were briefly knocked off the summit, there has been unparalleled interest in the rankings. The fact that Wales could be first one week, and fourth the next, highlights the narrow margins between the top teams, which accurately reflects the widespread expectation of this being the closest World Cup ever.</p> <p>So, whether you agree with the methodology behind them or not, there can be no denying the rankings are generally accurate, and they have generated interest.

      "bodyText": "Two-time Rugby World Cup-victor John Eales once said that the winner of the World Cup is not necessarily the best team in the world, rather it is the best team at the tournament. His observation has never been more pertinent following the indignation with which Wales\u2019 albeit brief rise to the summit of the World Rugby rankings was received. The outrage was unsurprisingly at its greatest in New Zealand \u2013 where All Blacks\u2019 coach Steve Hansen openly questioned the methodology employed \u2013 but the scepticism spread far beyond the dethroned former top rankers. Even Warren Gatland got drawn in, with the Wales coach understandably playing down his side\u2019s achievement and joking that they would \u201chand the ranking back\u201d. Gatland\u2019s response was understandable. The last thing he would want to do was to antagonise the New Zealand media and public, given he is returning to his homeland next year to coach in Super Rugby, and still undoubtedly has one eye on his long-held ambition of coaching the All Blacks. Even so, and even though Wales did hand the ranking back by losing to Ireland while fielding an under-strength XV last weekend, Gatland is still entitled to a quiet sense of satisfaction, having led Wales on a 14-match winning streak that propelled the country from eighth to first on the global standings. The critics contest that Wales didn\u2019t beat New Zealand during that run \u2013 but the two countries didn\u2019t cross paths, and you can\u2019t beat who you don\u2019t play. Wales did beat each of Ireland, South Africa and Australia. Significantly, each of those countries beat New Zealand during that same period. And that\u2019s the essence of the rankings. Consistency of performance is recognised, with the points allocation weighted by games played home and away, and against teams rated higher or below on the ratings, at the time the outcome was achieved. While Hansen was dismissive, in the afterglow of his team\u2019s 36-0 wipeout of Australia the previous evening, he failed to acknowledge that the Wallabies are only the sixth-ranked side in the world. It was largely because the sixth-ranked team had beaten the All Blacks by 21 points the previous weekend that New Zealand had slipped, so as to allow Wales to edge above them. If anything, Hansen more than most, should have appreciated the level of the current Wales side\u2019s achievement, on the back of their record winning streak. A former coach of Wales himself, Hansen once lost 10 straight. Not only was it the most consecutive defeats suffered by any Wales coach, it also left the country ranked eighth when he departed in 2004, the exact position Wales occupied prior to their recent winning run. Since they were introduced in 2003, the rankings have generally been a more accurate guide as to how teams are performing at any given time, than has the four-yearly World Cup sample. England won the tournament in 2003, when ranked No 1 in the world, but that status was hardly relevant by 2007, having lost 25 matches by an average of 17 points per-defeat in the intervening period. And even though England did make the final again in 2007, the post-tournament performances of losing finalists through the next four years is further evidence as to why the rankings provide a much more accurate indication. The last four beaten World Cup finalists have all performed terribly through the following four years, making a lie of their perceived \u201cstatus\u201d as the second-best team in the world. While the 42% win ratio of the Wallabies since 2015 is one of the worst, France plumbed even lower depths, winning just 40% of their games in the four years after making the 2011 final. England won just one more game than they lost between 2007 and 2011, while even the Australian side that made the 2003 final plummeted, winning just one more game than they lost in the 2005-07 period. Perhaps ominously for the Wallabies looking ahead to Japan, the last three beaten finalists have all been eliminated in the quarter-finals the next time around. Of all the recent criticism, perhaps the most ironic came from World Rugby vice chairman Agustin Pichot, who dismissed the ranking formula as a marketing tool, insisting he would make changes in the advent of his rise to the global rugby chairmanship. Pichot was the architect of the Nations League proposal which, while defeated, had been championed as a means of providing more relevance to non-World Cup Test matches by attaching qualifying points, thereby generating additional interest. Since the All Blacks were briefly knocked off the summit, there has been unparalleled interest in the rankings. The fact that Wales could be first one week, and fourth the next, highlights the narrow margins between the top teams, which accurately reflects the widespread expectation of this being the closest World Cup ever. So, whether you agree with the methodology behind them or not, there can be no denying the rankings are generally accurate, and they have generated interest. And that is what they are ultimately for.",

      "bodyText": "The health minister, Greg Hunt, has hardened his opposition to changing Australia\u2019s e-cigarette laws amid warnings of a vaping epidemic that has led to at least one death in the United States. But despite the government\u2019s stance, the vaping industry, which includes big tobacco companies such as Philip Morris, is preparing to ramp up lobbying efforts to push Canberra for policy change. Following pressure from Coalition MPs late last year, Hunt ordered an independent inquiry into the use of nicotine e-cigarettes, the first report from which will be delivered to government by the end of the month. The public health assessment is being conducted by the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health at the Australian National University, with the study to look at electronic cigarette use in the Australian context. The first stages of the research is investigating the \u201chardened smoker\u201d hypothesis, which proposes that as smoking prevalence declines the remaining smokers will increasingly be \u201chard-core\u201d or \u201chardened\u201d, with higher nicotine dependence and less willingness to quit. The hypothesis also proposes this group of smokers will be unresponsive to the traditional suite of tobacco control policies and motivational appeals. A spokesman for Hunt said the minister was unmoved by those lobbying for Australia to change its approach to the regulation of vaping. \u201cThe government\u2019s position on e-cigarettes remains unchanged and the minister is firmly opposed to changing the current laws, particularly in light of recent statements by the US FDA about an epidemic of addiction among teen users.\u201d In Australia, the commercial sale of liquid nicotine used in vaping is banned, and can only be legally obtained with a doctor\u2019s prescription. A statement released by the US Food and Drug Administration and the Centre for Disease Control on Friday said that the agencies were investigating the link between e-cigarette use and severe respiratory disease, including a death in the state of Illinois. As of 27 August 2019, 215 possible cases have been reported from 25 states, and additional reports of pulmonary illness are under investigation. Despite unanimous opposition to vaping among the peak health groups, several Coalition MPs believe the government should support a regulated system, arguing it has benefits for hardcore smokers. Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman said the FDA\u2019s statement had not changed his views, saying he was still a supporter of a regulated system similar to that in the UK. According to the federal government\u2019s lobbyist register, several pro-vaping groups have engaged lobbying firms to help make their case to MPs, including tobacco giant Philip Morris. Philip Morris engaged Capetal Advisory, which has links to the Labor party, in April. Bradley Green, director of Capetal Advisory, told Guardian Australia that the agency had been engaged by Philip Morris \u201cto assist on issues to do with alternatives to smoking\u201d. \u201cThere are still millions of Australians who smoke and how that is best addressed in the long-term is an interesting policy question that should be dealt with properly.\u201d Former journalist Michael Gleeson, who runs Beltway Government Relations, is lobbying for the Australian Vaping Advocacy Trade and Research Organisation, which has been established by a small Australian vaping company. Prominent lobbying firm Barton Deakin was engaged in 2017 to promote a visit by Clive Bates, one of the most vocal campaigners for what some in the vaping industry call Tobacco Harm Reduction (THR).",

Asked what constituted nuisance behaviour by a cat, Ferguson said: \u201cCats defecating on people\u2019s lawns, cats spraying on people\u2019s front doors and cats fighting in the garden and also killing wildlife.\u201d Ferguson told Guardian Australia she was a \u201ccat lover\u201d and that the new rules were not aimed at vilifying the animal. \u201cThere are more people out there who love cats and tolerate cats,\u201d she said. \u201cCat haters exist but they are few and far between.\u201d Ferguson said while penalties for owners whose cats break the rules were yet to be determined, the council was considering conducting covert surveillance on cats suspected to be breaking curfew. \u201cWe\u2019re still working through the details of that,\u201d she said. Mount Barker is the latest Adelaide council to propose or introduce tough new cat regulations. In Adelaide Hills, it will be compulsory for cats to be confined to their owner\u2019s home from 2022.

Paul Stevenson, the head of the RSPCA in South Australia, said the organisation received 10,000 stray cats a year because there were no mandatory cat management guidelines for councils. The lack of state-wide regulation of cats had seen a \u201cpiece-meal\u201d approach to the animal, resulting in some \u201cless than ideal\u201d proposals. \u201cIn general we support councils introducing measures like curfews so our only concern with the Mount Barker measures is that the devil is in the detail,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "The Liverpool teenager Bobby Duncan appears to have bucked a growing trend by leaving to join Fiorentina in Italy. Whatever the rights and wrongs of a dispute with the European champions that led to the player\u2019s exit, Fiorentina are at least getting a promising young talent at the right age. Most of the recent Italian imports from the Premier League have been just the opposite, with Henrikh Mkhitaryan joining Alexis S\u00e1nchez in Serie A after failing to convince he was worth a regular place at Arsenal. Fair enough, Romelu Lukaku is only 26 and Chris Smalling could easily enjoy a career rejuvenation at Roma but there seems something almost poetic about Mkhitaryan and S\u00e1nchez, both 30, ending up in Italy when they so conspicuously failed to live up to expectations after the swap deal between Arsenal and Manchester United in January 2018. Had any money changed hands that particular bit of transfer business might now be regarded as one of the most ill-judged in Premier League history, though S\u00e1nchez\u2019s stratospheric wages at Old Trafford helped ensure a massive financial hit to the club did not go unnoticed. As recently as six months ago Ed Woodward was still trying to sweep the mistake under the carpet, arguing United could easily afford to keep paying S\u00e1nchez\u2019s reputed weekly wage of \u00a3400,000 until his contract expired, though the executive vice-chairman appeared to overlook the difficulty Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r would face in pretending it was normal to have the club\u2019s highest-paid player a non-functioning and visibly struggling presence on the first-team periphery. S\u00e1nchez has just said that with more game time at United he might have made an impact, though most supporters who have witnessed his misery over the past 18 months would surely agree with Solskj\u00e6r and the club hierarchy that after a certain number of chances it is best to accept something is not working and try to move on. The only mystery now that S\u00e1nchez has left England is what Internazionale could possibly have seen in the player\u2019s contribution at United to convince them he may be worth taking on.

He owed a drug dealer \u00a355 and did not have the funds to pay off the debt.</p> \n<p>He was told the cannabis debt would double \u2013 and keep doubling \u2013 if he failed to pay. But the teenager was offered a way out: he could work for the dealer and his associates.</p> \n<p>\u201cI had an idea it would probably be selling drugs,\u201d Boy X said. \u201cI agreed because I was scared of him, I didn\u2019t know what he was going to do to me.

Boy X and Griffin were in effect the shop front for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/03/gang-guilty-london-cornwall-county-lines-drug\">an enterprise called the \u201cBilly line\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>Boy X said Griffin\u2019s council flat was \u201cdirty, disgusting\u201d.

According to <a href=\"https://safercornwall.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2019/07/Bodmin-Town-Profile-2018.pdf\">Safer Cornwall</a>, an umbrella group made up of police, council, housing providers and other agencies, one in four people in Bodmin and the surrounding parishes live in the 20% most deprived neighbourhoods in England and 22% of children live in poverty \u2013 compared with 16% for the whole of Cornwall and 17% across England.</p> \n<p>Safer Cornwall says while the county is safe, crime is concentrated in its town centres and the level of recorded crime in Bodmin town centre is comparatively high.</p> \n<p>According to a survey, only 48% of Bodmin residents felt safe out in their local area during the night, and drug dealing is the issue most people worry about.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s terrible in the town at the moment,\u201d said a resident on Berryfields estate, one of the developments on the northern edge of the town <a href=\"http://www.cau.org.uk/media/3631494/Bodmin-Appraisal-Draft-Dec-2012.pdf\">built in the early </a><a href=\"http://www.cau.org.uk/media/3631494/Bodmin-Appraisal-Draft-Dec-2012.pdf\">70s as part of London\u2019s overspill scheme</a>, in which the capital\u2019s overcrowding problem was eased by sending families to remote parts of England.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6a3d0869-31b2-4f55-9050-b16658db33d2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What does the term \u2018county lines\u2019 mean?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The name \u2018county lines\u2019 refers to the phone numbers, or lines, that criminal gangs which traffic drugs from urban to rural areas use to organise the sale of their wares. Gangs in cities such as London, Birmingham and Liverpool use children to deal mostly heroin and crack cocaine over a network of dedicated mobile phones&nbsp;to smaller towns and rural areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who are the victims and how are they recruited?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The majority of victims groomed into working for gangs are 15- to 17-year-old boys but children as young as 11 have been safeguarded and girls have been targeted.<br></p>\n    <p>Many victims are recruited over social media, with offenders luring them with images of cash, designer clothing and luxury cars, but vulnerable girls and women are being targeted by men who create the impression of a romantic relationship before subjecting them to sexual exploitation.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How big is the problem?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In 2015, about seven forces reported county lines behaviour. Now, 44 forces, including British Transport Police, have recorded county lines behaviour on their turf.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>No one really knows how many young people across the country are being forced to take part. Children without criminal records \u2013 known as \u2018clean skins\u2019 \u2013 are preferred because they are less likely to be known to detectives. The Children\u2019s Society says 4,000 teenagers in London alone are exploited through county lines, while the children\u2019s commissioner estimated at least 46,000 children in England were caught up in gangs.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many children have been affected</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The number of individual phone numbers identified by law enforcement officials as being used on established county lines networks is about 2,000 \u2013 nearly three times the 720 previously established.<br><br>Police estimate the phone numbers are linked to about 1,000 branded networks, with a single line capable of making \u00a3800,000 profits in a year.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to spot the dealers,\u201d said the woman, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals. \u201cThe London ones are in their North Face jackets; the Liverpool ones tuck their tracksuit trousers into their socks.</p> \n<p>\u201cTwenty years ago, we used to drink a bit of cider or smoke a bit of weed.

Boy X and Griffin were in effect the shop front for an enterprise called the \u201cBilly line\u201d. Boy X said Griffin\u2019s council flat was \u201cdirty, disgusting\u201d.

The routine was that Griffin was given heroin and went to his room to smoke it while Boy X began selling drugs to 90 or so addicts who had been alerted that a new batch of Billy line heroin and cocaine was on sale in Bodmin. The Billy line is a typical example of the way criminals are using so-called county lines operations to traffic drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine from cities into faraway towns across the UK. Gangs often drive out local dealers, exploit children such as Boy X and frequently take over a local property belonging to an addict or vulnerable person to use as a base, a practice known as cuckooing. Most tourists whizz through Bodmin, which nestles between the moors and the coast, en route to the surfing beaches of north Cornwall. A very different sort of Cornwall is to be found here. Bodmin bills itself as the historic heart of the county and in the town centre a granite monument pays tribute to Cornishmen Thomas Flamank and Michael Joseph, who led a 15th-century rebellion against taxes imposed by Henry VII and were hung, drawn and quartered in London for their efforts. The town\u2019s tourist attractions tend towards the macabre. Bodmin jail says more than 50 people have been executed within its walls and organises paranormal tours, while visitors to Shire Hall are invited to sit on a make-believe jury to hear the case of Charlotte Dymond, a servant who was murdered on Bodmin Moor in the 19th century. But the town\u2019s crime and social problems are not all historical. According to Safer Cornwall, an umbrella group made up of police, council, housing providers and other agencies, one in four people in Bodmin and the surrounding parishes live in the 20% most deprived neighbourhoods in England and 22% of children live in poverty \u2013 compared with 16% for the whole of Cornwall and 17% across England. Safer Cornwall says while the county is safe, crime is concentrated in its town centres and the level of recorded crime in Bodmin town centre is comparatively high. According to a survey, only 48% of Bodmin residents felt safe out in their local area during the night, and drug dealing is the issue most people worry about. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible in the town at the moment,\u201d said a resident on Berryfields estate, one of the developments on the northern edge of the town built in the early 70s as part of London\u2019s overspill scheme, in which the capital\u2019s overcrowding problem was eased by sending families to remote parts of England. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to spot the dealers,\u201d said the woman, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals. \u201cThe London ones are in their North Face jackets; the Liverpool ones tuck their tracksuit trousers into their socks. \u201cTwenty years ago, we used to drink a bit of cider or smoke a bit of weed.

The \u201cBilly line\u201d resulted in many thousands of pounds-worth of class A drugs being sold to almost 100 users in Cornish towns including Bodmin and the surfing resort of Newquay, Truro crown court heard. A jury on Tuesday found John Griffin, 56, of Bodmin, and Shanice Morrison, 28, of Tottenham, north London, guilty of conspiring to supply crack cocaine and heroin. Londoners Amari Orgill, 22, Connell Bruce, 31, Timon Davis-Blake, 20, Antoinette Bourne, 28, and a 17-year-old boy who cannot be named for legal reasons had already admitted the same offence. The court heard that young people from north London were sent to Bodmin and dumped in the grubby flat of an addict, from where they sold heroin and crack cocaine that had been transported into the county in hired Mercedes and Audi saloons. The operation to catch the gang, codenamed Ligament, culminated in 200 Devon and Cornwall and Metropolitan police officers raiding properties across Cornwall and north London this year. Drugs, cash and knives were seized. When officers caught up with one gang member, he brandished a machete before being overpowered and arrested. According to the National Crime Agency, the term \u201ccounty lines\u201d is used to describe how gangs from big cities expand their operations to towns, often using violence to drive out local dealers. A common feature in county lines drug supply is the exploitation of young and vulnerable people. Dealers frequently persuade or force teenagers to hole up in a local property belonging to an addict or someone with mental health problems, a practice known as \u201ccuckooing\u201d. Truro crown court heard how the Billy line\u2019s mobile phones would send bulk text messages to addicts when a new shipment was on the way advertising what was available. Two of the boys caught up in the line were forced to live in the flat of a 56-year-old Bodmin addict called John Griffin. The court was told he had been given heroin in exchange for the use of his property. There was little attempt to hide the dealing. The boys, who were black, stood out in the small Cornish town with a largely white population. The gang did not care \u2013 their modus operandi was to move boys in and out quickly. One of the boys \u2013 known as X \u2013 informed police he had incurred a drug debt of \u00a355 with the gang and was told he could pay it off by dealing. He presumed he would be put to work near his home in north London and was astonished when he ended up 250 miles away in Bodmin, far from family, friends and familiar surroundings. When he was spotted by the authorities he was taken away by police and social services but was replaced by a second boy \u2013 Y \u2013 who said he had been bundled into a car in London, driven to Cornwall and put up in Griffin\u2019s flat. Devon and Cornwall police believe Operation Ligament was a success not just because it disrupted the Billy line but because it also stopped at least a few young people from being exploited. DI Peter Found, from Devon and Cornwall police, said: \u201cWe are happy we have totally disrupted this drugs supply network. That protects vulnerable people in this county and London. It sends a clear message to those who seek to traffic drugs into Cornwall. We will target traffickers and prosecute them.\u201d The gang members will be sentenced on 11 October.",

At the top of the list was a commitment to use the forthcoming budget to help stimulate economic growth, but also a promise that it would not endanger public finances.

Emphasising social justice, the two parties pledged to introduce a minimum salary, avoid a planned VAT sales rise and boost spending on education, research and welfare. The programme also called for a web tax on multinationals and the creation of a public bank to help boost development in the south. Some M5S figures had criticised the decision to put the coalition plan to an online vote and risk a rejection. \u201cThe voting on the platform is not, in this delicate moment, the most appropriate tool, given the timing,\u201d the MP Michele Nitti wrote on Facebook. \u201cI am surprised the decision to do so was taken, despite the concerns that emerged after the last meeting with the colleagues of the movement.\u201d In a statement to the Italian news agency Adnkronos a few days ago, another M5S MP, Flora Frate, asked Di Maio to withdraw the vote on Rousseau because \u201cbinding Mr Conte via the result of a vote on a platform run by a private company, without any guarantee of transparency, is absurd\u201d. Massimiliano Panarari, a politics professor at Luiss University in Rome, said: \u201cThe vote on Rousseau is part of the M5S tradition and was presented as an example of direct democracy, even though it is far from it. \u201cSubmitting the agreement between PD and M5S to the vote seems an affront to the institutions and to the same democratic representation, after President Mattarella formally commissioned Conte to find an agreement to form a new government.\u201d Web-based direct democracy has been one of M5S\u2019s core principles since it was founded in 2009 by the comedian Beppe Grillo and Gianroberto Casaleggio, an entrepreneur who died three years ago. In its early years, the movement used its website and Grillo\u2019s blog to debate and hold votes before Rousseau, a purpose-built platform named after the 18th-century Swiss-born philosopher, was developed and introduced in 2016. But the system has been plagued by hacking attacks during key votes, and in April Italy\u2019s data protection authority fined the company that runs the platform \u20ac50,000 (\u00a345,000) for failing to protect users\u2019 personal details. M5S has held dozens of online votes on key decisions, including one to elect Di Maio and another on whether to enter its previous coalition with the League. The most recent online ballot was on whether to vote in parliament to defend Salvini from prosecution for preventing migrants disembarking from an Italian coastguard ship. Italy was plunged into chaos last month when Salvini withdrew the League from its fractious alliance with M5S, as he sought to exploit his party\u2019s popularity to bring about snap elections and become prime minister. The dramatic move threatened to create a fully formed far-right government. But Salvini, whose tactics have dented his popularity in recent weeks, had not banked on M5S teaming up with the PD. Though the two parties are longstanding enemies, they are also the two largest parties in parliament. Despite toppling the government, the League remains the most popular party. A poll published on Saturday by Corriere della Sera showed support for the League had fallen to 31.8%, from a mid-July record high of 35.9%. M5S rose almost seven percentage points from mid-July to 24.2%, according to the same poll, while the PD rose marginally to 22.3%. The future of the new coalition remains uncertain. \u201cIt is a government that is surely favoured by Brussels,\u201d said Panarari, \u201cbut in order to carry out the programme it will need to govern until 2022. So far, this seems very difficult.\u201d Conte is expected to draw up a list of ministers by Friday. By this time next week, the new government could already be settled in Rome, with Salvini forced to watch from the opposition benches.",

      "body": "<p>As Boris Johnson threatened that those who vote against him this week will not be allowed to stand as Conservatives in the next election (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/01/boris-johnson-brexit-sacrifice-majority-by-withdrawing-whip-from-rebel-mps\" title=\"\">Johnson ready to sacrifice majority by withdrawing whip from rebels</a>, 2 September), Tory rebels said that if it is country versus party then they will choose country.</p> <p>This is a commendable sentiment from Philip Hammond, David Gauke and others, but it is a false choice. There are numerous historical examples when political \u201crebels\u201d shortly thereafter come back to take leadership positions, while those who followed the official line are consigned to the political wilderness. Winston Churchill is the clearest example of this. And Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton for the 2008 Democratic party nomination because she voted to support the Iraq war.</p> <p>Given the economic disaster that will follow a no-deal Brexit, it will be government members who will struggle to hold their seats in the next election. If Jeremy Corbyn wins, the next Tory leaders will come from the rebels, not from those currently in power. And if the rebels enable the UK to avoid no deal, they will be in line with the majority of the public. So while Nigel Farage and his fellow travellers will be screaming from the sides, the rebel Tory MPs will be well placed to recreate the \u201cone-nation\u201d Conservative party that (as members of the Johnson government themselves stated recently) is essential for its future electability.<br><strong>Dr Charles Enoch</strong><br><em>St Antony\u2019s College, Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022 On Monday I watched a series of TV interviews in which ministers attempted to justify the threats to withdraw the whip from any Tory MP who voted to prevent a no-deal Brexit and possibly to deselect them in the event of a general election. The argument is that the government has a right to expect the loyalty of its party\u2019s MPs.

      "bodyText": "As Boris Johnson threatened that those who vote against him this week will not be allowed to stand as Conservatives in the next election (Johnson ready to sacrifice majority by withdrawing whip from rebels, 2 September), Tory rebels said that if it is country versus party then they will choose country. This is a commendable sentiment from Philip Hammond, David Gauke and others, but it is a false choice. There are numerous historical examples when political \u201crebels\u201d shortly thereafter come back to take leadership positions, while those who followed the official line are consigned to the political wilderness. Winston Churchill is the clearest example of this. And Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton for the 2008 Democratic party nomination because she voted to support the Iraq war. Given the economic disaster that will follow a no-deal Brexit, it will be government members who will struggle to hold their seats in the next election. If Jeremy Corbyn wins, the next Tory leaders will come from the rebels, not from those currently in power. And if the rebels enable the UK to avoid no deal, they will be in line with the majority of the public. So while Nigel Farage and his fellow travellers will be screaming from the sides, the rebel Tory MPs will be well placed to recreate the \u201cone-nation\u201d Conservative party that (as members of the Johnson government themselves stated recently) is essential for its future electability. Dr Charles Enoch St Antony\u2019s College, Oxford \u2022 On Monday I watched a series of TV interviews in which ministers attempted to justify the threats to withdraw the whip from any Tory MP who voted to prevent a no-deal Brexit and possibly to deselect them in the event of a general election. The argument is that the government has a right to expect the loyalty of its party\u2019s MPs. What those ministers fail to acknowledge is that while it might be reasonable to expect loyalty from MPs elected on the basis of a party manifesto of which a no-deal Brexit was a part, that is not the case \u2013 the last Tory manifesto contained no such proposal. So there is no mandate for no deal and the unelected prime minister\u2019s personal mandate does not go beyond the 90,000 Tory members who voted for him as leader. Alan Healey Shrewsbury, Shropshire \u2022 Jeremy Corbyn is rightfully itching to take on Boris Johnson in a general election. Indeed, the Labour leader is at his best on the campaign trail, focusing on those other issues so wilfully neglected these past three years, as Labour\u2019s results in 2017 demonstrated. Yet the shadow Brexit minister, Jenny Chapman, and others are also right to argue that stopping no deal must come first (Corbyn \u2018delighted\u2019 at talk of election, 3 September) and resist the temptation of a snap election. Labour should hold its nerve and exhaust all the legislative processes in parliament until an increasingly beleaguered prime minister and his hard Brexiters are denied any escape routes to the 31 October deadline. Paul Dolan Northwich, Cheshire \u2022 It is possible that Boris may win an election with the opposition vote split. The Tories may lose some seats to the Liberal Democrats in strong remain areas, but Labour is unlikely to achieve a swing against the Conservatives in many seats. It needs a Lib-Lab pact. But fear of Jeremy Corbyn could deter voters from voting Lib Dem if it will deliver him to Downing Street, unless Labour and the Lib Dems agree a limited-purpose pact. The Lib Dems and the SNP should support Corbyn only in order for him to call a second referendum. After that, they do not commit to support him and further negotiations would be required. This pact would require Jo Swinson and Corbyn to swallow their pride, but it is the only way Boris will be defeated. And by God he needs to be. Jonathan Porteous Petersfield, Hampshire \u2022 Thank you for the list of Tory MPs prepared to place the good of the nation above their own personal status (Tory rebels: MPs risking expulsion, 3 September). It gladdens the heart to know there are still some people with this rare quality. Rick Kempster Waterlooville, Hampshire \u2022 Regarding the deselection threat, there would be nothing to stop those deselected from standing as unofficial Tory candidates, thus splitting the Tory vote in those constituencies and probably handing the seat to one of the other candidates. As a confirmed remainer, I would happily make a contribution to the deposits of those deselected.

It may be perfectly possible today to imagine that Boris Johnson may recognise that being tough on crime can sell politically if prison expansion is tied to the update of the prison estate. This leads to unresolvable ethical tensions: we oppose his proposed expansion of prisons, but would we oppose it if the prison estate looked nicer? Some have termed the reformist tilt towards the improvement of prison design and the incorporation of more rehabilitative strategies as \u201ccarceral humanism\u201d, questioning whether these efforts can be truly humanist if they are undergirded by a carceral drive. At what point do we more seriously consider decarceration as a social aim, as opposed to simply rehabilitation? Dr Alexandra Cox Senior lecturer, department of sociology, University of Essex \u2022 The appalling state of this country\u2019s prison system, as described in your G2 article, is made all the more reprehensible by the lack of any meaningful attention that successive governments have given to the 1991 report by Lord Woolf into the mass riots that occurred in Manchester\u2019s Strangeways prison the previous year. Had this report\u2019s proposed shift towards smaller, locally based units \u2013 combined with the greater use of alternative community sentences \u2013 been followed, we wouldn\u2019t be heading toward a hugely costly rerun of the scenes of destruction witnessed at prisons across the country nearly 30 years ago. Isn\u2019t it time that policy shapers, makers and enactors stopped believing that humiliating and dehumanising prisoners encourages them to reform, deters others from offending or makes the public at large any safer?

That won\u2019t change this Test match.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut certainly the dryness of the square as well can play a part in that and Starc is a great exponent of reverse swing if he can get it to happen.

      "bodyText": "Tim Paine has admitted to having sleepless nights over Ben Stokes as the gripping battle for the Ashes resumes in Manchester on Wednesday. Four sold-out days at Old Trafford and a fifth with 18,500 tickets shifted speaks volumes about the enduring appeal of Test cricket and the national fervour sparked by Stokes through his series-levelling century at Headingley. This side of the Pennines even the traffic sign on Princess Parkway heading into the city was warning drivers of delays because of \u201cSir Ben Stokes v Australia\u201d \u2013 something that feels appropriate given the way Australia\u2019s captain was talking 24 hours before the resumption of hostilities. Paine said: \u201cI haven\u2019t lost a hell of a lot of sleep thinking about my captaincy but I have lost a bit of sleep thinking how we\u2019re going to get Stokes out. He\u2019s a class player and he\u2019s really confident at the moment. He\u2019s going well. We\u2019ve got some plans for him \u2013 but we\u2019ve just got to execute them a bit better.\u201d Australia still hold the whip hand knowing one win from the remaining two Tests will retain the urn. As well as dropping Usman Khawaja for the returning Steve Smith \u2013 the right\u2011hander is newly restored to No 1 in the Test batting rankings \u2013 Paine hinted strongly at a recall for Mitchell Starc\u2019s left-arm pace. England have also made a change for what tends to be the bounciest surface in the country as the 6ft 5in Craig Overton comes in for Chris Woakes. It is another seamer who has seemingly got under Paine\u2019s skin, however, after Jofra Archer\u2019s assertion that Australia \u201cpanicked\u201d in Leeds. Paine said: \u201cJofra\u2019s entitled to his opinion, he\u2019s had plenty of those that\u2019s for sure. We made some mistakes, it happens, we\u2019ve addressed it as a team. We\u2019ve spoken about it honestly. I was certainly one of those people who made mistakes. It happens, we\u2019ve moved on and we\u2019re here ready for a great Test match.\u201d On Smith, who sat out the one\u2011wicket defeat at Headingley because of the concussion inflicted by Archer at Lord\u2019s, Paine said: \u201cI think everyone in the world is looking forward to watching Steve Smith bat. Steve has missed one Test match, he hasn\u2019t been out for 12 months. He came back from a 12-month layoff pretty well, so I expect he will handle six days without batting pretty well.\u201d The 12-month absence alluded to followed Smith\u2019s role last year in the ball\u2011tampering scandal, something Paine was happy to make light of when the subject of reverse swing arose. Old Trafford has a reputation for the phenomenon and though a green square may not be conducive this time around, it furthers Starc\u2019s claims for a first outing of the series. Asked whether his side will change their ball management methods with reverse swing in mind, Paine said with a smile: \u201cNo, we just use saliva and shine it on our pants. That\u2019s the way we look after the ball. That won\u2019t change this Test match. \u201cBut certainly the dryness of the square as well can play a part in that and Starc is a great exponent of reverse swing if he can get it to happen. If that is the case he will be a dangerous proposition.\u201d Paine\u2019s opposite number, Joe Root, was hopeful the feelgood factor from this summer\u2019s World Cup win and Headingley rolls on. But this will hinge chiefly on how his batting lineup, fresh from a Jekyll and Hyde performance \u2013 67 all out followed by a record chase of 359 \u2013 fare. Jason Roy has dropped from opener to No 4 in a swap with Joe Denly and a concession that the Surrey right-hander, averaging 9.5 this series, will need the shine taken off the Dukes ball to produce his best. Root said: \u201cIt\u2019s not gone exactly how we\u2019d have liked and [Roy] hasn\u2019t scored the runs he would have liked. We\u2019re still trying to find a formula that works for us. It\u2019s been difficult in English conditions and it\u2019s not just us, every side that has come over the top order have not performed. \u201cJason is a high-quality player and could be better suited to four. We all know what he can do when he gets himself in and hopefully batting a little lower down helps him to do that.\u201d Overton\u2019s recall comes off the back of 32 wickets at 21 from eight appearances for Somerset this season. The 25-year-old has experience of Ashes cricket too, having played twice during the 2017-18 series and opened his account in Adelaide with the prized scalp of Smith. Root said: \u201cThe extra bounce of a taller bowler gives us a different option on a ground that does perform slightly differently. It will balance our attack really well in these conditions. \u201cCraig is a competitor. You saw him come into Ashes cricket on debut and looked very much at home and got himself in a battle. I expect him to do that again this week.\u201d On Stokes, enjoying a golden summer and with two centuries already this series, Root said: \u201cHe\u2019s a great team man who will go out of his way to help anyone.

      "bodyText": "GKN Aerospace is to shed 1,000 jobs worldwide as part of a restructuring that it said pre-dated its controversial \u00a38bn takeover by Melrose, which secured the government\u2019s blessing for the deal after promising to invest in the business. The company, based in Redditch, Worcestershire, said it needed to cut jobs to simplify the business, which grew after a series of acquisitions, leading to duplication of roles in the 15 countries where it operates. It is not yet clear how many UK roles will be affected but the company plans to cut 1,000 staff from a global workforce of 18,000, of which 3,500 are in the UK. GKN Aerospace is part of the larger GKN engineering group bought by takeover and turnaround business Melrose after a hostile bid last year. Melrose promised to invest in GKN \u2013 and to keep its own headquarters and stock market listing in the UK \u2013 after the government stepped in to seek binding assurances. It has since been accused of a \u201cbreach of faith\u201d by MPs, after revealing plans to shut the King\u2019s Norton factory in Birmingham, which makes windscreens and windows for both civilian and military aircraft, at the cost of 170 jobs. But GKN Aerospace said its restructuring plan pre-dated the takeover by Melrose and was part of a longstanding plan to combine its four divisions into one. Its chief executive, Hans B\u00fcthker, said: \u201cWe are creating a single, fully integrated business aligned to our customers\u2019 needs, which will ensure we are better positioned within the competitive global aerospace market.\u201d The company said the 1,000 job cuts would take place over two years and it will try to minimise the impact by redeploying staff and not filling any vacancies that arise. \u201cLooking ahead, when this restructure is complete, we will be simpler, stronger and more successful,\u201d said B\u00fcthker. GKN Aerospace\u2019s UK workforce of 3,500 makes it the company\u2019s second most well-staffed market, after the US, where it has more than 5,000 staff. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 September 2019 to clarify that Melrose promised to keep its own headquarters and stock market listing in the UK, not those of GKN as an earlier version said.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson had secretly decided to suspend parliament nearly two weeks before asking the Queen, according to memos from Downing Street read out in court. The court in Edinburgh heard the first memo was written by Nikki da Costa, the prime minister\u2019s senior legal adviser, on 15 August and spelled out the plan to suspend parliament in the week beginning 9 September. Her memo was circulated to a very small circle of key figures in Downing Street, including Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, Ed Lister, the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, and Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s controversial chief adviser. In public Johnson was then refusing to confirm he planned to do so but he ticked the secret memo and said \u201cyes\u201d, before sending Da Costa a handwritten note the following day, where he criticised the convention where MPs return for several weeks of Commons business after the summer holidays before breaking again for conference season. He told Da Costa the \u201cwhole September session [at Westminster] is a rigmarole introduced to show the public that MPs are earning their crust. I don\u2019t see anything especially shocking about this prorogation.\u201d This exchange of memos came 12 days before privy counsellors designated by Johnson met the Queen at Balmoral to ask her to prorogue parliament, on the grounds he wanted to present a significant new legislative programme on 14 October. The documents, revealed in heavily redacted form for the first time at 10.55pm on Monday, were sent to the legal team acting for 75 MPs and peers who are challenging prorogation in the court of session in Edinburgh. Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, acting for the MPs and peers, said he only received an unredacted version of the documents on Tuesday morning. He told Lord Doherty, the judge hearing the case, this proved Johnson was plotting to suspend parliament at the same time that his government\u2019s lawyers had told the court in Edinburgh the question of prorogation was \u201chypothetical and academic\u201d because no such decision had been taken. The UK government had also refused to give the court any sworn affidavits setting out why prorogation was necessary and the prime minister had ignored O\u2019Neill\u2019s suggestion last week that he should provide one to the court. Accusing Johnson of \u201cincontinent mendacity\u201d, O\u2019Neill said the prime minister had shown an unwillingness to acknowledge and speak the truth. He said: \u201cHe has chosen not to be accountable to this court and seeks not to be accountable to parliament.\u201d David Johnston QC, acting for the UK government, apologised to the court for failing to produce the papers until the night before the hearing and admitted the government had breached the deadline for submitting them. He said they were being produced in the spirit of transparency, to allow the court to understand the process behind the decision to seek prorogation. Reading from a brief prepared by the government, Johnston insisted the legal action was academic because MPs were still being given time to sit and vote before exit day on 31 October, and set their own agenda. \u201cWe are not dealing with an executive which is out of control,\u201d he said. It was also well within the government\u2019s and Queen\u2019s constitutional rights to prorogue parliament, while a court did not have the competence or tools to judge on political decisions by a prime minister. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, which requires a two-thirds majority in the Commons to stage an election within five years of a previous one, explicitly allowed a prime minister to prorogue parliament, he added. This is \u201cfast-moving and highly controversial situation\u201d, Johnston said. \u201cIt is not a situation where the courts can properly impose additional legal standards on a political process.\u201d This case is the first of three legal challenges, including others to be heard in Belfast and London this week. Earlier Doherty had allowed the lord advocate, James Wolffe QC, Scotland\u2019s chief law officer, to join with the O\u2019Neill case. Doherty is expected to give his judgment on Wednesday: if he rules that the UK government has behaved illegally then Johnson could be forced to immediately ask the Queen to suspend prorogation.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s building industry was hit by the biggest fall in new work in more than a decade last month as Brexit uncertainty gripped construction firms before the deadline on 31 October. New orders contracted for a fifth month in August with commercial construction, which includes offices and shops, leading the decline as competition for work intensified and property developers delayed decision-making. The measure of new orders on the IHS Markit/Cips UK construction PMI survey slumped from 44.6 in July to 40, the lowest since March 2009 when the UK economy was in recession after the financial crash. Any reading below 50 signals contraction. The headline index, which measures total activity in the sector, showed construction fell for a fourth consecutive month, again led by office building and general maintenance.

The level of new work has declined since April in line with official figures, which last month showed the sector contracted in the second quarter of the year. Building lobby groups warned that further declines over the coming months were likely to put many smaller firms out of business. The Federation of Master Builders said its members were already struggling to absorb higher costs \u201cin an industry notorious for tight margins\u201d. Its chief executive, Brian Berry, said: \u201cIf we want local builders to deliver the high-quality homes our country needs, to upgrade people\u2019s homes to modern standards and to form the supply chain for key national infrastructure projects that are essential to helping our economy move forward, then we certainly can\u2019t afford for building companies to go to the wall due to uncertainty.\u201d In spite of the contraction and weak outlook, firms hung on to staff and maintained recruitment plans. The survey reported evidence of a widespread shortage of workers since the Brexit vote that prevented employers from making staff redundant. Analysts said a Brexit deal was unlikely to revive the industry before the end of the year after a dive in confidence in construction industry boardrooms. An IHS Markit economist, Tim Moore, said: \u201cConstruction companies noted that rising risk aversion and tighter budget-setting by clients in response to Brexit uncertainty had held back activity, particularly in the commercial sub-sector. \u201cCommercial construction activity fell at a steep and accelerated pace during August, which more than offset the softer rates of decline in house building and civil engineering work.\u201d Construction companies indicated a slide in business optimism to the lowest level since December 2008.

The Brexit crisis meant it seemed inevitable there would be an early general election, she added.</p> <p>She did not mention polls that indicate the Scottish National party would win more than 50 of Scotland\u2019s 59 Commons seats, but said she wanted to be prepared. \u201cWe intend to offer the people of Scotland the choice of a better and more positive future as an independent nation,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe will seek agreement to the transfer of power that will put the referendum beyond legal challenge.

      "bodyText": "Nicola Sturgeon has said she will ask for the legal powers to stage a new independence referendum next year as she unveiled a swathe of measures to combat climate heating. The first minister told MSPs on Tuesday she would ask the UK government for a section 30 order enabling Holyrood to hold a second independence vote once a new Scottish referendum bill is passed. Over the next year, the Scottish government would also spend \u00a3500m to improve the country\u2019s buses, set a new target to decarbonise the Scottish rail network by 2035, and fund a \u00a33bn green new deal package coordinated by a new Scottish investment bank. Coupled with measures on health inequalities and cutting waste, Sturgeon said her ambitious legislative programme stood in stark contrast to the political and constitutional emergency gripping Westminster. The Brexit crisis meant it seemed inevitable there would be an early general election, she added. She did not mention polls that indicate the Scottish National party would win more than 50 of Scotland\u2019s 59 Commons seats, but said she wanted to be prepared. \u201cWe intend to offer the people of Scotland the choice of a better and more positive future as an independent nation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will seek agreement to the transfer of power that will put the referendum beyond legal challenge. We have a clear democratic mandate to offer the choice of independence within this term of parliament \u2013 and we intend to do so.\u201d Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, said earlier on Tuesday an election gave his party \u201ca fantastic opportunity\u201d to strengthen the mandate for independence. It would allow Scotland\u2019s voters \u201cto send a very clear message to Westminster that we should be able to determine our own future\u201d, he said. Speaking in Holyrood as she unveiled the next year\u2019s programme for government, Sturgeon said the carbon emergency would be the centrepiece of its legislation and spending. She said the programme included: \u2022 Making the Highlands and islands the first \u201cnet zero\u201d aviation zone in the world by 2040. \u2022 Producing regulations to make sure all new homes would include renewable or low carbon heat from 2024. \u2022 Consulting on introducing zero-emissions city centres by 2030. \u2022 Helping the oil and gas industry invest in carbon capture and storage. \u2022 Exploring the scope for a hydrogen refuelling network and explore using hydrogen to power trains in remote areas. Among other measures, Sturgeon said another \u00a320m would be spent on tackling Scotland\u2019s drugs deaths crisis; a fresh initiative to improve mental health for women; reform of Scotland\u2019s defamation laws; new powers for local councils to introduce tourist levies such as bed taxes; and enable new charges for single-use disposable coffee cups. Sturgeon\u2019s emphasis on tackling the climate crisis was welcomed by environmental campaigners. Glasgow is expected to be the host city for next year\u2019s COP26 global climate summit and Sturgeon wants to show her government is taking leadership on the climate. Richard Dixon, the director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said the positive measures Sturgeon unveiled were undermined by the serious contradiction of continuing to support maximum extraction of North Sea oil and gas. North Sea drilling should be phased out quickly, he said.

Here, however, the technical challenges were all formidably met in playing and singing of tremendous precision and often hair-raising exuberance. Gardiner conducted with almost ferocious energy.

      "bodyText": "\u2018I\u2019m convinced there\u2019s an absolute masterpiece in there that has to be dug out like a pearl from an oyster,\u201d John Eliot Gardiner commented in a recent interview, on Benvenuto Cellini, Berlioz\u2019s first opera. Unsuccessful at its 1838 Paris premiere and during its composer\u2019s lifetime, it had to wait until the late 20th century for audiences and performers to appreciate its worth. To mark the 150th anniversary of Berlioz\u2019s death, meanwhile, Gardiner has embarked on a European tour of the work, in a semi-staging by Noa Naamat, with the Monteverdi Choir and Orchestre R\u00e9volutionnaire et Romantique. He brought it to the Proms after performances in Berlioz\u2019s birthplace, La C\u00f4te-Saint-Andr\u00e9, and Berlin. A portrait of the famous sculptor as an iconoclastic rebel, the score, riotous in its profusion, has a reputation for being difficult and problematic, both for the considerable demands it places on its performers, and for its supposed unevenness of inspiration. Its greatness, we are frequently told, is hampered by too many longueurs. Here, however, the technical challenges were all formidably met in playing and singing of tremendous precision and often hair-raising exuberance. Gardiner conducted with almost ferocious energy. Rhythms were exactingly precise, textures beautifully illuminated, shifts in mood immaculately judged. The Monteverdi Choir sounded thrilling, above all in the complex tarantella that Berlioz reused as the allegro in his Roman Carnival Overture. It was impossible not to be swept away by it all, and just for once not a note seemed out of place, with no sense of longueurs whatsoever. There wasn\u2019t a weak link in the cast, either. Michael Spyres made a superb Cellini, handsome and seductive in tone, ardent in his passion for Sophia Burgos\u2019s sensual, spirited Teresa, and standing up to Tareq Nazmi\u2019s manipulative, if none too bright Pope with assertive dignity. Maurizio Muraro was the blustering yet dangerous Balducci; Lionel Lhote, impeccable both in comic timing and vocal warmth, the outstanding Fieramosca.

Tory rebels see in Dominic Cummings \u2013 who has bragged in the past about not actually being a member of the Conservative party despite working for several of its leading lights \u2013 a mirror image of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/26/jeremy-corbyn-makes-unites-andrew-murray-part-time-consultant\" title=\"\">ex-Communists such as Andrew Murray, </a>who now have Corbyn\u2019s ear. They also see the swaths of ex-Ukippers rejoining constituency associations as cuckoos in the nest, just waiting for their chance to oust sitting MPs who don\u2019t share their views. And now the showdown some have been grimly expecting ever since the referendum is here.</p> <p>Some of the refuseniks are old school, one-nation Conservatives who are either already retiring, such as Ken Clarke, or have been around for long enough not to care about their future ministerial prospects. Others such as Greening, Nick Boles or Ed Vaizey rose to prominence as part of David Cameron\u2019s efforts to detoxify the Tory brand, and are still young enough to have a second career outside politics if they go now. For every Tory openly voting against the government tonight, there will be even more like-minded MPs who share their fears for the party\u2019s future but are siding still with Boris Johnson, either in the hope he somehow pulls off a deal or under the illusion they can influence things from the inside.</p> <p>But if there is to be a general election in which Tory candidates might be expected to embrace not only a no-deal Brexit, but potentially a slew of provocative \u201cculture war\u201d policies \u2013 Downing Street is said to have polling ideas on trans rights, for example \u2013 to woo socially conservative voters back from the Brexit party, then the Amber Rudds, Nicky Morgans and Damian Greens will also have to ask themselves whether they can in all conscience be part of it. And that question will cascade right the way down the party, to councillors and activists and voters wondering if this is still the Conservative party they joined, or whether it has been taken over by fundamentally unconservative forces.</p> <p>On the one hand, they\u2019ll know that if all the moderates melt away then Nigel Farage will essentially have won; the transformation of the Conservative party into something virtually indistinguishable from his Brexit party would be complete. They will have seen, too, in the collapse of Change UK how difficult it is to get a new breakaway party off the ground and how hard it is even for household names to get a hearing once they no longer have a platform.</p> <p>But they have also seen how many Labour MPs\u2019 pledges to \u201cstay and fight\u201d Corbynism translated either into a great deal of staying and not much discernible fighting, or into a vicious and exhausting war of attrition with the membership. If many centrist voters dread the choice awaiting them at a coming election, imagine how centrist MPs feel about it. But they may not have long to make up their minds.</p> <p>\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p>",

The speed with which husky-hugging Cameroon modernisers have gone from the dominant mainstream force inside the party to a marginalised one is breathtaking, but hardly unprecedented in recent years. Tory rebels see in Dominic Cummings \u2013 who has bragged in the past about not actually being a member of the Conservative party despite working for several of its leading lights \u2013 a mirror image of the ex-Communists such as Andrew Murray, who now have Corbyn\u2019s ear. They also see the swaths of ex-Ukippers rejoining constituency associations as cuckoos in the nest, just waiting for their chance to oust sitting MPs who don\u2019t share their views. And now the showdown some have been grimly expecting ever since the referendum is here. Some of the refuseniks are old school, one-nation Conservatives who are either already retiring, such as Ken Clarke, or have been around for long enough not to care about their future ministerial prospects. Others such as Greening, Nick Boles or Ed Vaizey rose to prominence as part of David Cameron\u2019s efforts to detoxify the Tory brand, and are still young enough to have a second career outside politics if they go now. For every Tory openly voting against the government tonight, there will be even more like-minded MPs who share their fears for the party\u2019s future but are siding still with Boris Johnson, either in the hope he somehow pulls off a deal or under the illusion they can influence things from the inside. But if there is to be a general election in which Tory candidates might be expected to embrace not only a no-deal Brexit, but potentially a slew of provocative \u201cculture war\u201d policies \u2013 Downing Street is said to have polling ideas on trans rights, for example \u2013 to woo socially conservative voters back from the Brexit party, then the Amber Rudds, Nicky Morgans and Damian Greens will also have to ask themselves whether they can in all conscience be part of it. And that question will cascade right the way down the party, to councillors and activists and voters wondering if this is still the Conservative party they joined, or whether it has been taken over by fundamentally unconservative forces. On the one hand, they\u2019ll know that if all the moderates melt away then Nigel Farage will essentially have won; the transformation of the Conservative party into something virtually indistinguishable from his Brexit party would be complete. They will have seen, too, in the collapse of Change UK how difficult it is to get a new breakaway party off the ground and how hard it is even for household names to get a hearing once they no longer have a platform. But they have also seen how many Labour MPs\u2019 pledges to \u201cstay and fight\u201d Corbynism translated either into a great deal of staying and not much discernible fighting, or into a vicious and exhausting war of attrition with the membership. If many centrist voters dread the choice awaiting them at a coming election, imagine how centrist MPs feel about it. But they may not have long to make up their minds. \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",

The footage is intensely personal, at times searingly intimate, and cumulative \u2013 showrunners Josh Kriegman, Elyse Steinberg and Eli Despres filmed four couples over 20 weeks of one-hour therapy sessions, then edited down and stitched together each couple\u2019s journey into nine half-hour episodes. Other than brief transition montages or characterizing shots \u2013 couple pouring coffee in their home, couple riding in the back of a car \u2013 that\u2019s it: the couples and the therapist, outfits changing with the week, getting to know each other and themselves.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJbWAWnWuio\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FJbWAWnWuio?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>A decently clear picture \u2013 or, at least, the small-talk version of why each pair no longer sees eye-to-eye \u2013 emerges by the end of the first episode. There\u2019s Evelyn and Alan, a young couple whose mutual lack of trust perches them on separate ends of the couch and the brink of separation; Lauren and Sarah, a queer and trans couple whose spark dampens under the weight (or lack thereof) of potential children; DeSean and Elaine, a union of reserve and fire \u2013 \u201che calmed my noise, and I woke him up,\u201d Elaine says \u2013 now speaking in mutual spite; and Annie and Mau, whose bickering over a birthday plan gone awry suggests a personal history of defensiveness and desire much more complicated than either let on.</p> <p>The subsequent episodes, four of which were available for review, richly fill in \u2013 or interrogate and flip \u2013 those narratives as the therapist, Dr Orna Guralnik, masterfully steers part conversation, part investigation into the many strands of personality, miscommunication, sex, money, power and mistrust (to name a few things) that pull a couple apart. This raw, potentially instructive honesty builds on years of popular media seeking to pull back the curtain on romantic coupledom: there\u2019s the viral Ted Talk by therapist and media figure Esther Perel, <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/esther_perel_rethinking_infidelity_a_talk_for_anyone_who_has_ever_loved?language=en\">Rethinking Infidelity,</a> viewed nearly 14m times, and advice podcasts such as the Dan Savage Lovecast or Cheryl Strayed and Steve Almond\u2019s Dear Sugar.

Its presence offers a level up on the fascination of lurking behind closed doors, but also presents a conundrum \u2013 \u201chow can you capture therapy, and what\u2019s so extraordinary about therapy, while also filming it?\u201d Kriegman, whose parents are both therapists, told the Guardian. \u201cIs it possible for people to be open and raw and vulnerable where they are able to do great work while also knowing that they\u2019re being filmed?</p> <p>\u201cTruthfully, we didn\u2019t know if it would work,\u201d he admitted. (He and Steinberg previously worked together on Weiner, a documentary about former congressman Anthony Weiner\u2019s scandal-derailed NYC mayoral campaign.) Nevertheless, the team set about casting a diverse range of couples \u2013 in age, sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnicity \u2013 open to exploring their relationship on record. Their open call, according to Steinberg, received over 1,000 inquiries. After a series of \u201clong conversations\u201d, they narrowed it down to a few couples, then eventually four.</p> <p>All agreed to have cameras in their sessions because they were \u201cinspired by the possibility that sharing their stories publicly could be helpful to other people who are having similar struggles\u201d, said Kriegman. In turn, the film-making team, according to Steinberg, sought to avoid sensationalism or salaciousness by eliding the camera\u2019s presence as much as possible: the documentarians stayed out of the therapy room, instead concealing cameras, integrated inconspicuously into the office\u2019s design, behind one-way glass. They maintain that the recorded emotion is all unprompted; couples were able \u201cto come in, sit in the waiting room, have an hour-long therapy session, leave and never once interact with any element of production or camera-person, or see any camera\u201d, said Kriegman.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59c64dba7702af862bc3ecac0f4d0b8c1d0acc67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59c64dba7702af862bc3ecac0f4d0b8c1d0acc67/0_0_8000_4208/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Ameerullah and Evelyn Ameerullah in Couples Therapy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"526\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan and Evelyn in Couples Therapy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of SHOWTIME/Courtesy of Showtime</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Guralnik, meanwhile, flourishes as she treads an expert line between empathetically pulling on tightly held threads and acknowledging pain while sidestepping judgment. A New York City-based psychotherapist and psychoanalyst with 25 years\u2019 experience, Guralnik was initially skeptical of appearing on screen, but came around to the film-makers\u2019 vision of unadulterated process. \u201cThere are very parallel processes to documentary film-making and the psychoanalytic process \u2013 the process of storytelling, narrating, finding the underlying narrative of something that seems obvious,\u201d she told the Guardian.</p> <p>A former film student, Guralnik approaches couple\u2019s therapy with what she called a \u201cpsychoanalytic sensibility\u201d \u2013 keeping an ear to the \u201cenigmatic unconscious\u201d, knowing that \u201cpeople don\u2019t always know what\u2019s motivating them and what\u2019s at play\u201d \u2013 while also noting \u201cthe system that they\u2019ve created together\u201d with its own individual and family patterns. Guralnik also \u2013 in accordance, she said, with Kriegman and Steinberg \u2013 pays particular attention to sociocultural factors: gender dynamics, politics, race, class, \u201call of these large-scale issues and how they find expression within the couple\u2019s life, and their most intimate moments\u201d.</p> <p>Captured softly on tape, Guralnik\u2019s work offers a welcome opportunity to witness the struggle of seeing another person for who they are \u2013 of recognizing, as she tells her own clinical adviser-cum-work therapist, that a single person will never live up to your fantasy of them. The show, she hopes, will help people \u201cto think about the kind of couple\u2019s dances that we all do \u2013 that we get into repetitive cycles.\u201d</p> <p>Those cycles work on a societal level, as well \u2013 a national pattern of outrage not lost on the film-makers. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that our culture right now, we\u2019re inundated with stories of conflict and polarization,\u201d said Kriegman. \u201cBut even beyond politics, I think many of us experience the dominant narrative being one of people entrenched in their corners with opposing views and digging their heels in.\u201d</p> <p>The contested terrain of the romantic couple offers a different story, he said, one that evinces humanity\u2019s oft-underplayed instinct to sincerely improve. \u201cPeople really do want to do better \u2013 they want to transcend, they want to grow, there\u2019s this underlying push toward health, connectedness, betterment,\u201d Guralnik said. \u201cI really feel as a therapist and an analyst, you get to tap into the underlying forces that mend humanity.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Couples Therapy starts on Showtime on 6 September with a UK date yet to be announced.</em></p></li> </ul>",

Other than brief transition montages or characterizing shots \u2013 couple pouring coffee in their home, couple riding in the back of a car \u2013 that\u2019s it: the couples and the therapist, outfits changing with the week, getting to know each other and themselves. A decently clear picture \u2013 or, at least, the small-talk version of why each pair no longer sees eye-to-eye \u2013 emerges by the end of the first episode. There\u2019s Evelyn and Alan, a young couple whose mutual lack of trust perches them on separate ends of the couch and the brink of separation; Lauren and Sarah, a queer and trans couple whose spark dampens under the weight (or lack thereof) of potential children; DeSean and Elaine, a union of reserve and fire \u2013 \u201che calmed my noise, and I woke him up,\u201d Elaine says \u2013 now speaking in mutual spite; and Annie and Mau, whose bickering over a birthday plan gone awry suggests a personal history of defensiveness and desire much more complicated than either let on. The subsequent episodes, four of which were available for review, richly fill in \u2013 or interrogate and flip \u2013 those narratives as the therapist, Dr Orna Guralnik, masterfully steers part conversation, part investigation into the many strands of personality, miscommunication, sex, money, power and mistrust (to name a few things) that pull a couple apart. This raw, potentially instructive honesty builds on years of popular media seeking to pull back the curtain on romantic coupledom: there\u2019s the viral Ted Talk by therapist and media figure Esther Perel, Rethinking Infidelity, viewed nearly 14m times, and advice podcasts such as the Dan Savage Lovecast or Cheryl Strayed and Steve Almond\u2019s Dear Sugar. Perel has her own podcast, Where Should We Begin?, launched two years ago, in which audiences listen in on capsule episodes of single therapy sessions with real couples. But Couples Therapy breaks new ground with its camera, capturing the stalemates and breakthroughs in shifting gazes, unsaid interjections, raised eyebrows. Its presence offers a level up on the fascination of lurking behind closed doors, but also presents a conundrum \u2013 \u201chow can you capture therapy, and what\u2019s so extraordinary about therapy, while also filming it?\u201d Kriegman, whose parents are both therapists, told the Guardian. \u201cIs it possible for people to be open and raw and vulnerable where they are able to do great work while also knowing that they\u2019re being filmed? \u201cTruthfully, we didn\u2019t know if it would work,\u201d he admitted. (He and Steinberg previously worked together on Weiner, a documentary about former congressman Anthony Weiner\u2019s scandal-derailed NYC mayoral campaign.) Nevertheless, the team set about casting a diverse range of couples \u2013 in age, sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnicity \u2013 open to exploring their relationship on record. Their open call, according to Steinberg, received over 1,000 inquiries. After a series of \u201clong conversations\u201d, they narrowed it down to a few couples, then eventually four. All agreed to have cameras in their sessions because they were \u201cinspired by the possibility that sharing their stories publicly could be helpful to other people who are having similar struggles\u201d, said Kriegman. In turn, the film-making team, according to Steinberg, sought to avoid sensationalism or salaciousness by eliding the camera\u2019s presence as much as possible: the documentarians stayed out of the therapy room, instead concealing cameras, integrated inconspicuously into the office\u2019s design, behind one-way glass. They maintain that the recorded emotion is all unprompted; couples were able \u201cto come in, sit in the waiting room, have an hour-long therapy session, leave and never once interact with any element of production or camera-person, or see any camera\u201d, said Kriegman. Guralnik, meanwhile, flourishes as she treads an expert line between empathetically pulling on tightly held threads and acknowledging pain while sidestepping judgment. A New York City-based psychotherapist and psychoanalyst with 25 years\u2019 experience, Guralnik was initially skeptical of appearing on screen, but came around to the film-makers\u2019 vision of unadulterated process. \u201cThere are very parallel processes to documentary film-making and the psychoanalytic process \u2013 the process of storytelling, narrating, finding the underlying narrative of something that seems obvious,\u201d she told the Guardian. A former film student, Guralnik approaches couple\u2019s therapy with what she called a \u201cpsychoanalytic sensibility\u201d \u2013 keeping an ear to the \u201cenigmatic unconscious\u201d, knowing that \u201cpeople don\u2019t always know what\u2019s motivating them and what\u2019s at play\u201d \u2013 while also noting \u201cthe system that they\u2019ve created together\u201d with its own individual and family patterns. Guralnik also \u2013 in accordance, she said, with Kriegman and Steinberg \u2013 pays particular attention to sociocultural factors: gender dynamics, politics, race, class, \u201call of these large-scale issues and how they find expression within the couple\u2019s life, and their most intimate moments\u201d. Captured softly on tape, Guralnik\u2019s work offers a welcome opportunity to witness the struggle of seeing another person for who they are \u2013 of recognizing, as she tells her own clinical adviser-cum-work therapist, that a single person will never live up to your fantasy of them. The show, she hopes, will help people \u201cto think about the kind of couple\u2019s dances that we all do \u2013 that we get into repetitive cycles.\u201d Those cycles work on a societal level, as well \u2013 a national pattern of outrage not lost on the film-makers. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that our culture right now, we\u2019re inundated with stories of conflict and polarization,\u201d said Kriegman. \u201cBut even beyond politics, I think many of us experience the dominant narrative being one of people entrenched in their corners with opposing views and digging their heels in.\u201d The contested terrain of the romantic couple offers a different story, he said, one that evinces humanity\u2019s oft-underplayed instinct to sincerely improve. \u201cPeople really do want to do better \u2013 they want to transcend, they want to grow, there\u2019s this underlying push toward health, connectedness, betterment,\u201d Guralnik said. \u201cI really feel as a therapist and an analyst, you get to tap into the underlying forces that mend humanity.\u201d Couples Therapy starts on Showtime on 6 September with a UK date yet to be announced.",

The retailer plans to take charge of supplying water to its John Lewis and Waitrose stores in England through a self-supply licence. If the application is successful, John Lewis will become the first retailer to skip the margin charged by water suppliers and pay direct wholesale prices instead. It plans to work with Waterscan to organise the operation, which could help the retailer reduce its overall water use and meet its sustainability goals. An increasing number of companies are opting to self-supply rather than buy water from traditional companies after the regulator, Ofwat, opened the market to competition in 2017. The biggest shake-up of the industry since deregulation in the late 1980s has prompted Greene King, Whitbread, Marston\u2019s, Kellogg\u2019s, Coca-Cola European Partners, BT and Heineken to become their own water suppliers. In the past, companies were bound to a string of regional monopoly water suppliers to meet the demand of sites across the country. For big companies, this would mean a series of water bills from multiple suppliers every quarter. Under the most recent laws, which took effect in April 2017, companies could choose a pan-national supplier or become a self-supplier. Ofwat has said companies that choose to self-supply benefit from cost savings, better control of data and water efficiency savings. The regulator has considered also opening the water market for households, but the financial savings are likely to be too small to make the cost of changing the sector worthwhile. Neil Pendle, the managing director of Waterscan, said he was \u201cextremely confident\u201d a self-supply licence would help John Lewis meet its sustainability targets and set a benchmark for water efficiency in the retail sector.",

But there are clear processes to be followed. The other factors are dealt with by other organisations and other processes.\u201d</p> <p>Black was on far firmer ground when it came to discussing Dina Asher-Smith, who he believes could become the first British athlete to take three medals in one world championships, in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay.</p> <p>\u201cI think it is possible for her to win medals in all three events,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is probably the expectation she puts on herself. We all know she\u2019s a very special athlete and I think she\u2019s got her focus on all three events. The 100m is probably the biggest challenge but it\u2019s not unrealistic for her to be aiming for all three.\u201d</p> <p>However Black was slightly less upbeat about the prospects of another serious contender, Laura Muir, who is only just back running sessions again after tearing a calf muscle at the Anniversary Games in July.

      "bodyText": "Neil Black, the British Athletics performance director, has defended the decision to select 800m runner Kyle Langford for the world championships in Doha this month despite the 23-year-old\u2019s well-publicised misdemeanours this summer. Langford, who finished fourth at the world championships in London in 2017 as a teenager, was fined \u00a31,000 and given a final warning in July after appearing to grab a 74-year-old race official by the throat. He is now the subject of a further complaint from the athlete James McCarthy, whom he is alleged to have called a \u201cfucking pussy\u201d after finishing eighth at the UK trials in August. However, Black sidestepped questions about Langford\u2019s behaviour and whether he was an adequate role model \u2013 and instead insisted he deserved to be picked in the 72-strong team on his ability. \u201cThe discussions in the selection meeting focused purely on performance,\u201d Black said. \u201cThe selectors decided that Kyle\u2019s performances merited selection and we believe he\u2019s going to go forwards to Doha and perform really well.\u201d He added: \u201cIf a complaint has been received I am sure it will be dealt with in the correct manner. But there are clear processes to be followed. The other factors are dealt with by other organisations and other processes.\u201d Black was on far firmer ground when it came to discussing Dina Asher-Smith, who he believes could become the first British athlete to take three medals in one world championships, in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay. \u201cI think it is possible for her to win medals in all three events,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is probably the expectation she puts on herself. We all know she\u2019s a very special athlete and I think she\u2019s got her focus on all three events. The 100m is probably the biggest challenge but it\u2019s not unrealistic for her to be aiming for all three.\u201d However Black was slightly less upbeat about the prospects of another serious contender, Laura Muir, who is only just back running sessions again after tearing a calf muscle at the Anniversary Games in July. Black did say, though, that with just over three weeks to go before Doha she still had time to get into the shape to win a medal at 1500m. \u201cShe\u2019s at the stage of actually starting to run sessions, and the beauty of Laura and her coach Andy Young is that they\u2019re brilliant at planning,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know from the past what Laura needs to do to get in shape to run medal-winning performances, which is anywhere from 3.55-3.57. They know what it takes to win a medal. That\u2019s the plan. It\u2019s just a different preparation. She is going to be there and she is going to be competitive.\u201d As expected there was no Mo Farah in the British team, with the 36-year-old deciding against running in the 10,000m in Doha to concentrate instead on defending his Chicago marathon title, for which he will be handsomely remunerated. However Black defended UK Athletics\u2019 decision to keep funding Farah despite a growing number of critics pointing out that he has not run in a British vest since 2017. \u201cI understand people thinking that way,\u201d Black said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been really clear from the start that the marathon is the event and I think he\u2019s on a mission.

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap. Rising anxiety over Brexit and the possibility of a snap general election have sent the pound spiralling towards a 34-year low today. Sterling suffered a sharp early selloff, dropping by a cent against the US dollar to just $1.1959. That\u2019s the weakest level since a notorious flash crash in October 2016, and the weakest since 1985 in regular trading. The slump came amid fears that Britain could crash out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. MPs are trying to block a no-deal tonight, which could prompt the government to push for a general election in the middle of next month. But after a grim start, the pound has actually recovered this afternoon after Boris Johnson lost his majority in parliament. Sterling bounced back as Conservative MP Phillip Lee crossed the floor of the House of Commons to join the Liberal Democrats. It\u2019s now up 0.2% today at $1.2090, after a wild day that left traders gasping for breath (and possibly a swift drink on the way home). Sterling also had a wild ride against the euro, falling to just \u20ac1.0932 before bouncing back over the \u20ac1.1 mark. City experts warned that the pound will remain volatile while the political crisis played out. JP Morgan advised against holding large positions in sterling, while Royal London Asset Management predicted the pound would rise if the Liberal Democrats helped form a new coalition. Goldman Sachs warned that the risk of a no-deal Brexit has risen, but there\u2019s still a possibility that Britain doesn\u2019t leave the EU at all. The 20% slump in the pound since the EU referendum has encouraged overseas investors to buy UK assets, new data showed. Britain\u2019s building sector has suffered a harsh Brexit shock. The latest manufacturing PMI showed that activity shrank again, with new orders tumbling at their fastest rate in a decade. Our Politics Live blog will have all the action from Westminster tonight, as a crunch week for the UK\u2019s future heats up. After a turbulent day, the FTSE 100 share index has closed just 13 points lower at 7268, a drop of 0.2%. UK-focused companies, who are vulnerable to a no-deal Brexit, had a poor day. Housebuilder Persimmon lost 2%, airline group IAG fell by 1.7%, and Lloyds Banking Group fell by 1.5%. Multinational companies, who earn much of their money in foreign currencies, did better. Silver miner Fresnillo rose by 2.4%, while chemicals firm Johnson Matthey gained 1.5%. As a rule, political instability isn\u2019t great for currencies. But today, the news that Boris Johnson has parted company with his majority has pushed the pound higher.... The pound has now recouped all today\u2019s losses, just as Boris Johnson loses his majority in parliament! Sterling is back at $1.207, where it ended last night.... just as Philip Lee MP dramatically leaves his seats among the government benches and joins the opposition Liberal Democrats. That means Johnson\u2019s majority has evaporated, even with the deal with the DUP party. Heads-up: Boris Johnson is about to update MPs about the recent G7 summit. Our Politics Live blog has all the action. Ouch! A second survey of America\u2019s factories is even more grim. The Institute of Supply Management have just reported that US manufacturing actually shrank last month - joining the wider global slowdown. Bosses interviewed for its PMI report found a sharp fall in new orders last month. This is providing the pound with some much-needed support! The dollar is sliding, pushing sterling up to $1.205. But today\u2019s Brexit debate, and vote, could change that..... Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada has drawn up this flowchart, outlining how the UK\u2019s political crisis could play out. She argues that a snap election before 31 October would cut the chances of a no-deal Brexit, and would thus be good for the pound. Assuming a 50/50 coin toss for who wins the election (so much will depend on alliances so it\u2019s the most neutral assumption for now), a Labour-led government would open the way to the most GBP-positive scenario for Brexit (a second referendum \u2013 which we expect would be precondition from LibDems to offer their support). But what about the theory that markets would tumble if Jeremy Corbyn became prime minister, and pushed a left-wing agenda of nationalisation and wealth redistribution? Lignos reckons Brexit is the bigger issue. While we hear a lot of worry on how GBP-negative a Labour-led government would be because of Corbyn\u2019s policies, Labour\u2019s chance of winning an outright majority seems vanishingly slim. Also most clients we speak to prioritise outcome on Brexit over Corbyn\u2019s impact on domestic policy if governing in a coalition. In other news, Donald Trump\u2019s trade war appears to have driven growth across America\u2019s factories down to a 10-year low. Data firm Markit reports that US manufacturing barely expanded last month -- that\u2019s a bad sign, but actually better than the UK or the eurozone which both suffered a contraction. The slump in the pound today is helping to prop up London\u2019s stock market. Shares in multinationals such as building supply firm Ferguson, drinks giant Diageo and chemicals group Johnson Matthey have all risen, as a weaker sterling makes their overseas exports more valuable. But with UK-focused firms like builders and banks falling, the FTSE 100 is down 17 points or 0.25%. On Wall Street, though, the Dow Jones industrial average has lost 1% or 280 points on concerns over the US-China trade war. Deutsche Bank has just told its clients that a general election before 31 October would be the \u201cleast worst\u201d of all the scenarios on the table. They argue it would cut the risk of a no-deal Brexit. Karen Ward, chief market strategist at JP Morgan, thinks investors should keep away from the pound or risk getting badly burned fingers. She believes the pound could rise back to $1.40 if Britain was to leave the EU under a withdrawal agreement, but could plunge to $1.10 in a no deal scenario. So given this \u201cbinary outlook\u201d, it doesn\u2019t make sense to hold large one-way positions in sterling assets. Ward told clients: \u201cMPs return to parliament today on the back of the latest slide in the British pound, which reflects an increase in market jitters around the potential for a no-deal exit. A general election appears increasingly likely, although the events of the last few years have taught us that there is frequently an unforeseen twist in the Brexit tale. If the UK population are indeed sent back to the polls, this will only add to political uncertainty given the complexities in forecasting the result of an election that will clearly be dominated by Brexit. Back in Westminster, government efforts to placate the group of Conservative MPs opposed to a No-Deal seem to have floundered. The group, including former chancellor Philip Hammond, have met Boris Johnson, but say the PM only gave an \u2018unconvincing\u2019 explanation of how a new deal could be agreed in time. That suggests they are likely to support today\u2019s emergency motion which tries to block a disorderly exit. The opposition Labour party, meanwhile, is indicating it won\u2019t vote to trigger an early election until it\u2019s certain that no-deal is off the table. That could make it hard for Johnson to swerve around the Fixed Term Parliament Act..... Investors should also keep a close eye on Edinburgh today, where judges are hearing a court case on whether parliament should be suspended for five weeks. The case was brought by a group of parliamentarians, who argue that Boris Johnson has acted illegally and unconstitutionally by proroguing Parliament ahead of the UK leaving the EU on 31 October. The hearing began dramatically, with the production of a handwritten note showing that Johnson had approved a plan to shut the Commons down back in mid-August. That is well before the plan was made public. If the court rules against the government, it could impose an interim interdict , or injunction, stopping the proroguing of Parliament. That could give MPs more time to vote for a deal, or to block no deal. The pound is changing hands at $1.201 to the US dollar as City traders grab a lunchtime sandwich. This minor recovery from this morning\u2019s slump comes as opposition MPs look for a way to block no-deal on 31 October, before giving their approval for an election. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg has the details: In theory, the pound is a global reserve currency, alongside the euro, the yen, and of course the US dollar. In practice, it is behaving more like an emerging market currency - volatile, vulnerable to political crises, and prone to slumping at the first sight of an alarming headline. This chart shows how sterling volatility has spiked in recent days - back towards levels seen before the 2016 referendum, and in the run-up to the March deadline. That means investors have been taking steps to protect themselves from a juddering lurch in the value of the pound. Trevor Greetham, head of multi asset at Royal London Asset Management, says the threat of a general election just before the Brexit deadline is spooking the City. He\u2019s spotted that the pound is now almost as volatile as the stock market, which is \u201ca very unusual state of affairs for a developed economy.\u201d Greetham predicts more volatility: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to know where sterling will be a few months from now. A disruptive No Deal Brexit could see the pound weaken much further. On the other hand, a delay in Brexit with increased prospects for a deal, or even a referendum with remaining in the EU as an option, could see the pound recover sharply. A General Election would create a further layer of uncertainty for sterling. We learnt in 2017 that opinion polls can shift dramatically during an election campaign. There is little prospect for a new deal with the EU under the short timetable currently available so the markets would probably be forced to factor in a No Deal Brexit under a majority Conservative government. A majority Labour government, on the other hand, would usher in a range of market-unfriendly policies. Arguably the pound would rally most on a hung parliament with centre parties including the Liberal Democrats needed to form a government. After a torrid morning, sterling has suddenly bounced back off the mat. The pound is now back over $1.20 against the US dollar, shaking off much of its earlier slump. But it\u2019s still down on the day, at $1.203, and still at risk of closing at its lowest level since the 1980s. The sudden bounce came as MPs submitted their request for an emergency debate to rule out a no-deal Brexit. This move was expected, of course, but investors may still be encouraged that the \u2018rebel alliance\u2019 are moving fowards. Wall Street titan Goldman Sachs has warned its clients that a no-deal Brexis is a growing risk. Its base case scenario is that a variant of Theresa May\u2019s deal is approved by MPs. But it also believes there\u2019s a possibility that Britain will never leave the EU at all. In a new report, Goldman estimates that: No Deal is a 25% chance, up from 20% No Brexit is a 30% chance, down from 35% Leaving with a deal is a 45% chance - unchanged. Over in Brussels, the European Commission is confirming that the UK side haven\u2019t yet provided \u2018concrete\u2019 proposals to replace the Irish Backstop..... At least the two sides are talking, though.... The pound would plunge below parity with the euro if there is a No Deal Brexit, predicts Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe. He says the \u201cfragile support\u201d created by Boris Johnson\u2019s trips to Paris and Berlin last week have been obliterated by the political drama back in Westminster. \u201cNo-deal risk remains the be all and end all for sterling. Given that sterling\u2019s fall over the past six months has been driven by an increase in the no-deal risk, from an outside possibility to approximately 50% chance today, we estimate that the pound is likely to weaken by around a further 7% if no deal actually happens \u2013 taking GBPUSD to around $1.12 and EURGBP to just below parity. One pound is worth \u20ac1.096 right now, meaning one euro is worth 91.2p, close to last month\u2019s 10-year low. The slump in the pound since the Brexit referendum has helped overseas investors to cherry-pick UK assets. Foreign companies spent \u00a318.4bn buying UK companies in April-June, up from \u00a310.8bn in January-March, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics. These charts show this \u2018inward investment\u2019 jumped after the 2016 vote (which sent the pound down from almost $1.50 to below $1.20 today): Rob Donaldson, RSM\u2019s head of corporate finance says sterling\u2019s weakness is turning UK companies into prey, rather than predators: Given the persistent weakness of sterling overseas acquisition by UK companies is challenging whereas inbound investment from abroad is, despite some of the obvious uncertainties for the UK economy, encouraged by the relatively low multiples in the UK particularly when sterling weakness is taken into account. \u2018Meanwhile UK domestic activity is relatively strong as consolidation is more attractive than new investment, which has been weak. \u2018In the absence of any change in Q3 we would expect these trends to continue for the rest of the year, absent a chaotic \u201cHalloween\u201d Brexit. There\u2019s every danger that the pound will end today at its weakest closing level in 34 years. That would hang over MPs heads as they vote tonight on whether to block no deal by seeking another Brexit extension, a move that could trigger an election next month. The pound is struggling back from the three-year low hit this morning, but it still below the $1.20 mark. The slump in UK construction this year shows there is a desperate need for clarity about Brexit, says Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. He says building firms are suffering badly, because nervous clients aren\u2019t happy about making major sending commitments in the current uncertain climate. \u201cThe sector fell deeper into contraction as continuing uncertainty and a weakened UK economy took a sizeable bite out of this month\u2019s construction activity. Inevitably business confidence followed suit, dropping like a brick to its worst since December 2008 and close to the lowest depth seen in the previous recession. \u201cAs Brexit creeps closer and confusion still reigns, this will undoubtedly heap more pressure on the UK Government to create much-needed clarity in the market. The commercial sector particularly has been devastated by reluctant clients fearful of taking a wrong turn in a confusing landscape and delaying project starts, resulting in the fastest drop in new orders since March 2009. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s construction sector has been hit by a collapse in orders, as Brexit worries hurt building firms. Data firm Markit has just reported that builders suffered the sharpest fall in new business since March 2009 - when Britain had fallen into recession after the financial crisis. Housebuilding, commercial construction and major civil engineering firms all suffered, with business optimism hitting its lowest level since December 2008. Companies reported that Brexit-related uncertainty was encouraging \u201crisk aversion\u201d, and encouraging clients to set tighter budgets. This means building firms are running short of work, if they can\u2019t find enough new business to replace completed projects. This dragged Markit\u2019s construction PMI index down to 45.0 - below the 50-point mark which shows growth. Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit, said \u201cdomestic political uncertainty\u201d is hurting the construction sector......and there could be worse to come. \u201cConcerns about softening demand for new projects resulted in a fall in business optimism across the construction sector to its weakest since December 2008. This provides an early signal that UK construction companies are braced for a protracted slowdown as a lack of new work to replace completed contracts begins to bite over the next 12 months. Yesterday\u2019s manufacturing PMI showed that factory output fell at its fastest pace in seven years last month -- raising fears over the health of the UK economy. The euro is also suffering from the threat of a disruptive Brexit. The single currency has fallen to a 28-month low against the US dollar at $1.092. That\u2019s a reminder that No Deal is seen as bad for both sides. Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale says Brexit uncertainty is \u201creaching new heights\u201d and is dragging the \u201cterrible twins\u201d of sterling and the euro lower. Juckes says we face 48 hours of uncertainty, which could be followed by six weeks of uncertainty (and markets, they say, really don\u2019t like uncertainty). He told clients: The first question that will be answered - today - is whether the rebels can indeed get control of the order paper again. At the moment, it isn\u2019t clear when we might find that out (today is, after all, the first day back for MPs after their summer holidays!). To further muddy waters, a judge in Edinburgh\u2019s Court of Sessions will also be asked for a ruling on whether the Prime Minister is acting illegally in suspending parliament for 5 weeks ahead of the Queen\u2019s Speech on October 14. If we can survive today\u2019s uncertainty, we may move on to a vote tomorrow which will then determine whether the rebels have succeeded in the plan to force the PM to ask for a delay. Whether that vote passes is uncertain, since while there are enough Conservative rebels to win the vote if the opposition supports it, there may be some Labour rebels from Brexiteer constituencies who support the Government. But, if that vote passes, there will almost certainly be a vote as the PM seeks elections instead. Could he win the two-thirds majority needed to force elections? Gain, that\u2019s not certain and after that, there is the biggest uncertainty of all, which is what happens at an election in October. The Conservatives have performed well In opinion polls, at the expense of the Brexit Party, but may not have the4 seats to win outright majority. Shares in UK-focused companies are falling this morning, hit by the threat of a disorderly Brexit. Housebuilders are among the top fallers, with Barratt Development and Berkeley Homes down 1.5%. Online estate agent Rightmove has lost 1.2%, on fears that the property sector would freeze up after No Deal. Banks are also under pressure, with Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group down over 1%. A recession could drive up their bad loans, and hurt demand for credit. Supermarkets could be another Brexit casualty, if disruption at the ports prevents food reaching the shelves. Wm Morrison and Sainsbury are both down 1.2%. There\u2019s been a lot of political drama already today, which is helping to push sterling deeper into the mud. Already: Conservative MP Justine Greening, who opposes a no-deal Brexit, has said she won\u2019t run in the next election, and compared Brexit to a contagious, highly virulent, virus. Former chancellor Philip Hammond has said Boris Johnson is maneuvering for an election, and claimed the PM can\u2019t be trusted not to move the date until after the Brexit deadline. The Daily Telegraph have created quite a stir. It\u2019s reporting that top advisor Dominic Cummings has described negotiations with the EU as as \u201csham\u201d, and that the attorney general has rubbished the idea that the Irish Backstop could be ditched. That undermines Johnson\u2019s claim that MPs would undermine his negotiations if they took a no-deal Brexit off the table. Theresa May\u2019s former chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, has heard similar claims..... Our Politics Live blog has all the details: Newsflash: The pound just fell to $1.1960 against the US dollar, down a whole cent today. Again, that\u2019s the weakest point since October 2016 when sterling suffered a brief, punishing \u2018flash crash\u2019 in the aftermath of the June 2016 referendum. If you strip that flash crash out of the data, the pound hasn\u2019t been quite so weak since 1985. Nervous investors are piling into UK government bonds in a scramble for safety. This has forced prices to record highs, driving the interest rates (or yield) on 10-year gilts down to a record low of 0.384%. That might sound like a vote of confidence in the UK. But actually, it\u2019s due to worries about a general election, and concern about a possible recession. Other government bond yields are also hitting record lows, as investors worry about the health of the global economy (which would be hurt by a disorderly Brexit). Today\u2019s rout means the pound has lost five cents against the US dollar since Boris Johnson became Conservative Party leader in mid-July. How bad could it get for the pound? Much worse, according to some City analysts. Neil Wilson of Markets.com predicts sterling could fall to $1.15, or even $1.10, in the coming weeks. He writes: Ignoring the flash crash [in 2016], we are very much in uncharted waters here. We could feasibly see 1.15 or even 1.10 in the coming weeks if traders decide to move against the pound. Elections are never easy to call \u2013 the risk of Corbyn to UK assets is probably greater than a no-deal Brexit, after all. The outlook for sterling may well worsen if there is an election and will certainly deteriorate if it\u2019s a no-deal. The pound is continuing to slide, and just hit $1.1975 against the US dollar. That takes it below the January 2017 low. Indeed, if you exclude a currency \u201cflash crash\u201d in October 2016, it\u2019s the lowest since 1985! This chart shows just how weak sterling has become in historical terms. The pound is likely to fall further if a snap general election is called, predicts Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada. She told clients: Parliament reconvenes today. While the opposition MPs\u2019 motion is expected to be tabled today, it will only move to a key vote tomorrow if MPs vote today to take control of Commons business \u2013 so a two-step process: vote to take control today, vote on the bill tomorrow (though if the first passes, the second is expected to also). Tory MPs have been told they will be de-selected which some speculate could dissuade younger MPs but with the govt\u2019s majority so tight, the opposition\u2019s hurdle is achievable. The Parliamentary session may start early, but the key vote is expected late tonight (potentially 9.30-10pm according to ITC). If the vote does pass, the vote on a snap election is expected on Thursday. If the vote fails, we expect the probability of no-deal exit to surge (and GBP to fall). The pound is also losing ground against the euro, fast! Sterling has dropped to \u20ac1.096, down nearly half a euro cent this morning. That\u2019s only a two-week low, though (the pound hit \u20ac1.072 in mid-August). If the pound falls much further against the US dollar today, it will hit levels last seen under Margaret Thatcher in 1985! Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound has slumped to its lowest level since January 2017 this morning, as fears of a no-deal Brexit grip the financial markets. Sterling was driven through the $1.20 point in early trading in London. It has shed half a cent to hit $1.1995, its weakest point in 32 months. Traders are shunning the currency, as speculation swirls that Britain could be heading for a general election. The City is hunkering down ahead of a seismic day in Westminster. A group of rebel Conservative MPs are expected to try to block a no-deal Brexit - despite being threatened with deselection, meaning they\u2019d lose their jobs at the next election. Last night, prime minister Boris Johnson pledged that he didn\u2019t want a general election, but sources said last night that a poll could take place on 14 October -- if MPs took control of the House of Commons. Triggering an election would require a vote of no confidence in the government. So, with Brexit due in under 59 days, investors across the globe are worrying that the UK could crash out of the EU without the cushion of a withdrawal agreement. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, explains: At this point, with a slim majority of just one in hand, Johnson cannot afford to lose support from the Conservative Party members. As a result, he is now pressuring Tories to stand next to him at this week\u2019s vote in the House of Commons to deliver Brexit by October 31 with \u2018no ifs or buts\u2019. If not, he is threatening to expulse rebels and to throw a snap election by October 14. As a result, on the final run-up to the critical October 31st deadline, the pound is shaken by more political uncertainties. Cable hit a fresh two-week low on rising tensions among British lawmakers. Traders are now pricing in the possibility of a no-confidence vote this week, a scenario which could get the UK\u2019s political scene uglier than it already is. A snap election would mean that either Johnson receives a mandate to quit the EU with no deal on October 31st, or the Brexit deadline is postponed \u2013 again. Both scenarios justify a weaker pound. A new business survey is expected to show that the UK construction sector contracted last month, adding to worries about the economy. Yesterday we learned that manufacturing activity declined in August, at the fastest pace in seven years, as Brexit uncertainty and the US-China trade war hurt factories. The agenda 9.30am BST: UK construction PMI for August (expected to rise to 45.9 from 44.3, still showing contraction) 3pm BST: US manufacturing PMI for August",

Taking CBD may have helped Glover relax but selling it, Day says, \u201chas been a real whirlwind\u201d.",

Ancestry has more than a billion searchable UK family history records, including censuses from 1841 to1911; the birth, marriage and death indexes from 1837 to 2005; and UK incoming passenger lists from 1878 to 1960. There are also parish records from some counties \u2013 in some places dating back to the 1300s. Ancestry also has many family and historic photographs connected to those family trees that are visible to the public. Hammond discovered this when he was doing his research and spotted something he recognised: an 18th-century painting. At the time, Hammond was studying for an MPhil in theology at the University of Oxford and he spent many hours in the university\u2019s Bodleian library. \u201cI used to sit in one of the lower reading rooms \u2013 that was where the books I was using for my course were shelved. I would sit at a table 10ft away, directly under a painting. I hadn\u2019t paid any attention to the painting even though I had been sitting there for most of a year.\u201d Joseph Trapp had been a professor of poetry at Oxford To his great surprise, this turned out to be a portrait of his eight times great-grandfather, Joseph Trapp, the first professor of poetry at the University of Oxford in 1708. Joseph Trapp had been a fellow of Wadham College, and Hammond discovered the college had a whole room dedicated to him. He was astonished. \u201cI was on a high for the best part of a month,\u201d he says. An etching of the Bodleian Libraries Building on this research, Hammond then discovered further ancestors, not suspecting they had a shared interest: theology. His 10-times great-grandfather, Joseph Trapp\u2019s grandfather John, was born in 1601. John studied the subject at Christ Church, Oxford, later becoming a preacher. John Trapp\u2019s commentaries on the bible were considered humorous and scholarly; some were even republished 200 years later. \u201cI found an etching of him inside one of his books,\u201d says Hammond. Details from inside the library Theology was a common vocation for generations of male Trapps, with several clergymen among their number. Some of their descendants worked on the railways; subsequent generations were in the police force. For centuries, the family was based in Gloucestershire, as Hammond found when he looked through online parish records. His grandmother, whose surname had been Trapp, broke with this when she moved to Norfolk. \u201cFact checking is the most arduous part of the task,\u201d says Hammond. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to take any information for granted.\u201d For instance, some people put incorrect information on their family trees, and he wanted to make sure he wasn\u2019t assuming things were right when they were not. \u201cIt\u2019s about making sure I could connect the people with their records. That was the hardest thing, but it was still easier than I assumed. I think that was the majority of the work,\u201d he says. There is still more he can do, too. \u201cI have gone back to about 1500, but I can\u2019t go much further than that. There are also a couple of names I don\u2019t know much about,\u201d he says. Theology was a common vocation for generations of male Trapps Most of the work he has done so far has been online via Ancestry, but Hammond has become interested enough to explore further afield. \u201cThere is a Trapp coat of arms; my great-grandfather had it. My mother remembers seeing it, but it can only be inherited by the male line. Now I\u2019ve seen it on a memorial in west London, in books, and on a painting in Gloucestershire.\u201d Hammond: \u2018The chances are your family tree is just as fascinating\u2019 Hammond and his mother have spent many hours talking about what he has discovered. Some of his friends are also intrigued, joking about the possibilities of being related to a nobleman. \u201cI think family trees grow out exponentially. The chances are your family tree is just as fascinating, and I think that\u2019s true of pretty much everyone,\u201d he says.

Maike Bohn, co-founder of the3million charity, supporting the estimated 3.2 million EU nationals who need to apply if they wish to remain in the UK after Brexit, was concerned that applicants who were unable to trigger explosions of online outrage were not getting such swift assistance from the Home Office. \u201cFor every high-profile case that gets a happy ending there are hundreds and thousands of people who are neither getting the status they are entitled to nor help from the Home Office to put things right,\u201d she said. One way of avoiding these difficulties would be to tweak the scheme so that EU nationals who were resident in the UK did not have to apply for the right to remain (waiting for Home Office approval of their status) but could simply register their presence here, she added. \u201cThe only way to avoid immense heartache and a Windrush scenario further down the line is for the prime minister to honour his referendum pledge to EU citizens: to put the rights of all EU citizens into law and change the settlement scheme from application to registration.\u201d Concern that the Home Office prioritises cases that have attracted media attention arose last year when ministers were attempting to manage the emerging Windrush scandal, although officials denied reports of a dedicated media case handling team. A Home Office spokesperson said it was encouraging people to call the hotline for applicants who needed help. \u201cWe have contacted Mr Sirieix about his application and he has now been granted settled status. EU settlement scheme statistics confirm that by the end of June not a single person had been refused. EU citizens are our friends, family and neighbours and we want them to stay.\u201d However, applicants have reported 20-minute waits to get through on the helpline, where a recorded message notes that staff are \u201ccurrently experiencing a high volume of calls\u2019. Sirieix, who has appeared on a number of television programmes, said hardly any of his 80 colleagues at the Galvin at Windows restaurant at the Park Lane Hilton in London were British, and added that his experience had made him determined to assist the large number of EU nationals there with their applications.",

His new album, Let Love, his 12th, is full of lush, moving jazz and soul-tinged odes to life, hip-hop, his mother, his 22-year-old daughter, his hope for a future romantic relationship and to God.</p> <p>Common, 47, speaks powerfully about his childhood, growing up on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/08/racial-segregation-chicago-ills-america-too\">Chicago\u2019s notorious</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/08/racial-segregation-chicago-ills-america-too\"> South </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/08/racial-segregation-chicago-ills-america-too\">Side</a>. His parents split when he was a baby, but he maintained regular contact with his father, and his grandmother walked him to school.

Although the drugs and gangs that plagued the neighbourhood were close by, \u201cit wasn\u2019t like every day we were walking around dodging bullets,\u201d Common explains in a laid-back drawl. \u201cThe ultimate thing was that, man, I had something to aspire to.

He read the Bible and the Qur\u2019an, listened to jazz and worked on his craft as an MC. Two years later, he came back with a critically acclaimed second album, Resurrection.

He\u2019s appeared in more than 50 movies \u2013 including a role in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ava-duvernay\">Ava DuVernay</a>\u2019s Selma and in the next 10 years, he says: \u201cI want people to say, \u201cMan, he\u2019s one of the great actors of his generation.\u2019\u201d Calling acting enlightening and therapeutic, he says it has taught him that \u201cwhat\u2019s more important than being cool is telling the truth\u201d.</p> <p>This might sound like so much celebrity puff, but Common credits acting with a profound late-in-life revelation.

Common opens up easily about the recollection: \u201cIt was something I had removed from my thoughts, but through being part of the movie, the situation came to my memory. As a kid I must have felt, \u2018I don\u2019t want nobody to know about this, I don\u2019t wanna get in trouble or get this person in trouble\u2019, so I just didn\u2019t let it exist in my mind.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"06725006f1e26016271d62024bcc53bcfcd58fc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06725006f1e26016271d62024bcc53bcfcd58fc5/0_92_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Common and Stacey Abrams, democratic gubernatorial candidate for Georgia, at a Souls to the Polls rally ahead of the midterm elections in Atlanta, Georgia, 28 October 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Common with Democratic party politician Stacey Abrams at a rally in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lawrence Bryant/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He also wrote about this in his memoir, Let Love Have the Last Word, published earlier this year. \u201cI\u2019ve recently been getting into the mental health of the community and how we deal with some of the issues that are generational [but] we never talk about,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is one of them.\u201d</p> <p>At first reticent to write about the issue \u2013 music was \u201ca safer place\u201d to deal with it, he says \u2013 he discussed it with his mother, who told him something similar had happened in their family. \u201cIt was something people never talked about, but the not talking about it is what allows it to continue,\u201d Common says. He felt it was vital he share his story so that \u201canybody who has experienced [abuse] can feel they don\u2019t have to carry the shame and can figure out a way to get past it and heal\u201d.</p> <p>The topic of healing weighs heavily on the rapper\u2019s mind these days, especially when it comes to race, poverty and US politics. \u201cThere has to be a shift in values,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat can we offer our communities to provide people not only with hope but with practical ways to advance and live a full life?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/02/50-great-tracks-for-september-from-normani-tinariwen-miley-cyrus-and-more\">50 great tracks for September from Normani, Tinariwen, Miley Cyrus and more</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More than a decade ago, he created the Common Ground Foundation, which focuses on empowering high-school students from underserved communities. It is about to open the Art in Motion charter school in Chicago. He is also involved in criminal justice reform initiatives. Since 2017, he has toured California prisons, talking to and performing for inmates. His efforts have been credited with helping pass a bill in California that allows young offenders sentenced to life without parole the opportunity to have their cases reheard.</p> <p>Sitting on his tour bus after his show, Common sips on red wine while showing friends the video for Show Me That You Love, a song about how his relationship with his daughter has evolved. A few years ago, she told him she didn\u2019t think he had been the best father \u2013 he was separated from her mother and away on tour all the time \u2013 and she felt that he didn\u2019t really care about her. At first, Common says, he was defensive, but then they started mending their relationship with the help of therapy.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important that people see there are artists out there who have achieved, but they still have issues they are working through,\u201d he says, explaining why he wants to reveal vulnerability in his music. \u201cThis is why I talk about therapy and mindfulness and meditation in my [new] songs. It\u2019s why I talk about being molested, and my father. The job of the artist is to not always show the accolades.\u201d</p>",

The rapper, who is also an activist and Emmy-winning actor, has a preoccupation with the subject, which he believes should be the driving force behind personal and social change. \u201cMy mother\u2019s love was the first thing I pretty much knew,\u201d he says as we drive to the soundcheck for a gig. His new album, Let Love, his 12th, is full of lush, moving jazz and soul-tinged odes to life, hip-hop, his mother, his 22-year-old daughter, his hope for a future romantic relationship and to God. Common, 47, speaks powerfully about his childhood, growing up on Chicago\u2019s notorious South Side. His parents split when he was a baby, but he maintained regular contact with his father, and his grandmother walked him to school. There he met Mr Brown, a teacher who \u201ctook a lot of pride in what it was to be a black man\u201d. Although the drugs and gangs that plagued the neighbourhood were close by, \u201cit wasn\u2019t like every day we were walking around dodging bullets,\u201d Common explains in a laid-back drawl. \u201cThe ultimate thing was that, man, I had something to aspire to. One of the solutions to the violence that goes on in the inner city is providing young people with something [that makes them] feel valued.\u201d He\u2019s become known for writing conscious rap, but his debut album, Can I Borrow a Dollar, came out in an era when gangsta rap was the genre\u2019s driving force. It depicted a less mature person, particularly on the misogynist track Heidi Hoe. \u201cI definitely put a lot of that down to youth,\u201d Common explains, sounding a bit embarrassed. \u201cIt was \u2018bros before hoes\u2019 \u2013 stuff you\u2019re repeating from your homies when you\u2019re not really thinking for yourself yet.\u201d After the album failed to achieve commercial success, he embarked on a journey of personal and spiritual growth. He read the Bible and the Qur\u2019an, listened to jazz and worked on his craft as an MC. Two years later, he came back with a critically acclaimed second album, Resurrection. It was \u201cas if Common had gone from playing dozens on the corner to standing in as an elder statesman\u201d, declared one critic. \u201c[He was] socially conscious, verbally dexterous and seemingly wise beyond his years.\u201d Clearly, his underwhelming experiences with his first album affected him. \u201cI named the album Resurrection because I felt like I was coming back from the dead,\u201d he says, with a deep belly laugh. \u201cMy ambition initially was driven by wanting to be seen, wanting to be heard \u2013 I wanted to be the dopest. But when I started writing stories about myself I would have people come to me and say, \u2018Wow, your song Retrospect for Life [about abortion] made me decide to have my child.\u2019 When people start telling you how your music has affected them, you know that it has a higher purpose.\u201d The experience taught him that change doesn\u2019t happen unless you make it happen. He applied the same line of thinking to acting, which he began studying in 2001. He\u2019s appeared in more than 50 movies \u2013 including a role in Ava DuVernay\u2019s Selma and in the next 10 years, he says: \u201cI want people to say, \u201cMan, he\u2019s one of the great actors of his generation.\u2019\u201d Calling acting enlightening and therapeutic, he says it has taught him that \u201cwhat\u2019s more important than being cool is telling the truth\u201d. This might sound like so much celebrity puff, but Common credits acting with a profound late-in-life revelation. While filming The Tale, a film about sexual abuse starring Laura Dern, he recalled that he had been molested as a child by a male relative of a family friend. Common opens up easily about the recollection: \u201cIt was something I had removed from my thoughts, but through being part of the movie, the situation came to my memory. As a kid I must have felt, \u2018I don\u2019t want nobody to know about this, I don\u2019t wanna get in trouble or get this person in trouble\u2019, so I just didn\u2019t let it exist in my mind.\u201d He also wrote about this in his memoir, Let Love Have the Last Word, published earlier this year. \u201cI\u2019ve recently been getting into the mental health of the community and how we deal with some of the issues that are generational [but] we never talk about,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is one of them.\u201d At first reticent to write about the issue \u2013 music was \u201ca safer place\u201d to deal with it, he says \u2013 he discussed it with his mother, who told him something similar had happened in their family. \u201cIt was something people never talked about, but the not talking about it is what allows it to continue,\u201d Common says. He felt it was vital he share his story so that \u201canybody who has experienced [abuse] can feel they don\u2019t have to carry the shame and can figure out a way to get past it and heal\u201d. The topic of healing weighs heavily on the rapper\u2019s mind these days, especially when it comes to race, poverty and US politics. \u201cThere has to be a shift in values,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat can we offer our communities to provide people not only with hope but with practical ways to advance and live a full life?\u201d More than a decade ago, he created the Common Ground Foundation, which focuses on empowering high-school students from underserved communities. It is about to open the Art in Motion charter school in Chicago. He is also involved in criminal justice reform initiatives. Since 2017, he has toured California prisons, talking to and performing for inmates. His efforts have been credited with helping pass a bill in California that allows young offenders sentenced to life without parole the opportunity to have their cases reheard. Sitting on his tour bus after his show, Common sips on red wine while showing friends the video for Show Me That You Love, a song about how his relationship with his daughter has evolved. A few years ago, she told him she didn\u2019t think he had been the best father \u2013 he was separated from her mother and away on tour all the time \u2013 and she felt that he didn\u2019t really care about her. At first, Common says, he was defensive, but then they started mending their relationship with the help of therapy. \u201cIt\u2019s important that people see there are artists out there who have achieved, but they still have issues they are working through,\u201d he says, explaining why he wants to reveal vulnerability in his music. \u201cThis is why I talk about therapy and mindfulness and meditation in my [new] songs. It\u2019s why I talk about being molested, and my father. The job of the artist is to not always show the accolades.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Terrance Dicks, who has died aged 84, had a long association with the popular BBC series Doctor Who. He was the show\u2019s script editor from 1968 to 1974, wrote numerous episodes, and adapted more than 50 of the television stories into bestselling novelisations. Published by Target Books, they could reasonably be claimed to have inspired legions of children to take up reading in the 1970s and 80s. A great number of those children became writers too, with Neil Gaiman, Mark Gatiss and Paul Cornell among those acknowledging his influence on them.</p> <p>The books captured the imagination and excitement of the TV scripts and their prose was ambitious yet accessible, broadening the vocabulary of their young readers \u2013 the Doctor\u2019s pockets, for example, were \u201ccapacious\u201d, and \u201cwheezing, groaning\u201d is the closest anyone has got to accurately describing the noise made by the arrival of the Tardis.</p> <p>He also wrote, with Malcolm Hulke, the show\u2019s first ever behind-the-scenes book, The Making of Doctor Who (1972, rewritten by Dicks in 1976), in which he described the Doctor as \u201cnever cruel or cowardly\u201d. This distillation of the hero\u2019s character was so apt that the writer and executive producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/30/doctor-who-steven-moffats-highs-lows-and-time-travelling-hijinks\" title=\"\">Steven Moffat</a> (a fan since childhood) ultimately wrote it into the 50th anniversary episode, The Day of the Doctor (2013), and Peter Capaldi\u2019s valedictory regeneration speech in 2017\u2019s Twice Upon a Time.</p> <p>Dicks had joined Doctor Who as an assistant script editor in 1968, five years into the series. Quickly promoted to script editor, he found himself doing major surgery as stories fell through around him, ultimately co-writing (with Hulke) the second doctor Patrick Troughton\u2019s swansong, the 10-part classic The War Games (1969), which introduced the Doctor\u2019s people, the Time Lords, and so added another layer to the show\u2019s mythology.</p> <p>The first year of the new doctor <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-jon-pertwee-5615100.html\" title=\"\">Jon Pertwee</a> revitalised the ailing series, and Dicks found himself simpatico with the incoming producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2009/oct/12/barry-letts-obituary\" title=\"\">Barry Letts</a>: together the pair introduced <a href=\"http://www.thedoctorwhosite.co.uk/master/roger-delgado/\" title=\"\">Roger Delgado</a> as the Master, a new nemesis for the Doctor, and devised the popular companions Jo Grant (played by Katy Manning) and Sarah Jane Smith (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/apr/20/doctor-who-fantasy\" title=\"\">Elisabeth Sladen</a>).</p> <p>Under the aegis of Letts and Dicks, the show featured killer plastic daffodils (Terror of the Autons, 1971), monsters rising from the sea (The Sea Devils, 1972) and huge maggots (The Green Death, 1973, a dire warning about the dangers of industrial pollution), as Pertwee\u2019s stylish, virtuous Doctor battled ambitiously staged invasions with wit and ingenuity. Dicks was responsible for helping his writers to maintain the Doctor\u2019s moral integrity and mould their scripts into the programme\u2019s notoriously small budget and tricky production schedule.</p> <p>When Dicks, Letts and Pertwee left at the end of Planet of the Spiders (1974), Doctor Who was riding high, winning the Writers\u2019 Guild of Great Britain award for best children\u2019s drama script. Dicks convinced the incoming script editor Robert Holmes that it was traditional for the outgoing incumbent to be commissioned upon departure and so wrote Tom Baker\u2019s opening adventure, Robot (1974), establishing the fourth doctor\u2019s zanier, more unpredictable persona.</p> <p>Unhappy with alterations to his next script, The Brain of Morbius (1976), Dicks decreed that it should \u201cgo out under some bland pseudonym\u201d.

Horror of Fang Rock (1977) is a claustrophobic masterpiece dripping with mordant humour and suspense as a shape-changing alien picks off the well-drawn, dwindling inhabitants of a lighthouse, while State of Decay (1980) is a clever meld of vampire legend and science fiction.</p> <p>The special feature-length episode The Five Doctors (1983) \u2013 Peter Davison by now in the lead role \u2013 is an effective and entertaining 20th anniversary celebration despite Dicks being obliged to include a host of popular monsters, various companions and every incarnation of the central character.

      "body": "<p>\u2018Oh my gosh, I love your dress!\u201d Cara Delevingne stretches out a hand and nods approvingly. It\u2019s an offhand comment, but it still feels like a big compliment coming from someone who has twice been named model of the year at the British Fashion awards, the woman who singlehandedly sold bushy brows to the masses, and who \u2013 for a time \u2013 was so conspicuous that you could barely pick up a magazine without said brows staring back at you. For her part, Delevingne looks laid-back yet pristine, the same way wealthy people do at airports \u2013 sequin top and impractical-for-most white trousers; smudgy, kohl-rimmed eyes that are just the right side of slept in; a loose French plait slung over one shoulder; \u201ccurated\u201d diamond piercings snaking up both ears. She chose her top because it was in the colours of the union jack but, come to think of it, she says, \u201cit could be the American flag couldn\u2019t it ... or, er, French?\u201d</p> <p>However, Delevingne quickly puts the kibosh on the fashion chat, because she is an actor, too \u2013 and seemingly in it for the long haul. Since 2015, the 27-year-old has been on a break from her first career, the one in which the privileged goddaughter of Joan Collins became an unexpectedly relatable icon, ushering in the now ubiquitous pizza-noshing, Insta-friendly model who\u2019s as likely to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/sep/29/cara-delevingne-talks-about-depression-and-alienation-in-interview\">talking about their mental health</a> as they are jumping on a private jet (she once <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/news/a20101/cara-delevingne-chartered-karl-lagerfeld-jet-british-fashion-awards/\">chartered Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s</a> to fly from Austria to London).</p> <p>But while she still has lucrative endorsements with the likes of Burberry, Delevingne\u2019s \u201cit girl\u201d days have given way to a new chapter.

The series marries the growing trend for fantasy TV sagas with an appealing amount of Victoriana and a whodunnit subplot. Delevingne plays Vignette, a faerie exiled from her homeland who ends up at the bottom of an increasingly divided feudal society. Filming took place in Prague, in temperatures of \u201310C. \u201cIt really added to the dire situation in the show,\u201d Delevingne explains. \u201cPlus you get takes done quicker because it\u2019s just too cold!\u201d</p> <p>We meet at a plush London hotel where the launch for the programme is taking place \u2013 PR execs, reporters, foreign press and other assorted people in suits buzzing around a corridor of elegant suites. Delevingne\u2019s here; her co-star Orlando Bloom \u2013 who plays the ornately named Rycroft Philostrate, Cockney detective and Vignette\u2019s love interest \u2013 is on his way. As soon as I ask a question she speaks for a minute, barely drawing breath, keen to show her competence \u2013 and perhaps to steer the conversation away from her much talked-about personal life.</p> <p>She starts with an answer to my question: was she a fan of Game of Thrones, the biggest fantasy series of them all, and the one Carnival Row seems designed to ape? The answer is no (\u201cI didn\u2019t watch it at the time, and then when I got Carnival Row, I was like, that would be too much.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Oh my gosh, I love your dress!\u201d Cara Delevingne stretches out a hand and nods approvingly. It\u2019s an offhand comment, but it still feels like a big compliment coming from someone who has twice been named model of the year at the British Fashion awards, the woman who singlehandedly sold bushy brows to the masses, and who \u2013 for a time \u2013 was so conspicuous that you could barely pick up a magazine without said brows staring back at you. For her part, Delevingne looks laid-back yet pristine, the same way wealthy people do at airports \u2013 sequin top and impractical-for-most white trousers; smudgy, kohl-rimmed eyes that are just the right side of slept in; a loose French plait slung over one shoulder; \u201ccurated\u201d diamond piercings snaking up both ears. She chose her top because it was in the colours of the union jack but, come to think of it, she says, \u201cit could be the American flag couldn\u2019t it ... or, er, French?\u201d However, Delevingne quickly puts the kibosh on the fashion chat, because she is an actor, too \u2013 and seemingly in it for the long haul. Since 2015, the 27-year-old has been on a break from her first career, the one in which the privileged goddaughter of Joan Collins became an unexpectedly relatable icon, ushering in the now ubiquitous pizza-noshing, Insta-friendly model who\u2019s as likely to be talking about their mental health as they are jumping on a private jet (she once chartered Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s to fly from Austria to London). But while she still has lucrative endorsements with the likes of Burberry, Delevingne\u2019s \u201cit girl\u201d days have given way to a new chapter. Having starred in Paper Towns \u2013 adapted from the hit young adult novel \u2013 space epic Valerian, and attention-deficit superhero romp Suicide Squad among other projects, she has showed her range and commitment to acting, even if the latter two films were widely panned. Now she\u2019s on to a new challenge, having landed her first starring role in a TV show, Amazon\u2019s Carnival Row. The series marries the growing trend for fantasy TV sagas with an appealing amount of Victoriana and a whodunnit subplot. Delevingne plays Vignette, a faerie exiled from her homeland who ends up at the bottom of an increasingly divided feudal society. Filming took place in Prague, in temperatures of \u201310C. \u201cIt really added to the dire situation in the show,\u201d Delevingne explains. \u201cPlus you get takes done quicker because it\u2019s just too cold!\u201d We meet at a plush London hotel where the launch for the programme is taking place \u2013 PR execs, reporters, foreign press and other assorted people in suits buzzing around a corridor of elegant suites. Delevingne\u2019s here; her co-star Orlando Bloom \u2013 who plays the ornately named Rycroft Philostrate, Cockney detective and Vignette\u2019s love interest \u2013 is on his way. As soon as I ask a question she speaks for a minute, barely drawing breath, keen to show her competence \u2013 and perhaps to steer the conversation away from her much talked-about personal life. She starts with an answer to my question: was she a fan of Game of Thrones, the biggest fantasy series of them all, and the one Carnival Row seems designed to ape? The answer is no (\u201cI didn\u2019t watch it at the time, and then when I got Carnival Row, I was like, that would be too much. So I just started watching Drag Race.\u201d) She doesn\u2019t wait for the next question, and instead, politely but firmly, explains why she wanted to play Vignette. \u201cI always get an instinct with characters, when I see the way their spirit is \u2026 I have to fight for the role and do everything I possibly can. And Vignette had this \u2013 as a woman she had this strength, [it] was unparalleled. But her strength was her vulnerability. No matter how much she gets knocked down or gets everything taken away from her, she still fights back.\u201d Delevingne then changes tack, speaking simply about the show\u2019s themes. \u201cI think the most important thing about it is the social commentary,\u201d she explains. \u201cI love the love story and the crime thriller, but I think it\u2019s so interesting to see when fantasy really tries to play a part in talking about life. It gives you a different perspective, and it gives people whomaybe want to be ignorant of certain things more of a view as to how things are.\u201d What she\u2019s primarily talking about is Vignette\u2019s status as a refugee, something she hopes will draw attention to the plight of many in the present. \u201cBecause of when it\u2019s set, it could fit the time, but why the hell is it happening now?\u201d she says, brow furrowing. \u201cThat\u2019s the main thing I want people to get from it.\u201d Indeed, while Carnival Row has A Lot Going On for any one series, the constant is a sense of injustice.

      "bodyText": "As he bounded off stage to the tune of Get Ready by the Temptations on Monday night, Jeremy Corbyn told a rally in Salford he would be \u201cdelighted\u201d to fight a general election and beamed: \u201cWe will win!\u201d Eleven miles away, in the Labour heartland of Wigan, there was slightly less enthusiasm. \u201cIt would be a disaster,\u201d said the fish and chip shop owner Andy Mappouridis, 55, during the lunchtime rush. \u201cIt\u2019s the wrong time to have an election. I voted to remain but now we\u2019ve got to get out \u2013 we\u2019ve got no choice. If we choose not to leave we\u2019ve lost all of our bargaining tools.\u201d Dishing up \u00a31.20 cones of chips to a queue of students, Mappouridis said he had always voted Labour but was now politically homeless. \u201cI\u2019m a Labour voter but I wouldn\u2019t vote for any one of them at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t particularly like Boris Johnson but he\u2019s got to go through with it.\u201d Wigan has chosen a Labour MP in every general election since 1918 but the town voted strongly (63.9%) to leave the European Union in 2016, rejecting the party\u2019s campaign to remain. In May\u2019s European elections, a resounding 41% of voters backed the Brexit party, pushing Labour into second place as it shed almost one-fifth of its vote compared with 2014. The town\u2019s MP, Lisa Nandy, has warned Labour against taking an unequivocally pro-EU stance, describing it as a \u201cfinal breach of trust\u201d with working-class voters, but has expressed concern about the damage a no-deal Brexit would do to Wigan, with its ageing population and high proportion of small to medium-sized businesses. As Labour has moved gradually towards backing a second referendum, Nandy has braced herself for a backlash at the polls. However, she has a sizeable majority of more than 16,000 votes and believes the impact of the government\u2019s spending cuts will convince many voters not to desert her party. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be at all complacent because I think the frustration with Labour is very evident,\u201d she said on Tuesday. \u201cBut I think people would look beyond Brexit and consider issues like crime and healthcare and that would put us in a firmer position.\u201d Setting up his flower stall on Wigan\u2019s outdoor market, Dave Martin said he was \u201csick to the bloody teeth of it\u201d when asked about a possible imminent election. The 62-year-old, from nearby Chorley, stopped voting for Labour 10 or 15 years ago \u2013 ending a family tradition stretching back to his grandfather \u2013 because he felt the party was no longer \u201cfor working people\u201d.

      "body": "<h2>SHEARER/OWEN</h2> <p>We\u2019d all like to bring back the 90s. The Fiver was only a twinkle in a web developer\u2019s eye back then, but it would have been nice to see what all the fuss was about. About a year ago the 90s were apparently back \u201cin\u201d and why not? This tea-timely email always thought it\u2019d look good with curtains and wouldn\u2019t mind finding out what an Aftershock tastes like. Sadly that\u2019s a word appropriate to the day\u2019s major ruction on Social Media Disgrace Twitter. Think fondly of those balmy summer nights during France 98, when Britannia was cool? Hold that thought because \u2013 in a development entirely appropriate to the wider news cycle \u2013 the climate two decades on has become decidedly stormy.</p> <p>Alan Shearer and Michael Owen have morphed from fresh-faced bearers of a country\u2019s dreams to persuasive arguments for a more prominent mute button. If all publicity is good publicity then we can expect Owen\u2019s new book to soar up the charts when it comes out on Friday; as it is, the escalating feud between the former Newcastle centre-forwards is evolving very much in real time, so excuse us if we missed a bit. \u201cPerhaps rather than examine his own shortcomings, it felt easier to blame Michael Owen,\u201d Owen had third-personed to a ghostwriter. He was referring to the end of the 2008-09 season, when Shearer couldn\u2019t keep Newcastle up and \u2013 according to Owen \u2013 cast doubts on his assertion that he wasn\u2019t fully fit for the relegation decider at Aston Villa, suggesting he might have been eyeing his next payday. \u201cSadly, this feud has continued to the present day,\u201d Owen chirped. \u201cThe more I think about it, the more I understand why Alan behaves the way he does and continues to spread negativity about me whenever he can.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/15/small-talk-michael-owen\">Michael Owen: \u2018I don\u2019t watch films. I just can\u2019t get into them\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Surely Shearer was well equipped to take a childish jibe in his stride? Displaying deft-cutting room skills as well as a disturbing aptitude for digging out past bons mots, Big Al <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alanshearer/status/1168818634568994818\">took to the social stage</a> with a clip of Owen baring his soul in a TV studio last season. \u201cAll I did for the last six, seven years of my career, I hated it. I couldn\u2019t wait to retire for most of the back end of my career,\u201d he parped, Shearer captioning it with: \u201cYes Michael, we thought that also, whilst on \u00a3120k a week \u2026\u201d Checkmate? Not a bit of it. Owen had mud of his own freshly prepared, and fling it he did. \u201cNot sure you are as loyal to Newcastle as you make out mate,\u201d he honked, fingers no doubt struggling to keep up with the giddy excitement <a href=\"https://twitter.com/themichaelowen/status/1168822808614526976\">of getting this pearler on record</a>. \u201cI distinctly remember you being inches away from signing for Liverpool after Sir Bobby Robson put you on the bench. You tried everything to get out.\u201d</p> <p>Not quite the Gallagher brothers, but still. At this point a ding-dong between England\u2019s old striking master and apprentice might have seemed a bit rich for everyone\u2019s blood. So stand by for a positively gout-inducing intervention by their grandfather in goalscoring lineage, Gary Lineker, who weighed in with an \u201cAwkward\u201d and a laugh-crying emoji that didn\u2019t exactly lighten the mood. \u201cAre you surprised he\u2019s manipulated a tiny part of an honest answer to aim a cheap dig at me? Most ex-players I\u2019ve spoken to aren\u2019t,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/themichaelowen/status/1168833805093875717\">continued Owen</a>, by now seemingly happy to drag in whoever he jolly-well wanted. Even Henry Winter sidled in. \u201cTheir dispute demeans both, demeans Newcastle and demeans England,\u201d he Helen Lovejoyed. \u201cPlease get together, sort your differences and call a truce.\u201d The Fiver still has its popcorn at the ready and nervously awaits the shattering of more sepia-tinted dreams \u2026</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d25e5d78a959ceb582d08d416e876179425f7d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d25e5d78a959ceb582d08d416e876179425f7d2/0_94_2022_2674/756.jpg\" alt=\"The full Goal premiere shot from 2005 in all its flared glory.\" width=\"756\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The full Goal premiere shot from 2005 in all its flared glory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Niall McVeigh for hot MBM coverage of Norway 2-2 England in their women\u2019s international friendly from 5pm BST</a>.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cTo be in the top 1% you have to be prepared to do what 99% of the rest won\u2019t do.

While I appreciated your summary of certain major moves (yesterday\u2019s Fiver), how could you have missed Augsburg\u2019s recent acquisition, via loan from Leverkusen, of defender Tin Jedvaj? Moreover, why didn\u2019t you buy Mr Jedvaj yourselves? I don\u2019t know what the transfer budget is at Fiver Towers FC, but I\u2019d have thought Tin would have filled most of your squad\u2019s pressing needs\u201d \u2013 R Reisman.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8ac44459d879ae81f587ec20593f4a0ac0b89e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8ac44459d879ae81f587ec20593f4a0ac0b89e1/0_152_2970_2276/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tin Jedvaj, left, rocks up at Augsburg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"766\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tin Jedvaj, left, rocks up at Augsburg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: APA-PictureDesk GmbH/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSo, Noble Francis is a fan of a recital of classical music (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters)?

Rather than journey from the south coast to Manchester and watch the City match at the weekend, I drove to a popular Swedish store to buy felt pads to protect my floors.

He was referring to the end of the 2008-09 season, when Shearer couldn\u2019t keep Newcastle up and \u2013 according to Owen \u2013 cast doubts on his assertion that he wasn\u2019t fully fit for the relegation decider at Aston Villa, suggesting he might have been eyeing his next payday. \u201cSadly, this feud has continued to the present day,\u201d Owen chirped. \u201cThe more I think about it, the more I understand why Alan behaves the way he does and continues to spread negativity about me whenever he can.\u201d Surely Shearer was well equipped to take a childish jibe in his stride? Displaying deft-cutting room skills as well as a disturbing aptitude for digging out past bons mots, Big Al took to the social stage with a clip of Owen baring his soul in a TV studio last season. \u201cAll I did for the last six, seven years of my career, I hated it. I couldn\u2019t wait to retire for most of the back end of my career,\u201d he parped, Shearer captioning it with: \u201cYes Michael, we thought that also, whilst on \u00a3120k a week \u2026\u201d Checkmate? Not a bit of it. Owen had mud of his own freshly prepared, and fling it he did. \u201cNot sure you are as loyal to Newcastle as you make out mate,\u201d he honked, fingers no doubt struggling to keep up with the giddy excitement of getting this pearler on record. \u201cI distinctly remember you being inches away from signing for Liverpool after Sir Bobby Robson put you on the bench. You tried everything to get out.\u201d Not quite the Gallagher brothers, but still. At this point a ding-dong between England\u2019s old striking master and apprentice might have seemed a bit rich for everyone\u2019s blood. So stand by for a positively gout-inducing intervention by their grandfather in goalscoring lineage, Gary Lineker, who weighed in with an \u201cAwkward\u201d and a laugh-crying emoji that didn\u2019t exactly lighten the mood. \u201cAre you surprised he\u2019s manipulated a tiny part of an honest answer to aim a cheap dig at me? Most ex-players I\u2019ve spoken to aren\u2019t,\u201d continued Owen, by now seemingly happy to drag in whoever he jolly-well wanted. Even Henry Winter sidled in. \u201cTheir dispute demeans both, demeans Newcastle and demeans England,\u201d he Helen Lovejoyed. \u201cPlease get together, sort your differences and call a truce.\u201d The Fiver still has its popcorn at the ready and nervously awaits the shattering of more sepia-tinted dreams \u2026 LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Niall McVeigh for hot MBM coverage of Norway 2-2 England in their women\u2019s international friendly from 5pm BST. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cTo be in the top 1% you have to be prepared to do what 99% of the rest won\u2019t do. In my line of work I know nobody even comes near. Not everything in life is black and white and you have to be able to adapt and roll with the punches. Now Bobby Duncan has the opportunity to live and experience something not many young English players have done. That\u2019s what leaders do\u201d \u2013 Saif Rubie, the new Fiorentina forward\u2019s understated Mr 15%, after that transfer from Liverpool. RECOMMENDED LOOKING David Squires on \u2026 the Premier League story so far. You can also get your own copy. RECOMMENDED LISTENING Football Weekly be here now. Meanwhile, the live shows are heading to Manchester and Leeds. FIVER LETTERS \u201cI finally followed your link and read Big Website\u2019s comprehensive list of summer transfers from Europe\u2019s top five leagues. While I appreciated your summary of certain major moves (yesterday\u2019s Fiver), how could you have missed Augsburg\u2019s recent acquisition, via loan from Leverkusen, of defender Tin Jedvaj? Moreover, why didn\u2019t you buy Mr Jedvaj yourselves? I don\u2019t know what the transfer budget is at Fiver Towers FC, but I\u2019d have thought Tin would have filled most of your squad\u2019s pressing needs\u201d \u2013 R Reisman. \u201cSo, Noble Francis is a fan of a recital of classical music (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters)? An increasingly expensive form of entertainment out of the financial reach of the working classes, he was probably glad of the break from the Premier League to attend the Proms\u201d \u2013 Keiron Fulop. \u201cUnlike Noble Francis, I am a relatively unreconstructed and uncultured so and so. Rather than journey from the south coast to Manchester and watch the City match at the weekend, I drove to a popular Swedish store to buy felt pads to protect my floors. Consequently I travelled a long way for something that started off quite promising, yet in the end got cut to pieces and has ended up near the bottom of the table. Perhaps I should\u2019ve gone to see Brighton instead?\u201d \u2013 Tony Crawford. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Tony Crawford. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Greater Manchester police have started a fraud inquiry which is believed to be into the crisis that led to Bury\u2019s expulsion from the Football League. Alexis S\u00e1nchez insists he has no regrets about his underwhelming time at Old Trafford. \u201cI\u2019m very happy I went to Manchester United,\u201d cheered the Chilean, who has reportedly been trousering a cool \u00a3400,000 a week for his troubles. Spurs\u2019 Christian Eriksen wishes he had more control of his future after missing out on a move to Spain this summer. \u201cI wish I could decide myself, like you can do in Football Manager, but I can\u2019t do that sadly,\u201d he sighed. PSG procured Mauro Icardi late on Monday night, wrapping up a season\u2019s loan from Inter. \u201cI am going to give my heart and soul to help my new team go as far as possible in all the competitions,\u201d he tooted.

The show, based at a vast space at La Villette before it arrives at the Saatchi Gallery in London in November, has beaten France\u2019s previous record of 1.2 million visitors in 1967 for a much smaller Tutankhamun exhibition at the Petit Palais. The visitor numbers can be explained in part by the exhibition\u2019s run exceeding five months and special extended late-night openings to meet demand. More than 130,000 tickets had been sold before doors opened in March. But French cultural commentators said the record-breaking turnout also testified to an enduring fascination with the Egyptian pharaoh\u2019s tomb as well as the notion of life after death. The show features the largest number of Tutankhamum treasures ever to leave Egypt and it will be the last time they can be seen on tour before they are permanently displayed at the vast new Grand Egyptian Museum near the pyramids of Giza. One key attraction in the exhibition is the guardian statue that guarded the burial chamber. The 150 objects on show include a gold inlaid miniature coffin that contained the king\u2019s liver after it was removed during the mummification process, a gilded wooden bed with carved lion feet, probably made specially for Tutankhamun\u2019s funeral, and a gilded wooden shrine showing intimate scenes of royal domestic harmony.

In Norway you can search online for the income and tax paid by any other taxpayer in the country. The idea was that openness would build trust in the tax system, and reduce things like gender inequalities in wages, and it\u2019s pretty successful. But there are downsides too \u2013 we naturally make comparisons with other people, and there is dissatisfaction when people discover their colleagues or neighbours are paid more, and even occasional reports of playground bullying of the children of less affluent parents. So there\u2019s a trade-off in complete openness with money.</p> <h2>How good are we at making financial decisions? Is there a way to rewire our brains to make better choices?</h2> <p>The mind is fantastic at doing stuff that over the millennia has helped us survive, and one of the ways it does that is by using mental short-cuts, heuristics, to make sense of the world quickly. This allows us to make speedy decisions that are generally good enough for our purposes, but aren\u2019t always perfectly accurate. In the new and fairly abstract world of financial decision making, we can misapply these rules of thumb, which can lead us to making decisions that go against our best interests.</p> <p>So it\u2019s not a case of rewiring the brain as much as understanding the wiring we\u2019re born with, and taking into account the systematic ways it can lead us in the wrong direction.</p> <h2>Do people generally fall into the same financial traps, or is everyone different?</h2> <p>Most of the academic research has focused on the similarities in people\u2019s decisions, and there are lots of interesting ways in which we all tend to get things wrong in the same way. But I\u2019m also interested in how people differ with their finances. In my research I\u2019ve found that people believe others\u2019 preferences are much more similar to their own than they actually are, and often can\u2019t imagine anyone making a different choice from the one they would make. I\u2019ve worked extensively with the BBC and have been able to ask various financial questions to over a quarter of a million people on their website, which gives some insights into the breadth and variety of decisions people make.</p> <p>This variability also extends to how people deal with their financial circumstances \u2013 I\u2019ve looked at debt and seen that you can get two people with almost identical monetary issues, but one doesn\u2019t give it much thought at all while the other lies awake at night worrying about it. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard to give one-size-fits-all financial advice \u2013 people are so different. What can be more useful is for us to develop the skills to understand our own preferences and ways of thinking about money, and use that to make decisions to fit our specific aims.</p> <h2>What\u2019s the biggest mistake people make in their financial decisions?</h2> <p>It\u2019s hard to give one single mistake, but a general area is that we tend to overweigh the present and focus less on the future than we should. It\u2019s understandable because the future is less concrete and salient than the present, and deferring gratification is a struggle. But as a species we are unique in being able to mentally travel through time and imagine the experience of the future. I and other researchers have shown several techniques that can use this to give more weight to our future selves and help save more for them.</p> <h2>Why do you think so few people actually know how to make our finances go further? It is a lack of education, an unwillingness to learn, or a combination of the two? Is there an answer to this?</h2> <p>There\u2019s certainly a dearth of financial training in schools, although this is starting to change. Most of the current education is in basic numeracy, which is a good start, but several specific issues like inflation and interest compounding are things that even adults struggle with, and understanding one\u2019s relationship with money is rarely covered. Although money isn\u2019t the be all and end all, having enough to meet your needs is a major factor in happiness, and consumers are often up against financial institutions that know all the tricks in the book to extract money from their customers.</p> <h2>Can you talk a bit about your background, and your expertise in this area? What inspired you to research financial decision making?</h2> <p>My background is in cognitive psychology, so I\u2019m interested more generally in the way the mind packages up the world in order to help us make better decisions. I\u2019ve worked on academic projects on financial decision making for over 15 years, looking at a range of things such as the challenges of providing automated financial advice, understanding how people think about debt, and how they decide \u2013 and sometimes fail \u2013 to save rather than spend. I\u2019ve also worked on projects with commercial and government clients to look at behavioural factors in things like taxpayer behaviour, financial product selection, inertia in taking action over finances, and so on.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been teaching on the MSc Behavioural Economics programme at City, University of London, since we founded it five years ago, and have been lucky enough to supervise a fascinating range of projects from students across the world: encouraging pension saving in Indonesia, valuing of quality of life in US palliative care, or looking at the effects of contactless payment on overspending in central London eateries.</p> <p>I think my main inspiration was that it is such a wide-ranging and often counterintuitive area for research. I look at my own financial decisions and wonder why I made the choice I did in the heat of the moment, and that can lead to new research questions. It is also the fact that I\u2019ve always had a niggling sense that a lot of the advice and policymaking in the financial sector seems to treat us as if we\u2019re logical decision-making automata, which isn\u2019t good. This is sometimes a focus on the economic rather than the psychological aspects of personal finance, which can feel like telling someone who wants to lose weight that they just need to eat less: factually correct but largely useless in helping reach a goal.</p> <p>I think we can help a lot more by understanding the psychology as well as the economics of personal finance, and that\u2019s underpinned much of the research I\u2019ve done so far.</p> <h2>Could you talk about your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/2019/jun/04/money-and-the-mind-how-to-make-better-financial-decisions-stian-reimers-culture-business-course\">upcoming masterclass</a>?

I have longed to read of how she might have written about choosing names for her sons that connect them to their origins without making them an unpronounceable laughing stock at school or teased for sounding like terrorists, or how she deliberates over which parts of her inherited culture she might choose to ignore. It\u2019s not always easy to talk about these things in parenting groups because first, where do you begin, and second, in my experience at least, even those can feel isolating (I once gatecrashed a National Childbirth Trust group before realising that it wasn\u2019t for me, that being the only woman of south Asian origin there made me feel more and not less alone). Perhaps these are my own insecurities to overcome, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only one who feels that motherhood can sometimes seem even more overwhelming when you\u2019re caught halfway, juggling layers of cultures and religions and obligations and judgments in a way which perhaps the white narrative of mainstream motherhood doesn\u2019t always have to.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/31/ruth-davidson-departs-to-focus-on-family-her-decision\">Ruth Davidson departs  to focus on family.  That decision is only hers to make | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I have longed to read about all of this, but I\u2019ve not found it, so I\u2019m writing a little bit about it in my second book instead. But this too is not easy. There are other reasons why it\u2019s hard to find memoirs on motherhood by women of colour. Put simply: it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/09/diversity-publishing-new-faces\" title=\"\">already hard enough to be published</a> if you\u2019re a writer of colour. It\u2019s also <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/08/sally-rooney-and-hazards-writing-while-female/596218/\" title=\"\">harder if you\u2019re a woman</a>. Harder too if you\u2019re a mother, battling for the time to write and raise a family. Put it all together \u2013 a woman writer of colour who is also a mother \u2013 and our odds of being published are slim. Perhaps this is why our personal stories and memoirs about how we navigate the mess and the joy of motherhood will rarely be told.</p> <p>But it matters. It matters because while motherhood is so intense and so intimate it is also wildly universal; after all, even if we\u2019ve not all given birth we have all been born. Motherhood is, in this very simple way, naturally inclusive, which is why it\u2019s all the more important to make sure that the books on the subject are too. For the more perspectives we read, the more empathy we might have towards mothers of all backgrounds, all colours. The more we might even come to understand what this immense, magnificent thing called motherhood really is.</p> <p>\u2022 Huma Qureshi is a former Guardian staff writer and now a freelance features writer</p>",

It\u2019s not always easy to talk about these things in parenting groups because first, where do you begin, and second, in my experience at least, even those can feel isolating (I once gatecrashed a National Childbirth Trust group before realising that it wasn\u2019t for me, that being the only woman of south Asian origin there made me feel more and not less alone). Perhaps these are my own insecurities to overcome, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only one who feels that motherhood can sometimes seem even more overwhelming when you\u2019re caught halfway, juggling layers of cultures and religions and obligations and judgments in a way which perhaps the white narrative of mainstream motherhood doesn\u2019t always have to. I have longed to read about all of this, but I\u2019ve not found it, so I\u2019m writing a little bit about it in my second book instead. But this too is not easy. There are other reasons why it\u2019s hard to find memoirs on motherhood by women of colour. Put simply: it is already hard enough to be published if you\u2019re a writer of colour. It\u2019s also harder if you\u2019re a woman. Harder too if you\u2019re a mother, battling for the time to write and raise a family. Put it all together \u2013 a woman writer of colour who is also a mother \u2013 and our odds of being published are slim. Perhaps this is why our personal stories and memoirs about how we navigate the mess and the joy of motherhood will rarely be told. But it matters. It matters because while motherhood is so intense and so intimate it is also wildly universal; after all, even if we\u2019ve not all given birth we have all been born. Motherhood is, in this very simple way, naturally inclusive, which is why it\u2019s all the more important to make sure that the books on the subject are too. For the more perspectives we read, the more empathy we might have towards mothers of all backgrounds, all colours. The more we might even come to understand what this immense, magnificent thing called motherhood really is. \u2022 Huma Qureshi is a former Guardian staff writer and now a freelance features writer",

Trade union officials accused Diageo of \u201cinsatiable corporate greed\u201d after serving notice of strikes on the company, which declined to improve on a final offer of a 2.8% pay rise for workers in Scotland. Of the 1,000 Diageo staff represented by the GMB union in Scotland, more than 80% had voted to strike unless the company improved its terms. GMB Scotland said it expected Diageo\u2019s bottling, maturing and distillery sites to be severely affected as a result of a rolling 10-day programme of walkouts that will run from 17-27 September. Affected sites including the Talisker, Royal Lochnagar and Blair Athol distilleries as well as the Cameronbridge and Leven plants in Fife and another in Shieldhall near Glasgow. But sources close to Diageo indicated they expected business to continue as usual because only about a third of its 3,000 staff in Scotland are unionised. The GMB\u2019s Scotland organiser, Keir Greenaway, said: \u201cStrike action across Diageo\u2019s Scottish operations is a consequence of the insatiable corporate greed within the hierarchy of this company. \u201cOur campaign for a pay deal that beats the cost of living for our members and their families is a modest proposal against the backdrop of Diageo\u2019s absolutely staggering financial results, which workers in Scotland have more than helped to deliver.\u201d The GMB pointed to Diageo\u2019s pretax profits of more than \u00a34.2bn, a share buyback plan worth \u00a34.5bn to investors and a 30% pay rise for the chief executive, Ivan Menezes, which took his annual remuneration to \u00a311.7m. \u201cA huge chunk of Diageo\u2019s credibility and success is built on the back of Scotland and the working-class and rural communities that distil, mature, store and bottle their lucrative range of whiskies and white spirits,\u201d said Greenaway. \u201cIf any business can afford to make work pay for its employees it is Diageo. \u201cA rising tide should lift all boats but instead we have to suffer the grotesque spectacle of [chief executive] Ivan Menezes and his shareholders carving up the spoils while workers in Scotland get thrown scraps from the fat cats\u2019 table. \u201cIt\u2019s just not credible and we aren\u2019t going to leave this unchallenged.

      "bodyText": "A student who triggered an armed police response when he brandished a fake gun on a university campus has been jailed for eight months. Yihe Xiong, 25, took the realistic-looking imitation Beretta pistol into a University of Exeter building where he was due to give a presentation. He told students he had 12 bullets and claimed that if the presentation went badly he would open fire. Part of the Streatham campus, the university\u2019s largest site in Exeter, was evacuated and armed police were deployed. Xiong, who was studying a master\u2019s degree in computer studies, admitted possession of an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence. He told Exeter crown court that it was a prank or joke. But sentencing him to prison, Judge Peter Johnson said: \u201cIt was a calculated act of breathtaking stupidity.\u201d The judge said terrified students did not know if someone was about to go on a \u201ckilling spree\u201d and praised police for their actions. Johnson said: \u201cYou are academically gifted but socially awkward and did this to impress and be admired.\u201d He said there had been a number of incidents in schools and on campuses in other countries and he said he failed to understand how Xiong could have thought what he was doing was simply a joke. The court was told Xiong was from a respectable family in China, where his father was a judge. Herc Ashworth, prosecuting, said Xiong took the fake pistol into to the Amory building in June and was chatting to three other students when he produced the black handgun and waved it in the face of one of them. Xiong said he had 12 bullets in the gun. He said: \u201cIf the presentation goes badly I am just going to open fire.\u201d He said it was a real gun and pointed it at another student, calling him a target. One of the students told a tutor, who called police. Officers quickly arrived at the Devon campus. After he was arrested Xiong said he had been kidding and he had no grudge against his classmates. Brian FitzHerbert, in mitigation, said the student had won a scholarship to study for a PhD in Canada and his parents had been left \u201cutterly distraught\u201d. The court was told he had been told to leave the university and his hopes of becoming a software developer had been ruined. FitzHerbert said Xiong had not been motivated by malice or cruelty but had shown a lack of judgment, wrongly believing he was being \u201ccool, daring and funny\u201d. He pleaded for a last chance for Xiong saying he had no previous convictions and was an \u201cimpeccable and immaculate\u201d character. At a previous hearing, his solicitor, Caroline Salvatore, said: \u201cHe is a Chinese \u2018hooray Henry\u2019. He is full of loud japes of dubious decision but absolutely no ill will.\u201d",

A secret list of those most likely to be complicit has been sent to the UN. The UN report will very likely be used as further evidence for those demanding that the British government end arms sales to Saudi for use in Yemen. \u201cThis shocking report should act as a wake-up call to the UK government. It offers all the proof needed of the misery and suffering being inflicted on the people of Yemen by a war partly fuelled by UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia and other coalition members,\u201d said Oxfam\u2019s Yemen country director, Muhsin Siddiquey. The UK court of appeal on 20 June ruled that arms sales to Saudi Arabia have continued without proper UK investigation of the risk of war crimes being committed by the Saudi-led coalition and required the UK government to set out what it had done to rectify this. The UK government is due to provide its response, possibly this month. The British government, in defending sales to Saudi Arabia, is largely dependent on a team set up by Saudi Arabia to review alleged coalition violations, but its credibility is repeatedly challenged by the UN report. The UN panel, which includes a Briton, Charles Garraway, found the Saudi team had failed to hold anyone accountable for any strike killing civilians, raising \u201cconcerns as to the impartiality of its investigations\u201d. It also described the Saudi assessment of the targeting process as \u201cparticularly worrying, [since] it implies that an attack hitting a military target is legal, notwithstanding civilian casualties, hence ignoring the principle of proportionality\u201d. Airstrikes by the Saudi-led military coalition in south-west Yemen on Sunday hit a prison complex, killing scores of people, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Set up by the UN human rights council two years ago, the panel appears determined to introduce some individual accountability into the conduct of the war. Yemeni government forces, including those backed by the UAE, continue to arbitrarily detain, threaten and otherwise target individuals who openly questioned or criticised them, including political opponents, journalists, human rights defenders and religious leaders, the report said.

With Dulcamara in all-American getup, cutting a Colonel Sanders sort of figure with Mephistophelean black hair and a tall, white Stetson, Shore \u2013 who made his Met debut in this role \u2013 was a big presence, every bit the showman. Robert Lewis was the hapless Nemorino, his tenor strong and forthright, and words super-clear \u2013 if too unvaried in tone. His rival, Sergeant Belcore, was sung with bluster by Matthew Durkan. Claire Lees portrayed the sassy but fickle Adina, her sound bright, her phrasing graceful. \u2022Further performances on 6 and 7 September.",

      "body": "<p>\u2018Do you have a nemesis?\u201d I asked the two men, friends of my flatmate, to whom I had just been introduced. We were at a gig, waiting for the band to come on. My flatmate wordlessly assumed an apologetic air, but one of his friends seized on my question like he thought I would never ask.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, without any hesitation. I could almost see the face of his nemesis in his eyes, reflected in the stage lights. \u201cHe\u2019s a social worker.\u201d</p> <p>The other friend ummed, and ahhed, and cast his mind back to everyone he had ever met \u2013 including me, just now \u2013 before deciding that the closest he had had to a nemesis was a former colleague with whom he hadn\u2019t got on very well, but even they had turned out all right in the end, so the answer was no, not really.</p> <p>For some months, I had been asking the same question of everyone with whom I had come into contact. I was writing <a href=\"https://www.hodder.co.uk/titles/elle-hunt/why-everyone-needs-a-nemesis/9781529352931/\" title=\"\">a short book</a> about the unexpected upsides of having a nemesis, and had come to recognise these as representative responses. Either your nemesis leapt to mind with an immediacy that suggested they were never far from there in the first place \u2013 or you tried to conjure one out of politeness to appease your friend\u2019s intense flatmate.</p> <p>As is no doubt obvious from my question, I belong firmly in the first camp. As an ambitious, occasionally petty person, I have long understood that the power to motivate myself lies in an imagined competition with people who probably don\u2019t think of me at all.</p> <p>At the time of writing I have four nemeses. Three were formed at old jobs, over professional slights or disagreements that are intensely felt but tedious to explain; they themselves are oblivious. The fourth knows what she did.</p> <p>Yes, it is juvenile, and petty, and revealing of other character traits that are collectively and euphemistically described as \u201ccomplex\u201d. Owning up to having nemeses certainly doesn\u2019t win you any friends \u2013 but it\u2019s a suspiciously anodyne person who really likes everyone they meet. In February this year, <a href=\"https://www.totaljobs.com/insidejob/work-enemies/\" title=\"\">a Totaljobs survey of more than 7,000 British workers</a> found that 62% said they had an \u201coffice enemy\u201d, running the gamut from minor irritant to bully. Horrifyingly, nearly 300 people said that their nemesis <em>clipped their toenails</em> at work.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/feb/25/the-joy-of-pettiness-why-everyone-needs-an-office-nemesis\" title=\"\">As I wrote at the time</a>, I see my embrace of nemeses as fairly harmless. Picking a colleague to serve as your antagonist makes your life more like a sitcom, and less like wage slavery on the slow march towards death. And if they really are your antagonist, so much the better (so long as it is kept in check). In embracing the rivalry, you can unlock its potential benefits, and possibly, actually win.</p> <p>In sport, harnessing the power of competition to improve performance is well known. <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550614539770\" title=\"\">A 2014 study of long-distance runners</a> found that those who recalled a rival reported significantly higher motivation than those who did not. Competing against a rival led to significantly faster times: an improvement of nearly five seconds a kilometre. Runners could be expected to run a five-kilometre race roughly 25 seconds faster if they were competing against one of their rivals than if they weren\u2019t.</p> <p>Prof Brian Uzzi, an expert on leadership and social networks at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Illinois, says there are parallels with work and creativity. \u201cThe good kind of nemesis can really drive motivation, help you reach further, let you see the possibility to do things that you couldn\u2019t before \u2013 things that might have been impossible. And all of that, to me, means opportunity in life.\u201d</p> <p>Moreover, says Uzzi, a nemesis is somewhat inevitable once you reach a certain level in your career. \u201cAs you progress, your reputation builds and the probability of having someone that will be a nemesis also grows \u2013 either because your success is a threat to theirs or because, as you grow in authority, people become more critical of your behaviour.\u201d</p> <p>In June he published the results of his <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/06/190617125133.htm\" title=\"\">two-year study of day traders</a>, which showed that not only did they gravitate towards having a balance of friends and enemies in their professional networks, but that their performance improved when they achieved it. People look to be friends with their friend\u2019s friend and the enemy of their enemy, and to oppose their friend\u2019s enemy and their enemy\u2019s ally.</p> <p>When those conditions are met, according to a framework called structural-balance theory reinforced by Uzzi\u2019s study, a network is considered balanced \u2013 not, I note, when there are no enemies at all. It can be hard to push yourself in a vacuum; it is quite a bit easier to want to do better than the guy clipping his toenails.</p> <p>A nemesis may even fulfil an important existential function. In 2010 <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2010-02829-007\" title=\"\">researchers at the University of Kansas</a> found that, \u201calthough superficially disagreeable\u201d, seeing themselves as having powerful enemies allowed people to maintain a sense of personal control in the face of many more numerous and diffuse hazards.</p> <p>The paper\u2019s authors also found that people tended to attribute greater power to an enemy at times when the government, law enforcement and the wider social system appeared to be chaotic and disordered. When you might feel you are losing control over your environment or destiny, an enemy \u201ccan be effectively controlled, managed or understood\u201d.</p> <p>The key thing, says Uzzi, is to keep active conflict to a minimum. Friendly competition, not properly managed, can easily turn toxic, leaving the relationship beyond repair. \u201cThe bad kind of nemesis is something you really don\u2019t want to develop, and if it does, you want to fix that or develop an exit strategy.\u201d But the good kind is \u201csomeone who\u2019s going to raise your game \u2026 They have to be people you want to compete with and do better than.\u201d</p> <p>The Totaljobs survey found that most people identified office nemeses of the same gender and the same level of seniority (or higher) as them, which is revealing of the tendency to benchmark ourselves against broadly equivalent individuals. Comparing yourself with others is of course fraught, and counter to the typical advice for achieving contentment \u2013 but it can be helpful in clarifying your own ambition.</p> <p>My emotional response to my nemeses\u2019 activities and achievements \u2013 usually never even voiced \u2013 is often most revealing about my own desires and insecurities. If their news makes me churn internally, I realise that it is something I want for myself, encouraging me to think about taking steps to make it happen. Equally, when it stirs in me disproportionate emotion, I have learned that it means there are probably more complicated factors at play.</p> <p>Prof Barbara Louise Gray \u2013 a former director of the Center for Research in Conflict and Negotiation at Penn State University \u2013 says it is worth paying attention to people who push your buttons as they can teach you about yourself.</p> <p>According to Jungian psychology, everyone has a \u201cshadow self\u201d, informed by our upbringing and cultural training, that we subconsciously strive to keep hidden; when we have a strong emotional response to someone, we might be projecting on them characteristics that we struggle to accept in ourselves.</p> <p>Your nemesis, then, can be a prompt for useful introspection. \u201cTry as you might to change someone else, as most people in marriages know, that doesn\u2019t work very well,\u201d says Gray. \u201cSo you have to turn the light around and shine it on yourself: \u2018Why am I so teed off by this person? Why does this person rub me the wrong way all the time?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Identifying traits you are intolerant of in others may reveal those that you work to conceal in yourself, says Gray, and thereby present an opportunity for personal growth. Learning to accept our shadow selves as they are reflected in other people can be a humbling experience, one that can make us more confident and effective in our relationships and happier in ourselves.</p> <p>The cliche that we are our own worst enemy may be true, but an external one can help that process of introspection along, says Gray. She adds that it is important to be attuned to your behaviour, and any patterns in the things that provoke you in others. \u201cThe key for an individual is to know when their buttons are pushed, and when it evokes a really strong reaction in them \u2013 that\u2019s the time to say: \u2018OK, I have a nemesis operating in here that I probably ought to meet.\u2019\u201d</p> <p><em>Why Everyone Needs a Nemesis: Harnessing Pettiness For Greatness by Elle Hunt is available in audiobook and eBook, published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a33.99</em></p>",

When those conditions are met, according to a framework called structural-balance theory reinforced by Uzzi\u2019s study, a network is considered balanced \u2013 not, I note, when there are no enemies at all. It can be hard to push yourself in a vacuum; it is quite a bit easier to want to do better than the guy clipping his toenails. A nemesis may even fulfil an important existential function. In 2010 researchers at the University of Kansas found that, \u201calthough superficially disagreeable\u201d, seeing themselves as having powerful enemies allowed people to maintain a sense of personal control in the face of many more numerous and diffuse hazards. The paper\u2019s authors also found that people tended to attribute greater power to an enemy at times when the government, law enforcement and the wider social system appeared to be chaotic and disordered. When you might feel you are losing control over your environment or destiny, an enemy \u201ccan be effectively controlled, managed or understood\u201d. The key thing, says Uzzi, is to keep active conflict to a minimum. Friendly competition, not properly managed, can easily turn toxic, leaving the relationship beyond repair. \u201cThe bad kind of nemesis is something you really don\u2019t want to develop, and if it does, you want to fix that or develop an exit strategy.\u201d But the good kind is \u201csomeone who\u2019s going to raise your game \u2026 They have to be people you want to compete with and do better than.\u201d The Totaljobs survey found that most people identified office nemeses of the same gender and the same level of seniority (or higher) as them, which is revealing of the tendency to benchmark ourselves against broadly equivalent individuals. Comparing yourself with others is of course fraught, and counter to the typical advice for achieving contentment \u2013 but it can be helpful in clarifying your own ambition. My emotional response to my nemeses\u2019 activities and achievements \u2013 usually never even voiced \u2013 is often most revealing about my own desires and insecurities. If their news makes me churn internally, I realise that it is something I want for myself, encouraging me to think about taking steps to make it happen. Equally, when it stirs in me disproportionate emotion, I have learned that it means there are probably more complicated factors at play. Prof Barbara Louise Gray \u2013 a former director of the Center for Research in Conflict and Negotiation at Penn State University \u2013 says it is worth paying attention to people who push your buttons as they can teach you about yourself. According to Jungian psychology, everyone has a \u201cshadow self\u201d, informed by our upbringing and cultural training, that we subconsciously strive to keep hidden; when we have a strong emotional response to someone, we might be projecting on them characteristics that we struggle to accept in ourselves. Your nemesis, then, can be a prompt for useful introspection. \u201cTry as you might to change someone else, as most people in marriages know, that doesn\u2019t work very well,\u201d says Gray. \u201cSo you have to turn the light around and shine it on yourself: \u2018Why am I so teed off by this person? Why does this person rub me the wrong way all the time?\u2019\u201d Identifying traits you are intolerant of in others may reveal those that you work to conceal in yourself, says Gray, and thereby present an opportunity for personal growth. Learning to accept our shadow selves as they are reflected in other people can be a humbling experience, one that can make us more confident and effective in our relationships and happier in ourselves. The cliche that we are our own worst enemy may be true, but an external one can help that process of introspection along, says Gray. She adds that it is important to be attuned to your behaviour, and any patterns in the things that provoke you in others. \u201cThe key for an individual is to know when their buttons are pushed, and when it evokes a really strong reaction in them \u2013 that\u2019s the time to say: \u2018OK, I have a nemesis operating in here that I probably ought to meet.\u2019\u201d Why Everyone Needs a Nemesis: Harnessing Pettiness For Greatness by Elle Hunt is available in audiobook and eBook, published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a33.99",

Official figures published on Tuesday appeared to show sterling\u2019s decline this year had been a boon for foreign investors, who were able to snap up British businesses more cheaply. The value of mergers and acquisitions of UK companies by overseas businesses was \u00a318.4bn in the three months from April to June, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, more than double the \u00a37.6bn recorded in the first three months of the year.

      "bodyText": "Downing Street has vehemently rejected the suggestion it could change the date of a snap election beyond 31 October if MPs support the move, amid speculation No 10 could consider alternative ways to push the idea through the Commons. Ahead of a crunch vote on Tuesday evening about whether rebel MPs can take control of the Commons order paper to push through a bill to delay Brexit and avoid no deal, Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman condemned the plan as \u201ca blueprint for legislative purgatory\u201d. No 10 has pledged that if MPs vote to allow the rebel bill to be debated, the government will table for Wednesday a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act (FTPA), calling for a general election, slated for 14 October. Under the FTPA, elections outside the usual five-year terms require a two-thirds majority in parliament, which would mean the bulk of Labour MPs would have to support the plan. However, a number of them, and rebel Tories, have said they would be worried Johnson could simply change the date to beyond 31 October after the vote. Johnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cIt\u2019s simply not going to happen. The idea is simply wrong. It is simply wrong to suggest that the polling date could or would be changed.\u201d While not committing to the mooted 14 October date the spokesman said he could guarantee an election would be held before the next meeting of the European council on 17 and 18 October. \u201cTo reiterate, the prime minister does not want to hold an election. If, by destroying his negotiating position, MPs do force an election, then that would take place before the October European council,\u201d he said. The Labour leadership is minded to support a general election, but only if it can find a parliamentary mechanism for ensuring Johnson cannot use it as a way of securing a no-deal Brexit. One idea being discussed is an attempt to legislate for a poll on a specific date. However, staunch remainers in the shadow cabinet fear that as Tony Blair warned yesterday, Labour risks falling into an \u201celephant trap\u201d set by Johnson. One shadow minister said it would be wholly irresponsible to agree to an election before 31 October. If the election plan under the FTPA failed to reach the required threshold in the Commons, an alternative plan would be for the government to seek an election via a simple majority, for example a one-line amendment to the act mandating an election. A Downing Street source confirmed that other options could potentially be looked at if the FTPA method did not succeed. Johnson\u2019s spokesman was scathing about the cross-party bill to delay Brexit until at least 31 January, put together by the former ministers Philip Hammond and David Gauke among others, saying it would force the government into an election. \u201cThey do not want to hold an election,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they want is to be able to go ahead and continue negotiating with Brussels, continue the good progress which is being made, without having their legs cut away from them by MPs.\u201d The bill says the 31 January extension must be sought if the prime minister has not passed a new Brexit agreement by 19 October \u2013 the day after the European council meeting \u2013 unless he has finalised a replacement deal or MPs have passed a motion approving a no-deal Brexit. It says Johnson must then write to the president of the European council requesting an extension, and that Johnson must accept any alternative extension offered by the EU, though that must be put to a vote in parliament. Johnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cIt clearly envisages either a lengthy extension or an indefinite extension. It also sows the seeds for further legislation to be introduced on 15 January, 12 February and then every 28 days to command the government to take a specific action.

In response to a question from Richard Corbett, the leader of Labour\u2019s MEPs, the Finnish government, which holds the rolling presidency of the EU, confirmed that no new proposals had been tabled by the British government. The commission will launch a fresh attempt on Wednesday to get European businesses ready for a no-deal by warning that the proximity to 31 October and \u201cthe political situation in the UK\u201d have increased the risk that Britain will crash out of the EU without a deal.

Downing Street has denied claims that Johnson\u2019s strategist, Dominic Cummings privately described the talks in Brussels as a \u201csham\u201d, but EU officials are increasingly concerned that this is the case. Frost is expected to bring a larger team of officials to the next round of talks but EU sources said they were concerned that Downing Street was split between those who wanted a deal and those such as Cummings who are thought to be seeking a no-deal exit.

More than 50 prisoners died in prison segregation units in England and Wales due to an incident that occurred while they were in segregation in the past six years, a freedom of information request to the Ministry of Justice has revealed. At the time of their deaths, 40% of these prisoners were being supported through ACCT (assessment, care in custody and teamwork) case management, which means they were checked on regularly because they were at risk of suicide or self-harm. These deaths occurred despite guidelines by the Prison Service that state prisoners subject to suicide and self-harm prevention procedures should be held in segregation units only in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d. A Guardian analysis of the annual reports by the Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Prisons in England and Wales and figures provided by the Ministry of Justice indicate that at least 30 of the 41 deaths that occurred between 2013-14 and 2017-18 were clearly self-inflicted. Other prisoners died from drug overdoses, illness and natural causes. A Guardian analysis of fatal incidents reports by the prisons and probation ombudsman (PPO) found some of those prisoners who died in segregation had been kept in isolation for weeks or months at a time. The 52 deaths include: A 21-year-old prisoner with psychosis in segregation in HMP Leicester who was found to have had nothing to occupy his time, \u201cnot even have a radio. Until he was given one, his only occupation seems to have been making models out of his food cartons.\u201d A 47-year-old man in Elmley. A 2014 report found that \u201cby the time of his death, he had spent over two months segregated with a very restricted regime and would probably have remained there for at least several more weeks\u201d. A 18-year-old man who struggled to cope with prison life and found it hard to communicate in English had made five previous attempts to take his own life during the three months he had been in HM Prison Wandsworth. On the day of his death, the prisoner had rung a bell in his segregation cell but it took prison staff 37 minutes to respond \u2013 by which time he was found unconscious. A 37-year-old man who took his own life at HMP The Mount in Hertfordshire in 2015 was \u201cheld in an unfurnished cell [without any furniture or sanitation, known as special accommodation] to manage his risk. No one assessed his mental health \u2026 as Prison Service instructions require\u201d. A 42-year-old man who had a personality disorder and schizophrenia was incorrectly recorded as not having self-harmed in custody and not on antipsychotic medication. Prison managers at HMP Birmingham authorised the man\u2019s segregation using this incorrect information. He killed himself 72 hours after being held in segregation. A 2015 report by the charity Prison Reform Trust stated that segregated prisoners spent an average of 23 hours a day inside their cell. According to the PPO, segregation involves a prisoner being removed from the general prison population. A prisoner could be segregated as a form of punishment, if their presence on a standard wing would be disruptive or unsafe for others. A prisoner might also be segregated for their own protection. The very basic design requirements for segregation units include a window, toilet and wash basin, power point, a bed or a concrete slab with a mattress, artificial light, and a call bell.

      "bodyText": "Spain\u2019s acting prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has announced hundreds of progressive policies intended to persuade the anti-austerity Unidas Podemos alliance to back his efforts to form a government and avoid the country\u2019s fourth general election in as many years. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s Socialist party (PSOE) won the most seats in April\u2019s general election but fell short of a majority in congress and has refused to govern in coalition with the far-left grouping. S\u00e1nchez has instead suggested a \u201cshared progressive programme\u201d designed to end the standoff and win over Unidas Podemos, unveiling on Tuesday 370 policies including proposals to clamp down on excessive rent rises, introduce low-emission zones in towns and cities, and expand free public nursery education. Speaking at the launch in Madrid, the acting prime minister called for a government built around a \u201cshared, progressive agreement\u201d and an openness to society. \u201cIt\u2019s not just because it\u2019s the route people called for when they voted at the polls,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s because society is asking us to show we can overcome the political impasse that the country\u2019s endured since 28 April and give Spain the opportunity to have a progressive government right now.\u201d S\u00e1nchez also took aim at the conservatives and pro-independence Catalan parties who overcame their bitter enmity to trigger the snap election by rejecting his government\u2019s 2019 budget. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got to where we are today because of disagreements between progressive parties but because pro-independence and conservative parties pooled their votes to topple a progressive government,\u201d he said. Iglesias gave the policies a cautious welcome, telling Spanish TV that while they \u201csounded good\u201d, he and his colleagues would need to study them in detail before making any decisions. Even if S\u00e1nchez manages to win over Unidas Podemos \u2013 which is far from certain \u2013 he would still need the pro-independence Catalan Republican Left party to abstain during the investiture vote. Tensions between Catalan separatists and pro-unity parties remain high and are likely to rise still further when the supreme court delivers its verdict next month in the trial of the 12 regional independence leaders accused of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds over their alleged roles in the failed bid to secede from Spain two years ago. If the manoeuvring and horse-trading fail to yield a government by 23 September, another general election will be held on 10 November. Although Spaniards are weary after voting in three general elections since December 2015, two recent polls suggest a repeat poll would benefit the PSOE. A survey for El Mundo found that the Socialists would again finish first, taking 145 of the 350 seats in congress \u2013 22 more than they managed in April. Unidas Podemos, meanwhile, would win 40 seats, meaning the two parties would easily secure a majority. Another poll, for El Espa\u00f1ol, predicted the PSOE and Unidas Podemos would take 176 seats between them. The current impasse, however, does not bode well for a deal, and voter fatigue could cause a decrease in turnout. S\u00e1nchez came to power in June 2018 after using a vote of no confidence to turf the scandal-mired conservative People\u2019s party (PP) out of office. The PP suffered its worst ever results in April\u2019s election as its support collapsed and it lost 71 seats. The party\u2019s corruption woes show no sign of abating. On Monday, a judge investigating illegal political financing summoned two former PP presidents of the Madrid region \u2013 Esperanza Aguirre and Cristina Cifuentes \u2013 to answer questions over alleged corruption. Another election could also hurt the centre-right Citizens party. The party, led by Albert Rivera, was leading the polls last year until it refused to back S\u00e1nchez\u2019s no-confidence motion. Its liberal credentials have also been undermined by its decision to enlist the help of the far-right Vox party to take power in Andaluc\u00eda and Madrid. El Pa\u00eds\u2019s poll predicts Citizens would drop from 57 seats to 34 in the event of another election, while El Espa\u00f1ol\u2019s suggests it would lose 19 seats.",

The Birmingham engineer Matthew Boulton wrote that Trevithick was in a \u201cpublick [sic] house\u201d when an injunction was served on him and adds: \u201cHe seemed much aggitated [sic] and vexed.\u201d</p> <p>Another yellowing document makes a reference to the pirate Henry Avery (also known as Every), who in 1695 raided the 25-strong convoy of Grand Mughal vessels making the annual pilgrimage to Mecca.

      "bodyText": "A treasure trove of documents charting 850 years of Cornish history, ranging from an elaborate Elizabethan manuscript gifting a nobleman chunks of the county, to recipes for pasties and a spell-busting charm involving hot urine, have been gathered together at a new archive. Housed in a refurbished brewery, the Kresen Kernow (Cornwall Centre) in Redruth is home to 1.5m records that give an insight into the rich history and culture of the far south-west of Britain. Much of the material is held on 14 miles of shelving in large storerooms and preservation suites, but exhibition spaces showing some of the most intriguing pieces have been created to encourage people to drop in. Upstairs in the Mirva Tresoryow (Treasures Gallery) is the manuscript from Elizabeth I \u2013 adorned with images of snakes, a strawberry border and letters made up of birds \u2013 that hands land over to George Carey, who commanded the Isle of Wight\u2019s defences when under threat from the Spanish Armada. In the same dimly lit room is a Cornish language dictionary compiled in the mid-18th century by William Borlase, the rector of the village of Ludgvan, near Penzance. The growing revival of the Cornish language has led Kresen Kernow to adopt a \u201cCornish first\u201d approach to its signs. Many are musical in tone \u2013 such as lyverva (library) and kornel kosel (quiet corner) \u2013 although the Cornish for archive is a little less sweet to the English ear \u2013 argh. Documents on display downstairs include insights into authors famed for their Cornish connections, such as Daphne du Maurier and Winston Graham, the latter having written the Poldark books. There are papers that tell some of the inside stories of Cornwall\u2019s industrial heritage, including a letter describing the reaction of the Cornish steam locomotive pioneer Richard Trevithick when he found out competitors were taking legal action against him. The Birmingham engineer Matthew Boulton wrote that Trevithick was in a \u201cpublick [sic] house\u201d when an injunction was served on him and adds: \u201cHe seemed much aggitated [sic] and vexed.\u201d Another yellowing document makes a reference to the pirate Henry Avery (also known as Every), who in 1695 raided the 25-strong convoy of Grand Mughal vessels making the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. It claims that after the raid he buried \u201cthree chests or boxes full of treasure\u201d in the sands of the Lizard peninsula in south Cornwall. The centre will open to the public on Saturday with a community day to coincide with the annual Redruth mining and pasty festival. Deborah Tritton, the centre\u2019s project lead, said visitors of all ages and interests would be welcome. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely resource in a beautiful building.\u201d She said Kresen Kernow had brought together documents held at two previous centres and numerous out-stores. As well as the eye-catching \u201ctreasures\u201d on display it holds hundreds of years of parish registers, tithe maps, business records and photographs in its backrooms that will be pored over by historians and genealogy researchers. On the decision to prioritise Cornish on the signs, Tritton said: \u201cWe wanted to give it a status and acknowledge its importance in our heritage. It is usually presented as a secondary language, in grey and italics beneath the English.\u201d Among Tritton\u2019s favourite documents is the spell-busting charm. It appears to have been written for a man called Thomas Leverton, who was clearly the target of some sort of supernatural attack. The suggested solution involves a witch bottle \u2013 a counter-magical device \u2013 that had to be filled with a piping hot \u201cpint of your owne [sic] urine\u201d. Follow the instructions and \u201cyour private enemies will never after have any power upon you\u201d, the document says.",

I can\u2019t remember who said it, or exactly how old I was, but it has lived with me ever since.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you call a black man in a suit? Guilty.\u201d</p> <p>Some will dismiss this as a bit of fun or, dare I say it, banter, but they tend to be the people who aren\u2019t being targeted by the setup and punchline, nor have to deal with the way similarly flippant wisecracks, comments and judgments have an insidious effect on those who are. In other words they tend to be white people, and when they stray into this territory it\u2019s only right to lead them back on to safer, fairer ground.</p> <p>Which is why I\u2019m writing about Graeme Souness. I\u2019ve never met the former Scotland midfielder and am willing to accept from those who have that he\u2019s a thoroughly nice guy; his bark is worse than his bite, and all that. But the problem is that on Sunday he said something that \u2013 and there really is no easy way to put this \u2013 sounded like racial stereotyping.</p> <p>A couple of days on, the memory still lingers, the sense of jaw\u2011dropping shock as Souness spoke about Moise Kean during Sky Sports\u2019 coverage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/01/everton-wolves-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Everton\u2019s 3-2 victory over Wolves</a> and why Juventus allowed the 19-year-old striker, who scored six goals in 13 Serie A appearances last season, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/04/everton-sign-moise-kean-juventus\" title=\"\">join Everton for an initial \u20ac32m (\u00a329m) last month</a>. \u201cAt 19, why have they sold him?\u201d the 66-year-old said. \u201cPersonally, slight alarm bells are going off in my head.\u201d Those alarm bells were clearly very loud because in the space of just over a minute, Souness went on to suggest Juventus may have sold Kean because his \u201coff\u2011the-field activities are not the best\u201d.</p> <p>This was the precise moment Souness needed to stop, take a breath and head in another direction. Instead he ploughed on and went on to make a comparison between Kean\u2019s move from Juventus to Everton and that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jul/18/arsenal-manchester-city-emmanuel-adebayor\" title=\"\">Emmanuel Adebayor from Arsenal to Manchester City</a> that was, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/sep/03/david-squires-on-the-premier-league-story-so-far\" title=\"\">David Squires references in his latest cartoon</a>, outright weird.

      "bodyText": "Many years ago I was a told a joke that, looking back, could well have been my first experience of racial stereotyping. I can\u2019t remember who said it, or exactly how old I was, but it has lived with me ever since. \u201cWhat do you call a black man in a suit? Guilty.\u201d Some will dismiss this as a bit of fun or, dare I say it, banter, but they tend to be the people who aren\u2019t being targeted by the setup and punchline, nor have to deal with the way similarly flippant wisecracks, comments and judgments have an insidious effect on those who are. In other words they tend to be white people, and when they stray into this territory it\u2019s only right to lead them back on to safer, fairer ground. Which is why I\u2019m writing about Graeme Souness. I\u2019ve never met the former Scotland midfielder and am willing to accept from those who have that he\u2019s a thoroughly nice guy; his bark is worse than his bite, and all that. But the problem is that on Sunday he said something that \u2013 and there really is no easy way to put this \u2013 sounded like racial stereotyping. A couple of days on, the memory still lingers, the sense of jaw\u2011dropping shock as Souness spoke about Moise Kean during Sky Sports\u2019 coverage of Everton\u2019s 3-2 victory over Wolves and why Juventus allowed the 19-year-old striker, who scored six goals in 13 Serie A appearances last season, to join Everton for an initial \u20ac32m (\u00a329m) last month. \u201cAt 19, why have they sold him?\u201d the 66-year-old said. \u201cPersonally, slight alarm bells are going off in my head.\u201d Those alarm bells were clearly very loud because in the space of just over a minute, Souness went on to suggest Juventus may have sold Kean because his \u201coff\u2011the-field activities are not the best\u201d. This was the precise moment Souness needed to stop, take a breath and head in another direction. Instead he ploughed on and went on to make a comparison between Kean\u2019s move from Juventus to Everton and that of Emmanuel Adebayor from Arsenal to Manchester City that was, as David Squires references in his latest cartoon, outright weird. The two deals occurred more than a decade apart, involve four clubs and two players at different stages of their career. Souness\u2019s claim that Ars\u00e8ne Wenger sold Adebayor to City because \u201cthere\u2019s something not quite right with him\u201d was also incorrect given the then Arsenal manager wanted the Togo striker to stay, while there have been no suggestions that Juventus sold Kean because of what he was getting up to in his spare time. The striker has been left out of Italy\u2019s latest squad, alongside Nicolo Zaniolo, for turning up late to a team meeting ahead of Italy\u2019s encounter with Belgium at the recent European Under-21 Championship but, according to informed voices, the reason for him leaving Juve are football-related. As the Italian football journalist Gabriele Marcotti tweeted in response to Souness\u2019s comments, the Serie A champions allowed Kean to swap Turin for Merseyside because he had one year left on his contract and, having declined to sign an extension, they did not want to lose him for free next summer. It was an error-strewn, conclusion-jumping bit of punditry from Souness and once the comparison with Adebayor had been made it was hard to escape a rather depressing conclusion. You know, that thing about certain people looking and acting the same. Souness would no doubt dispute this and more than likely be horrified by the suggestion that he cast aspersions on Kean\u2019s character purely because of his race. In doing so he may also point to his record as a manager when it came to signing and fielding black players, most notably Mark Walters during his time at Rangers. For its part, Sky Sports has declined to comment but, in defending Souness, the broadcaster did point out that his comments on Kean were part of a wider discussion that saw Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, in his role as a fellow Sky pundit, speak entirely positively of the player and therefore all Souness may have been doing is offering a counter-argument.

      "body": "<p>Once upon a time, the most talked-about family in the US was a collection of narcissists and nepotists, a flash, brash bunch with vast, brittle egos who loved to brag about their wealth and show off their designer wardrobes.

The Trump era, in which the villains are all too real, has ushered in a misty-eyed nostalgia for Dynasty. Alexis Colby \u2013 one eyebrow raised in prelude to some withering comeback, cupid\u2019s bow lipsticked with the precision of a scalpel \u2013 is on designer moodboards all over fashion this season.</p> <p>Joan Collins was recently announced as <a href=\"https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/head/article/45714/1/joan-collins-shines-in-new-charlotte-tilbury-foundation-campaign\" title=\"\">a poster girl for Charlotte Tilbury\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/head/article/45714/1/joan-collins-shines-in-new-charlotte-tilbury-foundation-campaign\" title=\"\">Airbrush Flawless </a><a href=\"https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/head/article/45714/1/joan-collins-shines-in-new-charlotte-tilbury-foundation-campaign\" title=\"\">foundation</a>. There are 12 models in the main campaign image \u2013 including Miss Fame from RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, Tilbury herself, the usual gorgeous twentysomethings and the YouTuber Em Ford \u2013 but only one star. The other 11 wear spaghetti-strap slips and the odd understated piece of jewellery; Collins wears a ruched satin gown with sparkling embroidery and enormous diamond earrings. Her hair is styled in the same gravity-defying hot-brushed waves that she wore as Alexis in the 80s.</p> <p>At the age of 86, Collins is enjoying a fashion renaissance. Last year, <a href=\"http://www.joancollins.com/2018/07/kurt-geiger-campaign-featuring-dame-joan-collins-july-2018-qa/\" title=\"\">she starred in a campaign for Kurt Geiger</a>. Photographed in a pair of the brand\u2019s towering, lipstick-red high heels, she recalled that one of her favourite Dynasty outfits was \u201cthe grey silk jersey wrap dress worn with a fur cape trimmed with grey fox and a matching hat and boots\u201d. (Note how at home that look would be in Melania Trump\u2019s wardrobe.)</p> <p>Collins has deliberately blurred her real life with that of the fictional Alexis, because she knows that owning the Dynasty slot awards her prime airtime in popular culture. This year, she attended the camp-themed Met Gala wearing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2019/may/07/met-gala-2019-stars-turn-up-the-camp-on-the-red-carpet-in-pictures\" title=\"\">an all-white, feather trimmed Valentino gown</a> with diamond tiara, collar and earrings.

In one scene, Smalls sprays the contents of her martini over a shagpile carpet as she flounces up from a white chaise longue with a hip-swinging swagger. Shayk wields a champagne bottle as a weapon, while Hadid\u2019s impressively voluminous yet chaotically side-swept bouffant suggests she got caught up in a catfight in an upscale hair salon.</p> <p><a href=\"https://fashionweekdaily.com/jeremy-scott-moschino-good-luck-trolls-collection-dynasty-ads/\" title=\"\">Dynasty represents \u201cthe power of television\u201d in fashion</a>, Scott has said.

In its overtly sexualised boardroom power-dressing, it was undeniably Alexis. At Alessandra Rich \u2013 the designer where every young socialite buys her gowns these days \u2013 high-shine eveningwear comes with high hemlines and belts as wide and glittering as any worn in the boxing ring. Escada\u2019s new campaign \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B01V_bjjkus/?utm_source=ig_embed\" title=\"\">featuring Rita Ora in head-to-toe ice-white tailoring</a> finished with rows of gold buttons, backcombed hair and a cool, icy glare \u2013 is pure Dynasty.

Of course, charity and secondhand stores have long been a rich hunting ground for Dynasty-chic: look for shiny fabrics, gathered shoulders, brooch-detailing and black-and-white graphics.</p> <p>But Dynasty fashion is as much about the mood music it brings as it is about a look. Both Melania and Ivanka Trump are power-dressers who weaponise their femininity. Their wardrobes for the state visit to the UK in June were lavish, with hourglass tailoring, high heels and a penchant for snowy white: all tropes that the Colby and Carrington women embraced on screen, back when the dynasty in question was a fantasy.</p> <p>Despite the butter-wouldn\u2019t-melt, all-white looks, the embrace of the Dynasty aesthetic in the real world represents our willingness to play the bad guy.

      "bodyText": "Once upon a time, the most talked-about family in the US was a collection of narcissists and nepotists, a flash, brash bunch with vast, brittle egos who loved to brag about their wealth and show off their designer wardrobes. They picked high-profile fights with anyone who crossed them and kept a global audience mesmerised with their provocative put-downs. OK, so the Carringtons didn\u2019t try to buy Greenland or muscle their way into chats with world leaders at the G20. But the lifestyle espoused in the 80s soap opera Dynasty helped create a blueprint \u2013 in tone, aesthetic and optics \u2013 for the Trump White House. Life has now imitated art. But the reality takes cartoon villainy to lengths that the Dynasty scriptwriters would have baulked at. The Trump era, in which the villains are all too real, has ushered in a misty-eyed nostalgia for Dynasty. Alexis Colby \u2013 one eyebrow raised in prelude to some withering comeback, cupid\u2019s bow lipsticked with the precision of a scalpel \u2013 is on designer moodboards all over fashion this season. Joan Collins was recently announced as a poster girl for Charlotte Tilbury\u2019s Airbrush Flawless foundation. There are 12 models in the main campaign image \u2013 including Miss Fame from RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, Tilbury herself, the usual gorgeous twentysomethings and the YouTuber Em Ford \u2013 but only one star. The other 11 wear spaghetti-strap slips and the odd understated piece of jewellery; Collins wears a ruched satin gown with sparkling embroidery and enormous diamond earrings. Her hair is styled in the same gravity-defying hot-brushed waves that she wore as Alexis in the 80s. At the age of 86, Collins is enjoying a fashion renaissance. Last year, she starred in a campaign for Kurt Geiger. Photographed in a pair of the brand\u2019s towering, lipstick-red high heels, she recalled that one of her favourite Dynasty outfits was \u201cthe grey silk jersey wrap dress worn with a fur cape trimmed with grey fox and a matching hat and boots\u201d. (Note how at home that look would be in Melania Trump\u2019s wardrobe.) Collins has deliberately blurred her real life with that of the fictional Alexis, because she knows that owning the Dynasty slot awards her prime airtime in popular culture. This year, she attended the camp-themed Met Gala wearing an all-white, feather trimmed Valentino gown with diamond tiara, collar and earrings. On Twitter, she explained that she had come as herself, captioning her look: \u201cI\u2019m Alexis Morell Carrington Colby Dexter Rowan.\u201d Talking about yourself in the third person, with a bombastic embrace of ego? Alexis is very, very 2019. Jeremy Scott, Moschino\u2019s creative director, has an infallible instinct for the zeitgeist. (At the VMAs last week, he dressed Lizzo, the woman of the hour, in a floor-length red sequin gown with \u201cSIREN\u201d emblazoned in capital letters.) Alongside the veteran photographer Steven Meisel, he created a homage to Dynasty \u2013 starring the models Gigi Hadid, Joan Smalls and Irina Shayk \u2013 for Moschino\u2019s autumn advertising campaign. The models wear tiny cocktail dresses and enormous fur coats with a thick frosting of diamonds. In one scene, Smalls sprays the contents of her martini over a shagpile carpet as she flounces up from a white chaise longue with a hip-swinging swagger. Shayk wields a champagne bottle as a weapon, while Hadid\u2019s impressively voluminous yet chaotically side-swept bouffant suggests she got caught up in a catfight in an upscale hair salon. Dynasty represents \u201cthe power of television\u201d in fashion, Scott has said. He credits the producer Aaron Spelling and the costume designer Nolan Miller with shaping \u201cso much of our American, and ultimately world, view of glamour\u201d. Like Killing Eve and Stranger Things in this decade, Dynasty used fashion to help make itself unmissable viewing. Saint Laurent\u2019s autumn/winter catwalk show in Paris in February opened with a luxe charcoal-wool tailored coat with vast power shoulders, which framed a plunging, cleavage-focused wisp of black organza worn beneath. In its overtly sexualised boardroom power-dressing, it was undeniably Alexis. At Alessandra Rich \u2013 the designer where every young socialite buys her gowns these days \u2013 high-shine eveningwear comes with high hemlines and belts as wide and glittering as any worn in the boxing ring. Escada\u2019s new campaign \u2013 featuring Rita Ora in head-to-toe ice-white tailoring finished with rows of gold buttons, backcombed hair and a cool, icy glare \u2013 is pure Dynasty. Zara has a blazer-dress in a bombastically loud poppy print, with a matching belt, for \u00a399.99. Of course, charity and secondhand stores have long been a rich hunting ground for Dynasty-chic: look for shiny fabrics, gathered shoulders, brooch-detailing and black-and-white graphics. But Dynasty fashion is as much about the mood music it brings as it is about a look. Both Melania and Ivanka Trump are power-dressers who weaponise their femininity. Their wardrobes for the state visit to the UK in June were lavish, with hourglass tailoring, high heels and a penchant for snowy white: all tropes that the Colby and Carrington women embraced on screen, back when the dynasty in question was a fantasy. Despite the butter-wouldn\u2019t-melt, all-white looks, the embrace of the Dynasty aesthetic in the real world represents our willingness to play the bad guy. What made Alexis and her co-stars so compelling was their unabashed embrace of ego, their refusal to play nice. In Dynasty, the bad guys didn\u2019t just get the best lines; they got the best of everything. Contrary to narrative traditions, this was a show in which the good guys did not necessarily triumph. So, it is more than a little alarming to find it so resonant today. But hey, it made for good television. And, more importantly, it makes for some great fashion.",

His short speech on Monday evening against a backdrop of chanting protesters was aimed squarely at exasperated voters: if we have to have a general election, don\u2019t blame me. The outcome of Tuesday\u2019s attempt by backbenchers to take control of the parliamentary timetable to try to block a no-deal Brexit is by no means a foregone conclusion. Party discipline has been fraying at the edges throughout the many months of this fractious hung parliament. But by threatening to impose the severest sanction \u2013 permanent expulsion \u2013 on rebels, Johnson is effectively challenging them to choose between what they believe to be the national interest, and any political future inside their party. The stakes could not be higher. It should come as no surprise that Johnson is playing hardball, for two reasons. First, any prime minister would struggle to accept a piece of legislation that binds their hands quite so comprehensively \u2013 even specifying the wording of the letter he must write to the EU27 to secure an article 50 extension. Yes, MPs are dealing with weighty issues, in a hung parliament, against the backdrop of extraordinary political ferment.

This time it is different. The only basis on which Johnson\u2019s plea to his backbench colleagues (and indeed his cabinet) makes any sense is that he is pressing hard for a deal with the EU27, and needs the threat of a no-deal Brexit in his toolkit. Certainly that was the message Johnson was keen to communicate after the G7 summit in Biarritz, where he played up the issues on which the UK stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the EU, without offering any concrete new proposals on the Northern Irish border. But his problem in trying this argument on party colleagues is that many of them simply do not trust him \u2013 the man who drank a toast to Theresa May\u2019s Chequers deal and then resigned in protest several days later. As Philip Hammond\u2019s tone of livid disgust made clear on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Tuesday, this is a party at war. If Johnson does try to trigger a general election, Labour faces a tough tactical dilemma between backing the election they have long said they want, while simultaneously trying to avoid the \u201celephant trap\u201d, as Tony Blair has called it, of Johnson changing the polling date, and pressing ahead with Brexit while parliament is suspended. Every instinct of Jeremy Corbyn and his team will be telling them to back an election \u2013 they were invigorated by the 2017 campaign, and would hope, as they did then, to make it about more than just Brexit. And they believe that whatever the \u201cprocessology\u201d in parliament, as they dismissively call it, the public are likely to see any refusal to power up the battle buses as cowardice. But many Labour members and shadow ministers will want Corbyn to ensure a no-deal Brexit has been ruled out categorically before he whips his MPs to back an election. Only a fool or a charlatan would try to predict the outcome of a general election held against this backdrop, with both major parties deeply divided. Labour will hope that, having backed a Brexit referendum, they have neutralised much of the challenge from the Liberal Democrats, who jumped on the remain bandwagon early, and will be able to focus instead on austerity, and bash Johnson as an establishment stooge. The Tories will hope their hardline stance has helped them scoop up the Brexit party vote, but unlike May in 2017 they will also have something to say about bread-and-butter issues \u2013 boosting funding for the NHS and schools, and increasing police numbers. And they will attack Labour both as seeking to block Brexit and being preoccupied with student-style protest politics distant from the real lives of voters in leave constituencies. Even if Johnson battles on for the next few days and weeks, a general election is coming, probably sooner rather than later, and it is likely to be the hardest-fought and most unpredictable in many years.",

Sadly, the same thing is also happening to the rainforests, the indigenous peoples and the wildlife of central Africa and Borneo. Our precious earth\u2019s creatures are at great risk of extinction if we do not change course very soon.</p> <p>The only way to stop the climate crisis is to have a concerted global people-power campaign to remove the megalomaniac nationalist leaders Jair Bolsonaro, Donald Trump, Xi Jinping and others who are the foremost proponents of the plunder of the natural world.</p> <p>The survival of the planet and its inhabitants depends on us acting quickly together to reverse this awful state of affairs and renew the earth before we get to an irreversible tipping point. Let\u2019s turn our despair, sadness and anger into hope and action to make a real difference. <br><em>Steven Katsineris</em><br><em>Hurstbridge, Victoria, Australia</em></p> <p>\u2022 The article summarising a new UN report describes how we humans degrade the earth, threatening the world food supply by forest destruction, implicitly blaming \u201crising global population and consumption\u201d in Malthusian tonalities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/08/climate-crisis-reducing-lands-ability-to-sustain-humanity-says-ipcc\" title=\"\">(16 August)</a>. The article does not mention the patenting of seeds, the land grabs and monopolies by transnational corporations. There is also the vast deforestation for biofuel plantations to feed cars, not people; the speculation on food prices in futures markets; and the dumping of food products, which undermines small farmers. Exacerbating the dire impact of climate change is the lethal agriculture system, with culpable people at the helm.<br><em>Judith Deutsch</em><br><em>Toronto, Ontario, Canada</em></p> <p><strong>Your analysis of Putin omits some key points</strong></p> <p>Angus Roxburgh\u2019s article on Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/12/vladimir-putin-west-russian-president-20-years\" title=\"\">(16 August)</a> omits two points. In 1990s Russia, democracy brought many political parties, but also economic shock therapy that was all shock and no therapy. Dodgy privatisations created a few multibillionaires and left the vast majority impoverished, with an epidemic of violent crime.</p> <p>Entrepreneurs did well, workers went unpaid or earned too little to survive. In popular parlance, <em>demokratiya</em> soon became <em>dermokratiya</em> (shitocracy). Older Russians remember a time of fear and insecurity; Putin restored order. Their view of democracy is, understandably, different from ours.</p> <p>The Chechen separatists were Islamist fighters who called for jihad. In any other context they would be called terrorists; naturally Russia views them as such. <br><em>Christine Barnard</em><br><em>London, UK </em></p> <p><strong>The collapse of linguistic standards is distressing</strong></p> <p>With reference to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/aug/15/why-its-time-to-stop-worrying-about-the-decline-of-the-english-language\" title=\"\">23 August\u2019s Lingua fracas!!</a>: Guardian writer David Shariatmadari picks out renowned authors, such as John Updike and William Golding, to refute the value of George Orwell\u2019s statement that language will become decadent and share in the general collapse of civilisation.

Of course, language gradually evolves but when changes in usage derive simply from utter carelessness or an \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn\u201d attitude, there must surely be lines that cannot be crossed.

      "bodyText": "We must turn anger into action to save the planet Thank you for highlighting the truly dire situation in the Amazon (30 August). Sadly, the same thing is also happening to the rainforests, the indigenous peoples and the wildlife of central Africa and Borneo. Our precious earth\u2019s creatures are at great risk of extinction if we do not change course very soon. The only way to stop the climate crisis is to have a concerted global people-power campaign to remove the megalomaniac nationalist leaders Jair Bolsonaro, Donald Trump, Xi Jinping and others who are the foremost proponents of the plunder of the natural world. The survival of the planet and its inhabitants depends on us acting quickly together to reverse this awful state of affairs and renew the earth before we get to an irreversible tipping point. Let\u2019s turn our despair, sadness and anger into hope and action to make a real difference. Steven Katsineris Hurstbridge, Victoria, Australia \u2022 The article summarising a new UN report describes how we humans degrade the earth, threatening the world food supply by forest destruction, implicitly blaming \u201crising global population and consumption\u201d in Malthusian tonalities (16 August). The article does not mention the patenting of seeds, the land grabs and monopolies by transnational corporations. There is also the vast deforestation for biofuel plantations to feed cars, not people; the speculation on food prices in futures markets; and the dumping of food products, which undermines small farmers. Exacerbating the dire impact of climate change is the lethal agriculture system, with culpable people at the helm. Judith Deutsch Toronto, Ontario, Canada Your analysis of Putin omits some key points Angus Roxburgh\u2019s article on Vladimir Putin (16 August) omits two points. In 1990s Russia, democracy brought many political parties, but also economic shock therapy that was all shock and no therapy. Dodgy privatisations created a few multibillionaires and left the vast majority impoverished, with an epidemic of violent crime. Entrepreneurs did well, workers went unpaid or earned too little to survive. In popular parlance, demokratiya soon became dermokratiya (shitocracy). Older Russians remember a time of fear and insecurity; Putin restored order. Their view of democracy is, understandably, different from ours. The Chechen separatists were Islamist fighters who called for jihad. In any other context they would be called terrorists; naturally Russia views them as such. Christine Barnard London, UK The collapse of linguistic standards is distressing With reference to 23 August\u2019s Lingua fracas!!: Guardian writer David Shariatmadari picks out renowned authors, such as John Updike and William Golding, to refute the value of George Orwell\u2019s statement that language will become decadent and share in the general collapse of civilisation. There will always be exceptions, tall poppies who buck the trend. I submit there is a general decline. Even look at the subsequent page subhead in the Weekly: \u201cThis summer\u2019s World Cup made Megan Rapinoe a outspoken global superstar\u201d. \u201cAn\u201d used to be the correct preposition. It all adds to the decline \u2013 the Guardian, and media in general, can help slow the decline. Stephen Banks Birmingham, UK \u2022 I stand duly chastised by David Shariatmadari in his admonition to accept changes in English usage. Of course, language gradually evolves but when changes in usage derive simply from utter carelessness or an \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn\u201d attitude, there must surely be lines that cannot be crossed. I hope that even the author will accept that \u201cI should of went\u201d is one of my lines. John Gittins Toronto, Canada Greenland has other options besides Trump Greenland has more options than Denmark, independence or Donald Trump (23 August). It\u2019s just a day\u2019s kayaking from Ellesmere Island, Canada. The peoples of Greenland and Nunavut are ethnically similar, and until the 1940s they visited back and forth by boat and sled. Douglas Porteous Victoria, British Columbia, Canada Thank you for such profound insights Thank you for publishing the extraordinary thoughts of Noel Gallagher on global warming and the nuclear threat: \u201cfuck the grandkids, they might be cunts\u201d (16 August, Bigmouth strikes again). I don\u2019t remember reading things so profound since Plato, Spinoza or Hegel. Marc Jachym Les Ulis, France",

      "bodyText": "Subscribe now to receive the morning briefing by email. Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Storm expected to pass \u2018dangerously close\u2019 to Florida At least five people are dead in the Bahamas after Hurricane Dorian, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms on record, stalled over the Caribbean islands on Monday. The storm battered the island of Grand Bahama for more than 12 hours, with winds of up to 155mph and storm surges some 18ft above normal tide level. The category 5 storm has since weakened to a category 3 and is expected to move north-west on Tuesday, sparing the US mainland but passing \u201cdangerously close\u201d to the Florida coast. \u2018Historic tragedy.\u2019 The five fatalities reported were on the Abaco Islands in the north of the Bahamas. The country\u2019s prime minister, Hubert Minnis, called Dorian \u201ca historic tragedy\u201d and its devastation \u201cunprecedented\u201d. Alabama safe. Donald Trump\u2019s response has been confusing, with the US president twice claiming \u2013 falsely \u2013 that Dorian would hit Alabama. He also suggested, for at least the fifth time in two years, that he had never heard of a category 5 hurricane. At least 25 killed in California boat fire Twenty-five people have died and another nine are still missing after a scuba diving boat was engulfed in flames and sank off the coast of southern California in the small hours of Monday morning. Five crew members escaped from the 75ft boat, Conception, which was moored near Santa Cruz Island when the blaze broke out at around 3am. But the US Coast Guard said 33 passengers and one other crew member had been found dead or remained missing on Monday. Naming the dead. The passengers are believed to have been from across California and probably beyond. Authorities said the first four bodies recovered were of two adult males and two adult females, but DNA tests would be needed to identify them. Barr drafting new death penalty law for mass shooters The US attorney general, William Barr, has been drafting new legislation to speed up the implementation of the death penalty in federal cases involving mass murder, officials revealed on Monday. The news came after a weekend shooting rampage in the west Texas towns of Midland and Odessa that left seven people dead, the state\u2019s second mass shooting in August alone. The proposal will be presented by the administration as part of its effort to tackle gun violence, in the absence of any actual gun control measures. Victims and survivors. Victoria Bekiempis hears stories from those close to the victims of the west Texas shooting \u2013 and from some of those who survived. Great Lakes floods fuelled by climate crisis Detroit, Chicago, Buffalo, Duluth and Minnesota have all been struck by floods in recent years, bringing unprecedented chaos to the shores of the Great Lakes. As Tom Perkins reports, the lakes\u2019 water level has risen steadily over the last half-decade and reached record levels during spring and summer 2019, when their depths ranged from 14in to nearly 3ft above long-term averages. Climate scientists say the cause is clear: Earth\u2019s rising temperatures. Evaporation threat. The Great Lakes basin holds 90% of America\u2019s freshwater. While increased rainfall has raised water levels, in a warmer future scientists say the lakes will face the opposite threat and shrink through evaporation. Cheat sheet At least 16 people have been killed in a Taliban bomb attack in Kabul, hours after a US envoy briefed the Afghan government on a deal \u201cin principle\u201d with the group, which would see 5,000 US troops leaving Afghanistan within five months. The New York Times has scrapped its plans to sponsor one of the world\u2019s biggest oil industry conferences, following pressure and protests from climate activist groups including Extinction Rebellion. The former US secretary of state John Kerry has said the choice between climate action and economic growth is a false one, describing those who present it as such as \u201cneanderthals who don\u2019t want to believe in the future\u201d. The teenage climate campaigner Greta Thunberg has spoken about her Asperger\u2019s diagnosis, saying she sees the condition as a \u201csuperpower\u201d. Responding to critics, she added: \u201cWhen haters go after your looks and differences \u2026 you know you\u2019re winning!\u201d Must-reads How overblown fears of censorship normalised hate speech Speech has never been more free or less intermediated, says Nesrine Malik. As a columnist for the Guardian, she has experienced firsthand the growing torrent of online abuse that is directed most forcefully at women and minorities. So why, she asks, do we keep being fed the myth that free speech is under assault? The hellish climate future for Las Vegas Its climate already close to unbearable without air conditioning, Las Vegas is the fastest warming city in the US. And if climate change continues apace, scientists say the city will likely experience 96 days of heat above 100F annually by the end of the century, with a disproportionate impact on the poor.

Sport After outclassing the teenage sensation Coco Gauff in the third round of the US Open, defending champion Naomi Osaka was herself defeated 7-5, 6-3 in the fourth on Monday, by her Swiss rival Belinda Bencic. In 1968, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar boycotted the US Olympic basketball team to protest against the overt racism and police aggression that was causing deadly riots across the country. Athletes have only fleeting moments to proclaim their opinions and be heard, he says \u2013 and the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo could offer several such moments.

She had been teaching at a primary school in Bamenda, in anglophone Cameroon, but repeated threats had forced the headmaster to shut the school\u2019s doors.</p> <p>The threats were from the \u201cAmba boys\u201d, separatists who have been fighting a two-year battle with Cameroon\u2019s francophone government to break off and form their own state, Ambazonia. They enforced a school boycott to protest against educational injustices against English-speakers.</p> <p>Thousands of schools were closed. Many were burned and now lie in ruins or are being swallowed up in weeds. Teachers have left the anglophone regions in droves.</p> <p>Cameroon\u2019s government launched a back-to-school campaign over the summer, but ongoing gun battles mean that any children walking to school at the start of term this week run the risk of being shot, and there is no clear end to the conflict in sight.</p> <p>Akwa was struggling to make ends meet, so when several parents approached her, anxious for their children to receive an education, she agreed to take seven private pupils in secret.</p> <p>This had been going on for several months when one Saturday, five Amba boys came to her house. Akwa was cleaning vegetables, and as soon as she saw them, she stopped what she was doing.</p> <p>\u201cThey said they had been told that I continued to teach children at home. I lied that they were my neighbours\u2019 children,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of them asked me to shut up. He was the youngest of them all. He said I should stop it immediately, because they have declared no school in Ambaland. I was afraid. My neighbours were watching from afar. I apologised to the Amba boys and they left.\u201d</p> <p>Schoolchildren\u2019s studies are collateral damage in many conflicts, but in anglophone Cameroon, education was a major trigger for the crisis, and schools and those teachers still trying to work are themselves a target.</p> <p>Only 100 schools of 6,000 remain open, according to the Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Africa \u2013 the other 5,900 have been closed down. Unicef said <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/06/1041071\">80% of schools were shut</a>, 74 destroyed and 600,000 children affected by the school ban. The head of basic education for the north-west said school attendance had gone down from 422,000 in 2017 to 5,500 children today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4eb053fb502f78ad3a3c239dbde13e658524aea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4eb053fb502f78ad3a3c239dbde13e658524aea/0_347_7952_4771/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An abandoned school building in anglophone Cameroon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An abandoned school building in anglophone Cameroon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giles Clarke/UNOCHA via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Government officials have put the number of closed schools at around 3,000 and said around 200 had been burned. The government claims it was separatists that torched the schools, but the separatists say military forces destroyed many of them when they found they were being used as rebel bases.</p> <p>After the Amba boys left, Akwa immediately cancelled all her classes and left Bamenda, ending up in Logbessou, a neighbourhood of Douala. She found work, but struggles to make enough to live in Cameroon\u2019s biggest city. She cannot grow beans and corn there as she did in her garden at home, so she has to buy them.</p> <p>Sometimes she thinks about the pupils she left behind \u2013 like Noela, who was in primary school when the crisis began, and should have been well into secondary by now. She is not going to school. \u201cHer mother told her to learn a trade,\u201d Akwa said.</p> <p>The consequence of so many girls being out of school is that the rate of teenage pregnancy has shot up, community leaders say.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/11/cameroon-zip/giv-3902WIkFnRYwtsDF/\" data-alt=\"Map of area\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/11/cameroon-zip/giv-3902WIkFnRYwtsDF/\">Map of area</a> </figure>  <p>Many of the older boys whose studies were abruptly stopped began driving motorbikes to make a living. When the government banned motorbikes in much of the north-west region for several months, residents of the city of Kumbo say, many then joined the separatists.</p> <p>Fifteen-year-old George, whose name has been changed, said he had not been recruited by separatists because they valued physical strength and he was small for his age. He still wears his old blue and white school pullover to keep warm but has not been to school since 2016, instead spending his days hunting animals to sell and learning how to farm.</p> <p>\u201cI want to learn. I want to be educated, because I want to help myself in future,\u201d he said. But if school does not resume this year, he could be well into adulthood by the time he has caught up on the lost years.</p> <p>Whether they should support the back-to-school campaign has split anglophone separatists and protest leaders. A local chief was kidnapped last month as he oversaw the clean-up of one high school, <a href=\"https://mimimefoinfos.com/ntunbaw-fon-kidnapped-for-advocating-for-back-to-school/\">according to</a> the Cameroonian journalist Mimi Mefo.</p> <p>Others who spearheaded the schools boycott now advocate its end, saying the long break in education has <a href=\"https://www.chrda.org/why-schools-must-resume-in-the-anglophone-regions-of-cameroon/\">further marginalised</a> the anglophone regions.</p> <p>\u201cThe protest was to improve what we had, not to destroy the little we had,\u201d said Mancho Bibixy, one of the most prominent protest leaders.</p> <p>The headteacher of one primary school in Kumbo is thinking about reopening in September, but is caught between the demands of the government and separatists\u2019 threats.</p> <p>\u201cWe had meetings [with the government] and we were told that schools must resume this year,\u201d said the headteacher, who asked not to be named. \u201cParents want their children to stay in school but the [Amba] boys have been threatening. If security is ensured, many parents will send their children.\u201d</p> <p>Security is by no means ensured, many residents of the anglophone regions say.</p> <p>\u201cNo action is being taken to really prove they want children to go back to school. There\u2019s no preparation,\u201d said one community leader in Kumbo, who requested anonymity so he would not be targeted for speaking out. \u201cIf Unicef and other bodies could call for a ceasefire, school could resume, no problem.\u201d</p> <p>He has been holding a few conflict-specific lessons, training children to drop to the ground when they hear gunshots, and not to see joining the Amba boys as an attractive prospect.</p> <p>One head teacher has tried everything to keep her school open, but parents in Kumbo have been keeping their children home because they are worried that they will get caught in one of the gun battles between the military and rebel fighters.</p> <p>\u201cWe were able to register some 43 pupils last year at the beginning of the school year but some of them stopped coming. So we finally closed the school again,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Struggling even before the crisis, many teachers now cannot make ends meet. The Kumbo headteacher even offered lessons in the holidays \u2013 mainly to try to supplement her teachers\u2019 dwindling incomes \u2013 but worried parents forbade their children from attending, and none showed up.</p> <p>Others sent their children to Douala and Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon\u2019s two major cities.</p> <p>\u201cEven if we start this year, where would we take children from?\u201d she asked. \u201cThey are all gone.\u201d</p>",

He said I should stop it immediately, because they have declared no school in Ambaland. I was afraid. My neighbours were watching from afar. I apologised to the Amba boys and they left.\u201d Schoolchildren\u2019s studies are collateral damage in many conflicts, but in anglophone Cameroon, education was a major trigger for the crisis, and schools and those teachers still trying to work are themselves a target. Only 100 schools of 6,000 remain open, according to the Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Africa \u2013 the other 5,900 have been closed down. Unicef said 80% of schools were shut, 74 destroyed and 600,000 children affected by the school ban. The head of basic education for the north-west said school attendance had gone down from 422,000 in 2017 to 5,500 children today. Government officials have put the number of closed schools at around 3,000 and said around 200 had been burned. The government claims it was separatists that torched the schools, but the separatists say military forces destroyed many of them when they found they were being used as rebel bases. After the Amba boys left, Akwa immediately cancelled all her classes and left Bamenda, ending up in Logbessou, a neighbourhood of Douala. She found work, but struggles to make enough to live in Cameroon\u2019s biggest city. She cannot grow beans and corn there as she did in her garden at home, so she has to buy them. Sometimes she thinks about the pupils she left behind \u2013 like Noela, who was in primary school when the crisis began, and should have been well into secondary by now. She is not going to school. \u201cHer mother told her to learn a trade,\u201d Akwa said. The consequence of so many girls being out of school is that the rate of teenage pregnancy has shot up, community leaders say. Many of the older boys whose studies were abruptly stopped began driving motorbikes to make a living. When the government banned motorbikes in much of the north-west region for several months, residents of the city of Kumbo say, many then joined the separatists. Fifteen-year-old George, whose name has been changed, said he had not been recruited by separatists because they valued physical strength and he was small for his age. He still wears his old blue and white school pullover to keep warm but has not been to school since 2016, instead spending his days hunting animals to sell and learning how to farm. \u201cI want to learn. I want to be educated, because I want to help myself in future,\u201d he said. But if school does not resume this year, he could be well into adulthood by the time he has caught up on the lost years. Whether they should support the back-to-school campaign has split anglophone separatists and protest leaders. A local chief was kidnapped last month as he oversaw the clean-up of one high school, according to the Cameroonian journalist Mimi Mefo. Others who spearheaded the schools boycott now advocate its end, saying the long break in education has further marginalised the anglophone regions. \u201cThe protest was to improve what we had, not to destroy the little we had,\u201d said Mancho Bibixy, one of the most prominent protest leaders. The headteacher of one primary school in Kumbo is thinking about reopening in September, but is caught between the demands of the government and separatists\u2019 threats. \u201cWe had meetings [with the government] and we were told that schools must resume this year,\u201d said the headteacher, who asked not to be named. \u201cParents want their children to stay in school but the [Amba] boys have been threatening. If security is ensured, many parents will send their children.\u201d Security is by no means ensured, many residents of the anglophone regions say. \u201cNo action is being taken to really prove they want children to go back to school. There\u2019s no preparation,\u201d said one community leader in Kumbo, who requested anonymity so he would not be targeted for speaking out. \u201cIf Unicef and other bodies could call for a ceasefire, school could resume, no problem.\u201d He has been holding a few conflict-specific lessons, training children to drop to the ground when they hear gunshots, and not to see joining the Amba boys as an attractive prospect. One head teacher has tried everything to keep her school open, but parents in Kumbo have been keeping their children home because they are worried that they will get caught in one of the gun battles between the military and rebel fighters. \u201cWe were able to register some 43 pupils last year at the beginning of the school year but some of them stopped coming. So we finally closed the school again,\u201d she said. Struggling even before the crisis, many teachers now cannot make ends meet. The Kumbo headteacher even offered lessons in the holidays \u2013 mainly to try to supplement her teachers\u2019 dwindling incomes \u2013 but worried parents forbade their children from attending, and none showed up. Others sent their children to Douala and Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon\u2019s two major cities. \u201cEven if we start this year, where would we take children from?\u201d she asked. \u201cThey are all gone.\u201d",

According to a <a href=\"https://www.gottman.com/blog/building-great-sex-life-not-rocket-science/\" title=\"\">study</a> at the University of California, Los Angeles, couples with small children, and who both have careers, talk for just 35 minutes a week, and mainly about errands. That study, says John Gottman, \u201calarmed\u201d him and his wife, Julie. \u201cIt seemed like couples who had been together a long time were not taking care of the relationship \u2013 their curiosity in one another had died,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Gottman, the renowned relationships researcher known for his work on divorce predictors, and Julie Schwartz Gottman, a psychologist, have been married for 32 years. They founded the Gottman Institute, which conducts research and trains therapists. Their Gottman method is an approach designed to repair and deepen relationships, concentrating on three main areas \u2013 \u201cfriendship, conflict management and creation of shared meaning\u201d. They have also written many books, together and separately. Their latest book, which they wrote as a couple, is Eight Dates. It guides couples through eight conversations \u2013 to have on dedicated dates \u2013 on the big issues such as sex, parenting and how to handle conflict.

      "bodyText": "How often do we really talk to our partners? About the big stuff, not about childcare arrangements, or what the funny noise coming from the fridge means? According to a study at the University of California, Los Angeles, couples with small children, and who both have careers, talk for just 35 minutes a week, and mainly about errands. That study, says John Gottman, \u201calarmed\u201d him and his wife, Julie. \u201cIt seemed like couples who had been together a long time were not taking care of the relationship \u2013 their curiosity in one another had died,\u201d he says. Gottman, the renowned relationships researcher known for his work on divorce predictors, and Julie Schwartz Gottman, a psychologist, have been married for 32 years. They founded the Gottman Institute, which conducts research and trains therapists. Their Gottman method is an approach designed to repair and deepen relationships, concentrating on three main areas \u2013 \u201cfriendship, conflict management and creation of shared meaning\u201d. They have also written many books, together and separately. Their latest book, which they wrote as a couple, is Eight Dates. It guides couples through eight conversations \u2013 to have on dedicated dates \u2013 on the big issues such as sex, parenting and how to handle conflict. It was partly sparked by the rise of online dating and to provide new couples with a roadmap to navigate tricky subjects, but mainly to give long-term couples a project to steer their relationship to a better place. \u201cCouples who have been together for quite a long time create a relationship that grows stale with time, and they lose track of one another,\u201d says Julie. \u201cPeople evolve over time. They change.\u201d The categories \u2013 trust, conflict, sex, money, family, fun, spirituality and dreams \u2013 came out of the Gottmans\u2019 years of observing the flashpoints in relationships, and they sent 300 heterosexual and same-sex couples out to test the dates.

They are the kids I went to the local comprehensive with, the family who raised me on the council estates of Dover. Those in lower-paid, insecure work are more at risk of losing their job if the potential pile-up of 8,000 vehicles causes them to be late. </p> <p>The white cliffs of Dover have long been considered a bastion of Britishness. But Dover has suffered under years of austerity and a lack of investment that has left people even more exposed should the worst happen. Not only will we see the chaos build up in front of us, potentially for months, but the worst off will feel it in their wallets too. It\u2019s true that 62% of people in Dover voted for Brexit, but I do not believe for one second that any of them voted for this, that any of those people wanted to see their hometown and livelihoods plunged into mayhem \u2013 they wanted to see their lives improved, as many there so urgently need them to be.</p> <p>The leave campaign worked so well in places like Dover because it played to the desire for change. Now the only changes people from my hometown will see are ones that will make their lives worse, not better.</p> <p>People in Dover deserve certainty, clarity, reassurance and representation. They are getting none of that at the moment. Boris Johnson and the Brexit elite are doing their utmost to shut down debate. Now Dover\u2019s future rests on the shoulders of the MPs who will try on Tuesday to prevent no deal.

People in Dover won\u2019t be watching the news to see what happens on 1 November, they will be seeing it with their own eyes. As the risk of leaving the EU without a deal has become increasingly more likely, the concern for my hometown has increased. This is why Sunday night\u2019s Sky News report felt so alarming. An analysis \u2013 commissioned by the Department for Transport itself \u2013 suggests that in the event of no deal, lorries and freight vehicles could be delayed for up to two days at Dover, with the best-case scenario being two to three hours. At the moment it is two to three minutes. This would in effect turn Dover into a car park. The small amount of funding promised by the government will do little to fix the disruption to people\u2019s lives. People would struggle to get to work, to the town centre, to go about their lives in a normal way. Local businesses would suffer. Residents would have to plan every journey with the potential for it to take 10 times longer than usual. As always, the people bearing the brunt of the disruption would be the worst off. They are the kids I went to the local comprehensive with, the family who raised me on the council estates of Dover. Those in lower-paid, insecure work are more at risk of losing their job if the potential pile-up of 8,000 vehicles causes them to be late. The white cliffs of Dover have long been considered a bastion of Britishness. But Dover has suffered under years of austerity and a lack of investment that has left people even more exposed should the worst happen. Not only will we see the chaos build up in front of us, potentially for months, but the worst off will feel it in their wallets too. It\u2019s true that 62% of people in Dover voted for Brexit, but I do not believe for one second that any of them voted for this, that any of those people wanted to see their hometown and livelihoods plunged into mayhem \u2013 they wanted to see their lives improved, as many there so urgently need them to be. The leave campaign worked so well in places like Dover because it played to the desire for change. Now the only changes people from my hometown will see are ones that will make their lives worse, not better. People in Dover deserve certainty, clarity, reassurance and representation. They are getting none of that at the moment. Boris Johnson and the Brexit elite are doing their utmost to shut down debate. Now Dover\u2019s future rests on the shoulders of the MPs who will try on Tuesday to prevent no deal. I hope, for the sake of my hometown and everyone there, that they succeed. \u2022 Richard Brooks is co-founder of the campaign group For our Future\u2019s Sake",

      "bodyText": "The Testaments, Margaret Atwood\u2019s much-anticipated sequel to her feminist dystopia The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, has landed her a place on the Booker prize shortlist \u2013 despite the fact that barely anyone has read it yet. With little publicly known beyond that it is set more than 15 years after Atwood\u2019s hero Offred attempted to escape a theocratic future US, the plot of The Testaments remains under lock and key for most readers until its global release date on 10 September, with midnight launches and bookshop parties planned around the world. Chair of judges and Hay festival director Peter Florence said it was an \u201cextraordinarily complicated process\u201d to get copies of the manuscript, which is protected by a \u201cferocious\u201d non-disclosure agreement. He could not say more than that it is a \u201csavage and beautiful novel, and it speaks to us today, all around the world, with particular conviction and power\u201d. \u201cThe bar is set particularly high for Atwood and she soars over it,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for everyone to read it.\u201d This is the sixth Booker nomination for the Canadian author, who won the \u2019 prize in 2000 for The Blind Assassin. She is set to face off against another former winner, Salman Rushdie, who is nominated for Quichotte, a retelling of Cervantes\u2019 Don Quixote set in today\u2019s US.

If I have a choice, the first thing [I would do] is to quit, having made a deep apology,\u201d Lam is heard saying in the recording. The remarks suggested Beijing has been directing the Hong Kong government\u2019s response to months of mass protests that have plunged the semi-autonomous territory into its worst political crisis since it was returned to Chinese control in 1997. Over the last three months of protests, which began over a bill that would allow extradition to mainland China and has since turned into a broader democracy movement that has challenged Beijing\u2019s authority over the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.

On Tuesday, riot police patrolled the city as protesters vowed to come out again and students continued a class boycott that started on Monday. In a video posted online, police were seen chasing secondary school students and tackling one to the ground. More than 200 students and alumni of the the Church of Christ in China Ming Yin College formed a human chain around the school chanting: \u201cReclaim Hong Kong!\u201d The group scattered after a report that police were coming to the scene, according to public broadcaster RTHK. Police, who have now arrested more than 1,000 people since June, detained several organisers, including student union president Keith Fong of Baptist University, who has been supportive of the boycott. Fong was detained Monday night for alleged theft while police arrested Ivan Lam, chairman of the pro-democracy political organisation Demosisto as he arrived at the Hong Kong airport on Tuesday morning. Michael Mo, who helped organise marches in the New Territories, was detained at his home on suspicion of illegal assembly, according to a statement released by a friend. As the protests continue with few signs of stopping, the government has hinted it could deploy an emergency ordinance that gives Lam sweeping powers to restore \u201cpublic order\u201d. The colonial era law, last used to put down riots in 1967, mean the government could censor media and suppress communications, as well as arrest, detain, deport and search residents as it deems necessary. Lam refused to rule out the use of the law, saying: \u201cAs a government we have the responsibility to see what we have in our existent law that can deal with the unrest. If the violence calms down then there would be no need to do this.\u201d",

The two parties unveiled a shared policy programme on Tuesday to serve as the basis of a new coalition government, putting an expansionary 2020 budget at the top of their agenda. The traditional foes have agreed to form a new administration to head off snap elections after the previous administration comprising M5S and the far-right League collapsed last month. About 100,000 people who subscribe to M5S\u2019s Rousseau website had from 9am until 6pm on Tuesday to answer the question: \u201cDo you agree that the Five Star Movement should form a government together with the Democratic party, chaired by [the prime minister] Giuseppe Conte?\u201d About 30,000 voted in the first two hours, according to the organisation that runs the M5S platform.

The M5S senate whip, Stefano Patuanelli, said on Monday that if a majority of participants in the polls voted no then Conte would have to tell the president, Sergio Mattarella, that his attempt to form a government had failed. The M5S leader, Luigi Di Maio, told a meeting of his deputies that everything depended on the Rousseau vote. Web-based direct democracy has been one of M5S\u2019s core principles since it was founded in 2009 by the comedian Beppe Grillo and Gianroberto Casaleggio, an entrepreneur who died three years ago. In its early years, the movement used its website and Grillo\u2019s blog to debate and hold votes before Rousseau, a purpose-built platform named after the 18th-century Swiss-born philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, was developed and introduced in 2016. But the system has been plagued by hacking attacks during key votes, and in April Italy\u2019s data protection authority fined the company that runs the platform \u20ac50,000 (\u00a345,000) for failing to protect users\u2019 personal details. M5S has held dozens of online votes on key decisions, including one to elect Di Maio and another on whether to enter its previous coalition with the League. The most recent online ballot was on whether to vote in parliament to defend the League\u2019s leader, Matteo Salvini, from prosecution for preventing migrants disembarking from an Italian coastguard ship. Italy was plunged into chaos last month when Salvini withdrew the League from its fractious alliance with M5S, as he sought to exploit his party\u2019s popularity to bring about snap elections and become prime minister. The dramatic move threatened to create a fully far-right government. But Salvini, whose tactics have dented his popularity in recent weeks, had not banked on M5S teaming up with the PD. Though the two parties are longstanding enemies, they are also the two largest parties in parliament. If Conte fails to form a new government, Mattarella is likely to call for new elections.

      "body": "<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is thrown into conversations about the future of business tech with increasing frequency. Many enterprises now have programmers beavering away on bespoke algorithms to automate tasks or services, which they hope will give them a competitive advantage. These algorithms are trained on vast data sets and eventually learn how to correctly identify common patterns without human intervention. They take time to design, and they don\u2019t come cheap. But that doesn\u2019t mean AI is purely for the big beasts of the business world.</p> <p>While they may not have the funds to hire a team of data scientists, smaller companies can still take advantage of \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d AI. These tools are designed to improve everything from sales and marketing to customer service, and they\u2019re available from both startups and major technology vendors. They can automate repetitive admin tasks such as updating customer records, unlock new business insights, and free employees to perform more interesting work. And, compared with bespoke solutions, they can be implemented relatively easily.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c492ecae38a51d40f557ac36ce0542f635e3a410\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c492ecae38a51d40f557ac36ce0542f635e3a410/61_0_1939_2423/800.jpg\" alt=\"V2 Crop AI Business\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>An off-the-shelf chatbot, for example, can answer common customer questions through a website, app or text message. As well as providing customers with a 24/7 point of contact, they can reduce the burden on human staff and make the company seem more responsive. However, Shivani Govil, EVP ecosystems and emerging tech at Sage, says businesses should always keep their brand in mind when using one. \u201cBe transparent and let your customers know when they are speaking to a machine; this will help to manage expectations,\u201d she says. \u201cEqually, ensure you have a human on hand to take over when the robot isn\u2019t providing the right or expected customer experience.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith automated data capture tools, which use AI-powered optical character recognition to scan receipts, paperwork will soon be a thing of the past,\u201d says Johnnie Ball, co-founder and chief data officer at <a href=\"https://fluidly.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fluidly</a>, which provides AI-powered cashflow management software.</p> <p>Estimating cash inflow and outflow is a time-consuming process that\u2019s often prone to human error. \u201cMany businesses operate in a state of unawareness too, without any knowledge of what\u2019s coming around the corner,\u201d says Ball. But with AI-driven tools like Fluidly, algorithms pick up the heavy lifting of cashflow forecasting. \u201cThis can have a far-reaching impact for SMEs,\u201d he says, \u201cgiving greater visibility of their future finances and allowing for decisions to be taken ahead of time.\u201d</p> <p>AI can also help companies win new customers and deepen existing relationships. For example, Salesforce\u2019s Einstein AI can help predict which sales leads and opportunities are the most likely to convert, how marketing emails will perform, and tailor offers based on the lead\u2019s interests or past behaviours. Other AI tools allow you to monitor competitors\u2019 social media channels and websites for changes in pricing or marketing tactics, or sift through job applications to find the best match for the role.</p> <p>In October 2018, the tech accelerator programme Wayra (part of the Telef\u00f3nica Open Future global innovation network) also launched a <a href=\"https://www.wayra.co.uk/programs/ai-blockchain-accelerator\" rel=\"nofollow\">new programme</a> focused solely on AI and Blockchain startups. It aims to provide support for companies building AI solutions that are better and cheaper than existing products, some of which could benefit SMEs in future. But, like all AI tools, they\u2019ll need good data to deliver good results.</p> <p>As Ball says: \u201cFor SMEs to get the most out of AI, it\u2019s essential to build a strong foundation of clean, well-organised data.\u201d This means it\u2019s vital for organisations to have a secure system, such as<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.o2.co.uk/business/solutions/connectivity/o2-gateway\" rel=\"nofollow\">O2 Gateway</a>, to provide the network for the access and collection of data. Without the correct infrastructure in place, utilising advanced tech such as AI becomes increasingly difficult.</p> <p>Most data falls into one of two categories: structured and unstructured. The former includes numbers and dates, usually stored in a database, which a computer can easily understand. The latter includes videos, audio files and presentations, which are harder to process and analyse. SMEs need to ensure both types are stored and processed in a consistent manner in order to get the most from AI.</p> <p>Along with good data, companies should also have a strong business case for using the technology. For example, how much will a certain tool cost? What\u2019s the return on investment? And how long will it take to set up? As Tabitha Goldstaub, co-founder of CognitionX, an AI advice platform, says: \u201cThe amount of time it takes to actually start using AI can differ drastically, depending on how complex the project is, what resources and effort are needed to integrate AI products or bespoke solutions into your existing business, and other factors.</p> <p>\u201cIf you are looking to do a large-scale project, you might want to include the costs of technical consultants and others who will be involved in the implementation, and bear in mind that innovating with new products can often have unexpected complications.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s possible these complications could come in the form of employees who are confused or sceptical about the benefits of AI. \u201cAI can make your business more productive, reach more customers, and make more money, but only if you invest in your staff alongside investing in technology,\u201d says Goldstaub. Businesses that want to adopt AI should therefore focus on retraining and reskilling current staff as much as hiring people with data science expertise. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that ultimately your non-technical team interacting with the machines must be allowed the time to assimilate, and feel empowered, not inhibited, by this new technology.\u201d</p> <p>Specialist help is available from initiatives such as the Data Innovation Accelerator, which provides Welsh SMEs with access to data science expertise. CognitionX is also working with the mayor of London on a programme that will help small and medium-sized London-based retail and hospitality businesses benefit from AI solutions. Eligible businesses can apply for free access to funding, information and support through the <a href=\"https://www.growthhub.london/technology/ai-for-smes/\" rel=\"nofollow\">London Growth Hub</a>.</p> <p>Announcing the initiative, Sadiq Khan said: \u201cSmall businesses are the lifeblood of our economy, and I firmly believe these innovations should be available to companies of all sizes, not just the ones with the deepest pockets.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, AI isn\u2019t just for the big beasts. When it\u2019s broken down into off-the-shelf solutions and help and advice can come from technology vendors, it is possible to take the intimidation out of this innovative technology.</p>",

However, Shivani Govil, EVP ecosystems and emerging tech at Sage, says businesses should always keep their brand in mind when using one. \u201cBe transparent and let your customers know when they are speaking to a machine; this will help to manage expectations,\u201d she says. \u201cEqually, ensure you have a human on hand to take over when the robot isn\u2019t providing the right or expected customer experience.\u201d \u201cWith automated data capture tools, which use AI-powered optical character recognition to scan receipts, paperwork will soon be a thing of the past,\u201d says Johnnie Ball, co-founder and chief data officer at Fluidly, which provides AI-powered cashflow management software. Estimating cash inflow and outflow is a time-consuming process that\u2019s often prone to human error. \u201cMany businesses operate in a state of unawareness too, without any knowledge of what\u2019s coming around the corner,\u201d says Ball. But with AI-driven tools like Fluidly, algorithms pick up the heavy lifting of cashflow forecasting. \u201cThis can have a far-reaching impact for SMEs,\u201d he says, \u201cgiving greater visibility of their future finances and allowing for decisions to be taken ahead of time.\u201d AI can also help companies win new customers and deepen existing relationships. For example, Salesforce\u2019s Einstein AI can help predict which sales leads and opportunities are the most likely to convert, how marketing emails will perform, and tailor offers based on the lead\u2019s interests or past behaviours. Other AI tools allow you to monitor competitors\u2019 social media channels and websites for changes in pricing or marketing tactics, or sift through job applications to find the best match for the role. In October 2018, the tech accelerator programme Wayra (part of the Telef\u00f3nica Open Future global innovation network) also launched a new programme focused solely on AI and Blockchain startups. It aims to provide support for companies building AI solutions that are better and cheaper than existing products, some of which could benefit SMEs in future. But, like all AI tools, they\u2019ll need good data to deliver good results. As Ball says: \u201cFor SMEs to get the most out of AI, it\u2019s essential to build a strong foundation of clean, well-organised data.\u201d This means it\u2019s vital for organisations to have a secure system, such as O2 Gateway, to provide the network for the access and collection of data. Without the correct infrastructure in place, utilising advanced tech such as AI becomes increasingly difficult. Most data falls into one of two categories: structured and unstructured. The former includes numbers and dates, usually stored in a database, which a computer can easily understand. The latter includes videos, audio files and presentations, which are harder to process and analyse. SMEs need to ensure both types are stored and processed in a consistent manner in order to get the most from AI. Along with good data, companies should also have a strong business case for using the technology. For example, how much will a certain tool cost? What\u2019s the return on investment? And how long will it take to set up? As Tabitha Goldstaub, co-founder of CognitionX, an AI advice platform, says: \u201cThe amount of time it takes to actually start using AI can differ drastically, depending on how complex the project is, what resources and effort are needed to integrate AI products or bespoke solutions into your existing business, and other factors. \u201cIf you are looking to do a large-scale project, you might want to include the costs of technical consultants and others who will be involved in the implementation, and bear in mind that innovating with new products can often have unexpected complications.\u201d It\u2019s possible these complications could come in the form of employees who are confused or sceptical about the benefits of AI. \u201cAI can make your business more productive, reach more customers, and make more money, but only if you invest in your staff alongside investing in technology,\u201d says Goldstaub. Businesses that want to adopt AI should therefore focus on retraining and reskilling current staff as much as hiring people with data science expertise. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that ultimately your non-technical team interacting with the machines must be allowed the time to assimilate, and feel empowered, not inhibited, by this new technology.\u201d Specialist help is available from initiatives such as the Data Innovation Accelerator, which provides Welsh SMEs with access to data science expertise. CognitionX is also working with the mayor of London on a programme that will help small and medium-sized London-based retail and hospitality businesses benefit from AI solutions. Eligible businesses can apply for free access to funding, information and support through the London Growth Hub. Announcing the initiative, Sadiq Khan said: \u201cSmall businesses are the lifeblood of our economy, and I firmly believe these innovations should be available to companies of all sizes, not just the ones with the deepest pockets.\u201d In other words, AI isn\u2019t just for the big beasts. When it\u2019s broken down into off-the-shelf solutions and help and advice can come from technology vendors, it is possible to take the intimidation out of this innovative technology.",

      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond has said he is gearing up for the \u201cfight of a lifetime\u201d against deselection threats and government aggression as he leads the Conservative rebel charge to stop a no-deal Brexit in parliament. The former chancellor vowed to defend the Tories from the \u201cincomers and entryists\u201d he believes are controlling the party, and said there were enough Tory rebels to back a cross-party bill to delay Brexit. He believes he and Tory colleagues now have the numbers in parliament to pass a bill despite his claim that government whips are using an \u201caggressive operation\u201d to threaten people not to rebel. He also said he would explore legal action if moves were made to remove him as a Conservative MP and described the prime minister\u2019s belief he could renegotiate the backstop arrangement as \u201cnonsense\u201d. Hammond told the Radio 4 Today programme: \u201cThere\u2019s a group of Conservatives who feel very strongly that now is the time where we have to put the national interest ahead of any threats to us personally and our careers. \u201cI think there will be enough people for us to get this over the line.\u201d Conservatives who rebel against Boris Johnson and back legislation intended to block no deal are expected to have the whip withdrawn and effectively be thrown out of the party.

But the fact is we can\u2019t know for certain because the UK constitution is a fluid interpretation of codes, conventions and case law. Despite having influenced many constitutions around the world, we are one of only a handful of countries without such a written document of our own. The <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/68/contents\" title=\"\">European Communities Act 1972</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/contents\" title=\"\">Human Rights Act 1998</a> come close in terms of placing limits on executive power, but both are under immediate threat from the current occupants of No 10.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/30/boris-johnson-prorogue-parliament-scottish-judge\">Scottish judge refuses to block Johnson proroguing parliament</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Constitutions of any kind are statements of expression and intent, typically borne out of moments of crisis and revolution. Britain\u2019s comes from 1641, the last time that a leader joked about wanting to be \u201cworld king\u201d and attempted to shut down parliament when MPs blocked his way with the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Triennial-Act-England-1641\" title=\"\">Triennial Act</a>. A few decades later, the English and Scottish parliaments united in 1707 after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/sep/24/uk.books\" title=\"\">\u201ca parcel of rogues\u201d in Edinburgh</a> effectively sold Scotland to settle their own bad debts incurred trying to colonise elsewhere in the world. The recurrent narrative, both now and historically, is one of constitutional change being done to or for the people, not with us.</p> <p>Today, the UK constitution is still a piecemeal collection of conventions and common law open to misuse and abuse. The current crisis demands that we put this right and agree a written constitution that clarifies beyond doubt the separation of legislative, judicial and executive powers and the role, if any, of the monarchy. This would be hugely preferable to the current situation, which requires expensive judicial reviews to decipher the blurring of legal and political power.</p> <p>However a written constitution won\u2019t be a panacea. It will need to be a living document with the flexibility to be interpreted as the world changes. Recent debates on gun control in the US and the right to self-determination in Catalonia demonstrate that constitutions can also be barriers to change if they do not allow for contemporary amendments.</p> <p>There is much to learn from the ways in which other countries have gone about the process. In Iceland, following economic collapse in 2008, the crowdsourcing of a written constitution began with people sitting down to talk about the basic values they shared with their neighbours. By and large, the Icelandic drafting was not done by constitutional law experts \u2013 members of the public were selected by ballot and included a farmer, a truck driver, a pastor, a film-maker, a student and the director of an art museum. Conversations took place in town halls, on social media and even in knitting circles. The resulting Icelandic Constitutional Council opted to give legal personality to nature itself. This in turn was based on the Ecuadorian concept of <em>Pachamama </em>(world mother).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A new constitution might begin with a preamble setting out shared values such as equality, diversity and even kindness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ecuador was the first country to <a href=\"http://www.fdsd.org/ideas/ecuadorian-constitution-rights-to-nature/\" title=\"\">recognise the </a><a href=\"http://www.fdsd.org/ideas/ecuadorian-constitution-rights-to-nature/\" title=\"\">rights of </a><a href=\"http://www.fdsd.org/ideas/ecuadorian-constitution-rights-to-nature/\" title=\"\">nature</a> in its constitution. Rather than treating nature as property under the law, the constitutional articles acknowledge that nature in all its life forms has \u201cthe right to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles. The environment can be named as a legal party with standing in the justiciability of rights.\u201d If this all sounds a bit too \u201cEarth mother\u201d for the British public, it\u2019s worth noting that entities such as companies have long held legal personality.</p> <p>It is tempting to dwell on the domestic political drama, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/02/amazon-destruction-earth-brazilian-kayapo-people\" title=\"\">as the Amazon burns</a>, we don\u2019t have time to waste arguing about 17th-century codes and conventions. We need to get our house in order. That begins with a hopeful and declaratory vow to one another \u2013 a sort of post-Brexit truce or social contract \u2013 in the form of a new constitution.</p> <p>Such a constitution might begin with a preamble setting out shared values such as equality, diversity and even kindness. This would capture the public imagination and affirm a collective endeavour to look out for one another and the natural world. In this way, it would be a 21st-century take on the pursuit of happiness found in the <a href=\"http://www.ushistory.org/Declaration/document/\" title=\"\">US Declaration of Independence</a>. And rather than the Latin favoured by lawyers, the language of the articles within our new constitution must be clear and relatable to the people it protects. This is where the aspirations of the preamble would be incorporated into rights directly enforceable in the courts.</p> <p>The drafting process itself could prove a useful tool for pulling the country back together. The conversations it prompts will be as important as the text itself. If fully inclusive and participatory at a local level, by means of the citizen assemblies or mini publics that function well in Ireland, it can provide an opportunity to revive a sense of common purpose that has been sadly missing since the Brexit vote. And it will help to renew our credibility on the international stage.

      "bodyText": "Who would have thought that a niche constitutional verb would be the word of the moment? We\u2019ve known this mess was coming for months, but it doesn\u2019t make it any less galling as the word prorogue dominates the debate. So are the prime minister\u2019s actions unconstitutional? I think so \u2013 and there is a case at the Scottish court of session due to be heard on Tuesday to determine that question. But the fact is we can\u2019t know for certain because the UK constitution is a fluid interpretation of codes, conventions and case law. Despite having influenced many constitutions around the world, we are one of only a handful of countries without such a written document of our own. The European Communities Act 1972 and the Human Rights Act 1998 come close in terms of placing limits on executive power, but both are under immediate threat from the current occupants of No 10. Constitutions of any kind are statements of expression and intent, typically borne out of moments of crisis and revolution. Britain\u2019s comes from 1641, the last time that a leader joked about wanting to be \u201cworld king\u201d and attempted to shut down parliament when MPs blocked his way with the Triennial Act. A few decades later, the English and Scottish parliaments united in 1707 after \u201ca parcel of rogues\u201d in Edinburgh effectively sold Scotland to settle their own bad debts incurred trying to colonise elsewhere in the world. The recurrent narrative, both now and historically, is one of constitutional change being done to or for the people, not with us. Today, the UK constitution is still a piecemeal collection of conventions and common law open to misuse and abuse. The current crisis demands that we put this right and agree a written constitution that clarifies beyond doubt the separation of legislative, judicial and executive powers and the role, if any, of the monarchy. This would be hugely preferable to the current situation, which requires expensive judicial reviews to decipher the blurring of legal and political power. However a written constitution won\u2019t be a panacea. It will need to be a living document with the flexibility to be interpreted as the world changes. Recent debates on gun control in the US and the right to self-determination in Catalonia demonstrate that constitutions can also be barriers to change if they do not allow for contemporary amendments. There is much to learn from the ways in which other countries have gone about the process. In Iceland, following economic collapse in 2008, the crowdsourcing of a written constitution began with people sitting down to talk about the basic values they shared with their neighbours. By and large, the Icelandic drafting was not done by constitutional law experts \u2013 members of the public were selected by ballot and included a farmer, a truck driver, a pastor, a film-maker, a student and the director of an art museum. Conversations took place in town halls, on social media and even in knitting circles. The resulting Icelandic Constitutional Council opted to give legal personality to nature itself. This in turn was based on the Ecuadorian concept of Pachamama (world mother). Ecuador was the first country to recognise the rights of nature in its constitution. Rather than treating nature as property under the law, the constitutional articles acknowledge that nature in all its life forms has \u201cthe right to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles. The environment can be named as a legal party with standing in the justiciability of rights.\u201d If this all sounds a bit too \u201cEarth mother\u201d for the British public, it\u2019s worth noting that entities such as companies have long held legal personality. It is tempting to dwell on the domestic political drama, but as the Amazon burns, we don\u2019t have time to waste arguing about 17th-century codes and conventions. We need to get our house in order. That begins with a hopeful and declaratory vow to one another \u2013 a sort of post-Brexit truce or social contract \u2013 in the form of a new constitution. Such a constitution might begin with a preamble setting out shared values such as equality, diversity and even kindness. This would capture the public imagination and affirm a collective endeavour to look out for one another and the natural world. In this way, it would be a 21st-century take on the pursuit of happiness found in the US Declaration of Independence. And rather than the Latin favoured by lawyers, the language of the articles within our new constitution must be clear and relatable to the people it protects. This is where the aspirations of the preamble would be incorporated into rights directly enforceable in the courts. The drafting process itself could prove a useful tool for pulling the country back together. The conversations it prompts will be as important as the text itself. If fully inclusive and participatory at a local level, by means of the citizen assemblies or mini publics that function well in Ireland, it can provide an opportunity to revive a sense of common purpose that has been sadly missing since the Brexit vote. And it will help to renew our credibility on the international stage. It will be about plurality of voices not the populist, dangerous notion of the \u201cwill of the people\u201d. Brexit laid bare deep social divisions that have long existed. Now is the moment for the UK to ask itself some soul-searching questions about the kind of country, or countries, it wants to be. To be fully constituted means to stand together. Standing together, neighbour by neighbour, street by street, at this critical juncture, we are ready to do things differently.

      "bodyText": "On 15 August 2005, around 6pm, in that fug of early motherhood, I pushed my 15-month-old daughter out of the ground at Old Trafford and down the Great Stone Road. Away we went, buggy and all, away from one of the greatest Ashes Tests. Why I did not stay that extra half-hour and watch the last gasps I cannot remember \u2013 I think I was worried that she was hungry or tired \u2013 but what does stick with me is the noise that followed us the two miles home, roars and gasps tracing every step to the front door \u2013 still the only time I can remember hearing the cricket ground from our street, though aural flotsam and jetsam from the other Old Trafford often flies by on the wind. That morning the queues for the final day had started long before dawn \u2013 Lancashire had set the prices at \u00a310 for adults and \u00a35 for juniors in the hope that a few people would turn up on what was forecast to be a sunny day. By 8.30am the gates were closed with 20,000 locked outside and the England team ran out to warm up in front of a full house for the first time in their lives. After the two-run thriller at Edgbaston cricket fever had started to spread with seismic speed and centuries from Michael Vaughan, Andrew Strauss and a 600th wicket for Shane Warne had only stoked the mood \u2013 on a workday Monday nearly eight million people were watching on television. It was a mini epic as Australia attempted to bat out for the draw \u2013 spearheaded by Ricky Ponting\u2019s chanceless 156 against a ball reverse\u2011swinging at 90mph and Andrew Flintoff and Simon Jones at the height of their powers. When Ponting was finally out (just after I had left) the No 11, Glenn McGrath, and Brett Lee somehow saw out the final four overs. Australia celebrated as if they had won, something seized on by Vaughan, and at Trent Bridge a week later England inched into the lead and finally, famously, regained the Ashes thanks to some Kevin Pietersen sorcery at the Oval. But despite its No 1 status in the Old Trafford Test pantheon \u2013 a claim that may have raised a modest eyebrow from Jim Laker, whose 19 for 90 in 1956 was not all bad \u2013 England did not win in 2005. In fact England have not beaten Australia at Old Trafford since ye olde 1981, when a fresh-faced, neatly bearded, slim, helmetless Ian Botham put on his spurs and gracefully slashed Australia for 118 \u2013 the innings he and Mike Brearley consider the greatest of his career. A wander down YouTube\u2019s memory lane reveals a perfect gem, something even better than in the mind\u2019s eye \u2013 a cavalier in a short\u2011sleeved cable knit blind\u2011hooking Dennis Lillee off his eyebrows and driving on tiptoe as Richie Benaud quietly, and repeatedly, despairs: \u201cThey really musn\u2019t give this fellow room to play outside the off stump.\u201d Old Trafford looks on ecstatic, vast open stands and a few tin shacks, with what looks like factory chimneys and Del Boy\u2019s car lot in the background.

The court and the state\u2019s administrative tribunal have both thrown out Cilla Carden\u2019s complaints about her neighbours, including their cooking smells, cigarette smoke, chairs scraping on concrete, reflective light and the sounds of children playing basketball and pet birds. Carden, a massage therapist who lives at Girrawheen in Perth\u2019s north, says the ongoing dispute has robbed her of quality of life and claimed her neighbours actions are deliberate. \u201cThey\u2019ve put it there so I smell fish, all I can smell is fish,\u201d Carden told Nine. \u201cI can\u2019t enjoy my backyard, I can\u2019t go out there.\u201d She says she hasn\u2019t been able to sleep and just wants to live her life in peace. The legal saga has dragged on since August 2017.

Supreme court chief justice Peter Quinlan dismissed Carden\u2019s appeal last month. He ruled after considering all material he was not satisfied \u201cthat there is an arguable case that the tribunal denied Ms Carden procedural fairness or acted to her disadvantage so as to cause a miscarriage of justice\u201d. \u201cMs Carden was given a fair opportunity to present her case, and the learned tribunal member conducted the proceedings fairly and appropriately,\u201d the judgment said.

Abortion has been a criminal offence in New South Wales since 1900, and unlawfully procuring an abortion is punishable by up to 10 years' imprisonment. Doctors are able to conduct abortions if they believe the pregnancy is a risk to a woman\u2019s physical or mental health, and a common law precedent set in 1971 means social and economic factors may also be taken into consideration. Laws before the NSW parliament would make abortion legal on request up to 22 weeks, and with the approval of two doctors beyond that.</p>\n    <p><b>Queensland</b><br>The NSW legislation is based off the bill that passed in Queensland last year. Abortion is legal until 22 weeks gestation, and thereafter with the approval of two doctors.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Victoria</b><br>Legal to 24 weeks and then after 24 weeks with two doctors\u2019 approval.</p>\n    <p><b>ACT</b><br>Legal. Until last year, only a registered medical practitioner could carry out the procedure in an approved facility. However a change to ACT law last year now allows general practitioners to prescribe abortion drugs such as MS\u20112 Step.</p>\n    <p><b>South Australia</b><br>Legal up to 28 weeks but only if two doctors agree that a woman\u2019s physical and/or mental health is endangered by pregnancy, or for serious foetal abnormality. Unlawful abortion remains a crime. Terminations must be performed in a \"prescribed hospital\".</p>\n    <p><b>Western Australia</b><br>Legal up to 20 weeks but women must be given the opportunity to participate in counselling before a termination can be performed. Teenage girls under 16 require a parent to be informed. After 20 weeks, terminations become much more difficult to access. A woman must receive approval from two doctors from a statutory panel of six who agree the woman, or her foetus, has a \"severe medical condition\" that justifies the procedure.<br></p>\n    <p><b>Tasmania</b><br>Lawful on request up to 16 weeks, and beyond that point with the agreement of two doctors.<br></p>\n    <p><b>Northern Territory</b><br>Legal to 14 weeks with one doctor's approval, and after that to 23 weeks with an additional doctor. Beyond 23 weeks, abortions cannot be performed unless it is performed to save a pregnant person's life.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThis means, we will disconnect ourselves from the leadership of the Liberals and Nationals which means the government goes into minority government.\u201d</p> \n<p>Davies was referring to the Riverstone MP, Kevin Conolly, another fierce opponent of abortion law reform.</p> \n<p>Conolly said on Wednesday the nature of the bill, the way it was introduced to parliament and its \u201cexpedited\u201d passage had placed him in an \u201cuntenable position\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIdeally, this extreme bill should be defeated outright and a new proper process commenced which would allow the community time to have input,\u201d he said in a statement.</p> \n<p>The Reproductive Healthcare Reform bill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/08/nsw-abortion-bill-passes-first-hurdle\">easily passed the parliament\u2019s lower house 59 to 31 last month</a>.</p> \n<p>It was due to be voted through the upper house before Berejiklian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/20/nsw-abortion-bill-delayed-until-september-amid-liberal-division\">agreed to delay its passage</a> after a split within her party over the legislation.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/24/open-revolt-how-the-nsw-liberals-peace-deal-imploded-over-abortion\">How the NSW Liberals' peace deal imploded over abortion</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The bill has caused huge divisions within the Liberal party, pitting moderates including Berejiklian, the health minister, Brad Hazzard, and the transport minister, Andrew Constance, against the police minister, David Elliott, and the corrections minister, Anthony Roberts.</p> \n<p>MPs opposed to abortion reform including Davies and Conolly have fought to make significant changes to the draft legislation, including removing provisions which require doctors who have a conscientious objection to performing the procedure to refer patients elsewhere.</p> \n<p>Opponents have also seized on the so-called \u201cgender selection\u201d issue ahead of the vote next week, despite expert medical, legal and women\u2019s groups <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/19/nsw-abortion-law-the-decriminalisation-reform-bill-explained\">saying there is no evidence the practice is an issue in NSW</a>.</p> \n<p>Conservatives outside the parliament have also railed against the bill.

      "bodyText": "Two New South Wales Liberal party MPs have threatened to move to the crossbench if the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, refuses to cave to their demands for amendments on a bill to decriminalise abortion. The conservative Liberal MPs Tanya Davies and Kevin Conolly have told Berejiklian they will no longer sit in the party room if amendments to the bill are not passed. If they followed through, it would push the Liberal party into minority government less than a year after it won a slim majority against expectations at the last state election in March. Davies told a public meeting on Monday night that she had told Berejiklian she would \u201cseparate herself from the government\u201d if amendments including a ban on gender selection were not passed. Davies was speaking at a Cathedral Conversations event at St John\u2019s Anglican Cathedral in Parramatta on Monday night and was quoted as saying she and another MP would \u201cremove ourselves from the party room\u201d. \u201cI am one of those two, and there is another colleague of mine, who have told the premier and the deputy premier that if they do not make essential amendments to this bill, we will remove ourselves from the party room,\u201d Davies was quoted as saying. \u201cThis means, we will disconnect ourselves from the leadership of the Liberals and Nationals which means the government goes into minority government.\u201d Davies was referring to the Riverstone MP, Kevin Conolly, another fierce opponent of abortion law reform. Conolly said on Wednesday the nature of the bill, the way it was introduced to parliament and its \u201cexpedited\u201d passage had placed him in an \u201cuntenable position\u201d. \u201cIdeally, this extreme bill should be defeated outright and a new proper process commenced which would allow the community time to have input,\u201d he said in a statement. The Reproductive Healthcare Reform bill easily passed the parliament\u2019s lower house 59 to 31 last month. It was due to be voted through the upper house before Berejiklian agreed to delay its passage after a split within her party over the legislation. The bill has caused huge divisions within the Liberal party, pitting moderates including Berejiklian, the health minister, Brad Hazzard, and the transport minister, Andrew Constance, against the police minister, David Elliott, and the corrections minister, Anthony Roberts. MPs opposed to abortion reform including Davies and Conolly have fought to make significant changes to the draft legislation, including removing provisions which require doctors who have a conscientious objection to performing the procedure to refer patients elsewhere. Opponents have also seized on the so-called \u201cgender selection\u201d issue ahead of the vote next week, despite expert medical, legal and women\u2019s groups saying there is no evidence the practice is an issue in NSW. Conservatives outside the parliament have also railed against the bill. The federal Nationals MP, Barnaby Joyce, has recorded a robocall urging them to oppose the bill, claiming it would allow abortions to be performed \u201cfor any reason right up until the day of birth\u201d. Labor\u2019s Walt Secord said on Wednesday Berejiklian had \u201cbungled\u201d debate on the change from the beginning. \u201cGladys Berejiklian has caused this backbench revolt by her absolute lack of leadership,\u201d Secord said in a statement.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://joedunthorne.com/\" title=\"\">Joe Dunthorne</a> is a novelist who understands that joking can be the most powerful way of being serious. In his most recent novel, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/adulterants-9780241980972.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Adulterants</em></a>, his abject protagonist survives (only just) through last-ditch gags. How would his mutinous humour translate into poetry? The answer is: brilliantly. The delight of this debut collection is in watching a joker shuffle the darkest pack of cards. He travels so fast and far within the short spaces of his poems that readers must fasten their safety belts and be ready for anything. Including turbulence \u2013 obviously.</p> <p>The opening poem, A Sighting, about seeing a bear while camping, introduces a defining theme: transformation.

      "bodyText": "Joe Dunthorne is a novelist who understands that joking can be the most powerful way of being serious. In his most recent novel, The Adulterants, his abject protagonist survives (only just) through last-ditch gags. How would his mutinous humour translate into poetry? The answer is: brilliantly. The delight of this debut collection is in watching a joker shuffle the darkest pack of cards. He travels so fast and far within the short spaces of his poems that readers must fasten their safety belts and be ready for anything. Including turbulence \u2013 obviously. The opening poem, A Sighting, about seeing a bear while camping, introduces a defining theme: transformation. There is nothing Dunthorne\u2019s imagination cannot turn inside out (not the same as saying there is nothing it cannot heal). He does not believe in seeing straight and that is the pleasure of reading him. This sighting might prove lethal. But the calculated symmetry of the lost actor within the bear and the bear within the human being is offered as a rescuing conceit. In I wanted to see how unhappy I could get, he grumbles about a therapist who \u201cnever let my jokes be jokes\u201d. (I\u2019m on the therapist\u2019s side.)

In the first seven months of this year, 4,604 Cubans applied for asylum in Mexico, representing 10% of all applicants. In 2018, 218 Cubans sought asylum, representing 1% of total applicants. Historically, US-bound Cubans encountered far fewer obstacles on the migration passage due to unique legal protections and economic and educational advantages compared with Central Americans. But, a crackdown by the US and Mexican governments has left tens of thousands of Cubans trapped in Mexico, facing the same dangers and hurdles as migrants from elsewhere. In April, Cubans spearheaded a mass escape from one overflowing detention centre in protest at delays and inhumane conditions. The Cubans\u2019 plights can be traced back to Barack Obama\u2019s second term, when reducing migration was a key issue in bilateral discussions that eventually led to the historic diplomatic thaw between the old foes. Mexico was instrumental in implementing this deal to curtail Cuban migration, according to Rodolfo Casillas, a migration scholar at the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences (Flacso): Mexico detained 14,000 Cubans during 2015 and 2016 as rumours about a change in US policy prompted a surge in Cubans leaving the island. In 2017, just days before leaving the White House, Obama revoked the \u201cwet foot, dry foot\u201d policy which treated all Cubans arriving on US soil as political refugees, authorized to stay and legalize their status. Since then, Cubans have been obliged to enter the backlogged and time-consuming US asylum process like everyone else. Now, the impact of Donald Trump\u2019s policy is hitting Cubans in Mexico: in the north, thousands are waiting in line in border cities like Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to present their asylum cases at ports of entry. En route, 5,512 Cubans were detained in the first six months of this year, compared with 504 during the whole of 2018. (710 have been deported this year, compared with 156 in 2018.) In the south, in cities like Tenosique and Tapachula, those without the means to pay people smugglers are trapped since the exit pass \u2013 which allowed select nationals including Cubans and Haitians to traverse Mexico legally \u2013 was revoked in early 2019 amid the threat of crippling trade tariffs by Trump. \u201cThe tap has been turned off,\u201d said Ram\u00f3n M\u00e1rquez, director of the La72 migrant shelter, where 228 Cubans sought refugee in the first seven months of 2019, compared with 23 in 2019. \u201cMexico\u2019s only policy objective is to avoid conflict with Trump,\u201d said Casillas from Flacso. \u201cThis means stopping the flow of migrants, whatever it takes, which is fuelling people smuggling and asylum cases.\u201d In Tenosique, most Cubans can be found renting cramped, very basic digs, looking for a safe route out of the boiling hot city where violent crimes against migrants have long been tolerated by authorities.

This is aimed at tackling the number of female adults denied access as children, currently 75%, and will see 100 hubs delivering football in 6,000 schools across England.</p> <p>Adult women, though, are increasingly pushing back against their historical exclusion, with the football pitch booking site Playfinder revealing a 204% increase in bookings for women\u2019s football from the eight weeks leading up to the World Cup to the eight weeks following its kick-off on 7 June.</p> <p>The Playfinder co-founder and chief executive, Jamie Foale, said the booking site \u201cshowed a during-the-game increase\u201d and that a big proportion were for repeat bookings.

Kelly Smith said the research shows the women\u2019s game is ready to step away from being defined by the men\u2019s game and \u201ccan stand on its own\u201d. \u201cI do think that is down to the last couple of tournaments,\u201d the former England and Arsenal striker said. \u201cMaking it accessible for everyone has been huge, so the women\u2019s game can be proud of what is has achieved. But it must continue to evolve and develop. \u201cWomen need to be respected and given the same platform to perform. By doing this the quality gets higher and higher and with that comes better live and television attendances, sponsors, etc.\u201d The news is a boost to clubs and to the Football Association, which has been working hard to translate support for the national team into active interest in the domestic league. Measures taken include Manchester and London derbies being hosted on the opening weekend at the Etihad Stadium and Stamford Bridge respectively, games at the Tottenham Stadium and London Stadium in the next three months, a women\u2019s football weekend on 16-17 November when there is no Premier League action (much like non-league day); and targeted investment to market key games. With 46% of people who have been to a match reported to have been surprised with how professional it was and 74% thinking it underrated, evidence is clear of professionalism and investment improving the quality of the play and driving audiences. Barclays\u2019 record investment, believed to be closer to \u00a318m than the \u00a310m widely reported, is set to continue the evolution of the game at the top. However, a part of the deal also includes a commitment to the grassroots with a pledge to make football available to all girls in school by 2024 through its support for the FA Girls\u2019 Football School Partnerships. This is aimed at tackling the number of female adults denied access as children, currently 75%, and will see 100 hubs delivering football in 6,000 schools across England. Adult women, though, are increasingly pushing back against their historical exclusion, with the football pitch booking site Playfinder revealing a 204% increase in bookings for women\u2019s football from the eight weeks leading up to the World Cup to the eight weeks following its kick-off on 7 June. The Playfinder co-founder and chief executive, Jamie Foale, said the booking site \u201cshowed a during-the-game increase\u201d and that a big proportion were for repeat bookings. It has also reported a 192% increase in mixed-team bookings. \u201cMuch has been written about how the Women\u2019s World Cup was able to generate huge viewing figures and that does filter down to the grassroots game,\u201d Foale said. \u201cDuring the Women\u2019s World Cup it was obviously summer and people don\u2019t tend to play regular games, they\u2019ll play more spontaneously. It\u2019s around this time of the year that we see the regular games being booked in and we\u2019ve had a 35% increase on last year in terms of women booking regular games.\u201d The company has allocated 50% of its marketing budget to promoting the women\u2019s game, having committed to ensuring that at least half of the users on its platform will be female or mixed teams by the next Women\u2019s World Cup in 2023. Foale described its commitment as \u201csomething that we see, selfishly, as a big growth market\u201d, continuing the trend of brands that view the women\u2019s game as one of the biggest areas for growth in a saturated football marketplace. Articles on women\u2019s football still draw \u201cno one cares\u201d comments. Yet clearly people do. Talking points \u2022 The FA has announced a six-figure deal that will see the WSL broadcast overseas for the first time. The three-year agreement with Sky Mexico and the Scandinavian broadcaster NENT will result in league games being shown in Mexico, Central America, the Dominican Republic, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark. Monies raised from the sale of the rights will be reinvested in the new FA Player streaming platform. \u2022 England\u2019s Chioma Ubogagu has joined CD Tac\u00f3n, the club taken over by Real Madrid, from the NWSL team Orlando Pride. The 26-year-old winger received her first England call-up in 2018 but failed to make Phil Neville\u2019s World Cup squad. \u2022 The Uefa women\u2019s player of the year, Lucy Bronze, is on the three-player shortlist for Fifa\u2019s best women\u2019s player award. The England full-back is joined by USA\u2019s Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan. Phil Neville is on the shortlist for women\u2019s manager of the year alongside the departing USA manager Jill Ellis and the Netherlands\u2019 Sarina Wiegman. \u2022 West Ham\u2019s German midfielder Julia Simic has joined Common Goal, the organisation launched by Juan Mata whereby players donate 1% of their incomes to sporting charities.",

She is part of the so-called \u201cGaukeward squad\u201d of Conservative MPs who want to stop no deal and among the handful of Tories who publicly back the People\u2019s Vote campaign for a second referendum. Her constituency of Putney voted heavily for remain in 2016. On the prime minister\u2019s threat of holding a snap general election, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe the Conservative party will offer people a sensible choice at the next election in respect of the fact Boris Johnson is going to offer people a general election that offers them no deal or Jeremy Corbyn.\u201d Johnson threatened to call a general election on 14 October if MPs voted for a rebel motion to legislate against Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal. Greening said: \u201cThat is a lose-lose general election for Britain and I think a far better way of resolving the path forward on Brexit is to give the British people a direct choice between the different options on Brexit themselves rather than a messy general election, which I believe all the evidence suggests will be yet again inconclusive on a route forward on Brexit.\u201d The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Tuesday he wanted to \u201cfocus minds\u201d of MPs considering voting against the government to block a no-deal Brexit and to highlight the consequences of backing a delay. He told the Today programme: \u201cWe want to focus minds of all MPs that a deal is within sight that is faithful to our manifesto commitments but also to the referendum and any more delay \u2026 what does anyone realistically think a delay would do, rather than strengthen the hand of Brussels and weaken the hand of our negotiators?\u201d He said repeatedly the Conservatives did not want a general election. On Tuesday, Corbyn will meet a group of opposition party leaders in his office, including Ian Blackford from the SNP and Jo Swinson from the Lib Dems, for further talks on how they might block no deal. There has been significant confusion in the past 24 hours about whether Labour would vote in favour of a general election, even if triggered by the prime minister, or whether it is prioritising no-deal legislation. The shadow cabinet minister Tony Lloyd told the BBC\u2019s Newsnight the party would not back a general election triggered by Johnson. The shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, told the Today programme: \u201cIt\u2019s about sequencing. We need to ensure we get this legislation locked down \u2026 and guarantee Britain would not crash out of the EU in an election campaign period. We\u2019ve also got to try as best as possible to ensure that it wouldn\u2019t be possible for the sitting, squatting, prime minister in this period to set a general election, then change the date. \u201cThen if we get the sequencing right, and get sufficient support across the house, then we live and breathe a general election.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 4 September 2019. An earlier version incorrectly referred to Greening as the first comprehensive educated education secretary. To clarify: she is the first comprehensive educated Conservative education secretary.",

Prabakar Rajan Thomas, 69, received a 14 month non-parole jail sentence in March for abusing a patient. The county court was told he had put his hands in the victim\u2019s bra, asked about her masturbation habits and showed her graphic pornography. Ahpra is now investigating a separate complaint from another former patient, Naomi Fryers, who saw Thomas for about two years when she was an inpatient and outpatient of Delmont private hospital in Glen Iris from 2011. The regulator has told Fryers the investigation could take between six to 12 months. In an official statement to the investigation, Fryers said Thomas\u2019s behaviour often made her feel uncomfortable and she was forced to transfer to a different doctor. \u201cDuring my consultations with Dr Thomas he would often stare at my chest,\u201d Fryers said in her statement to Ahpra. \u201cI recall feeling awkward about the fact he was unable to look me in the eye.\u201d As an inpatient, she had been asked by Thomas on multiple occasions \u201cif I was disinhibited sexually or if I was hyper sexual\u201d, she said. \u201cI do not believe I ever displayed behaviour that would warrant these questions,\u201d she said.

The Hills Shire council had received 40 complaints over the past three years, with confirmed injuries, including people sent to hospital as a result of being swooped by the magpie on Old Windsor Road in Bella Vista. According to Magpie Alert, which collects reports of swooping incidents, several users reported being injured by a swooping magpie in the area. The magpie caused one resident to have a heart attack, the ABC reported. The story was first reported by News.com.au. The National Parks and Wildlife Service assessed the bird and found it was \u201cvery aggressive\u201d and \u201cuncharacteristically territorial\u201d. The magpie was observed to swoop underneath bike helmets and other deterrents to attack people\u2019s faces. A council spokesperson said the attacks were not associated with a nest, nor were the attacks limited to swooping season. Nevertheless, as Australia enters prime swooping season, the council decided to take the magpie out. The council tried to move the bird, but when that failed, it took out a permit to kill the magpie. \u201cCouncil does not usually take action to remove or destroy magpies \u2013 the usual procedure is to signpost known risk areas, as birds are generally only aggressive for four to six weeks per year,\u201d a council spokesperson said. \u201cHaving regard to the number of complaints, number of confirmed injuries and ongoing risk associated with the location, and after having exhausted all practical alternatives to alleviate the risk, council was issued a permit from the National Parks and Wildlife Service to engage a pest controller who humanely euthanised the bird to prevent further serious injuries. \u201cThis course of action was not taken lightly.\u201d The spokesperson confirmed the magpie met its demise last Wednesday, with the support of the NSW police. In spite of \u2014 or perhaps because of \u2014 its reputation for swooping, the Australian magpie was crowned Australian bird of the year in the 2017 Guardian/Birdlife Australia poll, securing 13.3% of the vote.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been a strange day on the markets with very little movement. But the ASX200 has closed the day down 6 points, or 0.09%, at 6,573.4. In Tokyo the Nikkei has closed up 5 points, or 0.02%, at 20,265. And in South Korea the Kospi has finished down 8 points, or 0.4%, at 1,961. It\u2019s been quiet on the markets but busy with Australia\u2019s central bank keeping rates on hold at 1% despite loud calls for more cuts amid the economy experiencing weak growth. In South Korea, inflation hit zero. Sterling\u2019s been hammered again ahead of that vote. Here are the highlights: Stocks have been flat in the Asian session as investors await the reopening of Wall Street later and a key US manufacturing survey. The Reserve Bank of Australia kept its key interest rate on hold despite a slump in retail sales of 0.1%. But Australia did record its first balance of payments surplus for 44 years thanks to its massive iron ore and coal exports, inflated by the rising US dollar. Inflation hit zero in South Korea, increasing the chances of rate cuts to boost growth. Sterling fell 0.23% to $1.2035 in Asian trading, near two-year lows. Brent crude is up slightly by 5c. The FTSE100 is set to lift at the opening this morning and the Dow is also on course for a positive start in New York. Thanks for joining me and stay tuned with Graeme Wearden on the UK blog for what promises to be a huge day in the markets there. As Australia debates the need for a rate cut or otherwise, in South Korea the fix is almost certainly in after inflation slumped to zero in the year to August. The South Korean economy has suffered for months because of the China slowdown, with exports falling for nine months in succession. The usual suspect of weak consumer demand was also at work in keeping prices down, but the less familiar factor of falling food prices thanks to better weather and harvests also weighed. The Bank of Korea (BOK) revised down economic growth for the June quarter to 1.0% on-quarter from a 1.1% gain reported earlier. BOK senior deputy governor Yoon Myun-shik said he wasn\u2019t worried about deflation and that inflation would pick up. But the bond market thinks otherwise as the benchmark 10-year yield shed 1.5 basis points to 1.285%, far below the central bank\u2019s policy rate of 1.50%, and indicating rate cuts are coming. The RBA has some supporters. Brendan Rynne, KPMG chief economist, says the decision is the correct one: The RBA was right to keep rates on hold at 1% today and leave any further cuts till later in the year. There was no clear reason to cut again yet and with limited ammunition left, the RBA sensibly kept its powder dry. Capital Economics says it is among the 30 forecasters that got the rates call right today. Four apparently got it wrong. It says the bank is sounding a little more positive than of late. Amazing what a rise in house prices can do to people. Marcel Thieliant, senior Australia &amp; New Zealand economist at Capital, says: The RBA sounded a touch more optimistic when it left interest rates on hold today, but we still think that further rate cuts over the coming months are likely. Sally Auld at JP Morgan says the decision was as expected and doesn\u2019t see much to suggest the bank will cut in October as some have suggested (notably UBS): There is nothing in today\u2019s statement which suggests the RBA are keen to cut again anytime soon, despite recent data which suggests another lucklustre quarterly GDP print for 2Q19 and a soggy start to 3Q partial activity data. Accordingly, not much has changed in the commentary; the paragraph on housing has a more upbeat tone, while the narrative around the economy and labour market is largely unchanged from August. As has been the case for a while now, household consumption remains the key domestic risk. Back in Australia the judgments on Governor Lowe and his fellow board members are rolling in. Stephen Koukoulas thinks he should be hauled before a parliamentary committee to explain his failure to meet the inflation target. Eleanor Creagh at Saxo thinks there\u2019s not much prospect of indebted consumers coming to the rescue: Callam Pickering thinks Lowe is fiddling while Rome burns. Stock markets are still subdued: The ASX200 is down 2 points, or 0.02%, at 6,577. Nikkei is up 33 points, or 0.16%, at 20,653. Shanghai Composite is down 1.5 points at 2,922, a fall of 0.05%. Hang Seng is down 24.85 points, or 0.1%, at 25,601. Kospi is down 1 point, or 0.04%, at 1,968. Brent crude is up 5c to $58.70 a barrel. Spot gold was down 0.5% at $1,523.26 per ounce. Evan Lucas at InvestSmart has done a great job in annotating the governor\u2019s statement so you can see the bits that have changed since last month. He sees the Australian economy growing \u201cfrom here\u201d so maybe hinting at a more upbeat forecast at some point. He appears more bullish about house prices. And he also sees inflation coming in below 2% target next year, but sees it above 2% in 2021. The Aussie has spiked back up to US67.04c. Lowe repeats his view that loose monetary policy will stay for some time. This is becoming a familar line so we can expect low interest rates to support growth. Lowe says: It is reasonable to expect that an extended period of low interest rates will be required in Australia to make progress in reducing unemployment and achieve more assured progress towards the inflation target. Governor Philip Lowe\u2019s statement picks its way carefully through the economic outlook but he notes that the improving housing market could start to help currently very weak consumer spending, along with tax cuts helping disposable income. The main domestic uncertainty continues to be the outlook for consumption, although a pick-up in growth in household disposable income and a stabilisation of the housing market are expected to support spending. It is reasonable to expect that an extended period of low interest rates will be required in Australia to make progress in reducing unemployment and achieve more assured progress towards the inflation target. The Board will continue to monitor developments, including in the labour market, and ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy and the achievement of the inflation target over time. Here\u2019s the statement in full. RBA keeps the cash rate at 1%. It\u2019s coming soon. The chances of a cut in rates at 2.30 is around 15%, according to CommSec analysts. That won\u2019t please the Kouk. Evan Lucas of InvestSmart is looking at what the RBA might say in its statement after the meeting. He notes that the familiar message of recent months might no longer contain the line about struggling house prices. We\u2019ll have all the reaction to the decision and statement from 2.30pm. There has been a lot of debate \u2013 as ever \u2013 about what the RBA should do today although the consensus is it won\u2019t cut the rate. The outspoken economist Stephen Koukoulas has left no doubt that he is in favour of a rate cut \u2013 preferably a whopping big one to reduce the cash rate to 0.25% and boost growth. But he doesn\u2019t think the RBA will and he\u2019s not afraid to let people know. Writing for Yahoo Finance he says: To boost growth, Dr Lowe could (should) cut interest rates to near zero but he has a preference to have higher unemployment and lower living standards than needed as he maintains his crusade against house prices and household debt. Without policy action by the government and the RBA, the economy is likely to remain a chronic under-performer. Having said that he has GDP to hit 0.7% for Q2 tomorrow meaning an annual growth of 1.6%. That\u2019s quite a lot more optimistic than some forecasters. A bit more than an hour before the RBA decision, which we\u2019ll bring to you as soon as it happens. Economists at JP Morgan have been crunching through the July retail sales data and conclude that any consumer-led recovery in the economy in the third quarter still seems a bit of a stretch. They note that shoppers cut back despite two successive rate cuts so they are unlikely to suddenly start spending now. The RBA cut in early June and July, and July was the first month where it was technically possible for households to have received the 2018/19 low and middle income tax offset. It is still very early days in tracking the disposable income transmission, but the July data represent an unimpressive start. Most categories were soft in July, with food sales (+0.3%m/m) boosting the headline measure, while clothing/footwear (-1.0%m/m), \u201cother\u201d retailing (-0.4%m/m), cafes/restaurants (-0.6%m/m) and department store sales (-0.2%m/m) were broadly soft. Household goods retailing managed to tread water (-0.1%m/m) but has still had a lackluster run of late. It\u2019s happened. The Aussie is being crushed by the economic gloom and the strong greenback. Some think it\u2019s only going lower ... I was just thinking there should really be an \u201cI love charts\u201d hashtag. And of course there is but it doesn\u2019t get much love on Twitter. But while I\u2019m at it, I also like this chart from Martin North at Digital Finance Analytics @DFA_Analyst with its implication that there may be trouble ahead for the aforementioned balance of payments ... I love this chart. Thanks to @JFosterFM The Chinese markets have opened but they are flat like the others this lunchtime. Shanghai Composite is down 2 points at 2,922, a fall of 0.07%. The Hang Seng is up 63 points, or 0.25%, at 25,689. The ASX200 is up 5 points, or 0.1%, at 6,586. Nikkei is up 14 points, or 0.07%, at 20,637. Kospi is up 6 points, or 0.3%, at 1,975. Westpac economists have put out an excellent summing-up of the Australian data. Andrew Hanlan writes that the boost in government spending and exports means he is sticking to his forecast of a rise of 0.5% in Q2 GDP tomorrow. Government is the key growth driver, he says. But he warns that falling iron ore prices will reduce the contribution of exports in the third quarter and put the spotlight on weak consumer demand. Government spending (largely centred on health and investment \u2013 albeit with quarterly volatility) is the key growth driver. Another positive is the resumption of the export uptrend in the first half of 2019, supported by expanding capacity in the LNG sector and with the lower AUD a boost for services and manufacturing. By contrast, private demand is contracting \u2013 with home building in a downtrend and business investment patchy. Consumer spending is likely soft, constrained by weak wages growth. Import weakness is symptomatic of weak demand, as well as the impact of the lower AUD. My colleague Ben Butler brings this depressing news for investors: More bad news for investors who trust other people to look after their money: most fund managers failed to beat the overall market last financial year, according to new research from S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. And many failed to come anywhere near the returns delivered by the benchmark indexes which S&amp;P maintains. Funds that invested in Australian shares grew by an average of 6.3% last year, almost half of the 11.6% gain experienced by the ASX200, which tracks the market\u2019s 200 biggest companies. More than 90% of funds failed to hit the benchmark, S&amp;P said. Funds that invested in international shares did a bit better, growing by 9.2% against an index that grew at 12.1%. However, that still resulted in more than 70% failing to reach the measure. Capital Economics reckons that the boost from exports and government spending will be enough to bring GDP in at 0.4% tomorrow. They revised their number down to 0.2% last week after the shocking building approvals but they now say it will be 0.4%. They say: In light of the data on net exports, government finances, and business inventories we are raising our estimate for Q2 GDP from 0.2% q/q to 0.4% q/q (actual data due on Wednesday). That would be consistent with annual GDP growth slowing to 1.3% y/y, the weakest pace of growth in nearly 20 years. Federal spending might be another factor to save the GDP number from going negative tomorrow. The ABS said this morning that general government final consumption expenditure increased by $2,365m or 2.7%, and \u201cis expected to positively contribute 0.5 percentage points to growth in the June quarter 2019 volume measure of GDP\u201d. With the balance of payments surplus contributing 0.6 percentage points to GDP, it might not be as bad as some economists have predicted. Cafes and restaurants performed especially badly to drag down retail sales, the ABS says. \u201cThere were falls in four of the six industries and six of the eight states and territories in July,\u201d said Ben James, director of quarterly economy wide surveys. \u201cCafes, restaurants and takeaway services (-0.6%) led the falls. There were also falls in clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing (-1.0%), other retailing (-0.4%), and department stores (-0.2%). Food retailing (0.3 %), and household goods retailing (0.1%) rose this month.\u201d The only states and territories that saw a rise were Western Australia (0.6%) and the Northern Territory (0.3%). The poor retail sales sent the dollar down again. It fell from US67.10c to US67.00c immediately after the release of the data, before climbing back to US67.04c a few minutes ago. On the up side, Australia has recorded its first current account surplus for 44 years. ABS chief economist Bruce Hockman said: \u201cSix consecutive quarters of goods and services surpluses, broadly commodity driven, have laid the foundation for our first current account surplus in 44 years.\u201d Retail sales fell 0.1% in July, according to figures from the Australia Bureau of Statistics. The number implies weaker than expected GDP figures tomorrow. The gloomy prospects for the global economy have pushed the price of a barrel down this morning. Benchmark Brent crude was was US7 cents lower at $58.59 a barrel. US crude was down 32 cents, or 0.6%, at $54.78. The Chinese yuan has been set weaker once again by the People\u2019s Bank. The currency is now notionally fixed at 7.0884 to the US dollar, as opposed to 7.0884 yesterday. But it\u2019s likely to drift lower still because it finished the trading day at 7.1717 on Monday (the higher the number the weaker the yuan). Bond yields are heading ever downwards and bringing the prospect of very low interest rates for years to come. That much we know. (Here\u2019s Greg Jericho\u2019s very useful primer on the subject.) Japan has been living with ultra low growth and rates for more than 20 years since the bursting of its property bubble in the 90s andpersistent low population growth. This has given rise to speculation about how other developed nations will cope in this changed environment. The economics team at JP Morgan have been looking at the issues and whether economies such as Australia\u2019s might succumb to this deflationary trap. Their conclusion is that population growth (which Japan famously doesn\u2019t have) might save Australia and the US, but there is a risk of \u201cJapanisation\u201d in Europe (low growth, low population growth) and China (high growth for now but a demographic timebomb is ticking there too). Here\u2019s what they say: Europe looks like Japan on a few measures, the US doesn\u2019t look like Japan on many measures at all, and China lies somewhere in between. China appears to offer the broadest set of potential Japanization trades relative to the US or Europe. Australia is at risk because the bond market is already \u201cJapanised\u201d \u2013 ie yields are very low \u2013 and household is very high at the second highest in the world. But they say: Strong population growth in Australia (1.5%oya at present) makes economic stagnation (and hence deflation) improbable, but doesn\u2019t rule out a protracted period of sub-trend growth and sub-target inflation. Stock markets have stabilised a bit and overall are flat across the region. The ASX200 is off four points at 6,575, while the Nikkei and the Kospi are up a smidgen. Korean investors might be encouraged by the prospect of another cut in rates after that zero inflation reading. Otherwise, the markets calm is partly because of the lack of the usual lead from the US, where markets were closed yesterday. And Reuters reports that investors will also be awaiting a manufacturing survey from the US later today for signs of how the world\u2019s biggest economy is going. \u201cAlthough US manufacturing activity has been slowing in recent months, the Institute of Supply management index has so far stayed above 50, which separates contraction and growth,\u201d Reuters says. The significance is summed up by Hiroyuki Ueno, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management in Tokyo: We have so many problems around the world, starting from the US-China trade war and Brexit. But investors appear to be getting used to be exposed to them. No one really thinks Washington and Beijing will solve the issues. But as long as the US economy keeps going, stock prices will have limited downside. The Australian dollar has edged lower this morning to US67.11c. It started the day at US67.18 and is now close to its lowest point for 10 years thanks to weakening commodity prices and a strong US dollar. The greenback dollar index is at 99.12, by the way, its strongest for two years. With this in mind, Michael McCarthy at CMC Markets in Sydney reckons the chances of an RBA cut later are pretty slim: Expectations for an interest rate cut in Australia today are muted after the back-to-back cuts in June and July. However the inventory component of the national accounts shocked with a 0.9% drop in the second quarter. This has some analysts predicting a negative number when GDP data is released tomorrow, a development that could shift the RBA\u2019s thinking. However the stimulatory impact of the lower Aussie should be enough to stay the board\u2019s hand today. The negative start on the market in South Korea comes after annual inflation hit an all-time low in August of ZERO, figures showed this morning. That means the Bank of Korea has revised down the economic growth for the April-June period to 1.0% on-quarter from a 1.1% gain reported earlier, citing weaker exports than estimated earlier. Consumer demand is also a worry in Korea. Stock markets across Asia Pacific are open. The ASX200 in Sydney has started the day flat while the Nikkei in Tokyo is down 0.27% and the Kospi in Seoul is off 0.15%. As I\u2019ve just mentioned, the Coalition is in full damage-limitation mode before the possibly terrible GDP figures tomorrow. My esteemed colleague Greg Jericho has taken his usual forensic look at the state of play and asks why we should be expected to believe the government\u2019s claims that a better economy is just around the corner when it\u2019s been in charge for six years ... Here\u2019s the full piece: Good morning and welcome to our business live blog. It looks set to be a busy day in economics and finance in Australia and around the world, beginning with another slew of data on the Australian economy at 11.30 this morning, followed by the Reserve Bank\u2019s latest monthly verdict on the cash rate at 2.30 this afternoon. The key background in Australia is that there is increasing pessimism around tomorrow\u2019s GDP number. A lot of data has pointed to a very low print tomorrow, with the latest coming yesterday. In case you missed it, a mixed business indicator survey showed profits and wages were solid, up 4% on the back of strong earnings in the mining sector in the June quarter, but inventories were down a surprising 0.9%. Economists at JP Morgan and UBS see the GDP quarterly number coming in 0.4% tomorrow but some have begun to revise that downwards. One analyst at Credit Suisse reckons the inventories were so bad yesterday that the GDP figure will be -0.6%. On interest rates nearly everyone expects the RBA to hold rates at 1% today \u2013 but the expectation is already there for cuts in October and maybe February next year. We might learn more from the wording of the governor Philip Lowe\u2019s statement later on. On the market, the ASX200 is expected to open down about 15 points or 0.23% this morning, when trading gets under way in about 30 minutes. The US market was closed yesterday for Labor day but the FTSE100 was up 1% helped by the weak pound. The Aussie dollar is close to a 10-year low at $67.18c. On the politics side, the Coalition will be hoping that the GDP number is not too ugly or it is in for a tough few weeks explaining what happened to the economy under its watch. Scott Morrison has said he expects tomorrow\u2019s number to be \u201csoft\u201d. It might blame uncertainty surrounding the election, and talk up a recovery in the third quarter. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has already been out there, telling a doorstop in Sydney that the government only has a political strategy and doesn\u2019t have a plan to fix the economy. Anyway, on with the program.",

      "bodyText": "Labor\u2019s lawyers have accused a former state MP of betraying his obligations to the party by attempting to hide donations from a Chinese billionaire and banned donor, Huang Xiangmo. Ernest Wong, a former NSW state MP, continued his evidence to the Independent Commission Against Corruption for a third day on Tuesday, where he was again accused of selling Bill Shorten\u2019s table at a 2015 Labor fundraising dinner for $100,000 to Huang and later covering it up by having \u201cstraw donors\u201d sign false donation records. Throughout the day, Wong was accused of giving evidence that was a \u201csham\u201d, \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d, \u201cnonsense\u201d, and a constructed story designed to fit with other evidence before the commission. Wong has now been accused of lying on each of the three days he has appeared before the commission. The penalty for giving false and misleading evidence is up to five years\u2019 imprisonment. The Icac has heard evidence claiming Huang, banned from donating due to his property development links, dropped off $100,000 cash to NSW Labor headquarters in an Aldi shopping bag several weeks after the dinner. Email records show Wong later arranged for individuals to sign pre-filled out donation records claiming to have given $5,000 to Labor. At least one man who signed such a record now says he never gave any money to Labor and was \u201cdumbfounded\u201d to be sent an invoice. Wong also diverted $12,200 raised at the dinner to a bank account controlled by the Friends of Chinese Community group. Wong was a convenor of the group and a signatory to its bank account. Arthur Moses, SC, representing Labor, accused Wong of betraying the Labor party and knowingly subverting the state\u2019s donations laws. \u201cYou were involved in a scheme to subvert the electoral funding laws of this state by hiding the true source of the donations, do you agree with that?\u201d Moses said. Wong rejected the suggestion, but Moses continued: \u201cAnd by doing so you betrayed your obligations to the Labor party \u2026 do you accept that?\u201d Wong also denied that assertion. Earlier, lawyers for the now-suspended NSW Labor boss, Kaila Murnain, asked Wong about his relationship with Huang. Huang is barred from donating in NSW due to his property developer links, but he remains a prolific donor elsewhere. He has donated to Labor since 2013, the inquiry heard, the same year Wong took his seat in NSW\u2019s upper house. Huang, who has since been denied re-entry to Australia on character grounds, was the long-term chairman of a peak Chinese Communist Party-linked lobby group, the Australian Council for the Promotion of the Peaceful Reunification of China. The former senator Sam Dastyari told the commission he now believed Huang may be an \u201cagent of influence\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Wong was asked whether he had \u201ccultivated\u201d Huang as a donor and political asset. The pair spoke and met regularly, the commission has heard. Wong was asked whether he saw Huang as a \u201csignificant political asset\u201d that he believed would help \u201csecure your political future\u201d. \u201cNo, I never cultivated Mr Huang,\u201d Wong responded. \u201cAs I said before it\u2019s always the party officials or the members themselves who approach Mr Huang ... not me.\u201d Wong was then asked whether he was working to specific fundraising targets in 2015, set by Jamie Clements, the then NSW Labor general secretary.

      "body": "<p>It is hard to say if this wraparound neck collar that heats up via a remote control was devised after a viewing of the movie Saw, but there is equally no evidence to prove it wasn\u2019t. Unlike that film, in which a maniac inventor traps unwitting victims inside arcane instruments of torture, U-Neck (\u00a364.99, <a href=\"https://www.stressnomore.co.uk/u-neck-neck-massage-device-10526.html\">stressnomore.co.uk</a>) aims to relax you. It is a massage device with an X-Men visor design and flexible arms that snap around your neck. I love a massage, so I am excited for this. It heats up! It vibrates at different intensities! It even deploys infrared to target nerve endings!</p> <p>First, though, the name. U-Neck is such a profoundly unattractive word, it almost warrants respect. Factual in a lumpen sort of way \u2013 this being a U-shape that fits around your neck \u2013 it also sounds like an obscure insult. It is as hard to wrap your head around U-Neck\u2019s name as it is easy to wrap U-Neck around your head.</p> <p>When the day comes to test it, I\u2019m lucky enough to wake with painful neck-ache. I charge it up and switch it on. Despite all the tech, it is not too heavy. It weighs 260g (which admittedly is hard to conceptualise. Think of it as weighing 0.004% of a midcentury sideboard). It is comfortable to wear and the remote control works well, allowing you to set a timer, change massage modes and control their intensity.</p> <p>The device buzzes and pulses through two metal plates covered in raised dots, built into the section hugging the back of my neck. It is strong, like someone accelerating a remote-control car inside my skull, or ringing a phone I\u2019ve just swallowed. I\u2019ve experienced similar with other massage devices, though U-Neck does employ a greater variety of rhythms and intensities (up to 550 permutations are possible).</p> <p>However, the collar has another trick up its, er, sleeve. I become aware of it while playing with the remote. It starts with a shiver on the nape of my neck, like a devil licking me. An inexplicable prickling, and then the sensation grows broad and intense, like tattoo needles up the back of my skull and over my ears. Whereas the vibration massage was localised, this sensation spreads. When I reach to touch the plate to see what is going on back there, I find my hand shooting away. It is electricity: there is electricity on my skin. I\u2019m viscerally alarmed. I don\u2019t even like taking a jumper off after 6pm because I\u2019m scared of static. (That little shock of blue, leaping from the Pringle? No thank you.) I take another look at the box. \u201cLow-frequency electric therapy,\u201d it says.</p> <p>Is this where we are now? Are our pleasure centres so overstimulated that in search of relaxation we will knowingly give ourselves electric shocks to the head? I find the sensation painful, until I realise I am on maximum intensity, too much for me. I\u2019m not trying to tranquilise a rhino. I turn it down to half that, and am more able to appreciate one of the most unusual sensations I\u2019ve ever known. It really is like nothing else. Relaxtricity? It is reminiscent of that trick where a friend pretends to crack an egg over your head, and you feel it oozing down your scalp.

      "body": "<p>If you watch an orthopaedic surgeon straddling a patient on the operating table, swinging a hammer into their pelvis with all his power, it becomes an indelible image.</p> <p>I stood, somewhere between the ages of 16 and 17, at the very edge of an operating theatre watching a hip replacement. Bone fragments settled on surgical drapes like confetti; a scene that, without kind voices and lack of murderous intent, could have been from a Dario Argento film: repulsive, abject, thrilling.</p> <p>I had designs on being a doctor for as long as I could remember. For my GCSE work experience I worked in the pharmacy department of my local private hospital for two weeks, helping with daily deliveries and stock-checking drug cabinets on the wards. They gave me a white coat and I felt like a peacock. One day a lady said: \u201cExcuse me, doctor, where are the toilets?\u201d You\u2019re having a laugh if you think I corrected her.</p> <p>So efficient was my pillbox counting, the pharmacist (a man of no more than 45 but with waves of brilliant white hair) asked me to stay on for the summer. He needed help while the real assistants navigated holidays and childcare. If I recall, he paid me \u00a320 a day. More than enough.</p> <p>My responsibilities were elevated, excitingly, to providing assistance in the preparation of chemotherapy bags in a small, lab-like room requiring hairnets. (When I say \u201cassistance\u201d I mean \u201cspraying things with sanitiser\u201d, but who cares for semantics?) I also did stock-checks in theatres. Not for the powerful drugs \u2013 those were under lock and key \u2013 but for the cabinets full of big, wobbly bags of saline solution. Each time I went into a theatre I had to change into scrubs. Each time I became Dr Corday from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2009/may/28/er-george-clooney-more4\" title=\"\">ER</a>.</p> <p>These theatre trips didn\u2019t always mean encountering live surgery, but when they did my counting would strangely become less efficient. You can\u2019t see much of the \u201cfield\u201d when you\u2019re 15 feet away, but you can see blood flooding a suction hose or glinting tools disappearing into the wetness of an opened body.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Seeing people at their most vulnerable and totally reliant on others planted the seed of wanting to help others</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You might question the appeal of all this as a summer job for a teenager; even one like me who had always been fascinated with the inner workings of humans. I went on to waitress through sixth-form to earn money for Bacardi Breezers, of course, but this was an important experience for me in many ways. I don\u2019t subscribe to fate, but being asked to work in the hospital that summer gave me not only the opportunity to see medicine up close but to do some private healing.</p> <p>Because I\u2019d almost died that school year. My gut had literally exploded after my appendix became infected. Sepsis had roared through my body. I spent a considerable amount of time in hospital flitting from one corporeal dissociation to the next. As I\u2019ve learned in therapy, appendix-gate was probably the mainspring of the anxiety I have lived with ever since. I have also learned that by exposing ourselves to what we fear we can gradually overwrite distress with new patterns of thought.</p> <p>Looking back, I like to ascribe intelligence to my subconscious and wonder if I was trying to reclaim meaning of some kind; putting myself into an environment that would not only further my career interests, but also re-expose me to what I encountered during the most frightening weeks of my life: strip-lit corridors, IV stands, beeping machines, the ferrous tang of iodine, the recurring image of a body \u2013 my body \u2013 unconscious and being invaded by people I didn\u2019t know. Only this time it wasn\u2019t my body. I was a rational observer.</p> <p>This job fuelled an already burning fascination into the human condition, what happens when things go wrong and what we need when it does. The pharmacist responded to my rapid-fire questions with grace and I still remember things he told me about cells. But there was something stirring about the emotion of it all, too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/30/summer-job-sheffield-cutlery-factory\">My summer of cutlery: how packing Sheffield steel checked my privilege | Catherine Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Seeing people at their most vulnerable and totally reliant on others, being privy to the micro-interactions that were soothing or empowering, planted the seed of wanting to help others. I studied English literature at university because I didn\u2019t get the grades for medical school and went straight into journalism. However, it was probably inevitable that I\u2019d return to healthcare in some form. Nineteen years on, I am training as a psychologist with a major interest in the mind-body relationship, and still think about that hospital often.</p> <p>I think about watching nurses angling patient\u2019s chairs towards the breeze from an open window, overhearing reassurances given to those anxiously awaiting surgery and the patient answering of questions. My eyes were opened to the kind of language and often basic behaviours \u2013 eclipsing the medical setting \u2013 that can make a person feel heard, safe and understood when they are scared or wounded. We all need to be held sometimes. Even if that holding is with phrases as fundamental as \u201cIt\u2019s OK\u201d or \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p> <p>Our formative experiences can make the business of accepting help difficult, even when we need it most. My home life at the time of my rupturing innards was difficult, meaning my emotional needs in my recovery were not met. This left a core unease of being truly vulnerable with others. I didn\u2019t address my anxiety for a very long time. Now I largely get on well with my mind and have the immense privilege of learning how to help support others in understanding and managing their distress.

      "bodyText": "If you watch an orthopaedic surgeon straddling a patient on the operating table, swinging a hammer into their pelvis with all his power, it becomes an indelible image. I stood, somewhere between the ages of 16 and 17, at the very edge of an operating theatre watching a hip replacement. Bone fragments settled on surgical drapes like confetti; a scene that, without kind voices and lack of murderous intent, could have been from a Dario Argento film: repulsive, abject, thrilling. I had designs on being a doctor for as long as I could remember. For my GCSE work experience I worked in the pharmacy department of my local private hospital for two weeks, helping with daily deliveries and stock-checking drug cabinets on the wards. They gave me a white coat and I felt like a peacock. One day a lady said: \u201cExcuse me, doctor, where are the toilets?\u201d You\u2019re having a laugh if you think I corrected her. So efficient was my pillbox counting, the pharmacist (a man of no more than 45 but with waves of brilliant white hair) asked me to stay on for the summer. He needed help while the real assistants navigated holidays and childcare. If I recall, he paid me \u00a320 a day. More than enough. My responsibilities were elevated, excitingly, to providing assistance in the preparation of chemotherapy bags in a small, lab-like room requiring hairnets. (When I say \u201cassistance\u201d I mean \u201cspraying things with sanitiser\u201d, but who cares for semantics?) I also did stock-checks in theatres. Not for the powerful drugs \u2013 those were under lock and key \u2013 but for the cabinets full of big, wobbly bags of saline solution. Each time I went into a theatre I had to change into scrubs. Each time I became Dr Corday from ER. These theatre trips didn\u2019t always mean encountering live surgery, but when they did my counting would strangely become less efficient. You can\u2019t see much of the \u201cfield\u201d when you\u2019re 15 feet away, but you can see blood flooding a suction hose or glinting tools disappearing into the wetness of an opened body. You might question the appeal of all this as a summer job for a teenager; even one like me who had always been fascinated with the inner workings of humans. I went on to waitress through sixth-form to earn money for Bacardi Breezers, of course, but this was an important experience for me in many ways. I don\u2019t subscribe to fate, but being asked to work in the hospital that summer gave me not only the opportunity to see medicine up close but to do some private healing. Because I\u2019d almost died that school year. My gut had literally exploded after my appendix became infected. Sepsis had roared through my body. I spent a considerable amount of time in hospital flitting from one corporeal dissociation to the next. As I\u2019ve learned in therapy, appendix-gate was probably the mainspring of the anxiety I have lived with ever since. I have also learned that by exposing ourselves to what we fear we can gradually overwrite distress with new patterns of thought. Looking back, I like to ascribe intelligence to my subconscious and wonder if I was trying to reclaim meaning of some kind; putting myself into an environment that would not only further my career interests, but also re-expose me to what I encountered during the most frightening weeks of my life: strip-lit corridors, IV stands, beeping machines, the ferrous tang of iodine, the recurring image of a body \u2013 my body \u2013 unconscious and being invaded by people I didn\u2019t know. Only this time it wasn\u2019t my body. I was a rational observer. This job fuelled an already burning fascination into the human condition, what happens when things go wrong and what we need when it does. The pharmacist responded to my rapid-fire questions with grace and I still remember things he told me about cells. But there was something stirring about the emotion of it all, too. Seeing people at their most vulnerable and totally reliant on others, being privy to the micro-interactions that were soothing or empowering, planted the seed of wanting to help others. I studied English literature at university because I didn\u2019t get the grades for medical school and went straight into journalism. However, it was probably inevitable that I\u2019d return to healthcare in some form. Nineteen years on, I am training as a psychologist with a major interest in the mind-body relationship, and still think about that hospital often. I think about watching nurses angling patient\u2019s chairs towards the breeze from an open window, overhearing reassurances given to those anxiously awaiting surgery and the patient answering of questions. My eyes were opened to the kind of language and often basic behaviours \u2013 eclipsing the medical setting \u2013 that can make a person feel heard, safe and understood when they are scared or wounded. We all need to be held sometimes. Even if that holding is with phrases as fundamental as \u201cIt\u2019s OK\u201d or \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d Our formative experiences can make the business of accepting help difficult, even when we need it most. My home life at the time of my rupturing innards was difficult, meaning my emotional needs in my recovery were not met. This left a core unease of being truly vulnerable with others. I didn\u2019t address my anxiety for a very long time. Now I largely get on well with my mind and have the immense privilege of learning how to help support others in understanding and managing their distress. I consider that summer to have been an important part of the trip here. The flying splinters of pelvis were a bonus. \u2022 Eleanor Morgan is an author and is training to be a psychologist",

      "bodyText": "Hurricane Dorian has stalled over the Bahamas, lashing the islands with wind, rain and storm surges, and killing at least five people. Thousands of homes were inundated by floodwater as rescue operations tried to reach stranded residents, many trapped on roofs. Dorian, one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes on record, has been hovering over Grand Bahama Island for more than a day. It has weakened to a Category 3 hurricane but is still battering the Bahamas with winds of 120mph, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said in an advisory issued at 2am EST (0600 GMT). The ferocious storm\u2019s centre was about 30 miles north-east of Freeport on Grand Bahama Island and about 100 miles east of West Palm Beach, Florida. The NHC urged residents to remain in shelters as they continued to be pounded by the storm\u2019s \u201ceyewall\u201d. The storm\u2019s strongest winds are usually close to the eye. In an earlier update, it said Dorian was \u201ccontinuing to thrash\u201d Grand Bahama and would cause \u201cextreme destruction\u201d into Tuesday morning. At least five people have been killed in the Abaco Islands, in the northern Bahamas, the country\u2019s prime minister, Hubert Minnis, said on Monday. \u201cWe are in the midst of a historic tragedy in parts of our northern Bahamas,\u201d Minnis said. \u201cOur mission and focus now is search, rescue and recovery.\u201d Abaco and Grand Bahama, neither much more than 40 feet (12 metres) above sea level at their highest points, are home to 70,000 people. Bahamian officials said they received a \u201ctremendous\u201d number of calls from people in flooded homes. One radio station said it received more than 2,000 distress messages, including reports of a five-month-old baby stranded on a roof and a woman with six grandchildren who cut a hole in a roof to escape rising floodwaters. At least two designated storm shelters flooded. Iram Lewis, a Bahamian MP, told the Associated Press his greatest fear was that waters would keep rising overnight and that stranded people would lose contact with officials as cellphone batteries died. \u201cIt is scary,\u201d he said, adding that Grand Bahama\u2019s airport was 6 feet underwater and that people were moving shelters as floodwaters kept surging. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely in dire straits.\u201d Yasmin Rigby, who lives in Freeport, told Reuters: \u201cPeople who thought they were safe are now calling for help.\u201d Minnis said the US Coast Guard was on the ground in Abaco and had rescued a number of injured people. Critically injured people were being taken to hospitals on New Providence, the country\u2019s most populous island. A witness staying in the hotel at the Abaco Beach Resort on the island of Great Abaco told Reuters that winds tore off the shutters and part of the roof, and the site was surrounded by a lake of water. Dorian threatened to unleash a storm surge that could raise water levels by as much as 12 to 18 feet (4-5 metres) above normal on Grand Bahama Island, the NHC said. As many as 13,000 homes in the Bahamas may have been destroyed or severely damaged, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said. Houses in a neighbourhood in Freeport were engulfed by six feet (1.8 metres) of water. \u201cIt looks like they\u2019re boats on top of the water,\u201d said Rosa Knowles-Bain, 61, a resident who fled two days ago to an emergency shelter. The NHC said Dorian was expected to drift to the north-west late on Tuesday, moving \u201cdangerously close\u201d to the east coast of Florida, where strong gusts and high surf were already being reported. At the White House, staff members reviewed hurricane planning with state and local officials. Donald Trump was being briefed hourly, White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said. Nine counties in Florida have issued mandatory evacuations. They included parts of Duval County, home to Jacksonville, one of Florida\u2019s two biggest cities, and some areas in Palm Beach County, home to Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort. Florida\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, urged coastal residents to heed evacuation orders. \u201cGet out now while there\u2019s time and while you have fuel available,\u201d he told a news conference from the state\u2019s emergency operations centre in Tallahassee. Orlando International airport, one of the largest in the state, planned to cease commercial operations at 2am on Tuesday because of the storm, it said in a statement. More than 1,300 flights have been cancelled in the US as well as to and from the country. A further 1,000 flights are expected to be cancelled on Tuesday, according to the flight tracking site, FlightAware. Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando will close early on Tuesday, it said in a statement. Multiple coastal counties in South Carolina, Georgia and Virginia have ordered mandatory evacuations ahead of the storm.",

There\u2019s a crystal-pendant-making workshop, a talk on the politics of body hair and another on mental health awareness. The most popular class to date, according to Jade Coles, the Collective\u2019s head of events and experiential marketing, was on how to make a ceramic dildo. \u201cThat one sold out in eight minutes,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The 550 residents who call this building home pay a monthly rent starting at \u00a31,085 to live in rooms that are hotel-sized but which benefit from a number of communal amenities, like the events. There\u2019s a cinema room, a co-working space that converts into a music venue, another co-working space, a library that feels like a co-working space, a restaurant and a bar. There\u2019s no fee to join, and you can leave with one month\u2019s notice.</p> <p>Benjamin Webb, 37, has lived at the Collective for eight months and likes it enough that he is now a \u201ccommunity ambassador\u201d. He says co-living offered him a sense of freedom after two decades renting in London.</p> <p>\u201cI was looking for flexibility rather than being sucked into the cycle of letting agents, paying \u00a32,000 each time you move and being locked in a contract,\u201d says Webb, who works as a PA in the finance industry. \u201cThe Collective gave me that flexibility, but what kept me there \u2013 and I\u2019ve extended my original contract \u2013 is the community and all the other things that come with it.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/video/2016/jun/15/i-have-500-flatmates-london-rediscovers-co-housing-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4y3k8\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2541842\"            data-video-name=\"I have 500 flatmates: London rediscovers co-housing \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-575fea4ce4b0f440d5d03381\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/06/14/160614HWLNLondon_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/06/14/160614HWLNLondon.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/06/14/160614HWLNLondon_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/06/14/160614HWLNLondon_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/06/14/160614HWLNLondon_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/video/2016/jun/15/i-have-500-flatmates-london-rediscovers-co-housing-video\">I have 500 flatmates: London rediscovers co-housing</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Indeed, the Collective doesn\u2019t market itself as apartments.

WeWork, the co-working behemoth, now runs WeLive: fully furnished apartments available for flexible rental in New York and Washington DC. The chic \u201cdigital nomad community\u201d Roam has set up co-living and co-working hubs in San Francisco, Miami, Tokyo and Bali (with a new location in London and another in New York coming soon).

Here, at last, is a way to provide affordable homes for younger people cut out of the market, while at the same time pooling resources, fostering community and catering for an increasingly mobile generation.

The idea is to structure and organise housing in such as a way as to put communities, rather than developers, in the driving seat.</p> <p>\u201cCo-<em>living</em> is purely a new way for developers to squeeze profit from an already broken housing market,\u201d says Hannah Wheatley, researcher on housing and land at the New Economics Foundation.</p> <p>\u201cCo-<em>housing</em> in its purest form is about communities being control of their housing.\u201d</p> <p>In Barnet, North London, the Older Women\u2019s Co-Housing project (Owch) has built a collection of 25 flats, all occupied by women older than 50. They are committed to participating in a community that shares space, resources and mutual support. As well as being an alternative to the existing home ownership model, Owch caters imaginatively for an ageing population, which is a growing need in many western cities.</p> <p>Josie Pearse, 64, shows it off with pride.

The Collective has received $800m to fund growth across the UK, US and Europe and now has 8,000 units operating or under development. It has just opened what it claims is the world\u2019s biggest co-living development in Canary Wharf, with 705 rooms, a swimming pool on the 20th floor and a golf simulator. The smallest rooms are available from \u00a3100 a night (though a cursory glance at the booking system suggests rates are often \u00a3150 or more), \u00a31863pm for a three month stay and \u00a31430pm if you stay for 12 months.

      "bodyText": "In the industrial chic lobby of the Collective, a huge apartment block in the northwest London neighbourhood of Willesden Junction, a set of posters advertise its events series for residents. There\u2019s a crystal-pendant-making workshop, a talk on the politics of body hair and another on mental health awareness. The most popular class to date, according to Jade Coles, the Collective\u2019s head of events and experiential marketing, was on how to make a ceramic dildo. \u201cThat one sold out in eight minutes,\u201d she says. The 550 residents who call this building home pay a monthly rent starting at \u00a31,085 to live in rooms that are hotel-sized but which benefit from a number of communal amenities, like the events. There\u2019s a cinema room, a co-working space that converts into a music venue, another co-working space, a library that feels like a co-working space, a restaurant and a bar. There\u2019s no fee to join, and you can leave with one month\u2019s notice. Benjamin Webb, 37, has lived at the Collective for eight months and likes it enough that he is now a \u201ccommunity ambassador\u201d. He says co-living offered him a sense of freedom after two decades renting in London. \u201cI was looking for flexibility rather than being sucked into the cycle of letting agents, paying \u00a32,000 each time you move and being locked in a contract,\u201d says Webb, who works as a PA in the finance industry. \u201cThe Collective gave me that flexibility, but what kept me there \u2013 and I\u2019ve extended my original contract \u2013 is the community and all the other things that come with it.\u201d Indeed, the Collective doesn\u2019t market itself as apartments. It calls itself a \u201cglobal living movement\u201d, and is one of a growing number of \u201cco-living\u201d developments that cater to a distinctly millennial market. In Berlin there is Quarters, a co-living developer that now has properties in New York and Chicago and has just announced a $1bn expansion to build many more across the US and Europe. WeWork, the co-working behemoth, now runs WeLive: fully furnished apartments available for flexible rental in New York and Washington DC. The chic \u201cdigital nomad community\u201d Roam has set up co-living and co-working hubs in San Francisco, Miami, Tokyo and Bali (with a new location in London and another in New York coming soon). It sells a dream lifestyle, that of a modern, flexible, \u201ccreative\u201d worker who has bid farewell to the deskbound nine to five and instead jets around the world, dropping in to work remotely from exotic locations. Each company presents its accommodation as a solution to the urban housing crisis. Here, at last, is a way to provide affordable homes for younger people cut out of the market, while at the same time pooling resources, fostering community and catering for an increasingly mobile generation. With 4.8 million Britons now self-employed, co-living is pitched as a utopian response to a rapidly changing society. But what from one angle looks like a revolutionary proposition can just as easily be seen from another as a cynical ploy by property developers to cash in on a generation living in the \u201cage of loneliness\u201d, locked in a perpetual struggle to find a place they can call home. Vlad Calus, 23, co-founder of social media startup Planable, sees it the second way. He moved into the Collective with a business partner two years ago. \u201cPeople were nice and friendly but we were shocked to see these \u2018boxes\u2019 being called rooms,\u201d he says. \u201cUnfortunately, co-living places are trying to squeeze every living space into the same building, which makes it unliveable for the long-term.\u201d Collective living has other downsides.

He points to bolder suggestions proposed by modernists almost a century ago to address the interwar housing shortage, such as the work of Karel Teige, a Czech theorist whose 1932 book The Minimum Dwelling proposed restructuring living space around community and collective domestic labour. \u201cThe Collective make similar claims about solving the housing crisis but it doesn\u2019t stand up,\u201d Stewart says. \u201cTeige was talking about a mixture of different ages, generations, classes \u2013 it wasn\u2019t targeted at a specific group.

Marmalade Lane, a 42-home multigenerational \u201coasis\u201d, was unveiled this May in Cambridge.

The balcony looks over the communal garden where neighbours can be seen chatting beside a sundial on the lawn. \u201cThe thing I love most about this place is coming home,\u201d she says. Kay, on the other hand, moved out of the Collective after a year to move in with her boyfriend. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the communal experience I imagined,\u201d she said. \u201cCo-living might work in smaller set-ups but there it was too big for any real community. It just felt like a hotel with rich students getting their accommodation paid for.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

Rochester said the five were awake on the bridge of the vessel when the flames were spotted and were able to jump off. The passengers reported missing were asleep below deck. While firefighters brought the blaze under control, the vessel sank 20 metres off shore in more than 15 metres of water, the Coast Guard said. By Monday afternoon, only a portion of the bow was sticking out of the water. The Ventura county fire department released dramatic pictures on Twitter on Monday morning, showing the boat engulfed in smoke and flames. A Coast Guard senior official, Aaron Bemis, told CNN the fire kept appearing to be extinguished and then burst back into flames, possibly because of the amount of fuel on the ship. \u201cThe fire was so intense that even after it was put out, we were not able to actually embark the vessel and look for survivors at [that] point,\u201d he said. The vessel, named Conception, was a diving tour boat owned by a company called Truth Aquatics, a boat rental service that offers diving tours off southern California.

Passengers boarded the boat at Santa Barbara Harbor on Friday night, and the vessel had been due to return to Santa Barbara late on Monday afternoon. California Diving, a local publication, described the boat as \u201cCalifornia\u2019s crown jewel of live-aboard dive boats\u201d when it was built in 1981. Rochester said the boat was in \u201cfull compliance\u201d with regulations. The US Coast Guard was \u201cworking deliberately with the vessel owner/operator, who is with us at the time working on a plan to conduct further assistance for his vessel\u201d, she said. Authorities set up a family assistance point at an event center in Santa Barbara. Officials said they did not have much information they could share, but were there to provide support. \u201cPeople are coming in wanting information,\u201d said Suzanne Grimmesey, an official with the Santa Barbara department of behavioral wellness. \u201cThere are a lot of unknowns across the board. \u201cWe are hoping to help them cope with what they are experiencing.

The rows of chairs stretch back into the ostensible blackness, with light beaming from the projector room. Ahead, archival footage of stylish black travelers pack the screen as an unseen narrator discusses the hardships of mid-20th-century black travel. Enabled by modern technology but trapped by racist social convention, their trips were eventually greatly eased by the publication of the Green Book, which listed safe spaces for black people to sleep, eat and replenish.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/11/green-book-facebook-black-motorists-racist-america-road-trip-pitstops-safe\">From the Green Book to Facebook, how black people still need to outwit racists in rural America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A car gradually appears next to the stage in black and white and a Green Book institution, Washington DC\u2019s Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl, comes into view. The seats have dissipated into a silent, empty U Street. For the next 20 minutes, the viewer will journey through the traumatic stories lent to Emmy-nominated virtual reality documentary Traveling While Black, which discusses the agony and trepidation of a people moving through a country that has not fully accepted them.</p> <p>Traveling While Black is the first virtual reality project by Oscar-winning documentarian Roger Ross Williams, in collaboration with virtual reality studio Felix and Paul Studios. Glued together by the deep terror of racism, the documentary relies on a collection of interviews and poetic cinematic recreations to tell the harrowing tale of the danger that comes with having black skin.</p> <p>Originally developed from a play as a multimedia project, someone suggested it might take better life as virtual reality project. Even so, its initial development was rocky. \u201cIt was tough figuring out the landscape because everything is so new,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAt one point, this piece was going to be animated. At one point, we wrote a script and were talking to actors...\u201d</p> <p>But all parties agree that the story works best told through documentary film-making. \u201cDocumentaries are a lot more immediately mature as a medium of virtual reality, as a genre, as a format than fiction. We saw that this was too sensitive of a shoot to be experimenting with,\u201d said Paul Raphael of Felix and Paul Studios. \u201cWe really wanted to do the material justice. It\u2019s not the kind of subject you want to approach and not be respectful of.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg8XlfChttc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eg8XlfChttc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In the documentary, the aforementioned Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl acts as a heartbeat of black DC, presenting itself as a central location for black travelers and locals alike. The virtual experience elucidates the concept and reality of an enduring safe space, too often stripped from black citizens.</p> <p>Virginia Ali, the owner of Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl, relays the history of the building as a black space, an old copy of the printed Green Book resting on the table of the booth before her. Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl is the third iteration of the space, she says, originating as a silent movie theatre, then a pool hall, and finally, into the restaurant and institution where Barack Obama once visited for their famous half-smoke.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the very day that we opened, until the current time, it\u2019s still a safe haven for people,\u201d she asserts gently. To Williams, Ben\u2019s was a natural choice to set a documentary. Ben\u2019s encapsulates the combination of black ease and discomfort alike. \u201cWe wanted to basically take people back to the time when they needed the Green Book and they needed spaces like that. We wanted to connect that to the present because we still need spaces like that to show how much hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"da7196a9e4322bd0d080c20c65813aea3aa9c738\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da7196a9e4322bd0d080c20c65813aea3aa9c738/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl in Washington DC acts as a safe space for black travelers and locals alike.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl in Washington DC acts as a safe space for black travelers and locals alike.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Felix &amp; Paul Studio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the documentary, like in the lives of black Americans, there is nowhere to turn away from the horrors of racism. It besieges the viewer in its inescapable cage.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not African American, you get to go into a space and be part of a conversation that you probably normally would not be privy to. If you are black, you get to delve deep into that inner trauma that we all carry with us in America as black people. I think that\u2019s really powerful in the way that 2D storytelling can\u2019t provide,\u201d Williams said.</p> <p>Raphael agreed, saying: \u201cIn virtual reality, you get to actually feel like they are there in front of you, much more strongly than by watching them on a flat two-dimensional rectangular screen. So that really changes how receptive you are to anything that is presented to you.\u201d</p> <p>But he admits its all-encompassing nature also poses a challenge. \u201c[It] also means you have to recalibrate how you tell the story and what you present to the viewer. You could actually overwhelm a viewer very easily and have them shut down,\u201d Raphael explains. \u201cSo it\u2019s a very interesting and beautiful medium to work with. You need to be careful with it, but when you do it right, you can affect people in a way that I think is out of reach for cinema.\u201d</p> <p>The experience allows for the past and present to be presented in juxtaposition, merging to validate one eery conclusion: the problems of the past have not subsided. Former Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee activist Courtland Cox contends in the documentary: \u201cThe assumption is that, at some time, it stopped. And that\u2019s not the case. It never stopped.\u201d</p> <p>The creator of the Green Book, Victor Green, once said that if the guide went out of print, black people would have reached the proverbial mountaintop of equal opportunity. Traveling While Black directly challenges that. \u201cIt\u2019s different, but we are still in danger as black people when we step outside of our doors,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI could be walking down the street in my own neighborhood and be killed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8c7399caff2631dc65fee1f4c7009d0dd6696112\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c7399caff2631dc65fee1f4c7009d0dd6696112/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from Traveling While Black\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Indeed, the fears aren\u2019t exclusively relegated to the bus or the train or even distant travel, says Williams. The documentary highlights one such example: the tragic extrajudicial murder of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, told through his reticent mother, Samaria, who describes the day for the first time to an audience inside the restaurant.</p> <p>She was at home, when, only a short distance from his Cleveland home, the officers shot her child within seconds of their arrival on scene. He was unarmed. The video of the entire police encounter only takes a few seconds, wherein the viewer is whisked back to the movie theatre, ushering a sense of disbelief and removal from the horror on screen. When the viewer returns to the booth where Samaria is still seated, several of the patrons and servers are in tears.</p> <p>\u201cI will never get that vision out of my head,\u201d she laments, telling the somber yet captive audience how she was restrained from being with her child during his final moments by the same force that took his life. Fiddling with her napkin nervously, she continues: \u201cI wasn\u2019t finished raising him. I wasn\u2019t finished nourishing him and America robbed me.\u201d When asked what the American dream is to her, she replies: \u201cA nightmare. Especially if you black.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wonder, when does it end?\u201d Sandra Butler-Truesdale, a fifth-generation DC resident, ponders aloud in the experience.</p> <p>It\u2019s the kind of question Williams wants the viewers to ask after the experience. He understands the material will not carry the same weight to different groups but does believe in its power to start an honest conversation.</p> <p>\u201cI think that if you are not a person of color and you watch this film, you walk away transformed. You walk away [and] you feel the sort of empathy and the pain really that black people carry with them in a country that hasn\u2019t confronted the reality of racism, in fact, in a country where racism is on the rise \u2026 As a black person, I want you to walk away and want you to have open and honest conversations with people in your community about that trauma. It\u2019s like therapy. We need to talk about it.\u201d</p>",

The rows of chairs stretch back into the ostensible blackness, with light beaming from the projector room. Ahead, archival footage of stylish black travelers pack the screen as an unseen narrator discusses the hardships of mid-20th-century black travel. Enabled by modern technology but trapped by racist social convention, their trips were eventually greatly eased by the publication of the Green Book, which listed safe spaces for black people to sleep, eat and replenish. A car gradually appears next to the stage in black and white and a Green Book institution, Washington DC\u2019s Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl, comes into view. The seats have dissipated into a silent, empty U Street. For the next 20 minutes, the viewer will journey through the traumatic stories lent to Emmy-nominated virtual reality documentary Traveling While Black, which discusses the agony and trepidation of a people moving through a country that has not fully accepted them. Traveling While Black is the first virtual reality project by Oscar-winning documentarian Roger Ross Williams, in collaboration with virtual reality studio Felix and Paul Studios. Glued together by the deep terror of racism, the documentary relies on a collection of interviews and poetic cinematic recreations to tell the harrowing tale of the danger that comes with having black skin. Originally developed from a play as a multimedia project, someone suggested it might take better life as virtual reality project. Even so, its initial development was rocky. \u201cIt was tough figuring out the landscape because everything is so new,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAt one point, this piece was going to be animated. At one point, we wrote a script and were talking to actors...\u201d But all parties agree that the story works best told through documentary film-making. \u201cDocumentaries are a lot more immediately mature as a medium of virtual reality, as a genre, as a format than fiction. We saw that this was too sensitive of a shoot to be experimenting with,\u201d said Paul Raphael of Felix and Paul Studios. \u201cWe really wanted to do the material justice. It\u2019s not the kind of subject you want to approach and not be respectful of.\u201d In the documentary, the aforementioned Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl acts as a heartbeat of black DC, presenting itself as a central location for black travelers and locals alike. The virtual experience elucidates the concept and reality of an enduring safe space, too often stripped from black citizens. Virginia Ali, the owner of Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl, relays the history of the building as a black space, an old copy of the printed Green Book resting on the table of the booth before her. Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl is the third iteration of the space, she says, originating as a silent movie theatre, then a pool hall, and finally, into the restaurant and institution where Barack Obama once visited for their famous half-smoke. \u201cFrom the very day that we opened, until the current time, it\u2019s still a safe haven for people,\u201d she asserts gently. To Williams, Ben\u2019s was a natural choice to set a documentary. Ben\u2019s encapsulates the combination of black ease and discomfort alike. \u201cWe wanted to basically take people back to the time when they needed the Green Book and they needed spaces like that. We wanted to connect that to the present because we still need spaces like that to show how much hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d In the documentary, like in the lives of black Americans, there is nowhere to turn away from the horrors of racism. It besieges the viewer in its inescapable cage. \u201cIf you\u2019re not African American, you get to go into a space and be part of a conversation that you probably normally would not be privy to. If you are black, you get to delve deep into that inner trauma that we all carry with us in America as black people. I think that\u2019s really powerful in the way that 2D storytelling can\u2019t provide,\u201d Williams said. Raphael agreed, saying: \u201cIn virtual reality, you get to actually feel like they are there in front of you, much more strongly than by watching them on a flat two-dimensional rectangular screen. So that really changes how receptive you are to anything that is presented to you.\u201d But he admits its all-encompassing nature also poses a challenge. \u201c[It] also means you have to recalibrate how you tell the story and what you present to the viewer. You could actually overwhelm a viewer very easily and have them shut down,\u201d Raphael explains. \u201cSo it\u2019s a very interesting and beautiful medium to work with. You need to be careful with it, but when you do it right, you can affect people in a way that I think is out of reach for cinema.\u201d The experience allows for the past and present to be presented in juxtaposition, merging to validate one eery conclusion: the problems of the past have not subsided. Former Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee activist Courtland Cox contends in the documentary: \u201cThe assumption is that, at some time, it stopped. And that\u2019s not the case. It never stopped.\u201d The creator of the Green Book, Victor Green, once said that if the guide went out of print, black people would have reached the proverbial mountaintop of equal opportunity. Traveling While Black directly challenges that. \u201cIt\u2019s different, but we are still in danger as black people when we step outside of our doors,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI could be walking down the street in my own neighborhood and be killed.\u201d Indeed, the fears aren\u2019t exclusively relegated to the bus or the train or even distant travel, says Williams. The documentary highlights one such example: the tragic extrajudicial murder of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, told through his reticent mother, Samaria, who describes the day for the first time to an audience inside the restaurant. She was at home, when, only a short distance from his Cleveland home, the officers shot her child within seconds of their arrival on scene. He was unarmed. The video of the entire police encounter only takes a few seconds, wherein the viewer is whisked back to the movie theatre, ushering a sense of disbelief and removal from the horror on screen. When the viewer returns to the booth where Samaria is still seated, several of the patrons and servers are in tears. \u201cI will never get that vision out of my head,\u201d she laments, telling the somber yet captive audience how she was restrained from being with her child during his final moments by the same force that took his life. Fiddling with her napkin nervously, she continues: \u201cI wasn\u2019t finished raising him. I wasn\u2019t finished nourishing him and America robbed me.\u201d When asked what the American dream is to her, she replies: \u201cA nightmare. Especially if you black.\u201d \u201cI wonder, when does it end?\u201d Sandra Butler-Truesdale, a fifth-generation DC resident, ponders aloud in the experience. It\u2019s the kind of question Williams wants the viewers to ask after the experience. He understands the material will not carry the same weight to different groups but does believe in its power to start an honest conversation. \u201cI think that if you are not a person of color and you watch this film, you walk away transformed. You walk away [and] you feel the sort of empathy and the pain really that black people carry with them in a country that hasn\u2019t confronted the reality of racism, in fact, in a country where racism is on the rise \u2026 As a black person, I want you to walk away and want you to have open and honest conversations with people in your community about that trauma. It\u2019s like therapy. We need to talk about it.\u201d",

If you\u2019d like to receive this as a weekly email, sign up here. You can also catch our monthly Brexit Means \u2026 podcast here. And for daily updates, head to Andrew Sparrow\u2019s politics live blog. Top stories It\u2019s all kicking off \u2013 and a snap election is looking more likely than ever. Boris Johnson launched his bid to break the Brexit deadlock in brutal fashion, suspending parliament for five weeks from next week and so cutting the time available to MPs to prevent a no-deal exit. The prime minister\u2019s move drew heavy criticism from the EU (which called it \u201csinister\u201d), the Speaker of the Commons, John Bercow (\u201ca constitutional outrage\u201d), and MPs from across the political spectrum (\u201creckless\u201d and \u201cundemocratic\u201d). It also triggered three distinct legal challenges from the campaigner Gina Miller (backed by Sir John Major); the Scottish National party\u2019s justice spokeswoman, Joanna Cherry; and Raymond McCord, a campaigner in Northern Ireland. A petition calling on the government not to suspend parliament passed 1.7m signatures, two senior Conservative figures \u2013 Ruth Davidson, the leader of the party in Scotland, and George Young, the Tory whip in the Lords \u2013 resigned, and protesters took to the streets across the UK and even in continental Europe. Undeterred, Johnson said he wanted to \u201cstep up the tempo\u201d of Brexit talks (his envoy David Frost will head to Brussels twice a week) and he demanded rebel MPs stop undermining the government\u2019s negotiating position. Ministers who had previously opposed the idea of suspending parliament rowed back on their earlier comments. But while Jeremy Corbyn warned that this week would be the last chance to stop a no-deal Brexit, rebel MPs said they were confident they would have the parliamentary time to do so \u2013 and more than 50 pledged to occupy an alternative House of Commons if Johnson did go ahead with the suspension. Michael Gove threw more fuel on the fire, refusing to rule out ignoring any anti-no-deal law, while general election speculation went into overdrive when the PM cancelled a Monday meeting with Tory rebels, threatened to blow up his majority by withdrawing the whip from any who vote against the government, and called a cabinet meeting for Monday afternoon. One leading rebel, David Gauke, said a Commons vote planned for Tuesday to block no deal could be \u201cvery tight\u201d but that the government\u2019s deselection threats may actually be counterproductive, boosting rebel numbers. Corbyn confirmed Labour would back an early election as long as it came before 31 October and as soon as anti-no-deal legislation had been passed, and Downing St said it would treat the vote to prevent no deal as \u201can expression of confidence\u201d. In a brief speech outside No 10, the prime minister threatened to ignore MPs if they vote against no deal, insisting that \u201cunder no circumstances\u201d would he ask the EU to delay beyond 31 October. A government source said if the rebels\u2019 efforts were successful, Johnson planned to call a general election for 14 October. On the continent, meanwhile, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, reiterated that it was up to the UK to come up with workable alternatives to the Irish backstop, a message Ireland\u2019s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, repeated. As the EU said it was considering whether to categorise a no-deal Brexit as a major natural disaster akin to flooding, fires or earthquakes, releasing emergency funds to member states most affected, the government unveiled a \u201cGet ready for Brexit\u201d information blitz with advice for citizens and businesses. What next This looks set to be one of the biggest weeks in UK politics in decades: it could decide how the UK leaves the EU, trigger a general election, end more than one political career, and leave an impact on Britain that will last for generations. Concretely, MPs return on Tuesday and the Speaker will respond to the government\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. The rebels will request an emergency debate, which Bercow is likely to grant, in a bid to seize control of the parliamentary timetable. Assuming they win that debate, they can table a new short bill that will order the prime minister to seek an extension to article 50 until 31 January to prevent no deal \u2013 although it is unclear how they can ensure Johnson will request it. Also on Tuesday, a court in Edinburgh will rule on one of the three legal challenges to the suspension (the others are due on Thursday). The latter stages of the week are likely to be taken up with the passage of the rebels\u2019 bill \u2013 if it passes the Commons \u2013 through the House of Lords, with peers possibly sitting through the weekend. Johnson has not confirmed how the government will respond if the rebels succeed. But many observers believe a snap \u201cwill of the people\u201d election would be inevitable, most likely in mid-October \u2013 and that it may be called as early as Wednesday. Best of the rest EU will not cave in to Johnson threats, says senior MEP. Rees-Mogg calls doctor \u201cshameful\u201d for raising no-deal drug concerns. No deliverable alternative to Irish backstop, leaked report concludes. Leaked no-deal report says lorries could face 48-hour delays at Dover. House prices could nosedive after no-deal Brexit, says KPMG. Government U-turn over plan to end freedom of movement on 31 October. Government branded immoral over pensions of UK citizens in EU. UK energy price fears as electricity imports climb to record high. Ireland says it will not act for Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cpolitical convenience\u201d. Gove watches no-deal Brexit practice run in Port of Calais. UK falls to bottom of G7 growth league in second quarter. Rise in EU citizens not getting UK settled status causes alarm. No-deal Brexit could lead to greater spread of disease, paper warns. Johnson has no credible replacement for backstop, says Irish deputy PM. No-deal Brexit threatens flu vaccine supply, doctors warn. \u201cI can\u2019t just be kicked out\u201d: EU national damns Brexit settlement scheme.

She watched her mother routinely attacked by her stepfather. \u201cSorry,\u201d her mother would whisper afterwards to the children.</p> <p>Then, Sefina\u2019s elder sister was nearly killed by a group of male relatives for breaking the curfew. \u201cSorry,\u201d her sister told her as she later left the island for good.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a norm here. You don\u2019t talk about violence, you have to be absolutely silent,\u201d says Sefina, now 22, and suffering from depression and anxiety. She has survived multiple suicide attempts.</p> <p>\u201cNobody asks for help, you can\u2019t reach out for help. The silence is overwhelming, it suffocates you. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m losing my sanity.\u201d</p> <p>Samoa is a small Polynesian country located in the western Pacific Ocean. Fields of taro flank the side of the country\u2019s few roads, and coconut palms and ginger flowers dot well-tended villages, where the people by and large live very traditional lives; defined by church, subsistence farming, and loyalty to family.</p> <p>But the beauty of this verdant tropical paradise conceals a dark secret: one of the highest rates of family and sexual violence in the world. Last year, Samoa became the first Pacific Island country to conduct a national public inquiry into family violence. Published in late 2018, <a href=\"https://ombudsman.gov.ws/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/National-Inquiry-Report-into-Family-Violence_-State-of-Human-Rights-Report-2018-English.pdf\">the findings revealed an \u201cepidemic\u201d of violence and sexual abuse</a>.</p> <p>The report found that \u201cviolence is affecting almost all families in Samoa\u201d, with nine out of 10 respondents reporting abuse occurring regularly within the home. About 60% of women have experienced intimate partner violence, and 20% of women reported being raped, while cases of incest were around 10%.</p> <p>As with all self-reported statistics, the actual numbers are thought to be far higher.</p> <p>\u201cThe government\u2019s lack of commitment and approach through inadequate allocation of resources, support and lack of coordination sends to people a message that gender inequality and family violence is acceptable,\u201d the report found. It estimated the cost to Samoa\u2019s GDP to be around 6-7% every year.</p> <p>Maluseu Doris Tulifau, 28, is a survivor of domestic violence. Her family is from Samoa and she relocated there from the US 18 months ago to launch a female empowerment group, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/browngirlwoke/\">Brown Girl Woke.</a> Tulifau says Samoa\u2019s culture of violence has spread to the US, Australia and New Zealand through the diaspora of Samoan immigrants, and she wanted to \u201cgo back to the source\u201d, to study and tackle the problem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c09f58a17bc32e4337e4a1c2743b35963f73ca13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c09f58a17bc32e4337e4a1c2743b35963f73ca13/0_0_3829_5743/667.jpg\" alt=\"Doris Tulifau is founder of Brown Girl Woke, a group working on domestic violence awareness in Samoa.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maluseu Doris Tulifau is founder of Brown Girl Woke, a group working to raise awareness of domestic violence in Samoa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Myka Stanley/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brown Girl Woke has gained a cult-like following of young women and men on social media and local college campuses. Just as many young men are members as women. The group mainly meet on college campuses \u2013 a neutral zone \u2013 where they host open-mic nights, poetry readings and \u201csafe space\u201d groups to gently open up discussions about what might be going on at home.</p> <p>Tulifau says many young Samoans are open to the concept of gender equality, but are torn between their conservative home lives in the villages, and the possibility of a more equal and modern society in the future.</p> <p>On the streets of Apia, the small and industrial capital city, men walk around in packs, ogling women and making lewd, loud comments. Women and girls disappear from the streets by dusk, and do not reappear until morning.

      "bodyText": "Blood on the walls. Bruises like smashed plums. As long as Sefina* can remember, family violence has been part of her life. She watched her mother routinely attacked by her stepfather. \u201cSorry,\u201d her mother would whisper afterwards to the children. Then, Sefina\u2019s elder sister was nearly killed by a group of male relatives for breaking the curfew. \u201cSorry,\u201d her sister told her as she later left the island for good. \u201cIt\u2019s a norm here. You don\u2019t talk about violence, you have to be absolutely silent,\u201d says Sefina, now 22, and suffering from depression and anxiety. She has survived multiple suicide attempts. \u201cNobody asks for help, you can\u2019t reach out for help. The silence is overwhelming, it suffocates you. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m losing my sanity.\u201d Samoa is a small Polynesian country located in the western Pacific Ocean. Fields of taro flank the side of the country\u2019s few roads, and coconut palms and ginger flowers dot well-tended villages, where the people by and large live very traditional lives; defined by church, subsistence farming, and loyalty to family. But the beauty of this verdant tropical paradise conceals a dark secret: one of the highest rates of family and sexual violence in the world. Last year, Samoa became the first Pacific Island country to conduct a national public inquiry into family violence. Published in late 2018, the findings revealed an \u201cepidemic\u201d of violence and sexual abuse. The report found that \u201cviolence is affecting almost all families in Samoa\u201d, with nine out of 10 respondents reporting abuse occurring regularly within the home. About 60% of women have experienced intimate partner violence, and 20% of women reported being raped, while cases of incest were around 10%. As with all self-reported statistics, the actual numbers are thought to be far higher. \u201cThe government\u2019s lack of commitment and approach through inadequate allocation of resources, support and lack of coordination sends to people a message that gender inequality and family violence is acceptable,\u201d the report found. It estimated the cost to Samoa\u2019s GDP to be around 6-7% every year. Maluseu Doris Tulifau, 28, is a survivor of domestic violence. Her family is from Samoa and she relocated there from the US 18 months ago to launch a female empowerment group, Brown Girl Woke. Tulifau says Samoa\u2019s culture of violence has spread to the US, Australia and New Zealand through the diaspora of Samoan immigrants, and she wanted to \u201cgo back to the source\u201d, to study and tackle the problem. Brown Girl Woke has gained a cult-like following of young women and men on social media and local college campuses. Just as many young men are members as women. The group mainly meet on college campuses \u2013 a neutral zone \u2013 where they host open-mic nights, poetry readings and \u201csafe space\u201d groups to gently open up discussions about what might be going on at home. Tulifau says many young Samoans are open to the concept of gender equality, but are torn between their conservative home lives in the villages, and the possibility of a more equal and modern society in the future. On the streets of Apia, the small and industrial capital city, men walk around in packs, ogling women and making lewd, loud comments. Women and girls disappear from the streets by dusk, and do not reappear until morning. Raised in a strictly patriarchal society, many Samoan women have been trained from birth to take up as little physical space as possible, to use voices that are barely audible, and to defer to all men they encounter with lowered eyes and a shrinking quality that is surprising to witness. \u201cWe are a selfless community,\u201d says Tulifau. \u201cWe don\u2019t see ourselves as individuals, that\u2019s why we\u2019re silent. When any of us get molested or raped, we consider our family, and the family of the perpetrator, and how the whole village will be impacted. \u201cA lot of the other organisations, because they\u2019re part of the government, are tainted by corruption.

The ultimate goal is equality. I want to wake up one day and know there are at least 16 members of parliament who are women.\u201d Five women hold seats in Samoa\u2019s parliament, and women are largely excluded from holding positions of authority or decision-making on village councils. Tuala-Tamalelagi says evidence of Samoa\u2019s patriarchal structure is \u201ceverywhere\u201d. Even in the university cafeteria, he observes young men subtly controlling their girlfriends.

The Methodist Church, Catholic Church and Samoan Council of Churches declined interviews with the Guardian. Both Tulifau and Ah Siu-Maliko say Samoa is \u201cawash\u201d in aid funding for gender equality programmes, and say NGOs \u2013 many without experience or expertise in family violence \u2013 are multiplying like mushrooms to get a slice of the lucrative pie. But it is in the villages of Samoa that programmes are needed. Vaiee is an hour\u2019s drive south of Apia, in Safata Bay.

      "bodyText": "A few months after the 2016 election, 29-year-old Emily Marburger posted an update on a private Facebook group, Pantsuit Nation, that had been set up to support Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed presidential bid. \u201cLike the rest of us last November, I woke up to a situation I didn\u2019t know existed,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI knew I had to get involved. I felt driven to help. But I never imagined I\u2019d find myself, at 29, running for Mayor in the heated Democratic primary in my tiny square mile borough of 8,000 (just outside Pittsburgh).\u201d The incumbent mayor of Marburger\u2019s small Pennsylvania town of Bellevue was an open Trump supporter. His sole opponent \u2013 until Marburger entered the race \u2013 was a conservative pastor. \u201cI thought: No. This Can\u2019t Happen,\u201d Marburger wrote. \u201cThe main criticism (so far) is that I don\u2019t have the experience. Here\u2019s what I say to that: Yes, I do have the experience. Yes, I can do this job.\u201d Marburger\u2019s post went viral. Donations flooded in from as far away as Hawaii. She raised $10,000 in 48 hours. The incumbent mayor was knocked out in the first round. Marburger won the second round easily. From the debris of Clinton\u2019s loss Marburger had built an unexpected triumph. Her experience is by no means exceptional. Trump\u2019s win was a devastating setback for American progressives. But it has also galvanized them in ways a Clinton victory would not have, stoking them to campaign, advocate, donate or run for office \u2013 to engage politically in ways and at levels they never previously imagined. Put bluntly, there\u2019s a lot going on with the left in America, producing a realignment that is at one and the same time ideological and structural. The pressure is both leftwards and downwards with the balance of power shifting towards the grassroots while demands for Medicare for All, free college tuition, fewer corporate donations and a Green New Deal are no longer routinely dismissed as fringe but embraced by many 2020 candidates. There is a moment in Knock Down the House, a documentary that follows four candidates challenging established party operatives in the 2018 Democratic congressional primaries, when the future New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez comforts Amy Vilela, who was running in Nevada. As Vilela realizes she is going to lose, Ocasio-Cortez, who has yet to be elected, reminds her that the odds were always stacked against them. \u201cIt\u2019s not about any one of us, individually,\u201d she tells Vilela. \u201cIt\u2019s about the \u2013 the whole movement.

I knew I wasn\u2019t physically strong, and was quick to book removalists and hard-rubbish collections. But it was instantly humbling to realise I couldn\u2019t even shift a flat-packed bookshelf from the pallet at IKEA on to my trolley \u2013 let alone from my car into my new house \u2013 and so had to have it delivered. Then I realised I\u2019d also need another person to help me assemble it.</p> <p>I felt so weak and powerless \u2013 and there was so much more to do.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Only in a world where freedom is individual can community be framed as dystopian</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of the depressing ironies of neoliberalism is that it acts as both carrot and stick. The appalling way I see governments and corporations treating people is steering me further towards the safety of self-sufficiency: building a resource of my own skills, capabilities and judgments. As a woman, I\u2019m even more determined to evade the misogynist stereotypes that my gender makes me \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cneedy\u201d. I want to build and fix things myself, control my own finances, solve my own problems, and manage my own emotions.</p> <p>Then I had to move house.</p> <p>Throughout human history, we\u2019ve formed communities and cultures, shared traditions, and treated each other <a href=\"https://www.sapiens.org/culture/ik-people-generosity/\">generously</a>. Cooperation mingles self-interest and altruism: we\u2019re more powerful and effective when we <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communal_work\">work together</a>, sharing both risk and reward. In a generous society, people feel good when they help others, and they feel secure when they\u2019re helped.</p> <p>Amid my house-moving turmoil I watched the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/midsommar\">Midsommar</a>, in which Dani, a grieving young woman, accompanies her boyfriend and his anthropology PhD buddies to a pagan festival in the secluded Swedish village where their friend Pelle grew up.</p> <p>\u201cI have always felt held. By a family \u2026 a real family,\u201d Pelle tells Dani. \u201cDo you feel held?\u201d I felt powerfully drawn to this idea; and I left the film feeling euphoric.</p> <p>It made me challenge the assumptions of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/30/folk-horror-cults-sacrifice-pagan-sex-kill-list\">folk horror</a>. In such stories, sacrificing individual sovereignty for group solidarity is always repressive, ritual is always malevolent, transcendence can\u2019t be trusted, and tradition is perverse and grotesque. Only in a world where freedom is individual can community be framed as dystopian.</p> <p>So, how did I feel when my mum helped me pack up my stuff and clear rubbish, and when my dad heroically dismantled the freestanding mezzanine my housemate Dave had built a decade or so earlier? How did I feel after my friends spent an afternoon clearing my backyard of weeds and ivy, and nourished me with a shared dinner?</p> <p>I felt \u2026 held. Grateful. Part of something bigger. My friends jocularly called their work a \u201cbarn raising\u201d. Best known for its persistence among the Amish and Mennonites, this tradition sees a farming community pitch in, unpaid, to build a barn for one of its members. And it made me reflect on how lucky I am to have relatively secure accommodation and people who care about me.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/14/neoliberalism-is-killing-our-love-lives\">Neoliberalism is killing our love lives | Bhaskar Sunkara</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We idealise the concept of care between blood relatives, but people who\u2019ve lost families to death or estrangement must weave alternative social safety nets.

I knew I wasn\u2019t physically strong, and was quick to book removalists and hard-rubbish collections. But it was instantly humbling to realise I couldn\u2019t even shift a flat-packed bookshelf from the pallet at IKEA on to my trolley \u2013 let alone from my car into my new house \u2013 and so had to have it delivered. Then I realised I\u2019d also need another person to help me assemble it. I felt so weak and powerless \u2013 and there was so much more to do. One of the depressing ironies of neoliberalism is that it acts as both carrot and stick. The appalling way I see governments and corporations treating people is steering me further towards the safety of self-sufficiency: building a resource of my own skills, capabilities and judgments. As a woman, I\u2019m even more determined to evade the misogynist stereotypes that my gender makes me \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cneedy\u201d. I want to build and fix things myself, control my own finances, solve my own problems, and manage my own emotions. Then I had to move house. Throughout human history, we\u2019ve formed communities and cultures, shared traditions, and treated each other generously. Cooperation mingles self-interest and altruism: we\u2019re more powerful and effective when we work together, sharing both risk and reward. In a generous society, people feel good when they help others, and they feel secure when they\u2019re helped. Amid my house-moving turmoil I watched the film Midsommar, in which Dani, a grieving young woman, accompanies her boyfriend and his anthropology PhD buddies to a pagan festival in the secluded Swedish village where their friend Pelle grew up. \u201cI have always felt held. By a family \u2026 a real family,\u201d Pelle tells Dani. \u201cDo you feel held?\u201d I felt powerfully drawn to this idea; and I left the film feeling euphoric. It made me challenge the assumptions of folk horror. In such stories, sacrificing individual sovereignty for group solidarity is always repressive, ritual is always malevolent, transcendence can\u2019t be trusted, and tradition is perverse and grotesque. Only in a world where freedom is individual can community be framed as dystopian. So, how did I feel when my mum helped me pack up my stuff and clear rubbish, and when my dad heroically dismantled the freestanding mezzanine my housemate Dave had built a decade or so earlier? How did I feel after my friends spent an afternoon clearing my backyard of weeds and ivy, and nourished me with a shared dinner? I felt \u2026 held. Grateful. Part of something bigger. My friends jocularly called their work a \u201cbarn raising\u201d. Best known for its persistence among the Amish and Mennonites, this tradition sees a farming community pitch in, unpaid, to build a barn for one of its members. And it made me reflect on how lucky I am to have relatively secure accommodation and people who care about me. We idealise the concept of care between blood relatives, but people who\u2019ve lost families to death or estrangement must weave alternative social safety nets. Still others are left to meet their basic needs alone, or end up homeless as the state withdraws support. This is our society\u2019s shame. It\u2019s repulsive that capitalism rebrands atomised, precarious labour as friendly \u201csharing\u201d; outsourcing to the market simply displaces the load from my shoulders on to someone else\u2019s. By contrast, everyday acts of community \u2013 like helping people move house \u2013 genuinely share the load, and lighten it for everyone. What makes moving house exhausting is its entanglement with people, places and things \u2013 connections that are emotional and social as well as logistical. Marie Kondo\u2019s tokimeku is about sparking something much more than joy: it\u2019s a sense of purpose and possibility. We think of an empty house as a blank slate, a depersonalised space of potential; but my old, emptied house thrums with the warmth of the many hands that lifted all its contents away. I hold my grandfather\u2019s hammer and a sense of strength and stability rises within me, like the throbbing of my own heart.",

Securing a place is already a lottery, masquerading as a sophisticated selection process. Lotteries are undeniably the fairest way to choose between equally deserving applicants, which is why so many state schools now use them. One option, adopted by Dutch medical schools, is to select the very highest academic performers and then use a lottery for lower achievers. If all that is a step too far, then admissions could at least be centralised, allowing university departments, rather than individual colleges, to select students. Surely our finest minds could find a way of then sorting students into different colleges? We could do away with the special rules that mark out Oxbridge as different. At the very least, colleges should agree to adopt the same admissions criteria. A sea change in attitudes is already taking place. Oxford is enrolling 50 students with grades as low as three Bs on its new foundation year as it aims to enrol a quarter of undergraduates from disadvantaged backgrounds within four years. Cambridge has similar plans. These would have been unthinkable a few years ago. The tide is turning. Universities overestimate their ability to spot talent, and under-estimate the power of simplicity. Simplifying admissions is one way the Office for Students can help the students it is meant to serve. Lee Elliot Major is professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter. His report for the Higher Education Policy Institute on social mobility and elite universities will be published later this year.",

Ryan Davis was similarly taken aback in 2010 when he found the vineyard for sale. Since then, he\u2019s restored the business to recreate some of the magic of Australia\u2019s Margaret River and Marlborough on home turf. The old farmhouse is now a restaurant with rooms, cookery school and wine-tasting hub. Vineyard tours and experiences draw on connections between the landscape and the taste of Cariad (Welsh for love) white wine made with kernling and reichensteiner grapes. Visitors are welcome to get involved in the harvest throughout September. \u2022 Doubles from \u00a3115 B&amp;B, llanerch.co.uk La Closerie de Fronsac, near Bordeaux Although more humble than some nearby wine ch\u00e2teaux, this pretty manor house is in a prime location to explore the Bordeaux region. Libourne railway station is five miles down the road (only one change from London St Pancras), and picturesque Saint-\u00c9milion isn\u2019t much further. Fronsac\u2019s 300-year-old vines produce rich, full-bodied reds cared for by a diligent father-and-son team, proud of their small-scale, traditional production methods. The Fronsac experience is awash with historical intrigue; from the 17th-century wine barrels to tales of pilgrims heading to Santiago de Compostela on the Camino Franc\u00e9s. To make the most of quiet roads and rolling countryside, bring bikes to pedal between world-famous vineyards with their rich, full-bodied reds and chateaus. Maps and advice are available on arrival. \u2022 Doubles from \u00a380 B&amp;B, lacloseriedefronsac.com Domaine de Saint-Jean, Occitanie Languedoc-Roussillon (consumed by the Occitanie region in 2016) rivals Provence for its charming concoction of hilltop villages, sandy shores and rolling vineyards. With almost three times as many vineyards as Bordeaux and fast trains from Paris, it suits oenophiles seeking balmy climes. Domaine de Saint-Jean (20 minutes by taxi from Narbonne station) is a serene spot in the heart of Corbi\u00e8res, one of France\u2019s most productive red and ros\u00e9 appellation d\u2019origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9es, close to the 900-year-old vineyard at Abbaye de Fontfroide. Martine and Didier welcome guests to four rooms in their rural idyll; Victorine has a private terrace overlooking the vineyards. \u2022 From \u00a370 B&amp;B, domaine-de-saint-jean.com Le Vieux Pressoir, Alsace The north-eastern region of Alsace is an interesting alternative to France\u2019s southern vineyards. The Alsace wine route weaves just west of the Rhine River, passing vineyards, forests and dramatic castles along the way. Working farm Le Vieux Pressoir is on the wine route in Dieffenthal, six miles from S\u00e9lestat\u2019s historic centre and station (one of the oldest in France, opening in 1840). The towers of Haut-Koenigsbourg Castle rise 800 metres above the otherwise unassuming village where Le Vieux\u2019s self-catering farmhouses offer a comfortable base. Accommodation ranges from a g\u00eete sleeping eight to a studio apartment; the whole place can be taken exclusively, too. Owners Aur\u00e9lie and Damien know the surrounding vineyards well and are always happy to point guests in the direction of family-run wineries nearby. \u2022 Doubles from \u00a340 B&amp;B, half board options available, two-night minimum stay may apply, gite-vieux-pressoir.fr Ch\u00e2teau de Pintray, Indre-et-Loire Marius and Maryyonne welcome guests to their homely Loire ch\u00e2teau surrounded by ancient vineyards and rolling countryside, five miles from Amboise station with its connections to Paris, Tours and Orl\u00e9ans. Although the opulent ch\u00e2teaux of Chenonceau and Villandry are close by, it\u2019s easy to while away the days staying put at Pintray. Maryyonne is responsible for the characterful g\u00eete, filled with brocante finds and family portraits, while Marius\u2019 domain is the wine. Across the pretty courtyard, the winery and cave have been part of the AOC of Montlouis-sur-Loire since 1937, although the enormous rotary wine press dates back to the 17th century. Established originally by monks, it\u2019s thought that Henry IV would have once enjoyed the fruits of these vines. Today, Marius leads tours and tastings extolling the virtues of the dry and medium-sweet wines. \u2022 Doubles from \u00a3115 B&amp;B, sawdays.co.uk, chateau-de-pintray.com LakeView Hotel le Rivage, Lausanne Close to Lausanne central railway station, with its frequent links to Geneva and beyond, LakeView Hotel le Rivage is almost on Lake Geneva and looks up at the Unesco-listed Lavaux vineyard terraces, which tumble down to the water. Families have cultivated this mosaic of steep vineyards covering 800 hectares since the 11th century. LakeView Hotel provides guests with bikes to ride to the vineyards but they are easy to explore on foot, too, with a lattice of interesting paths to follow. There\u2019s an educational walking trail between Lausanne and Montreux, electric buggy tours and the Lavaux Express wine train. The steep south-facing slope makes it impossible to harvest the grapes by machine, so during autumn, there are opportunities for volunteers to get involved in picking by hand. The May to December Lausanne \u00e0 Table food festival celebrates the pairing of predominantly Chasselas local white wine and food throughout the city. \u2022 Rooms from \u00a3100, breakfast from \u00a312, rivagelutry.ch Looking for a holiday with a difference?

      "body": "<h2>Top story: PM challenged to prove progress in EU talks</h2> \n<p>Hello, Warren Murray with you, and is this the beginning of the endgame on Brexit?</p> \n<p>Rebel Conservative MPs have adopted a defiant tone as they return to parliament today with Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/02/boris-johnson-threatens-to-ignore-mps-on-no-deal-brexit\">threatening their deselection as Tory candidates</a> and a general election on 14 October if they seize control of the Commons and vote against him on Brexit. The success or failure of such a vote will have a huge impact on the shape of the weeks to come. Johnson\u2019s work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, has broken cabinet ranks to speak out against the PM\u2019s threat to effectively expel Tory rebels from the party: \u201cWe should not be a party that is trying to remove \u2026 two former chancellors, a number of ex-cabinet ministers \u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair either to consider removing the whip from a group of people who oppose no deal.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"445a4a25-3d99-4c45-8469-35955651fc0f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zKlirT5shzQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Philip Hammond \u2013 the previous chancellor, whose name is on the anti-no-deal bill set to be presented to parliament \u2013 challenged Johnson to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/02/rebel-tories-defiant-in-face-of-deselection-and-election-threats\">demonstrate any actual proposals</a> the government has made to the EU about alternatives to the Ireland border backstop, and set out any \u201cspecific progress\u201d made in talks with Brussels. Other MPs who\u2019ve said they are undeterred by the threats include the former justice secretary David Gauke and former ministers Alistair Burt, Stephen Hammond, Richard Harrington and Guto Bebb.</p> \n<p>However, several Tory MPs who have been vocally against no deal appear unwilling to vote to give the rebels and opposition parties control of the Commons order paper. Speaking in Salford, Jeremy Corbyn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/02/jeremy-corbyn-labour-election-northern-vote-no-deal-brexit\">declared himself hungry for an election</a> and promised: \u201cWe will win.\u201d But senior Labour figures suggested that legislation to stop no deal should take precedence over a poll. Corbyn is due to host leaders of other opposition parties in his offices this morning to discuss cross-party legislation to block no deal.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Dive boat disaster \u2013 </strong>Dozens of people are feared dead off the coast of southern California after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/02/burning-boat-california-coast-santa-barbara-los-angeles\">scuba diving boat caught fire</a> in the early hours of Monday morning. Crew members of the Conception jumped off the boat to escape while passengers were asleep below deck. The US Coast Guard confirmed that up to 39 people were on board. While firefighters battled the blaze, the vessel sank 20 yards off the shore in more than 50ft of water. Five people were rescued. At the time of writing, the confirmed death toll is 25 as emergency workers continue to recover bodies. The boat was docked near Santa Cruz Island, off the coast of Santa Barbara and Los Angeles.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>New test gets poor reception \u2013 </strong>Headteachers and campaigners have urged the government to halt plans to introduce a start-of-school assessment for four and five-year-olds, arguing that it is a waste of money and will not benefit schools or children. About half of all primary schools in England will begin to trial the 20-minute test of language skills and ability this week, before a planned full rollout across the country next year. A small-scale survey by University College London found that 86% of headteachers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/sep/03/school-heads-criticise-new-reception-tests-for-five-year-olds\">were negative about the reception baseline assessment</a>. But the Department for Education says that nine in 10 schools have already been carrying out on-entry checks.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>About face \u2013 </strong>Facial recognition is being turned off at the King\u2019s Cross development in London after an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/02/facial-recognition-technology-scrapped-at-kings-cross-development\">outcry over privacy and excessive surveillance</a>. But the developer appeared to hold out the possibility of using it in the future, saying \u201cwe note the broad debate now under way\u201d, adding that its pledge to switch off the technology applied \u201cin the meantime\u201d. The cameras\u2019 use by police in south Wales is being challenged in the courts, while a trial of the technology at the Trafford Centre in Greater Manchester, where visitors were checked against a set of 30 police suspects, was scrapped amid concerns over such extensive monitoring of the public.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Inquiry over attacks on police \u2013 </strong>Britain\u2019s police chiefs are to carry out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/02/police-chiefs-launch-review-of-officers-safety-after-rise-in-attacks\">an urgent review</a> into the rise in attacks on officers. It comes after the death of PC Andrew Harper on 15 August who had responded to a burglary in Berkshire. Two forces \u2013 Durham and Northamptonshire \u2013 have said they will allow frontline officers to carry Tasers. The review will hear from officers about their experiences and consider training, equipment, deployment, investigations into officer assaults, the support available afterwards, and whether the criminal justice system is providing a sufficient deterrent.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Veganism is on a (sausage) roll \u2013 </strong>The steaming success of Greggs\u2019 Quorn-based, vegan sausage roll helped drive up the baker\u2019s profits by more than 50% to \u00a340.6m in the first six months of 2019. \u201cOne way of looking at this is that veganism is great for business,\u201d writes Richard Godwin. \u201cAnother is that vegan sausage rolls are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/03/the-vegan-halo-how-plant-based-products-are-transforming-british-brands\">a great marketing tool for pork sausage rolls</a>.\u201d It is emblematic of the \u201cvegan halo\u201d effect, in which companies that have gone down the non-meat route<strong> </strong>reap the rewards. The effect extends beyond food, Godwin writes: \u201cSuddenly, you can\u2019t move for vegan sofas, vegan face cream, vegan things that you didn\u2019t realise weren\u2019t vegan in the first place.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Today in Focus podcast: Boris Johnson\u2019s ultimatum</h2> \n<p>Jonathan Freedland joins Anushka Asthana to discuss a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2019/sep/03/parliament-returns-for-brexit-showdown-today-in-focus-podcast\">pivotal week ahead in British politics</a>.

This is the myth of the free speech crisis. The purpose of the myth is not to secure freedom of speech, it is to secure the licence to speak with impunity; not freedom of expression, but rather <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/03/the-myth-of-the-free-speech-crisis\">freedom from the consequences of that expression.</a>\u201d</p> \n<h2>Sport</h2> \n<p>Australia coach Justin Langer is trying to put the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/02/justin-langer-australia-stuart-broad-ashes-fourth-test-old-trafford\">Ashes defeat at Headingley behind him</a>, but with England bowler Jofra Archer eager for round two against the returning Steve Smith at Old Trafford, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/02/stuart-broad-steve-smith-brutal-return-jofra-archer-ashes\">Stuart Broad believes there will be scars</a> to exploit.

But the Department for Education says that nine in 10 schools have already been carrying out on-entry checks. * * * About face \u2013 Facial recognition is being turned off at the King\u2019s Cross development in London after an outcry over privacy and excessive surveillance. But the developer appeared to hold out the possibility of using it in the future, saying \u201cwe note the broad debate now under way\u201d, adding that its pledge to switch off the technology applied \u201cin the meantime\u201d. The cameras\u2019 use by police in south Wales is being challenged in the courts, while a trial of the technology at the Trafford Centre in Greater Manchester, where visitors were checked against a set of 30 police suspects, was scrapped amid concerns over such extensive monitoring of the public. * * * Inquiry over attacks on police \u2013 Britain\u2019s police chiefs are to carry out an urgent review into the rise in attacks on officers. It comes after the death of PC Andrew Harper on 15 August who had responded to a burglary in Berkshire. Two forces \u2013 Durham and Northamptonshire \u2013 have said they will allow frontline officers to carry Tasers. The review will hear from officers about their experiences and consider training, equipment, deployment, investigations into officer assaults, the support available afterwards, and whether the criminal justice system is providing a sufficient deterrent. * * * Veganism is on a (sausage) roll \u2013 The steaming success of Greggs\u2019 Quorn-based, vegan sausage roll helped drive up the baker\u2019s profits by more than 50% to \u00a340.6m in the first six months of 2019. \u201cOne way of looking at this is that veganism is great for business,\u201d writes Richard Godwin. \u201cAnother is that vegan sausage rolls are a great marketing tool for pork sausage rolls.\u201d It is emblematic of the \u201cvegan halo\u201d effect, in which companies that have gone down the non-meat route reap the rewards. The effect extends beyond food, Godwin writes: \u201cSuddenly, you can\u2019t move for vegan sofas, vegan face cream, vegan things that you didn\u2019t realise weren\u2019t vegan in the first place.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: Boris Johnson\u2019s ultimatum Jonathan Freedland joins Anushka Asthana to discuss a pivotal week ahead in British politics. Plus, Liz Bentley of the Royal Meteorological Society on the destructive force of Hurricane Dorian, which has been battering the Bahamas. Lunchtime read: Myth of the \u2018free speech crisis\u2019 \u201cWhen I started writing a column in the Guardian,\u201d Nesrine Malik recalls, \u201cI would engage with the commenters who made valid points and urge those whose response was getting lost in rage to re-read the piece and return. Coming up for air at the end of a thread felt like mooring a ship after a few days on choppy waters \u2026 We discussed sensitive, complicated ideas about politics, race, gender and sexuality and, at the end, via a rolling conversation, we had got somewhere. In the decade since, the tenor of those comments became so personalised and abusive that the ship often drowned before making it to shore. \u201cThe vast majority of online abuse goes unpunished. And yet it is somehow conventional wisdom that free speech is under assault, that university campuses have succumbed to an epidemic of no-platforming, that social media mobs are ready to raise their pitchforks at the most innocent slip of the tongue or joke, and that Enlightenment values that protected the right to free expression and individual liberty are under threat. This is the myth of the free speech crisis. The purpose of the myth is not to secure freedom of speech, it is to secure the licence to speak with impunity; not freedom of expression, but rather freedom from the consequences of that expression.\u201d Sport Australia coach Justin Langer is trying to put the Ashes defeat at Headingley behind him, but with England bowler Jofra Archer eager for round two against the returning Steve Smith at Old Trafford, Stuart Broad believes there will be scars to exploit. Joe Denly has confirmed he will switch places with Jason Roy and open the batting for England while Usman Khawaja faces an uncertain future after being dropped by Australia for the fourth Test in Manchester. Belinda Bencic reserved her best again for Naomi Osaka to win 7-5, 6-3 in the fourth round and knock out the defending US Open champion. Johanna Konta\u2019s coach, Dimitri Zavialoff, believes she can overcome her self-doubt and become the first British woman to win the US Open since Virginia Wade in 1968. Phil Neville believes that Lucy Bronze\u2019s response to his challenge a year ago to add \u201cgoals, personality and character\u201d to her game has launched her into global view. And Christian Coleman, the fastest man in the world this year, is free to compete at the world championships in Doha later this month after the US Anti-Doping Agency dropped its charge against him on the advice of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Business The jury might still be out on the impact Brexit will have on the economy, but the prospect of exiting the EU is not doing much for growth. The latest gloom is that UK factory output has slumped to a seven-month low amid uncertainty and volatility around Brexit. It is not great for the pound either of course, which continued its slide yesterday. It has dropped again in overnight trade to $1.203 and \u20ac1.10. The FTSE is on course to lift a modest 0.13%. The papers \u201cJohnson\u2019s ultimatum: back me or face a snap election\u201d is the Guardian\u2019s splash headline today. The Times has: \u201cJohnson warns rebels: I\u2019ll call October election\u201d, while the Telegraph goes with: \u201cI don\u2019t want an election, you don\u2019t want an election ... but it\u2019s planned for October 14\u201d. The Financial Times\u2019 headline is \u201cJohnson threatens snap election if Tory rebels refuse to back him\u201d. The tabloids are a little more creative: \u201cBoris snaps\u201d is the Sun\u2019s take. The Mirror goes with \u201cSnappy election\u201d with a picture of the PM\u2019s dog calling the threat to go to the country a \u201cBrexit dog\u2019s dinner\u201d. The Mail is a little more predictable with \u201cBoris names election date\u201d adding that the PM has warned rebels that \u201cif they \u2018chop his legs off\u2019 by blocking no deal today, he\u2019ll call a snap election in just six weeks\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The sergeant in charge of the Castlemaine police cells on the day Yorta Yorta woman Tanya Day was arrested has rejected a suggestion it was \u201ccriminally negligent\u201d to extend the time between physical welfare checks, an inquest has heard. Sergeant Edwina Neale was the custody supervisor on 5 December, 2017, when Day, 55, was arrested and put in custody for public drunkenness. She said she did not observe Day fall over in custody, and particularly did not see her fall and hit her forehead at 4.51pm. If she had seen the fall, she said, she would have gone to the cell and checked on Day herself. As it was she did not go to the cells between 3.59pm, when Day was checked in, and 8.03pm, when she went to wake Day, noticed a bruise on her forehead, and called an ambulance. The fall at 4.51pm, the inquest has heard, caused the haemorrhage that led to her death 17 days later. Neale was shown CCTV footage of Day in the cells. She agreed that after 5pm it appeared she could not move her right arm, and said that was not noticed at the time. She said footage from before 5pm did show that Day was more unsteady on her feet than she had been at the charge counter, just over an hour earlier, but that she was \u201cbehaving as a conscious, breathing, drunk.\u201d Peter Morrissey SC, the counsel for the Day family, said that Day appeared to be \u201cat risk of falling and cracking their head\u201d given her unsteadiness on her feet. \u201cWell, we found that later, yes,\u201d Neale said. She continued: \u201cI would say that all drunks are at risk of falling and cracking their head in a police cell and at that point ... her behaviour doesn\u2019t alert me particularly.\u201d Neale said she had initially ordered that Day be subject to a physical check every 20 minutes \u2014 more frequently than the 30 minutes required under police guidelines \u2014 because as an Aboriginal woman she was \u201cmore vulnerable\u201d in custody. At some point she changed that to a physical check, which involved walking to the cell and obtaining a meaningful verbal response from Day, every 40 minutes, with a check via the CCTV cameras every 20 minutes. \u201cThat decision was criminally negligent, do you agree or disagree,\u201d Morrissey said. \u201cI totally disagree,\u201d Neale said. \u201cIn fact at that point she was bleeding to death, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know that.\u201d The decision to extend the checks was made after the watch house keeper, Danny Wolters, told her that Day would \u201cget up and become agitated and ask when she could go home\u201d every time he performed a physical check, and that he had felt conducting such frequent checks was \u201cdisturbing her.\u201d Wolters first checked on Day at 4.50pm, leaving just 30 seconds before the devastating fall. Neale said she thinks the decision to extend the time between physical checks was made shortly after, as the next check was not for another 44 minutes. CCTV footage of that check, shown to Neale in court, shows that Wolters and another officer, the leading senior constable Wayne Cairnes, stood at the window to the cell for about six seconds before leaving. Day did not get up from the bed or appear to physically respond while they were there. There is no audio recorded on the footage, but the note Wolters made in the custody log states he had obtained a verbal response. Day stands up several seconds after Wolters has left, apparently in response to him speaking to her, and then falls. Neale said she was not watching the CCTV monitor on her desk to cover the period when Wolters was walking from his desk to the cell. \u201cNo one is going to sit and watch her continually,\u201d she said. Later, she questioned whether the bruise, which she said was the size of a 20c piece, should be called a head injury. \u201cI don\u2019t consider that a head injury ... she had a bruise in the middle of her forehead,\u201d she said. She said she only learned that Day had died from a blow to the head in custody, and not a pre-existing brain bleed, six months ago. Audio of the triple-0 call, played in court, suggests that Wolters told paramedics that Day was checked and gave a verbal response every 20 minutes, rather than every 40; that she had fallen just once at 7pm from the bed to the floor; and that she had got up and walked around immediately after the fall. The first paramedic, Lisa Harrop, arrived at 8.25pm, and two others arrived at 8.50pm. Day is not seen leaving the cell on the stretcher until 8.55pm, some 61 minutes after the bruise was first noticed.",

      "bodyText": "Journalists from Nine Entertainment\u2019s three major newspapers have written to management to \u201cstrongly object\u201d to Nine hosting a $10,000 a head Liberal party fundraiser which they say compromises the mastheads\u2019 reputation for independence. \u201cWe strongly object to our reputation for independent journalism being compromised by the hosting of party political fundraisers,\u201d the house committees of the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and the Australian Financial Review wrote to the CEO, Hugh Marks, and the managing director of publishing, Chris Janz. \u201cThis can only serve to make the job of working journalists more difficult.\u201d The public rebuke of Nine management by Fairfax journalists is the first major sign of tension between the two media brands, which merged last year to become the nation\u2019s largest locally-owned media company. Hosted by Marks, business people paid handsomely for the chance to dine with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the communications minister, Paul Fletcher, inside the Willoughby television studios. Executives from energy, education, mining, real estate and even fashion companies were among the attendees who dined with Liberal ministers on the set of Channel Nine\u2019s breakfast show Today. The letter said reports of the dinner at Nine headquarters on Monday night \u201craised the question of where the Nine newspapers\u2019 political loyalties lie\u201d. \u201cThe former Fairfax mastheads have a long history of political independence,\u201d the journalists said. \u201cIf this has changed and we are now associated with the Liberal Party, this should be conveyed to staff. A decision to host fundraisers for Labor or other political parties would be of equal concern. \u201cOur mastheads have done much to expose the corrupting influence of money on politics. It is vitally important that we remain independent of the political process.\u201d After the merger Nine agreed to support Fairfax\u2019s charter of editorial independence and Marks has insisted the mastheads will retain their independence. \u201cNine management and board have been clear and strong in the support of the charter of editorial independence,\u201d Nine said in response to the letter on Tuesday. \u201cEditorial impartiality is also integral to the operations of our regulated television business. \u201cWe participate actively in our democracy and speak to all parties to press our case around regulation and other political issues that concern our business and the ability of our people to perform their role. \u201cWe took the opportunity last night to present our case to the Liberal Party at their business forum and today to the Labor Party at their event and dinner with their leader.\u201d The attendees at the fundraiser included: John Grill, the chairman and non-executive director of the energy, chemicals and resources company Worley Stephen Nagle, the executive director of the vocational education provider Holmes Institute Stephen Conry, the chief executive of the commercial real estate services firm Jones Lang LaSalle Harry Triguboff, the founder and managing director of Meriton Rob Cromb, the co-founder of the fashion label Kookai The former Labor premier and current Australian Banking Association chief executive, Anna Bligh, attended, as did the Liberal powerbroker Michael Photios and the former Liberal cities minister and now PricewaterhouseCoopers partner Jamie Briggs. The Minerals Council of Australia chairman and former communications minister, Helen Coonan; the MCA chief executive, Tania Constable; the former deputy prime minister and current Servcorp director, Mark Vaile; and the Servcorp chairman, Alf Moufarrige, also attended. The other ministers in attendance were the trade minister and deputy Senate leader Simon Birmingham; the government services minister, Stuart Robert; the education minister, Dan Tehan; and the minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure, Alan Tudge. Since its merger with Fairfax Media last year, Nine has had control of the SMH, AFR and Age, mastheads which have always prided themselves on independent journalism. On Tuesday the chief political correspondent for the SMH and the Age, David Crowe, questioned the wisdom of the decision to host the fundraiser. \u201cI\u2019ve spent decades in journalism sometimes doubting the management decisions made by the companies I work for and not being able to change them, I guess that might be the case now,\u201d he told ABC\u2019s Radio National. \u201cOne thing I think is important is that there\u2019s a charter of editorial independence that we had at Fairfax before the merger with Nine, [and] that\u2019s being honoured by the Nine board.\u201d Crowe cited the fact the dinner was first reported by the AFR as evidence that \u201ceditorial independence is in place\u201d. The News Corp Australia columnist Andrew Bolt mocked the papers for marketing themselves as \u201cindependent always\u201d and hosting a Liberal fundraiser. \u201cWhat signal does Nine\u2019s fundraising dinner send?\u201d Bolt asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that Nine\u2019s newspapers, or at least its bosses, are at this very early stage in the electoral cycle committing themselves to the Liberal government. \u201cIt\u2019s also that they are crawling to power, when power must always be held to account. \u201cYes, held to account, not handed $700,000 and sent home with a full belly.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The Clark county death investigator Jill Roberts vividly recalls the sunny 115F (46C) afternoon last summer when she entered a Las Vegas home with no functional air conditioning. The indoor heat felt even worse than the broiling temperature outside. She climbed up the stairs, through thick, stifling air, landing in a third-story bedroom where the resident had died in sweltering conditions. The room had no fan and the door was shut. It felt as if it couldn\u2019t get any hotter.</p> <p>\u201cOur elements are unforgiving. Especially on those 115F days, it doesn\u2019t take a lot,\u201d Roberts told the Guardian.<strong> </strong>\u201cIn that situation I\u2019ll go stand in the sun in the 115F heat to do my paperwork as opposed to staying in the house because it\u2019s that hot.\u201d</p> <p>The coroner\u2019s office in Clark county, which encompasses Las Vegas, often records heat as a contributing factor to accidental deaths. There are hikers succumbing to lethal temperatures in the surrounding desert and heat-related deaths in cars and homes when occupants forgo cooling.

A June study of coroner data by the Las Vegas-based Desert Research Institute <a href=\"https://www.dri.edu/newsroom/news-releases/5837-researchers-identify-connection-between-more-frequent-intense-heat-events-and-deaths-in-las-vegas\">found</a> a correlation between heatwaves and heat-related deaths in southern Nevada, both of which, they say, are on the rise. And a recent Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) <a href=\"https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/global-warming-impacts/killer-heat-in-united-states\">report</a> warns that without global action to reduce carbon emissions, the city will probably experience 96 days of heat above 100F by the end of the century, including 60 days over 105F, and seven \u201coff the chart\u201d days that would break the current heat index.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Line break\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Line break</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Every city has its own challenges</strong> in adapting to climate change, even those that are supposedly accustomed to severe heat.

The resorts have long been the economic driver. Over a third of the area\u2019s workforce is supported by the 40 million visitors a year who descend on their gargantuan hotel towers, bustling casinos and massive convention halls. And as tourism grows, so does the population.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ef250bf6e413869a4eee0b9d19c103b4ec4db21d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef250bf6e413869a4eee0b9d19c103b4ec4db21d/0_274_8216_4929/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Southern Nevada has welcomed unfettered development since the 1930s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Southern Nevada has welcomed unfettered development since the 1930s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the boom years before the 2008 housing crisis, hundreds of miles of desert landscape were paved over with heat-absorbing asphalt and concrete, worsening a \u201cheat island\u201d effect in the cauldron-like valley.

      "bodyText": "The Clark county death investigator Jill Roberts vividly recalls the sunny 115F (46C) afternoon last summer when she entered a Las Vegas home with no functional air conditioning. The indoor heat felt even worse than the broiling temperature outside. She climbed up the stairs, through thick, stifling air, landing in a third-story bedroom where the resident had died in sweltering conditions. The room had no fan and the door was shut. It felt as if it couldn\u2019t get any hotter. \u201cOur elements are unforgiving. Especially on those 115F days, it doesn\u2019t take a lot,\u201d Roberts told the Guardian. \u201cIn that situation I\u2019ll go stand in the sun in the 115F heat to do my paperwork as opposed to staying in the house because it\u2019s that hot.\u201d The coroner\u2019s office in Clark county, which encompasses Las Vegas, often records heat as a contributing factor to accidental deaths. There are hikers succumbing to lethal temperatures in the surrounding desert and heat-related deaths in cars and homes when occupants forgo cooling. Roberts has seen homeless people with post-mortem burns from collapsing on hot streets. And it will get worse. Las Vegas is the fastest-warming city in the United States, its temperatures having risen 5.76F since 1970. A June study of coroner data by the Las Vegas-based Desert Research Institute found a correlation between heatwaves and heat-related deaths in southern Nevada, both of which, they say, are on the rise. And a recent Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) report warns that without global action to reduce carbon emissions, the city will probably experience 96 days of heat above 100F by the end of the century, including 60 days over 105F, and seven \u201coff the chart\u201d days that would break the current heat index. Every city has its own challenges in adapting to climate change, even those that are supposedly accustomed to severe heat. In Las Vegas, a laissez-faire attitude toward growth has allowed high temperatures to become even more deadly, and the scorching heat now threatens the city\u2019s basic functionality. Like the tourist guzzling alcohol by the resort pool, smiling and flirting until he faints from dehydration, southern Nevada has welcomed unfettered development since the 1930s \u2013 the advent of the home cooling era \u2013 when its population began to double in size nearly every decade despite limited water resources and increased drought. The resorts have long been the economic driver. Over a third of the area\u2019s workforce is supported by the 40 million visitors a year who descend on their gargantuan hotel towers, bustling casinos and massive convention halls. And as tourism grows, so does the population. During the boom years before the 2008 housing crisis, hundreds of miles of desert landscape were paved over with heat-absorbing asphalt and concrete, worsening a \u201cheat island\u201d effect in the cauldron-like valley. Outward growth also led to vehicles motoring further across the sprawling metropolis, increasing heat-trapping carbon emissions. Now, with growth having continued each year since 2011, and new home developments returning to boom-era levels, Sin City is reckoning with a future that looks downright hellish. \u201cThe thing about Vegas is, we always do feast and famine,\u201d said Tick Segerblom, a former state senator who now sits on the Clark county commission, which governs the Las Vegas Valley. \u201cWe never bother to say, \u2018Where are we going? What are we doing?\u2019\u201d During summer months, when Las Vegas city buses break down notoriously often, many pedestrians carry umbrellas to protect their skin, and those without cover often \u201cshadow walk\u201d, following the shade of palm trees, signs and buildings to avoid direct exposure to a sunshine that can cause humans to overheat. The city\u2019s poorest residents are most at risk. Fans and cooling systems can save lives, said Jill Roberts, the coroner office investigator, \u201cbut some people just don\u2019t have the funds to fix their air conditioning or have working equipment\u201d. Hundreds of homeless people living in the city choose to camp in storm drains rather than sleep above ground \u2013 another dystopian irony to the city\u2019s reputation for glitz and glamor. Those who dislike the tunnels often have to work hard to stay cool. Marcy Averett, 49, and her husband spend 15 hours a day collecting recyclables. But each day before they set off, they buy ice. \u201cI have to have cold water. I don\u2019t know how people do it with hot water,\u201d she told the Guardian on an August afternoon as she dragged a shopping cart filled with aluminum cans out of the blistering sun, into the shade of a highway overpass. An orange cooler hung from the side of her cart. Averett had a spray bottle to mist her face and neck, and applied lip balm as we spoke. \u201cI put medicated moisturizer on my lips constantly, all day every day, and my lips are still cracked. It\u2019s this heat.\u201d Like many other rapidly warming cities across the United States, Vegas has only recently begun to reckon with its future. \u201cThe real question is, do we want a place where we just go from our houses to our cars to our offices, and never go outside because it\u2019s too hot?\u201d Segerblom, the former state senator, asked. \u201cHow many months of the year is that tenable?\u201d Rachel Licker of the Union of Concerned Scientists warned that southern Nevada\u2019s productivity and essential services will become increasingly stressed as temperatures rise \u2013 construction projects will slow or stop more frequently to ensure worker safety; police and postal workers may be affected; and since studies show schoolchildren perform worse as temperatures rise, teachers may need to adjust testing schedules and standards for days if not months at a time. Meanwhile, power surges may become more common if increased demand overwhelms electrical grids, leaving the people most sensitive to heat illness such as children and the elderly without a cooling system when it\u2019s needed most. \u201cEven though people in Las Vegas might be used to high levels of heat, it\u2019s going to get even hotter, and we don\u2019t know how much they\u2019re going to be able to withstand,\u201d Licker said. As Las Vegas Valley reaches its limits, many in the community believe now is an opportune time to contemplate the future of the city. \u201cWhat do we want to be when we grow up?\u201d said Segerblom. \u201cIs there a way to manage this valley that\u2019s good for the quality of life of the citizens of Nevada, not just for the tourists and hotels?\u201d He noted that while state and federal policies get the most media attention, municipal governments can affect the environment just as well. Planting more native trees and shrubs, enforcing energy-efficient building standards, zoning to promote upward rather than outward growth, and developing alternatives to blacktop roads and concrete sidewalks are all policies that could have a major impact. To lessen its own carbon footprint, the city of Las Vegas began powering all government buildings and streetlights with renewable energy in 2016. The state\u2019s largest energy consumers, the multi-thousand room hotels and casinos on the Strip, have also made environmental sustainability a priority in recent years.

      "bodyText": "The Trump administration has attacked LGBT rights in healthcare, employment, housing, education, commerce, the military, prisons and sports. These efforts, it turns out, were just the beginning. The president\u2019s anti-LGBT agenda could soon gain significant momentum at the US supreme court, where Trump\u2019s Department of Justice (DoJ) is pushing to make it legal to fire people for being gay or transgender. The move would fundamentally reverse civil rights for millions of people, LGBT leaders say, and raises fears that LGBT people may lose the minimal protections and resources they have won in past years. \u201cThis is a critical point in history,\u201d said Alesdair Ittelson, the law and policy director at interACT: Advocates for Intersex Youth. \u201cThe outcome of this case is going to have a tremendous impact on everyone.\u201d Trump\u2019s most aggressive anti-gay legal argument yet Under Obama, LGBT people won a number of key victories, including the repeal of the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d ban on gay military members, new protections under the Affordable Care Act, an anti-discrimination executive order and expanded recognition of trans rights. Since taking office, the Trump administration has sought to reverse healthcare protections for trans people, moved to ban trans people from serving in the military, eliminated rules protecting trans students and pushed to allow businesses to turn away gay and trans customers if they seek a religious exemption. Last month, the Trump justice department made its most aggressive anti-gay legal argument to date, urging the supreme court to rule that gay employees are not protected under a longstanding act that prohibits \u201csex discrimination\u201d. The DoJ filed briefs related to three supreme court cases to be heard together on 8 October \u2013 two involving gay men fired from their jobs, and a third involving a woman terminated by her employer after she came out as trans. Courts have repeatedly affirmed that LGBT people are covered by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the federal government has agreed. But the DoJ is now arguing that sexual orientation and gender identity are excluded under Title VII because \u201csex\u201d narrowly refers to whether people are \u201cbiologically male or female\u201d. The definition not only seeks to invalidate trans people, but also altogether erases intersex people, who are born with a mix of what are typically considered male and female sex characteristics and make up 1.7% of the population. \u201cWhen the federal government and the nation\u2019s lawyers come out against you and say that your rights don\u2019t exist, it hurts the most vulnerable members of our community,\u201d said Robin Maril, the associate legal director at the Human Rights Campaign (HRC). Lifetimes of rejection: \u2018We don\u2019t have a place for someone like you\u2019 LGBT people said existing laws meant to shield them are inadequate and poorly enforced \u2013 and that if they were to lose what little recourses they have now, the consequences could be devastating. \u201cWe\u2019ve done so much work to prove our humanity to the rest of the world,\u201d said Aria Sa\u2019id, a San Francisco advocate who helped create the country\u2019s first-ever trans cultural district. \u201cThe policies and laws are in place, but that doesn\u2019t mean the social attitudes are \u2026 Trans people are literally living at the will of other people\u2019s opinions.\u201d Sa\u2019id cited the danger and abuse trans people face in homeless shelters \u2013 a problem that could be exacerbated by a May 2019 proposal by US housing officials that would, in effect, allow \u201csingle-sex\u201d shelters to turn away trans people. \u201cIt\u2019s disheartening and terrifying,\u201d said Koomah, a 32-year-old Houston-based activist who was previously homeless and is intersex. \u201cWe are made to violate the law because of the way that our bodies are.\u201d Koomah, who goes by a single name and is also genderfluid, said that when they were a teenager at a homeless shelter, they appeared androgynous, and staff forced them to undergo a genital examination to determine if they should be in the boys or girls section. Ultimately, the shelter kicked them out and they wound up on the street. \u201cI was told, \u2018We don\u2019t have a place for someone like you.\u2019\u201d said Koomah. \u201cMy housing is still unstable today, and even as an adult I know that if I get put in a homeless shelter, I may or may not be given space to be there.\u201d Khloe Rios, a 30-year-old not-for-profit manager who made headlines this month when she and a group of other trans women were forcibly dragged out of a downtown Los Angeles bar, said it was already difficult for trans people to find steady jobs. \u201cWe\u2019re all trying to survive,\u201d she said, noting that she was unexpectedly fired from her first job out of college at a marketing agency and that she believed she was targeted because she was trans. She added it was painful to think about the ways Trump has fueled hate against her community: \u201cI have no words \u2026 I feel very defeated. It\u2019s scary.\u201d Can Trump legalize discrimination? Civil rights experts said they are confident the DoJ\u2019s arguments would fail at the supreme court, given the well-established precedent from previous rulings.

The damage already done: \u2018I feel defeated\u2019 The constant barrage of headlines has already emboldened bigotry and caused a lot of anxiety, activists said. River Gowan Stone, a 40-year-old who is non-binary and trans, said he has faced repeated workplace discrimination throughout his career, and that it was hard to accept that things are getting worse: \u201cI have so much to contribute to the world, but it\u2019s terrifying to be at the whims of whoever I\u2019m encountering.\u201d The nonstop bad news from DC, along with the frequent murders of black trans women, took a severe toll on trans women, said Sa\u2019id, the San Francisco organizer: \u201cIt literally has me in stages of severe depression.\u201d Ultimately, no policy can stop people from living as their true selves, said Tanya Armstrong, a 34-year-old Los Angeles resident who is non-binary and intersex: \u201cWe\u2019re here, and we\u2019ve always been here, and no matter how many times they try to sweep us under the rug, we\u2019re still going to be here.\u201d Sa\u2019id added, \u201cI know who I am.

      "body": "<p>Silicon Valley has long sought to disrupt virtually every aspect of modern life. Now comes technology\u2019s final frontier: old age. Tech that\u2019s specifically designed for seniors is a growing market, fueled by inexorable demographic trends \u2013 about 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 every day.</p> <p>Senior tech is increasingly showing up in assisted living facilities and nursing homes. A company called It\u2019s Never Too Late proffers a massive 70in high-definition touchscreen computer that provides older people with little prior tech experience easy access to everything from travel videos and music playlists to a library of college lectures. Paro, a robotic seal stuffed with sensors and actuators that react to voice, light and touch, is being used to help those experiencing memory loss and social withdrawal.<strong> </strong>A movie system called 3Scape provides immersive 3D filmed content for the elderly and mobility-challenged in order to stimulate cognitive function and relieve depression and anxiety.</p> <p>\u201cAt retirement communities these days, technology is no longer a selling point, it\u2019s an expectation,\u201d says Davis Park, executive director of the Center for Innovation and Wellbeing at Front Porch, a not-for-profit company that manages 12 retirement communities nationwide.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7d3ddab96039957435f3e3de12a0dffb1484d76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7d3ddab96039957435f3e3de12a0dffb1484d76/0_157_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paro is a robotic seal that responds to touch and sound.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paro is a robotic seal that responds to touch and sound.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: University of Brighton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>San Francisco\u2019s Bay Area is ground zero for the emerging senior tech boom. The Trousdale, a new assisted living center in Burlingame, California, touts itself as a \u201ctechnology-driven community and innovation hub inspired by Silicon Valley\u201d.<strong> </strong>Every new resident at the Trousdale is issued a tablet computer, and all of the bedrooms feature smart sensor lighting that adapts to the routines of each occupant. \u201cFind the best version of you,\u201d declare print ads for the Trousdale, accompanied by a photo of three silver-haired residents crowded around a tablet computer, laughing uproariously.</p> <p>Rhoda Goldman Plaza, a residential care facility in San Francisco, offers \u201cdecision-support tools\u201d to address the challenges of growing older, including a Useful Apps club that allows residents to \u201cunlock the potential of your smartphone\u201d. The senior-targeted apps include pill organizers, medication reminders and guides on how the elderly can use Amazon Alexa.</p> <p>Sunny View, a retirement community in Cupertino, California, features the sort of leading edge technology you would expect from a residential community located just minutes from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/12/apple-headquarters-most-expensive-buildings\">Apple\u2019s world headquarters</a>.</p> <p>Sunny View offers its residents everything from immersive 3D virtual reality systems to \u201cexergame\u201d bikes that use computer-simulated environments to promote wellness through competition.</p> <p>Several tech companies have joined in on the gold rush to mine the golden years.<strong> </strong>Aiva Health, a Los Angeles-based startup, uses Google Home, Amazon Echo and smart speakers to support a mobile app for assisted living caregivers that manages help requests, performance reports, and remote controls for TVs, lights and thermostats. ElliQ, \u201cthe sidekick for happier aging\u201d, is a robotic voice-enabled assistant designed to make it easier to make video calls, set medication reminders and arrange doctor appointments. GreyMatters is an interactive storybook app that pairs visual reminiscences with music and games to jog memories.<strong> </strong>The senior tech field is quickly becoming more crowded than the early bird special at a South Florida restaurant.</p> <p>\u201cRight now, I\u2019ve got 15 startup companies waiting to pitch their technology,\u201d says Jennifer Bayard, senior vice-president of clinical operations at Carlton Senior Living, which operates 11 communities in northern California and has tested several new technologies at its facilities. \u201cMy phone is ringing off the hook with calls from entrepreneurs.\u201d</p> <p>Even venture capital firms are hoping to land a silver-haired unicorn. Honor, a San Francisco-based startup offering a technology platform that provides personalized senior home-care management, has raised $115m in VC funding. Los Angeles-based Renew Health, a startup promising to \u201ctransform medication management\u201d, has raised $13m in seed money, and its employees include alumni from Microsoft, Oracle and Snapchat.</p> <h2>From smart toilets to virtual assistants</h2> <p>No area of life is safe from being disrupted by technology, not even the bathroom. The <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/here-s-how-smart-toilets-future-could-protect-your-health-ncna961656\">TrueLoo \u201csmart toilet\u201d</a> optically scans and analyzes the contents of a toilet bowl to detect signs of dehydration, viruses and urinary tract infections. The TrueLoo is currently being tested at several northern California senior living communities and has secured a round of venture capital funding before it even hits the market.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re creating the bathroom of the future,\u201d says Vik Kashyap, co-founder and CEO of Toi Labs, maker of the TrueLoo. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to prevent health problems before they become too late to treat. And in<strong> </strong>terms of the overall user experience, we\u2019re trying to make it as seamless as possible.\u201d</p> <p>This isn\u2019t the first time that tech startups have attempted to crack the senior market, and past efforts have had only limited success. But with the steady ageing of the baby boomers, many startups believe that this market is poised for explosive growth. The oldest baby boomers are now approaching their mid-70s; the youngest are old enough to qualify for a senior discount at McDonald\u2019s. By 2035, the number of Americans 65 years and older will outnumber children for the first time in US history. For a tech industry that worships at the altar of year-to-year growth, the numbers are enticing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5d972049adf166e8fc8aed32f24b43027668809\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5d972049adf166e8fc8aed32f24b43027668809/0_172_4426_2655/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An elderly woman in Miami tests out a virtual reality device marketed to the elderly.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An elderly woman in Miami tests out a virtual reality device marketed to the elderly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rhona Wise/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So far, technology aimed at seniors is a decidedly mixed bag. Some of it is truly transformative, significantly improving the lives of users by monitoring their health, stimulating their brains, exercising their bodies and connecting them to loved ones. Other technologies fail to live up to their hype, a reality familiar to tech users of any age. </p> <p>\u201cTwenty years ago, the whole concept of having seniors engage with technology was looked at somewhat frivolously,\u201d says Jack York, president and co-founder of It\u2019s Never 2 Late, the company that designed the touchscreen computer system used at Sunny View.<strong> </strong>\u201cBut seniors are just as thirsty to stay engaged as any age group. If you expose them to things that are meaningful to them, you get better behaviors, they eat better, they\u2019re more engaged.\u201d</p> <p>Togg, a device that uses wall-mounted radar sensors to monitor breathing, positions and activities of nursing home residents, has shown promise in limited trials. The technology employs algorithms that help predict falls by analyzing a wide range of data about an individual\u2019s motion, gait, heart rate and even number of trips to the bathroom.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really cool technology,\u201d says Neil Tantingco, owner of Evergreen Residence Assisted Living in Visalia, California. \u201cWe\u2019re testing it right now in 15 rooms, but I want to make it a standard throughout the facility.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Seniors are just as thirsty to stay engaged as any age group. If you expose them to things that are meaningful to them, you get better behaviours, they're more engaged</p> <footer> <cite>Jack York</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Voice-controlled virtual assistants such as Alexa have proved the most popular. Eskaton, a not-for-profit that provides services at more than 30 senior communities, recently deployed Alexa at one of its facilities and it became an instant hit. Less than 40% of residents were using standard tablet computers on a weekly basis. With Alexa, that rate climbed to 80%.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t anticipate Alexa would be that popular,\u201d says Therese ten Brinke, Eskaton\u2019s project coordinator. \u201cVoice control is so much easier and more natural for seniors instead of learning how to use a tablet.\u201d</p> <p>However, other technologies fall well short of their promise. Standard laptop, tablet and desktop computers are far from being user friendly for older adults, who often struggle with complicated user interfaces and difficult-to-manipulate keyboard and mouse controls. Many become frustrated trying to perform even simple computer functions, much less advanced tricks like pressing the \u201cskip this ad\u201d button without accidentally clicking the nearby link that sends you to the advertiser\u2019s website.</p> <p>Other times, technology specifically aimed at older people seems to be a solution in search of a problem.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re bombarded by a lot of startups selling technology, and some of them don\u2019t have things worked out,\u201d says Sylvia Chu, executive director of the Trousdale. \u201cI saw a presentation from one company that was selling a device that looked like a giant fax machine that dispensed medications with the press of a button. But it wasn\u2019t any better than having someone put the medications in a weekly pill organizer.\u201d</p> <p>GeriJoy, an MIT startup, has designed a tablet-based application that lets older people interact with a virtual talking dog, which the company says helps users be less lonely \u201cbecause they always have someone to talk to.\u201d But when the device was tested at Evergreen Residence Assisted Living, it proved to be more alarming than companionable. The virtual dog\u2019s bark was harshly robotic-sounding, confusing many residents. To make matters worse, the remote caregivers tasked with interacting with users\u2019 questions and comments over an Internet connection were based in the Philippines, causing technical and cultural problems.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes, the dog would answer a question and the patient would be two or three conversations ahead,\u201d says Neil Tantingco.</p> <p>\u201cAnd because the remote caregivers were in the Philippines, they didn\u2019t always understand certain references. Like, they didn\u2019t know what Walgreens was.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes, the technology failed for a reason all too familiar to computer users everywhere: lack of tech support.</p> <p>\u201cTechnology for seniors is a great marketing tool, but unless you support it with training, it\u2019s useless,\u201d says Candiece Milford, managing director of marketing at Rhoda Goldman Plaza. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant learning curve because they forget how to use the device. Some of them are terrified when the computer screen times out and goes blank, because they think they\u2019ve lost everything.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Silicon Valley has long sought to disrupt virtually every aspect of modern life. Now comes technology\u2019s final frontier: old age. Tech that\u2019s specifically designed for seniors is a growing market, fueled by inexorable demographic trends \u2013 about 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 every day. Senior tech is increasingly showing up in assisted living facilities and nursing homes. A company called It\u2019s Never Too Late proffers a massive 70in high-definition touchscreen computer that provides older people with little prior tech experience easy access to everything from travel videos and music playlists to a library of college lectures. Paro, a robotic seal stuffed with sensors and actuators that react to voice, light and touch, is being used to help those experiencing memory loss and social withdrawal. A movie system called 3Scape provides immersive 3D filmed content for the elderly and mobility-challenged in order to stimulate cognitive function and relieve depression and anxiety. \u201cAt retirement communities these days, technology is no longer a selling point, it\u2019s an expectation,\u201d says Davis Park, executive director of the Center for Innovation and Wellbeing at Front Porch, a not-for-profit company that manages 12 retirement communities nationwide. San Francisco\u2019s Bay Area is ground zero for the emerging senior tech boom. The Trousdale, a new assisted living center in Burlingame, California, touts itself as a \u201ctechnology-driven community and innovation hub inspired by Silicon Valley\u201d. Every new resident at the Trousdale is issued a tablet computer, and all of the bedrooms feature smart sensor lighting that adapts to the routines of each occupant. \u201cFind the best version of you,\u201d declare print ads for the Trousdale, accompanied by a photo of three silver-haired residents crowded around a tablet computer, laughing uproariously. Rhoda Goldman Plaza, a residential care facility in San Francisco, offers \u201cdecision-support tools\u201d to address the challenges of growing older, including a Useful Apps club that allows residents to \u201cunlock the potential of your smartphone\u201d. The senior-targeted apps include pill organizers, medication reminders and guides on how the elderly can use Amazon Alexa. Sunny View, a retirement community in Cupertino, California, features the sort of leading edge technology you would expect from a residential community located just minutes from Apple\u2019s world headquarters. Sunny View offers its residents everything from immersive 3D virtual reality systems to \u201cexergame\u201d bikes that use computer-simulated environments to promote wellness through competition. Several tech companies have joined in on the gold rush to mine the golden years. Aiva Health, a Los Angeles-based startup, uses Google Home, Amazon Echo and smart speakers to support a mobile app for assisted living caregivers that manages help requests, performance reports, and remote controls for TVs, lights and thermostats. ElliQ, \u201cthe sidekick for happier aging\u201d, is a robotic voice-enabled assistant designed to make it easier to make video calls, set medication reminders and arrange doctor appointments. GreyMatters is an interactive storybook app that pairs visual reminiscences with music and games to jog memories. The senior tech field is quickly becoming more crowded than the early bird special at a South Florida restaurant. \u201cRight now, I\u2019ve got 15 startup companies waiting to pitch their technology,\u201d says Jennifer Bayard, senior vice-president of clinical operations at Carlton Senior Living, which operates 11 communities in northern California and has tested several new technologies at its facilities. \u201cMy phone is ringing off the hook with calls from entrepreneurs.\u201d Even venture capital firms are hoping to land a silver-haired unicorn. Honor, a San Francisco-based startup offering a technology platform that provides personalized senior home-care management, has raised $115m in VC funding. Los Angeles-based Renew Health, a startup promising to \u201ctransform medication management\u201d, has raised $13m in seed money, and its employees include alumni from Microsoft, Oracle and Snapchat. From smart toilets to virtual assistants No area of life is safe from being disrupted by technology, not even the bathroom. The TrueLoo \u201csmart toilet\u201d optically scans and analyzes the contents of a toilet bowl to detect signs of dehydration, viruses and urinary tract infections. The TrueLoo is currently being tested at several northern California senior living communities and has secured a round of venture capital funding before it even hits the market. \u201cWe\u2019re creating the bathroom of the future,\u201d says Vik Kashyap, co-founder and CEO of Toi Labs, maker of the TrueLoo. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to prevent health problems before they become too late to treat. And in terms of the overall user experience, we\u2019re trying to make it as seamless as possible.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time that tech startups have attempted to crack the senior market, and past efforts have had only limited success. But with the steady ageing of the baby boomers, many startups believe that this market is poised for explosive growth. The oldest baby boomers are now approaching their mid-70s; the youngest are old enough to qualify for a senior discount at McDonald\u2019s. By 2035, the number of Americans 65 years and older will outnumber children for the first time in US history. For a tech industry that worships at the altar of year-to-year growth, the numbers are enticing. So far, technology aimed at seniors is a decidedly mixed bag. Some of it is truly transformative, significantly improving the lives of users by monitoring their health, stimulating their brains, exercising their bodies and connecting them to loved ones. Other technologies fail to live up to their hype, a reality familiar to tech users of any age. \u201cTwenty years ago, the whole concept of having seniors engage with technology was looked at somewhat frivolously,\u201d says Jack York, president and co-founder of It\u2019s Never 2 Late, the company that designed the touchscreen computer system used at Sunny View. \u201cBut seniors are just as thirsty to stay engaged as any age group. If you expose them to things that are meaningful to them, you get better behaviors, they eat better, they\u2019re more engaged.\u201d Togg, a device that uses wall-mounted radar sensors to monitor breathing, positions and activities of nursing home residents, has shown promise in limited trials. The technology employs algorithms that help predict falls by analyzing a wide range of data about an individual\u2019s motion, gait, heart rate and even number of trips to the bathroom. \u201cIt\u2019s really cool technology,\u201d says Neil Tantingco, owner of Evergreen Residence Assisted Living in Visalia, California. \u201cWe\u2019re testing it right now in 15 rooms, but I want to make it a standard throughout the facility.\u201d Voice-controlled virtual assistants such as Alexa have proved the most popular. Eskaton, a not-for-profit that provides services at more than 30 senior communities, recently deployed Alexa at one of its facilities and it became an instant hit. Less than 40% of residents were using standard tablet computers on a weekly basis. With Alexa, that rate climbed to 80%. \u201cWe didn\u2019t anticipate Alexa would be that popular,\u201d says Therese ten Brinke, Eskaton\u2019s project coordinator. \u201cVoice control is so much easier and more natural for seniors instead of learning how to use a tablet.\u201d However, other technologies fall well short of their promise. Standard laptop, tablet and desktop computers are far from being user friendly for older adults, who often struggle with complicated user interfaces and difficult-to-manipulate keyboard and mouse controls. Many become frustrated trying to perform even simple computer functions, much less advanced tricks like pressing the \u201cskip this ad\u201d button without accidentally clicking the nearby link that sends you to the advertiser\u2019s website. Other times, technology specifically aimed at older people seems to be a solution in search of a problem. \u201cWe\u2019re bombarded by a lot of startups selling technology, and some of them don\u2019t have things worked out,\u201d says Sylvia Chu, executive director of the Trousdale. \u201cI saw a presentation from one company that was selling a device that looked like a giant fax machine that dispensed medications with the press of a button. But it wasn\u2019t any better than having someone put the medications in a weekly pill organizer.\u201d GeriJoy, an MIT startup, has designed a tablet-based application that lets older people interact with a virtual talking dog, which the company says helps users be less lonely \u201cbecause they always have someone to talk to.\u201d But when the device was tested at Evergreen Residence Assisted Living, it proved to be more alarming than companionable. The virtual dog\u2019s bark was harshly robotic-sounding, confusing many residents. To make matters worse, the remote caregivers tasked with interacting with users\u2019 questions and comments over an Internet connection were based in the Philippines, causing technical and cultural problems. \u201cSometimes, the dog would answer a question and the patient would be two or three conversations ahead,\u201d says Neil Tantingco. \u201cAnd because the remote caregivers were in the Philippines, they didn\u2019t always understand certain references. Like, they didn\u2019t know what Walgreens was.\u201d Sometimes, the technology failed for a reason all too familiar to computer users everywhere: lack of tech support. \u201cTechnology for seniors is a great marketing tool, but unless you support it with training, it\u2019s useless,\u201d says Candiece Milford, managing director of marketing at Rhoda Goldman Plaza. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant learning curve because they forget how to use the device. Some of them are terrified when the computer screen times out and goes blank, because they think they\u2019ve lost everything.\u201d",

Another is that vegan sausage rolls are a great marketing tool for pork sausage rolls.</p> <p>Greggs is emblematic of the \u201cvegan halo\u201d effect, by which companies that have embraced veganism<strong> </strong>have<strong> </strong>reaped the rewards. In May, the \u201cfast-casual\u201d chain Leon reported that its sales for 2018 were up 24.5% to \u00a395m. A lot of that is down to offerings such as jack wings, in which jackfruit replaces fried chicken, and the beetroot-based love burger. In January 2018, 46% of Leon\u2019s sales were vegetarian, while 34% were vegan. By January 2019, those totals were up to 64% and 55%.

Dr Martens boots have strolled in and out of fashion many times in the past few decades, but the brand is proving a hit with eco-conscious teenagers \u2013 and celebrities such as Kristen Stewart, Jessica Alba and Gigi Hadid. The fact that you can buy vegan sparkling-pink 1460s and cherry-red chelsea boots made from polyurethane plastic seems to speak to the company\u2019s core mission, which its CEO, Kenny Wilson, defines as \u201cempowering rebellious self-expression\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eba911589a919f41a68a4bf9f20f4eeacffc6903\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eba911589a919f41a68a4bf9f20f4eeacffc6903/0_0_2000_1680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vegan sparkling-pink 1460 boots by Dr Martens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"840\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Empowering rebellious self-expression\u2019 ... vegan sparkling-pink 1460 boots by Dr Martens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dr Martens has been owned by Permira, a private equity company, since 2014.

Vegan products usually involve much more processing than meat products \u2013 and there are also economies of scale to consider. \u201cImagine how many Tesco beef burgers are manufactured every day.

He concedes that vegans may not be delighted at the thought of regular sausages piggy-backing on their Quorn-based pastrymates. \u201cIf you\u2019re a vegan who wants everybody to be vegan, well, yes, you might want to go to establishments that only sell vegan,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the fastest-growing trends in the market is vegan-only retail. But those companies will end up catering only to vegans \u2013 and vegans don\u2019t make up most of the market.\u201d</p> <p>Rosemary Ferguson and Gizzi Erskine had a social media hit earlier this year with <a href=\"https://www.hot-dinners.com/Gastroblog/Latest-news/gizzi-erskine-s-pure-filth-veggie-burger-pop-up-plans-to-go-permanent\" title=\"\">a three-month stint selling vegan </a><a href=\"https://www.hot-dinners.com/Gastroblog/Latest-news/gizzi-erskine-s-pure-filth-veggie-burger-pop-up-plans-to-go-permanent\" title=\"\">Filth burgers at a pop-up in east London</a> \u2013 but the endorsements of the Beckham family haven\u2019t translated into permanent restaurants.

But, as Clark points out, the companies that try to make a quick buck from veganism will soon get found out. \u201cYou will quickly get a backlash if people think you\u2019re \u2018greenwashing\u2019.

He concedes that vegans may not be delighted at the thought of regular sausages piggy-backing on their Quorn-based pastrymates. \u201cIf you\u2019re a vegan who wants everybody to be vegan, well, yes, you might want to go to establishments that only sell vegan,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the fastest-growing trends in the market is vegan-only retail. But those companies will end up catering only to vegans \u2013 and vegans don\u2019t make up most of the market.\u201d Rosemary Ferguson and Gizzi Erskine had a social media hit earlier this year with a three-month stint selling vegan Filth burgers at a pop-up in east London \u2013 but the endorsements of the Beckham family haven\u2019t translated into permanent restaurants. The Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton will be hoping for more luck when he opens his first vegan restaurant later this year. Whiteside won\u2019t say which vegan products Greggs is working on, but he admits it is \u201cnot easy\u201d. \u201cThe test for us is that it has to be as good to eat as the non-vegan version.\u201d The doughnut is not vegan \u2013 surely that would be an easy win? \u201cNot as easy as you\u2019d think,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if you can come up with the recipe, you need to separate out the production to ensure there\u2019s no cross-contamination.\u201d None of this is cheap or easy. But, as Clark points out, the companies that try to make a quick buck from veganism will soon get found out. \u201cYou will quickly get a backlash if people think you\u2019re \u2018greenwashing\u2019. Token efforts tend to get a lot of flak on social media. And if it just doesn\u2019t taste very good, it won\u2019t work, either.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The New York Times has scrapped plans to sponsor one of the world\u2019s biggest oil industry conferences after pressure from climate campaigners including Extinction Rebellion. There were protests outside the newspaper\u2019s offices in Manhattan this month over the Oil and Money conference, which is in its 40th year and which green groups have called a \u201cclimate crime scene\u201d. The conference is due to take place next month at the InterContinental Hotel on Park Lane in London and will attract executives from the world\u2019s biggest oil companies as well as senior Opec leaders and ministers from fossil fuel-rich Middle Eastern nations. According to the event\u2019s website, keynote speakers this year will include Bob Dudley, the chief executive of BP, and Ben van Beurden, the boss of Royal Dutch Shell. A New York Times spokeswoman said the paper had \u201cdecided to end its relationship with the Oil and Money conference\u201d because its subject matter \u201cgives us cause for concern\u201d. The Guardian understands that the decision was made and communicated to the event\u2019s co-host, Energy Intelligence, more than a week ago. \u201cWe want there to be no question of our independence or even the potential appearance of a conflict of interest. Over the last several years [the New York Times] has significantly expanded its reporting on climate change and its impact, as well as broader investigative and explanatory coverage of energy and environmental policy,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cWe have a large team focused solely on the topic and in the last year alone we\u2019ve travelled to every continent to document the effects of a warming planet.\u201d Extinction Rebellion and other green groups staged protests at the newspaper\u2019s headquarters over the summer calling for it to withdraw from the conference and \u201ctell the truth about the climate emergency\u201d. Extinction Rebellion has also called on the New York Times to include more climate change coverage in its pages and to use \u201cclimate emergency language\u201d. Last week members of Extinction Rebellion joined Greta Thunberg, the Swedish climate activist, and thousands of US schoolchildren at a protest outside the UN headquarters in New York. The school climate strike was Thunberg\u2019s first in the US after she travelled across the Atlantic on a zero-carbon yacht to avoid the heavy greenhouse gas emissions caused by air travel.",

His opinions never got in the way of his success. As the editor of Astounding Science Fiction magazine, he was hugely influential on the genre during the 1940s, 50s and 60s; not just the authors he worked with (Isaac Asimov, Arthur C Clarke and Robert A Heinlein), but also those he kept out. All three of those writers were positive pinkos compared to Campbell; even Robert A Heinlein, who was an anti-communist rightwinger who proselytised the positives of nuclear weapon testing. In 1941, he wrote Sixth Column, a novel based on a story by Campbell, in which \u201cpan-Asians\u201d enslave the US, which fights back with a ethnic-specific ray gun that can kill the \u201cslanty\u201d and \u201cflat face\u201d. Heinlein would later voice his regret over the openly racist novel. Campbell would not.</p> <p>Last month, while accepting the John W Campbell award for best debut writer in science fiction and fantasy (awarded by the latest editor of the magazine), British author Jeannette Ng called him \u201ca fucking fascist\u201d. Campbell, she said, had set a tone that was \u201cstale, sterile, male, white, exalting in the ambitions of imperialists, colonialists, settlers and industrialists\u201d.

The baddies were often foreign or Travellers in her mysteries. Her fantasy villains were alternately golliwogs or ugly goblins, depending on whether I was reading her original text or a sterilised, modern edition.

      "bodyText": "The Anglo-Swiss commodities group Glencore has won a round in its war with the Taxation Office, with a judge throwing out a $92m bill relating to one of its Australian mines. On Tuesday the federal court judge Jennifer Davies set aside three years of tax bills levied against Glencore over its claims for the cost of processing copper from its CSA mine near Cobar. The case predates and is unrelated to Glencore\u2019s failed attempt to stop the ATO using leaked information contained in the Paradise Papers to investigate offshore finance structures, including $25bn in currency swaps. But Glencore\u2019s victory is a blow for the ATO in its attacks on complex transactions that take place between different members of the same corporate group, especially in the resources sector. The ATO has stepped up its scrutiny of the industry, bolstered by a win against Chevron in a 2017 case that set new benchmarks for how \u201ctransfer prices\u201d between the different parts of the same multinational group should be calculated. In the CSA case, the tax office objected to a change Glencore made in 2007 to the way the mine calculated the cost of processing done by another company in the Glencore group. The calculated cost \u2013 which was 23% of a copper reference price listed on the London Metals Exchange \u2013 was deducted from the amount Glencore paid the mine. But the ATO disagreed, hitting Glencore with fresh tax bills for the years between 2007 and 2009. The ATO told the court Glencore should have stuck with the previous method of calculating the processing price, which was based on an industry benchmark. It also said the deal had not been done at arm\u2019s length and had favoured the Glencore company that bought the copper, located in tax haven Switzerland, over the Australian one that operated the mine. But Davies said the arrangement made more sense when considering the volatile market for copper at the time. \u201cIt cannot be said that the entry into a price-sharing contract was irrational, having regard to the benefits of such contracts and the market circumstances,\u201d she said. She ordered the ATO to pay Glencore\u2019s costs. A company spokesman welcomed the court decision. The ATO said it was considering whether to appeal. The deputy commissioner said ensuring the Australian arms of big firms dealt with their offshore sister companies at arm\u2019s length was \u201cthe most significant issue in multinational taxation\u201d. \u201cTransfer pricing rules ensure these transactions are priced fairly and that multinational companies do not underpay tax in Australia,\u201d he said.",

The plane \u2013 which is able to fly with one engine \u2013 landed safely and no one on board was injured. Initial reports described the shutdown as being the result of fire in the engine, but in a joint statement with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (Casa) released on Friday the airline said \u201cthere was no evidence of an engine fire\u201d. Instead, it said the engine had been shut down after a cockpit sensor alert shortly after taking off from Moruya. Peter Gibson, a spokesman from Casa, was quoted in the statement as saying the reports of a fire \u201care probably explained by passengers seeing sparks\u201d but that \u201cobservations this morning don\u2019t show the presence of fire\u201d.

It comes after the airline was forced to deny claims last month that one of its planes was filmed with unrepaired corrosion around the propeller. Sydney\u2019s Daily Telegraph published footage that allegedly showed corrosion on a plane that flew from Kangaroo Island to Adelaide. The airline also described Casa as \u201cdespicable and cowardly\u201d last month after the Sunday Telegraph published details of a 17-page report submitted by the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers\u2019 Association, which accused Rex of pressuring its safety inspectors to ignore faults.

      "bodyText": "The government minister Stuart Robert and his business partner stand to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in an ill-fated investment in a health company headed by a convicted rapist. Liquidators are investigating whether crimes may have been committed by directors of the company, Cryo Australia, where Robert briefly sat on the board alongside rapist Neran De Silva. The investigation by the liquidators David Clout and Patricia Talty appears to focus on the conduct of De Silva, whom creditors have accused of \u201cmisappropriating\u201d company stock. There is no suggestion Robert has done anything wrong in relation to Cryo Australia, which offered customers therapy sessions in a human-sized cooler. In a report to creditors, the liquidators said the company, which collapsed earlier this year owing more than $1.4m, appeared to have traded while insolvent while under De Silva\u2019s control and that \u201cthe directors may have breached their duties\u201d to it, which can be a crime. De Silva was the company\u2019s only director at the time it went into liquidation. Cryo Australia owes a company linked to Robert and his business partner and friend John Margerison at least $410,000. The chances of recovering the money appear remote as the company had assets of just $16,000 when it collapsed. Robert, who as minister for government services is responsible for the controversial robodebt program, has been dogged by controversy over his short stint as a director of Cryo Australia. The company welcomed Robert to its board in August last year, but he quit two and a half weeks later when he became a minister. At the time, his fellow director De Silva was appealing against a conviction for rape to the Queensland court of appeal. That appeal failed and De Silva is now appealing to the high court, which is to hear the case on Wednesday. A spokeswoman for Robert did not respond to detailed questions about Cryo Australia. \u201cTo comply with the ministerial standards and to meet community expectations, minister Robert\u2019s assets are managed by the trustees of a blind trust,\u201d she said. \u201cThe trustees are responsible for all holdings and make all decisions regarding the management and structure of those holdings.\u201d De Silva is believed to be in immigration detention. He could not be reached through his solicitor, Emma Higgins of the Brisbane law firm Robertson O\u2019Gorman, or by email at another company with which he is associated, Global Health and Wellness Group. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Queensland supreme court appointed Clout and Talty to liquidate Cryo Australia in early March on the application of another company connected to Robert, JM National Property. Robert was a director of JM National Property between March and August last year and has previously told parliament he owned a stake in a property investment trust run by the company. In October last year, after controversy about his business interests, Robert put his assets into a \u201cblind trust\u201d, over which he has no control. On his most recent declaration to parliament, he listed as assets only the trust, vehicles including a vintage Austin 7 and a collection of Australian coins. Company documents show that JM National Property\u2019s sole director and shareholder is Margerison, a Gold Coast businessman and a close friend of Robert. Margerison could not be reached for comment. A former business associate of De Silva\u2019s, Paul Treloar, told the Guardian that Margerison and Robert invested as much as $700,000 in Cryo Australia by lending the company money and buying shares in it. Company documents show JM National Property owned half of Cryo Australia and was owed more than $410,000 as a creditor. \u201cThose guys were just bent over, unfortunately,\u201d Treloar said. Treloar said he was being charged $8,000 a month by finance company PMFA after guaranteeing a loan for equipment a Cryo Australia franchisee ordered from the company that was never delivered. In a 5 June report to creditors, the liquidators said a number of issues needed further investigation, including allegations that De Silva \u201cmisappropriated\u201d company stock and traded the company while it was insolvent, which can be a crime. They said $2.37m from sales dating as far back as August 2016 \u201chave been paid to a bank account which is not operated by the company\u201d but instead by a related company, which they did not name. Cryo Australia\u2019s \u201cdirectors may have breached their duties, and in doing so, caused the company to have suffered a loss\u201d, they told creditors. \u201cIf proven, it may be found the directors have committed offences and are liable to compensate the company for any losses caused.\u201d It is not clear to which of Cryo Australia\u2019s former directors the liquidators were referring, and Clout declined to provide further details of the investigation. He said he was hopeful an application to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission for funding to further investigate the company would succeed. \u201cIt looks like all the attributes are there,\u201d he said. An Asic spokeswoman declined to comment. Robert\u2019s business ventures have long caused him political difficulty. In 2016, when Malcolm Turnbull was prime minister, he dumped Robert from the ministry after it emerged he had taken a \u201cprivate\u201d trip to Beijing to celebrate a mining deal struck by a company in which he had an indirect interest. He also came under scrutiny after he and other Liberal frontbenchers, including Tony Abbott, accepted Rolexes that they thought were fake from a visiting Chinese billionaire. In October last year he got into fresh strife after he failed to declare his interest in a bodybuilding supplements business to parliament for four months. The department of finance has also repeatedly asked Robert about the $2,000 a month he charged taxpayers for his home internet. \u2022 Cryo Australia has no relationship to Cryo Pty Ltd, an entirely separate company.",

The 2002 Fifa World Cup final venue became one of two stand-in replacements after it became clear that the New National Stadium, built specifically for the Rugby World Cup and the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, would not be ready in time for the former. Budget constraints and squabbles over the design mean the stadium will not host its first sporting event until March 2020, nor be the centrepiece World Rugby had hoped for. Instead, Ajinomoto Stadium, a multi-purpose venue in the east Tokyo suburb of Chofu, will take on the role of hosting the opening match of the tournament on 20 September, in addition to seven other games throughout the tournament. Yokohama Stadium, will assume responsibility for hosting both semi-finals and the final as well as several key pool stage fixtures including the All Blacks\u2019 title defence opener against South Africa, Ireland v Scotland and England v France.",
