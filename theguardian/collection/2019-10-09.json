      "bodyText": "Former Greens senator Scott Ludlam has had bail conditions \u2013 that banned him from associating with Extinction Rebellion climate change protests \u2013 dismissed by a judge following his arrest at a protest earlier this week. The strict conditions had been labelled \u201cabsurd\u201d by civil liberties campaigners and prevented Ludlam from appearing in court on Thursday, due to restrictions on coming to the Sydney CBD. On Thursday morning in Sydney\u2019s Downing Centre local court, deputy chief magistrate Jane Mottley said the conditions imposed by New South Wales police were not necessary given the low seriousness of his offences. \u201cI note these are fine-only offences,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when one considers the ambit of matters before the court \u2013 these are not serious examples of offences which would ordinarily attract bail conditions\u201d. Ludlam and 29 others were arrested while protesting for action on the climate emergency in Sydney on Monday. The former Greens senator was charged with obstructing traffic, and given bail conditions which banned him from coming within 2.5km of the Sydney Town Hall, or attending future Extinction Rebellion events. According to documents seen by Guardian Australia, other protestors were given even harsher bail conditions that banned them from \u201cgoing near\u201d or speaking to members of Extinction Rebellion. Ludlam welcomed the decision, saying, \u201cI\u2019m glad common sense prevailed.\u201d \u201cThis decision sends a clear message to the NSW police that the bail conditions were wildly inappropriate,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I hope that the restrictions placed on other arrestees on Monday night will be immediately withdrawn.\u201d On Wednesday, the New South Wales Council of Civil Liberties said the conditions were \u201cabsurd\u201d, would affect thousands of people, and infringed on the constitutional right to freedom of political communication. That day, NSW Greens senator David Shoebridge said the conditions were so extreme NSW police \u201cknew they would be thrown out of court\u201d. On Thursday morning, magistrate Mottley dismissed the conditions and gave Ludlam unconditional bail. In arrest documents, NSW police stated that protesters \u201cif released from custody, will endanger the safety of victims, individuals or the community [and] interfere with witnesses or evidence\u201d. But Mottley determined that these could \u201cbe appropriately addressed by unconditional bail\u201d. If the conditions had been upheld, they would have applied to Ludlam until 7 November, when the matter was listed for first hearing. The former WA Greens senator was not present in court, as the Downing Centre is within 2.5km of the town hall. Ludlam had been given three bail conditions on Monday: good behaviour, the 2.5km exclusion, and the ban from attending Extinction Rebellion events. Ludlam applied to have only the last two dismissed. In court on Thursday, crown prosecutor Wayne Law said police believed there was \u201can unacceptable risk\u201d that Ludlam and other protestors could cause harm to the community. \u201cThe objective [of Extinction Rebellion] is to cause civil disobedience [for] their political agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cThose conditions imposed address that issue, which is to prevent further civil disobedience. \u201cThe endangering of safety is effectively that they lay on the road which is a great concern to themselves \u2026 but also the community.\u201d But Ludlam\u2019s lawyer Greg James said the conditions were aimed at \u201cstifling legitimate political protest\u201d. \u201cThe road was closed, there was no traffic,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that they can\u2019t contact others involved in a political movement show extraneous conditions were taken into account.

On Wednesday, Ludlam told Guardian Australia that if the government wanted to stop climate protesters, they should take action on policy.

The report from Oxfam claims that the supermarkets\u2019 \u201crelentless\u201d drive to maximise profits is fuelling poverty and gender discrimination in their retail supply chains. Its research is based on in-depth interviews with workers in India and Brazil and a separate survey in five other countries. Interviews with workers on 50 tea plantations in Assam allege that cholera and typhoid are rife because of poor access to toilets and safe drinking water. Half of those questioned receive government ration cards because they earn so little while female workers regularly clocked up 13 hours of hard labour a day. Aldi, Morrisons, Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s confirmed they source their own-brand tea from companies whose suppliers include the estates visited and Lidl was amongst other global supermarkets who source their own brand tea from the Assam region. On fruit farms in north-east Brazil, women with children said they were forced to rely on relatives or government support to feed their families outside the harvest season.

enshrined workers\u2019 rights to clock off at a reasonable time.</p> <p>While these protections have been preserved to varying degrees in contemporary workplace agreements, many employees are nevertheless working 19th-century hours at the expense of their mental and physical wellbeing.</p> <p>\u201cThese days, the people who get paid the most are those who are working the most hours,\u201d says<strong> </strong> Michael Leiter, a professor of industrial and organisational psychology at Victoria\u2019s Deakin University.</p> <p>\u201cIt used to be those who worked the most hours were low-paid people trying to make a living.\u201d</p> <p>In a sign of growing concern over the increased incidence of workplace burnout, the World Health Organisation recently <a href=\"https://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/burn-out/en/\">added burnout </a>to a list of occupational phenomenons, although it stopped short of labelling it a disease.</p> <p>WHO <a href=\"https://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/burn-out/en/\">defines burnout</a> as being characterised by exhaustion, cynicism or detachment from one\u2019s job, and reduced professional efficacy at work.</p> <p>This chimes with King, who used to love her job and got on well with her previous manager.</p> <p>\u201cBut<strong> </strong>the new manager made me feel so devalued and like my opinion didn\u2019t matter, even though I had seen the company grow over many years,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Leiter has been studying burnout since the 1980s, and says the global nature of the business world has chipped away at Australia\u2019s standard working hours.</p> <p>While burnout is \u201cmore intense\u201d in the US, owing to precarious healthcare and higher levels of student debt, Australians are suffering too, he says.</p> <p>\u201cThere are definitely some people in Australia who are working their allotted hours and then they go home,\u201d Leiter says.</p> <p>\u201cHowever I think there is a significant slice in Australia, on the low and high wage-end of the scale, who are working ridiculous hours.\u201d</p> <p>As Leiter, points out, burnout seems to affect those earning at the extreme ends of the spectrum: commercial lawyers working 100 hours a week as well as underemployed gig economy workers who struggle to earn a minimum wage ferrying delivery food to the same corporate lawyers too busy to cook.</p> <p>\u201cThe gig economy is totally hostile to a unionised framework, and then at the higher end of the pay scale if you want to compete globally, you have to scramble all the time,\u201d Leiter says.</p> <p>Which speaks to one of the common features of burnout: an overwhelming sense that your work life, your career, is out of your control.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/work-burnout-men-women-positions-power-self-esteem-family-balance-study-montreal-a8377096.html\">recent study</a> by researchers from Montreal University tracking 2,026 people \u2013 half of whom were women \u2013 for four years, found that women were more likely to burn out because they had less authority or control over their work than men.</p> <p>\u201cWhether someone has input into important decisions that affect their work is a major factor [in burnout],\u201d Leiter says.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have a real need for that autonomy. And by autonomy I don\u2019t mean, \u2018I can do whatever I like\u2019, it\u2019s about that feeling of making something happen as opposed to being acted upon.\u201d</p> <p>This was certainly the case for King, who felt worn down by a lack of agency.</p> <p>\u201cWhen my manager wanted something done, he wanted it done straight away,\u201d she says,</p> <p>\u201cIf I wanted to put in a new procedure, he wouldn\u2019t allow it and always wanted it his way even if it wasn\u2019t the best.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Meaningless work exhausts people, and it makes them more cynical</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Leiter</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Taylor has worked with scores of corporates to help build resilience in stressful situations and says both men and women, senior or junior, can feel they lack control.</p> <p>\u201cI know a lot of high-ranking executives who say they feel they have no control over what the board is doing,\u201d Taylor says.</p> <p>If your workplace is not allowing workers any freedom whatsoever, then maybe it\u2019s time to look for another job, Taylor suggests.</p> <p>\u201cIt may not be easy and it may take a while, but starting the process of looking is part of taking some control back,\u201d he says.</p> <p>How invested employees feel in their work can also be the difference between exhilaration and exhaustion. \u201cWithin reason, doing work that really matters does not burn people out as quickly and, in fact, it often energises them,\u201d Leiter says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/05/how-to-tackle-your-to-do-lists-oliver-burkeman\">Overwhelmed by your to-do lists?

While these protections have been preserved to varying degrees in contemporary workplace agreements, many employees are nevertheless working 19th-century hours at the expense of their mental and physical wellbeing. \u201cThese days, the people who get paid the most are those who are working the most hours,\u201d says Michael Leiter, a professor of industrial and organisational psychology at Victoria\u2019s Deakin University. \u201cIt used to be those who worked the most hours were low-paid people trying to make a living.\u201d In a sign of growing concern over the increased incidence of workplace burnout, the World Health Organisation recently added burnout to a list of occupational phenomenons, although it stopped short of labelling it a disease. WHO defines burnout as being characterised by exhaustion, cynicism or detachment from one\u2019s job, and reduced professional efficacy at work. This chimes with King, who used to love her job and got on well with her previous manager. \u201cBut the new manager made me feel so devalued and like my opinion didn\u2019t matter, even though I had seen the company grow over many years,\u201d she says. Leiter has been studying burnout since the 1980s, and says the global nature of the business world has chipped away at Australia\u2019s standard working hours. While burnout is \u201cmore intense\u201d in the US, owing to precarious healthcare and higher levels of student debt, Australians are suffering too, he says. \u201cThere are definitely some people in Australia who are working their allotted hours and then they go home,\u201d Leiter says. \u201cHowever I think there is a significant slice in Australia, on the low and high wage-end of the scale, who are working ridiculous hours.\u201d As Leiter, points out, burnout seems to affect those earning at the extreme ends of the spectrum: commercial lawyers working 100 hours a week as well as underemployed gig economy workers who struggle to earn a minimum wage ferrying delivery food to the same corporate lawyers too busy to cook. \u201cThe gig economy is totally hostile to a unionised framework, and then at the higher end of the pay scale if you want to compete globally, you have to scramble all the time,\u201d Leiter says. Which speaks to one of the common features of burnout: an overwhelming sense that your work life, your career, is out of your control. A recent study by researchers from Montreal University tracking 2,026 people \u2013 half of whom were women \u2013 for four years, found that women were more likely to burn out because they had less authority or control over their work than men. \u201cWhether someone has input into important decisions that affect their work is a major factor [in burnout],\u201d Leiter says. \u201cPeople have a real need for that autonomy. And by autonomy I don\u2019t mean, \u2018I can do whatever I like\u2019, it\u2019s about that feeling of making something happen as opposed to being acted upon.\u201d This was certainly the case for King, who felt worn down by a lack of agency. \u201cWhen my manager wanted something done, he wanted it done straight away,\u201d she says, \u201cIf I wanted to put in a new procedure, he wouldn\u2019t allow it and always wanted it his way even if it wasn\u2019t the best.\u201d Taylor has worked with scores of corporates to help build resilience in stressful situations and says both men and women, senior or junior, can feel they lack control. \u201cI know a lot of high-ranking executives who say they feel they have no control over what the board is doing,\u201d Taylor says. If your workplace is not allowing workers any freedom whatsoever, then maybe it\u2019s time to look for another job, Taylor suggests. \u201cIt may not be easy and it may take a while, but starting the process of looking is part of taking some control back,\u201d he says. How invested employees feel in their work can also be the difference between exhilaration and exhaustion. \u201cWithin reason, doing work that really matters does not burn people out as quickly and, in fact, it often energises them,\u201d Leiter says. And the problem, according to Leiter, is that many people are pulled away from work they enjoy to perform soul-crushing administrative tasks. \u201cTechnology gets a bad rap, but the problem with technology is that it allows employers to impose all kinds of administrative nonsense, such as compliance training, filling out forms, online time sheets,\u201d he says. \u201cThis meaningless work exhausts people, and it makes them more cynical.\u201d Leiter notes that millennials are more likely to feel the effects of burnout compared with other demographics, with a viral Buzzfeed article, \u201cHow millennials became the burnout generation\u201d, capturing the mental load many young Americans feel. It appears to be no different in Australia, with a stress and wellbeing survey conducted by the Australian Psychological Society finding those aged 18 to 25 consistently report lower levels of wellbeing. \u201cIt\u2019s a vulnerable time for burnout when you first start work as you\u2019ve usually come from university or some form of training, which is more idealistic,\u201d Leiter says. \u201cSo there is a conflict between the reality and the idealistic vision of work.\u201d The tech-heavy aspect of much of modern work is not helpful for millennials either, according to Leiter. \u201cWhile information technology opens access to resources that further a person\u2019s work, it also opens users to distractions and to administrative busy work that will hurt their productivity in the long run,\u201d he says. In King\u2019s view, far too many of us have merged our identities with what we do for a living. \u201cI honestly think a lot of people are lost and work is feeding people\u2019s self-worth,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter all, you don\u2019t have time to realise you\u2019re unhappy if you\u2019re working all the time.\u201d",

Suffering from discomfort to his adductor, Aaron Ramsey, arguably a more important player for the Welsh than even Gareth Bale, is out of the Slovakia game. Ryan Giggs could be forced into a tactical change and the thinking by Danny Gabbidon and Iwan Roberts on Elis James\u2019s Feast Of Football podcast was that Giggs needs to avoid playing the brand of expansive football he prefers in charge of making his team more difficult to beat. With this in mind, playing five at the back with two midfielders sitting directly in front of them was mooted as a potential solution. Whatever Giggs decides, a very talented generation of Welsh players is in danger of being wasted and the results of the next two games could have a major say in the future of a young manager who has been far from convincing during his tenure so far. <strong>BG</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Slovakia v Wales, 7.45pm Thursday</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6b8c61d8360438600d29e0308d235905942f758a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b8c61d8360438600d29e0308d235905942f758a/0_127_3626_2175/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gareth Bale at Wales training in Cardiff, in the runup to the match in Slovakia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gareth Bale at Wales training in Cardiff, in the runup to the match in Slovakia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Athena Pictures/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4) Endangered Iceland should fear Ben Yedder</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/29/2016-football-moment-to-remember-iceland-euro-2016\">Darlings of the last European Championship</a>, Iceland need to pull out some big results if they are to reach Euro 2020. They are third in Group H, behind an exciting young Turkey team and France, who thrashed them 4-0 earlier in the group. On Friday they host <em>Les Bleus</em>, who will be without the injured Paul Pogba and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 but still have no shortage of options. Didier Deschamps could, for instance, use Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s absence to give Wissam Ben Yedder his most meaningful cap to date. The striker, who joined Monaco in the summer and has been as prolific there as he was at all his previous clubs, has had to wait a long time for international recognition but, at 29, he is still young enough and good enough to make an impact. He would boost his chances of appearing in an international tournament if he helps France beat Iceland on Friday and Turkey three days later. <strong>PD<br><br></strong>\u2022 Iceland v France, 7.45pm Friday</p> <h2>5) <strong>Another toothless performance from Scotland?</strong></h2> <p>While Scotland\u2019s rugby players <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/09/scotland-russia-rugby-world-cup-match-report\">scored 61 without reply</a> against Russia at the Rugby World Cup, their footballing counterparts would gladly settle for victory by a far slimmer margin when they are entertained in Moscow on Thursday. Scotland trail Russia, who are second in Group I behind Belgium, by nine points with four games remaining and their hopes of qualifying via any other route than the play-off place they earned through the Nations League have evaporated. In Ryan Fraser, John McGinn, Andy Robertson, Scott McTominay and John Fleck Scotland have decent players, but their inability to score goals remains aconcern. The six forward players picked by Steve Clarke squad have just eight international goals between them and urgently need to improve that tally ahead of those play-offs so many Scottish hopes are pinned on. <strong>BG</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Russia v Scotland, 7.45pm Thursday</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08c4998ae208bd3f0a43c1686586119a54cbdc4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08c4998ae208bd3f0a43c1686586119a54cbdc4e/0_72_5292_3176/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John McGinn holds off Ryan Fraser during Scotland training before the match in Russia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John McGinn holds off Ryan Fraser during Scotland training before the match in Russia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6) <strong>O\u2019Neill\u2019s rock-hard run-in starts in Netherlands</strong></h2> <p>Second behind Germany in a group that also contains the Netherlands, Northern Ireland\u2019s remaining fixtures in Group C could scarcely be more difficult. Following their trip to Amsterdam they travel to the Czech Republic for a friendly, before completing their qualifiers against the Dutch at home and Germany away in November. Michael O\u2019Neill will have to make do without Norwich left-back Jamal Lewis, who has pulled out with a knee injury, but the manager remains upbeat about his team\u2019s chances of doing enough in successive qualifiers against the Netherlands to not have to concern himself with a potential route to the finals through the Nations League play-offs. \u201cWe are in a double-header with Holland and I believe if we get four points we will qualify,\u201d he said. Having made his first international start <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/09/northern-ireland-germany-euro-2020-qualifying-match-report\">in defeat against Germany</a> last time out, Linfield striker Shayne Lavery could be the manplaying up front faced with a defence marshalled by Virgil van Dijk, as O\u2019Neill has hinted the 20-year-old\u2019s pace and intelligence could be a key weapon in a battle against one of the world\u2019s best defenders. <strong>BG</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Netherlands v Northern Ireland, 7.45pm Thursday</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/09/callum-wilson-harry-kane-england-impact-euro-2020\">Callum Wilson: \u2018I\u2019m not trying to kick Harry out but I can make an impact\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>7) Switzerland need to find the right side of late dramas</h2> <p>Switzerland could have already secured their qualification for Euro 2020, instead they are set for a tense finale in Group D: and they have not coped well with tense finales so far. In their first match, at home to Denmark, they blew a three-goal lead in the last six minutes; and in their last outing, in the Republic of Ireland, they looked comfortable before conceding an 85th-minute equaliser and hanging on for a point. They face those two countries again in the next few days, starting with a trip to Copenhagen on Saturday. Xherdan Shaqiri has chosen to remain in international exile but manager Vladimir Petkovic has recalled Stephan Lichtsteiner after omitting him for the trip to Dublin. Apparently he values the 35-year-old\u2019s experience. \u201cHe is still our captain and leader,\u201d said Petkovic of the Augsburg defender, without saying whether Lichtsteiner will actually play. <strong>PD</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Denmark v Switzerland, 5pm Saturday</p> <h2>8) Crunch time for Finland to break drought</h2> <p>Finland have never qualified for a major tournament. It\u2019s somewhat of an annoyance for a nation of over five million people who gave football the supremely talented Jari Litmanen. Even tiny Iceland have beaten them to the punch. But having assumed a strong position in Group J \u2013 they\u2019re second behind Italy \u2013 they will never have a better chance of enjoying a summer party themselves. Markku Kanerva\u2019s side have won four and lost two (both to Italy) but now it\u2019s crunch time. They face Bosnia-Herzegovina and Armenia next, the two teams directly below them. They travel to the Bilino Polje Stadium in Bosnia-Herzegovina on Saturday. With Norwich\u2019s in-form Teemu Pukki leading the line, Kanerva\u2019s compact system is well set up to pick off their inconsistent opponents on the break. Finland have not conceded a goal against any team except Italy and Pukki has been just as lethal in qualifying as he has in the Premier League, scoring five in his last six. If he can continue his hot streak over the next few days, Finland\u2019s long wait for some summer fun could soon be over. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Bosnia-Herzegovina v Finland, 5pm Saturday</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b61240f836dee7704e7f4d46f5187d2eda29624\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b61240f836dee7704e7f4d46f5187d2eda29624/0_280_5060_3036/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Finland\u2019s Teemo Pukki has scored five times in his last six matches.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Finland\u2019s Teemu Pukki has scored five times in his last six matches.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Markku Ulander/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>9) Can Hungary capitalise against inconsistent Croatia?</h2> <p>Going into their game against Slovakia last time out, Hungary were pretty much two wins from Euro 2020. Now, after a 2-1 loss, qualification from Group E looks unlikely. Hungary did beat a sluggish Croatia in Budapest in their previous group encounter, and looked impressive in doing so. But with Hungary distinctly lacking in individual quality, it\u2019s the sum of their parts that makes this Hungarian apparatus tick. And when two or three of those parts falter, the whole machine malfunctions, as evidenced against Slovakia. Things don\u2019t look like changing in Croatia either, with very few of Hungary\u2019s key men finding any kind of form at club level this season. Yet Hungary are an odd side full of players unheard of in western Europe, but who are prone to big performances in big games. Croatia are massive favourites, but Hungary have refound a quality of turning up when it matters most under Italian coach Marco Rossi. And with Croatia looking decidedly inconsistent since the World Cup, maybe this isn\u2019t as improbable as first thought. <strong>TM</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Croatia v Hungary, 7.45pm Thursday</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/09/germany-argentina-match-report\">Lucas Ocampos\u2019 late strike earns Argentina a draw with Germany</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>10) Andorra aim to \u2013 finally \u2013 end long losing streak</h2> <p>Andorra have played 55 European Championship qualifiers and lost 55 European Championship qualifiers.

      "bodyText": "1) All eyes on fans in Prague In what looks certain to resemble the world\u2019s most unedifying stag party, an estimated 6,000 England fans will descend on Prague to watch Gareth Southgate\u2019s team take on the Czech Republic. Unsurprisingly designated as a \u201chigh risk\u201d fixture, this Friday night game will attract no shortage of thirsty visitors to the Czech capital, hellbent on making a weekend of it in a city renowned for the cheapness of its beer and myriad other nocturnal delights. Scheduled to kick off at 8.45pm local time, when more patriotic fans will have had all day to occupy the city\u2019s Old Town Square, get liquored up and perform their traditional repertoire of ditties, it is difficult to imagine the local constabulary will be kept idle following Uefa\u2019s refusal to move the game to a more suitable day or time. While many England fans are perfectly well-behaved, anti-social behaviour of the kind seen in Amsterdam and Porto on recent excursions seems dismally inevitable. \u201cYou\u2019re part of our team, make the country proud,\u201d said Gareth Southgate, in the FA\u2019s attempt to get in front of the problem by releasing a video entitled Don\u2019t Be That Idiot. Somebody will almost certainly be that idiot and, if recent history tells us anything, they are unlikely to be alone. BG \u2022 Czech Republic v England, 7.45pm Friday (all times BST) 2) Is Connolly the solution to Ireland\u2019s scoring problems? Mick McCarthy\u2019s second coming as Republic of Ireland manager got going in earnest in March when his team played with impressive vibrancy at home to Georgia, though they only won 1-0. Goals, you see, remain extremely hard to come by for Ireland. But a solution may have emerged: Brighton\u2019s Aaron Connolly, fresh from scoring twice against Spurs last weekend, could make his senior international debut in Tblisi on Saturday. If he shows the same sharpness that he did against Tottenham, then Ireland could take a big step towards Euro 2020 qualification, and young Connolly will be hearing more of that \u2018new Robbie Keane\u2019 talk. PD \u2022 Georgia v Ireland, 2pm Saturday 3) Ramsey injury may force tactical change on Giggs Anything less than a haul of four points from games at Slovakia and at home against Croatia over the coming days is likely to end any chance Wales have of qualifying for Euro 2020, although they could still be thrown a lifeline via the Nations League. Suffering from discomfort to his adductor, Aaron Ramsey, arguably a more important player for the Welsh than even Gareth Bale, is out of the Slovakia game. Ryan Giggs could be forced into a tactical change and the thinking by Danny Gabbidon and Iwan Roberts on Elis James\u2019s Feast Of Football podcast was that Giggs needs to avoid playing the brand of expansive football he prefers in charge of making his team more difficult to beat. With this in mind, playing five at the back with two midfielders sitting directly in front of them was mooted as a potential solution. Whatever Giggs decides, a very talented generation of Welsh players is in danger of being wasted and the results of the next two games could have a major say in the future of a young manager who has been far from convincing during his tenure so far. BG \u2022 Slovakia v Wales, 7.45pm Thursday 4) Endangered Iceland should fear Ben Yedder Darlings of the last European Championship, Iceland need to pull out some big results if they are to reach Euro 2020. They are third in Group H, behind an exciting young Turkey team and France, who thrashed them 4-0 earlier in the group. On Friday they host Les Bleus, who will be without the injured Paul Pogba and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 but still have no shortage of options. Didier Deschamps could, for instance, use Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s absence to give Wissam Ben Yedder his most meaningful cap to date. The striker, who joined Monaco in the summer and has been as prolific there as he was at all his previous clubs, has had to wait a long time for international recognition but, at 29, he is still young enough and good enough to make an impact. He would boost his chances of appearing in an international tournament if he helps France beat Iceland on Friday and Turkey three days later.

of the day, we have a democratic process in place, but what annoys me and what I think annoys most Australians is we have a government that rather than just dealing with trade agreements, is having

there was no economic modelling being presented that showed the benefits of the FTAs, and said Labor was limited in its ability to negotiate.</p> <p>\u201cWe are wedged, we are asked \u2018Do you support growth in trade opportunities?\u2019 but the kicker is you are going to also bring in all of these extra workers who may be exploited,\u201d she said.</p> <p>As revealed by Guardian Australia on Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/09/labor-set-to-support-new-free-trade-deals-but-will-push-for-job-concessions\">Labor has told union leaders that it will

      "bodyText": "Labor MPs are pushing back against supporting a new free-trade agreement with Indonesia that is at odds with the party\u2019s official platform, as the unions ramp up pressure to try to block the deal. While the party has indicated it will support the enabling legislation for the Indonesia Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (IA-CEPA) along with free-trade agreements with Hong Kong and Peru, MPs are bracing for a fierce caucus debate over the issue when parliament resumes next week. Leftwing Labor senator Kim Carr told Guardian Australia on Wednesday that the proposed agreement with Indonesia was \u201cexplicitly at odds\u201d with Labor\u2019s national platform, and warned the party could not defy the \u201csupreme governing body of the Labor party\u201d. \u201cThe Labor party\u2019s platform is very clear on these issues and the principles outlined by the Labor party in the last parliament were put there very consciously and deliberately when we were in opposition,\u201d Carr said. \u201cThere are very good reasons why the positions in the Labor party platform were put there and the deregulation of the labour market is of very deep concern within the Australian community.\u201d Carr said that if MPs were unhappy with the national platform, then they should call a special meeting of national conference to change it. He also likened the situation to the recent decision by Labor caucus to support mandatory sentencing of child sex offenders, which was also at odds with the Labor platform. \u201cThere are many issues that are being pursued by this government and the approach that we bend over backwards to accommodate them is not appropriate in this environment,\u201d he said. Labor MP Josh Wilson, who is the shadow assistant minister for the environment and was also on the joint standing committee on treaties which backed ratifying the agreements, said he had concerns about the new deals. \u201cWhile I\u2019m glad the JSCOT has maintained its principled support for independent economic analysis of trade agreements, the government\u2019s unhealthy appetite for undercutting Australian jobs through trade deals goes unchecked,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cLeaving the door open to walk away from labour market and skills testing is dangerous stuff, but this government seems intent on using trade to chip away at protections the Australian community should be able to take for granted.\u201d Lisa Chesters, the MP for the seat of Bendigo, said she was looking forward to next week\u2019s caucus meeting that would canvass the broad views of MPs on the issue, which she said was always \u201cchallenging\u201d for Labor. \u201cAt the end of the day, we have a democratic process in place, but what annoys me and what I think annoys most Australians is we have a government that rather than just dealing with trade agreements, is having side agreements attached to them that are about importing workers, workers who are then direct competition with Australian workers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is shocking to think that the government would be thinking of bringing in more workers in when they haven\u2019t even sought to clean up the situation we already have.\u201d Chesters said it was \u201calarming\u201d that there was no economic modelling being presented that showed the benefits of the FTAs, and said Labor was limited in its ability to negotiate. \u201cWe are wedged, we are asked \u2018Do you support growth in trade opportunities?\u2019 but the kicker is you are going to also bring in all of these extra workers who may be exploited,\u201d she said. As revealed by Guardian Australia on Wednesday, Labor has told union leaders that it will try to negotiate changes on labour market access and investor dispute clauses before supporting the bill\u2019s passage through parliament. But the Australian Council of Trade Unions has ramped up its pressure on MPs, writing to Labor members and including for them a copy of the party\u2019s national platform. ACTU president Michele O\u2019Neil said the agreements would increase the number of short-term foreign workers and undermine Australian jobs. \u201cThis is bad for local workers, will worsen the wage crisis and increase the exploitation for visa workers,\u201d O\u2019Neil said. \u201cThis report from JSCOT waves through agreements which would make the youth unemployment crisis in the regions worse and would allow companies to challenge Australian law when it doesn\u2019t suit their interests or profits.\u201d \u201cTrade agreements should improve the lives of working people, not put their interests second to multinationals. Labor\u2019s shadow trade minister Madeleine King said the report from the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties had confirmed \u201cthat there is no waiver of labour market testing for contractual service suppliers in either the Indonesia or Hong Kong agreements.\u201d \u201cThe report has found the IA-CEPA would reduce tariffs imposed by Indonesia, facilitate cooperation to address non-tariff barriers, ease restrictions on Australian participation in Indonesia\u2019s services sector and improve protections for Australian investment in Indonesia,\u201d King said in a statement. \u201cLabor will continue to push for the expertise of industry, unions and community groups in the course of trade negotiations. However, we acknowledge that the report concludes that these agreements are ultimately in Australia\u2019s national interest.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>For Callum Wilson the scent of non-league football came from the fast-food vans at pitchside. \u201cYou could smell burger and chips when you\u2019re running up and down the line,\u201d the Bournemouth striker says with a smile.</p> <p>It was at the start of his career that he had loan spells from Coventry City at Kettering and Tamworth in the Conference and, as the 27-year-old looks forward to playing his part for England in the Euro 2020 qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria, it is easy to reflect on how far he has come.</p> <p>Wilson does not see it quite this way. Yes, non-league toughened him, preparing him for his rise up the divisions, and he can tell the stories of rollickings he received from managers, of how people\u2019s livelihoods were riding on win bonuses. But to him, playing for England was always going to happen. It was his destiny and it has not mattered that he has needed to take a circuitous route to the top.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/08/england-ready-walk-off-if-racism-sofia-tammy-abraham-bulgaria\">England ready to walk off if Bulgaria fans racially abuse us, says Abraham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen I was on loan at Kettering and Tamworth, I said I will play for England one day. Everyone calls me self-confident. If you don\u2019t believe you can get somewhere you will never get there and it was always the aim to play for the national team and to play in the Premier League. When I got there, I felt I had been there before because in my head I had been there.\u201d</p> <p>Wilson was smart enough not to tell his non-league teammates of what he was about to do. \u201cThey would think: \u2018Young, little whippersnapper \u2013 coming in and saying he\u2019s going to play for England \u2013 get out of here,\u2019\u201d Wilson says. \u201cBut I told family, friends and they all said: \u2018Yes, go for it.\u2019 Some games, you would be playing terribly and I\u2019d think: \u2018No, it\u2019s never going to happen.\u2019 But you have to keep that belief there and here I am.\u201d</p> <p>Wilson has endured dark times, specifically those imposed by serious injury. In 2015\u201116, having started his first Premier League season at Bournemouth with five goals in six games, he ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee and was out for six months. Then, in February 2017, he ruptured the ACL in his other knee. This time he missed nine months of football.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83109606a4ab55aab053be99f87db49baa3675e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83109606a4ab55aab053be99f87db49baa3675e3/566_596_3102_1861/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Callum Wilson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Callum Wilson scores England\u2019s third goal in the 3-0 win against USA in a friendly at Wembley in November 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jasonpix/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it does not take long in Wilson\u2019s company to realise he is made of stern stuff; that the setbacks have only hardened his motivation and conviction, and now he faces his latest obstacle, a peculiar challenge that adds up to a test of his mindset. England play with one centre-forward and everybody knows who that is. So, if Harry Kane is certain to monopolise the minutes \u2013 when fit \u2013 how does Wilson approach international duty?</p> <p>The answer is with patience and focus. If Wilson were to come on even for one minute, he knows he could make the difference. \u201cHarry is a great player, I\u2019m not saying I want to kick him out of the team,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cBut with injuries and things that happen along the way, you have to be ready to grasp the opportunity \u2013 whether it is one minute, 20 minutes or from the opening whistle. It\u2019s not just thinking: \u2018Harry is going to play.\u2019</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/06/police-lead-for-football-urged-uefa-to-reconsider-staging-england-game\">English police urged Uefa to reschedule Friday night Prague game amid fan fears</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI like to think I can make an impact. In cup games, I tend to come on for Bournemouth as a sub and you get quite a few goals from that. Defences get a bit tired, you run in behind and that\u2019s the last thing they want to be up against. It has its pros and cons. No professional footballer will say they want to be on the bench. I keep working hard at club level to try to eventually get a starting place.\u201d</p> <p>Wilson has won three England caps, the first as a starter in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/15/england-usa-international-friendly-match-report\" title=\"\">3-0 friendly win</a> against USA last November, when he scored the third goal. He came on for Kane in the other two \u2013 against Montenegro in Euro 2020 qualifying and Switzerland in the Nations League third-place play-off.</p> <p>\u201cYou watch how clinical Harry is in training, in the finishing sessions and there is no laughing and joking, just pure concentration,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cSometimes in club football \u2013 and I\u2019ve been guilty of this myself \u2013 you\u2019ll be doing a finishing session but having a bit of banter with the lads; having competition, laughing and joking at people missing but in a game, that is not what happens.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to be focused. Harry is in that frame of mind and I have taken that into my own training at Bournemouth. When I\u2019m working on my finishing there is no need to be laughing and joking. You can have banter in the changing room.\u201d</p> <p>Wilson has scored five goals in his last five league matches and his growing maturity is evident in his assessment of the season. \u201cI am still missing a few chances. It\u2019s about being consistent. I always like to score in the first few games and I didn\u2019t do that but I didn\u2019t get too agitated. \u201cNow, after a few goals back to back, I am in a good place. I\u2019m confident and I feel I will score all the time.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "For Callum Wilson the scent of non-league football came from the fast-food vans at pitchside. \u201cYou could smell burger and chips when you\u2019re running up and down the line,\u201d the Bournemouth striker says with a smile. It was at the start of his career that he had loan spells from Coventry City at Kettering and Tamworth in the Conference and, as the 27-year-old looks forward to playing his part for England in the Euro 2020 qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria, it is easy to reflect on how far he has come. Wilson does not see it quite this way. Yes, non-league toughened him, preparing him for his rise up the divisions, and he can tell the stories of rollickings he received from managers, of how people\u2019s livelihoods were riding on win bonuses. But to him, playing for England was always going to happen. It was his destiny and it has not mattered that he has needed to take a circuitous route to the top. \u201cWhen I was on loan at Kettering and Tamworth, I said I will play for England one day. Everyone calls me self-confident. If you don\u2019t believe you can get somewhere you will never get there and it was always the aim to play for the national team and to play in the Premier League. When I got there, I felt I had been there before because in my head I had been there.\u201d Wilson was smart enough not to tell his non-league teammates of what he was about to do. \u201cThey would think: \u2018Young, little whippersnapper \u2013 coming in and saying he\u2019s going to play for England \u2013 get out of here,\u2019\u201d Wilson says. \u201cBut I told family, friends and they all said: \u2018Yes, go for it.\u2019 Some games, you would be playing terribly and I\u2019d think: \u2018No, it\u2019s never going to happen.\u2019 But you have to keep that belief there and here I am.\u201d Wilson has endured dark times, specifically those imposed by serious injury. In 2015\u201116, having started his first Premier League season at Bournemouth with five goals in six games, he ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee and was out for six months. Then, in February 2017, he ruptured the ACL in his other knee. This time he missed nine months of football. But it does not take long in Wilson\u2019s company to realise he is made of stern stuff; that the setbacks have only hardened his motivation and conviction, and now he faces his latest obstacle, a peculiar challenge that adds up to a test of his mindset. England play with one centre-forward and everybody knows who that is. So, if Harry Kane is certain to monopolise the minutes \u2013 when fit \u2013 how does Wilson approach international duty? The answer is with patience and focus. If Wilson were to come on even for one minute, he knows he could make the difference. \u201cHarry is a great player, I\u2019m not saying I want to kick him out of the team,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cBut with injuries and things that happen along the way, you have to be ready to grasp the opportunity \u2013 whether it is one minute, 20 minutes or from the opening whistle. It\u2019s not just thinking: \u2018Harry is going to play.\u2019 \u201cI like to think I can make an impact. In cup games, I tend to come on for Bournemouth as a sub and you get quite a few goals from that. Defences get a bit tired, you run in behind and that\u2019s the last thing they want to be up against. It has its pros and cons. No professional footballer will say they want to be on the bench. I keep working hard at club level to try to eventually get a starting place.\u201d Wilson has won three England caps, the first as a starter in the 3-0 friendly win against USA last November, when he scored the third goal. He came on for Kane in the other two \u2013 against Montenegro in Euro 2020 qualifying and Switzerland in the Nations League third-place play-off. \u201cYou watch how clinical Harry is in training, in the finishing sessions and there is no laughing and joking, just pure concentration,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cSometimes in club football \u2013 and I\u2019ve been guilty of this myself \u2013 you\u2019ll be doing a finishing session but having a bit of banter with the lads; having competition, laughing and joking at people missing but in a game, that is not what happens. \u201cYou have to be focused. Harry is in that frame of mind and I have taken that into my own training at Bournemouth. When I\u2019m working on my finishing there is no need to be laughing and joking. You can have banter in the changing room.\u201d Wilson has scored five goals in his last five league matches and his growing maturity is evident in his assessment of the season. \u201cI am still missing a few chances. It\u2019s about being consistent. I always like to score in the first few games and I didn\u2019t do that but I didn\u2019t get too agitated. \u201cNow, after a few goals back to back, I am in a good place. I\u2019m confident and I feel I will score all the time.\u201d",

And you can understand why people are getting rather antsy about the fact that even with the carry-over credits and dodgy accounting of land use, we are still unlikely to meet our Paris target of 26% below 2005 levels.

      "bodyText": "Thick crude oil that has stained hundreds of miles of pristine Brazilian beach in recent weeks probably originated in Venezuela, the Brazilian government has said, in an accusation likely to further strain relations between the two countries. Brazilian authorities have been investigating the growing disaster for more than a month, as the oil has spread to more than 130 beaches across nine states. On Wednesday, the country\u2019s environment minister, Ricardo Salles, told a congressional hearing that a study by the state oil company Petrobras had concluded that the oil \u201cis very likely from Venezuela\u201d. He said that a foreign ship near Brazil\u2019s coastline appeared to have caused the spill \u201caccidentally or not\u201d. Salles said that more than 100 tonnes of oil had already been collected from the coastline since 2 September, but said that the disaster was proving \u201cenormously difficult to contain\u201d. There was no immediate response from Venezuela, but the Brazilian assertion is likely to further escalate tensions between the two countries. Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s far-right president, is a longstanding critic of Venezuela\u2019s embattled leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, and has close relations with rightwing Venezuelan groups seeking his overthrow. Earlier this week, Bolsonaro dismissed speculation that the spill had been released by a sinking ship. \u201cIf it was a shipwreck, oil would still be coming up. It is more probable that something was dumped there criminally,\u201d he told reporters. Bolsonaro said he did not want to blame another country without proof, but hinted darkly: \u201cWe have a country on our radar screen that could be the origin of the oil.\u201d Petrobras\u2019s chief executive, Roberto Castello, said on Tuesday that the amount of oil spilled so far \u2013 approximately 500 barrels \u2013 was far too much to have been from the result of a routine tank cleaning. Social media users have shared shocking images of the spill, showing kilometers of white sand stained with oil blotches and dead, oil-covered turtles and dolphins. One video shows thick black oil lapping up against a rocky jetty. The oil\u2019s appearance came shortly after Brazil became the focus of international criticism over record wildfires and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest \u2013 both of which have surged since Bolsonaro came to office. Environmentalists and indigenous leaders say that Bolsonaro\u2019s stripping back of environmental legislation and protections has stoked a fresh assault on the country\u2019s ecosystems. \u201cThe oil spill that\u2019s reached over 132 beaches in the north-east is criminal.

      "body": "<p>Stephen Kenny is an unlikely revolutionary. The 47-year-old talks in such whispers that you could be forgiven for sensing he deals in international conspiracies rather than international football. Yet when Kenny speaks, those within Irish football have learned to listen.</p> <p>The Football Association of Ireland\u2019s succession plan, whereby Kenny would replace Mick McCarthy as the manager after a stint in charge of the under-21s, was ripe for ridicule when unveiled last November. The possibilities for trouble were endless. Kenny could at least shrug off the noise; it is in black and white that he will succeed McCarthy on 1 August 2020. McCarthy has been tetchy when pressed on the issue.</p> <p>More fool those who sensed Kenny might mark time with his young charges. A sellout crowd of 8,000 is due to attend Thursday\u2019s European Under-21 Championship qualifier as Ireland host Italy in Tallaght. At the same stadium only 19 months ago, 123 hardy souls watched the Irish defeat Iceland.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/05/republic-ireland-switzerland-euro-2020-qualifier-match-report\">David McGoldrick earns Ireland vital point with header against Switzerland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kenny\u2019s golden touch, so evident at club level \u2013 most recently Dundalk \u2013 is apparent again. Ireland have won three out of three in Group One as illustrious opposition come to town.</p> <p>But what if Kenny had struggled? What if his under-21 post had delivered only negative vibes in respect of the future? \u201cUltimately these are all possibilities but you can\u2019t be governed by fear,\u201d says Kenny. \u201cThere are no certainties but you have to have confidence and you have to back yourself to do well. I think it\u2019s important to have conviction and that\u2019s the way I view it. You can\u2019t be paralysed by fear. Life is short, you have to maximise everything you\u2019ve got and see the possibilities that exist.\u201d</p> <p>Likewise applies to personnel. If Ireland is a country supposedly devoid of deep football resource, Kenny will not be disheartened. Partly because he cannot be and partly after being in the audience for a lecture from Marcello Lippi in the aftermath of Italy\u2019s 2006 World Cup win.</p> <p>Lippi shone a light on Fabio Grosso, then of understated Palermo, rather than the stars of Juventus or the Milan clubs. \u201cI think there is a danger is focusing on what you don\u2019t have sometimes,\u201d Kenny explains. \u201cIt\u2019s not a league table to say: \u2018How many players have you got playing in the Premier League, how many games have they played.\u2019 The international team shouldn\u2019t reflect a league table of how many appearances people have and so forth.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to have your own vision of what you want, your own style of play and what fits that, what constitutes a team. You\u2019ve got to see it with your own eyes. You\u2019ve got to see the potential in people, even if they are not really excelling with their club. We have to utilise what we have got and, as a nation overall, show greater belief in ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>There are further breaches of convention.

      "bodyText": "Stephen Kenny is an unlikely revolutionary. The 47-year-old talks in such whispers that you could be forgiven for sensing he deals in international conspiracies rather than international football. Yet when Kenny speaks, those within Irish football have learned to listen. The Football Association of Ireland\u2019s succession plan, whereby Kenny would replace Mick McCarthy as the manager after a stint in charge of the under-21s, was ripe for ridicule when unveiled last November. The possibilities for trouble were endless. Kenny could at least shrug off the noise; it is in black and white that he will succeed McCarthy on 1 August 2020. McCarthy has been tetchy when pressed on the issue. More fool those who sensed Kenny might mark time with his young charges. A sellout crowd of 8,000 is due to attend Thursday\u2019s European Under-21 Championship qualifier as Ireland host Italy in Tallaght. At the same stadium only 19 months ago, 123 hardy souls watched the Irish defeat Iceland. Kenny\u2019s golden touch, so evident at club level \u2013 most recently Dundalk \u2013 is apparent again. Ireland have won three out of three in Group One as illustrious opposition come to town. But what if Kenny had struggled? What if his under-21 post had delivered only negative vibes in respect of the future? \u201cUltimately these are all possibilities but you can\u2019t be governed by fear,\u201d says Kenny. \u201cThere are no certainties but you have to have confidence and you have to back yourself to do well. I think it\u2019s important to have conviction and that\u2019s the way I view it. You can\u2019t be paralysed by fear. Life is short, you have to maximise everything you\u2019ve got and see the possibilities that exist.\u201d Likewise applies to personnel. If Ireland is a country supposedly devoid of deep football resource, Kenny will not be disheartened. Partly because he cannot be and partly after being in the audience for a lecture from Marcello Lippi in the aftermath of Italy\u2019s 2006 World Cup win. Lippi shone a light on Fabio Grosso, then of understated Palermo, rather than the stars of Juventus or the Milan clubs. \u201cI think there is a danger is focusing on what you don\u2019t have sometimes,\u201d Kenny explains. \u201cIt\u2019s not a league table to say: \u2018How many players have you got playing in the Premier League, how many games have they played.\u2019 The international team shouldn\u2019t reflect a league table of how many appearances people have and so forth. \u201cYou have to have your own vision of what you want, your own style of play and what fits that, what constitutes a team. You\u2019ve got to see it with your own eyes. You\u2019ve got to see the potential in people, even if they are not really excelling with their club. We have to utilise what we have got and, as a nation overall, show greater belief in ourselves.\u201d There are further breaches of convention. Kenny won\u2019t subscribe to the view that winning Ireland teams are an automatic consequence of rugged centre\u2011backs and the winning of second balls. \u201cThe players want to play in a progressive way, the supporters want to see a progressive team,\u201d he says. \u201cI think football is changing all the time and, believe it or not, the styles are evolving, so there is less cynicism in the game. Not on the outside, the periphery, but in the football itself. Some of the great teams in recent years have influenced teams all over to play in a more progressive way. In my view that has to be good.\u201d Kenny is anxious to point out his managerial journey \u2013 which began in Tallaght with a non-league side before he took over at Longford Town when aged just 26 \u2013 has not all been plain sailing. Dunfermline Athletic were relegated from Scotland\u2019s top flight on Kenny\u2019s watch in 2007. He had an ill-fated spell at Shamrock Rovers in 2012. Yet ask supporters of Bohemians, Derry City and Dundalk \u2013 Kenny transformed the latter two \u2013 about this manager and they will purr. Modesty is just one instantly identifiable Kenny trait. He is considerate, thoughtful, conscious of fine details and immensely proud of his current position. Any suggestion of management taking the Dubliner back across the Irish Sea is readily rebuffed. \u201cI\u2019m in the position I want to be in.

It\u2019s a meeting of glittering heavyweights in Dortmund. </strong>Germany and Argentina have won six World Cups between them. Their current iterations are somewhat in transition, though, and require some rebuilding work if they hope to add to that haul anytime soon. Both nations flopped at the 2018 World Cup and Argentina suffered the deep disappointment of being knocked out of the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica by Brazil in the semi-finals. Germany\u2019s form has been patchy \u2013 by their impeccable standards \u2013 since Russia, with a disappointing Nations League campaign and in Euro 2020 qualifying they have looked disjointed at times, never more so than in the 4-2 home defeat by the Netherlands last month. </p> <p><strong>Joachim L\u00f6w is trying to fast-track a new generation of younger players into becoming Germany regulars. </strong>Players such as Niklas S\u00fcle, Serge Gnabry and Julian Brandt are assuming more responsibility after L\u00f6w ruthlessly ended the international careers of most of the 2014 World Cup winners, so teething problems are to be expected. With Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen starting in place of Manuel Neuer this evening, and Toni Kroos injured, none of the Brazil 2014 alumni will be on show. </p> <p><strong>Argentina were the runners-up in 2014 and they too are being overhauled by their manager, Lionel Scaloni.</strong> His starting XI this evening may look even more experimental than usual given he is without a number of Boca Juniors and River Plate players, who are preparing for the second leg of the Copa Libertadores semi-final second leg. On top of that, Lionel Messi is still suspended and Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Angel Di Mar\u00eda have been left out. Nicolas Otamendi will start this evening. Scaloni will be hoping he doesn\u2019t bring his maverick Manchester City form to the occasion. The lesser-spotted Marcos Rojo will play too. He will be the only starter from the Brazil 2014 final. </p> <p><strong>They have played each other only once since the World Cup final, a Dusseldorf friendly in September 2014.</strong> On that occasion Argentina won 4-2. I\u2019m hoping for similar entertainment this evening.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 7.45pm BST, 8.45pm local, 3.45pm Buenos Aires.</p> <p><strong>My prediction:</strong> Germany 3-2 Argentina.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-09T16:36:47.785Z\">at 5.36pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Right, I\u2019m off. Thanks for your emails. There will be a report here to read shortly. I hear Guildford is nice this time of year \u2026 And that\u2019s that. Argentina were woeful in the first half and this result looked to be a pipe dream when they trudged in 2-0 down. But Germany allowed complacency to creep into their play in the second half and their changes weakened them. Argentina grew as they got to grips with a 3-4-3 formation and their changes brought energy into their play and they deserved their slightly fortunate equaliser. It was a decent friendly all told \u2013 and both managers will have learned something from it. 90 min: De Paul is off and Rodriguez is on. 87 min: Argentina can smell a winner. Martinez has been given a new lease of life by his strike partner Alario, who is ever so busy and giving Martinez space. A cross into the Germany box causes panic and Can hoofs clear from six yards. L\u00f6w will not be impressed by this second half display. He may well put his hand somewhere sweaty, show his young Germany team, and then tell them their performance smells like it. 86 min: Before that goal, Argentina could very easily have had a man sent off. Ocampos was booked for a foul on Klostermann but replays show that Paredes leapt in two-footed from the side and also got a bit of the Germany player\u2019s ankle. Had the referee seen that I think he would have seen red. Waldschmidt is picked off in Germany\u2019s midfield and Argentina race forwards. Martinez sprints into the box and lays the ball off to Ocampos, who bends a shot at goal that clips Can and goes in. Ter Stegen had no chance. But that was coming. Germany were sloppy again. 82 min: Argentina are looking the more likely team to score. They have finally turned up and look like they give a flying one now. Sloppiness has crept into Germany\u2019s play and they will pay if they don\u2019t sharpen up. Rudy is on for Germany\u2019s second goalscorer, Havertz. Rudy is a Schalke midfielder currently on loan at Hoffenheim. 79 min: With reference to an email on seven minutes, Ben Maiden writes: \u201cGregg, I lived in Guildford in the late 90s and a definite highlight would be the time I watched Steve Hoare being carried out of Bojangles \u2018nite\u2019 club by two bouncers. (He knows what he did.) A lowlight, oddly enough given the Figo photo, was eating a dish prepared by my roommate of the time that he called \u2018Astronaut Pie.\u2019 I shudder to recall.\u201d You know a nightclub is moody when it\u2019s called a \u201cnite\u201d club. 77 min: Germany are in danger of doing themselves harm here. From their own free-kick in the right-back position, Can plays a ridiculous cross-field pass that is cut out. Argentina pile forwards and Martinez rifles a right-footed shot just wide. 76 min: Pereyra\u2019s shift is over. Renzo Saravia punches in in his place. 75 min: \u2026 and Kimmich thumps a shot at the near post that Marchesin can only punch clear, clumsily. 74 min: Amiri tricks his way through three Argentina defenders and Pereyra sticks a foot out to bring him down. Free-kick to Germany on the corner of the box. Kimmich to take it \u2026 72 min: Gnabry, who scored the first goal, is replaced by Suat Serdar, a midfielder with Schalke who is making his debut. This Germany side is gradually looking more experimental and Argentina can sense a chance to make the most of the disjointedness that has crept into the home side\u2019s play. 70 min: Paredes fizzes a shot at goal that Ter Stegen plucks from the air. They\u2019re calling it a TV save on Sky. It dipped a little as it came to him so that\u2019s perhaps a little harsh. Other keepers not of Ter Stegen\u2019s level may have botched that up. 68 min: The home side make a change. Brandt is replaced Nadiem Amiri, an attacking midfielder with Leverkusen. 67 min: Germany had taken their foot off the gas and paid for complacency there. Acuna had far too much space to amble into before he played that cross in. Acuna whips another lovely ball in from the left towards Alario, who steps off his marker and heads powerfully into the top corner. That was a simple but high quality goal. Game on! 64 min: Martinez prods a shot just over after a tantalising cross in from the left. He looks rueful. That was a decent chance. 61 min: Alario is on for Dybala, who has seen so little of the ball tonight that he\u2019s barely been mentioned. It\u2019s a shame. He\u2019s a busy and inventive pesky menace at his best. Alario is a forward with Leverkusen, so he\u2019s not had to go far to make it to this friendly. 59 min: Argentina seem to have absolutely no idea how to get out of their own half. Whenever their defenders get the ball they have no midfielders on ahead of them. Even after switching to three at the back the extra man further forwards is not making much of a difference. 57 min: Brandt spins on the edge of the box and thumps a shot at goal that skids off the surface and into Marchesin\u2019s firm grasp. Germany are still bossing this. 54 min: Argentina win a corner. Dybala floats it in and Germany clear \u2026 and then they break like greyhounds! Brandt finds Havertz inside him, who prods the ball to the onrushing Can. He only has Marchesin to beat, but the keeper sticks out his right boot and prevents Can\u2019s prodded effort at goal making it 3-0. Lovely break, though. 52 min: There\u2019s not much happening so I\u2019ll hand the mic to Peter Oh. \u201cJR in Illinois inspired me to try my hand at joke-writing. Rojo and Otamendi walk into a bar. The bartender says \u2018What the dickens are ya\u2019 doin\u2019 in this here bar?! Yer supposed to be on the pitch defendin\u2019 for Argentina!\u2019\u201d I preferred JR\u2019s joke Peter. Though yours is perhaps more accurate as Rojo may well be in a bar now after that horror show of a first half. 50 min: It\u2019s easily cleared by Germany, who work their way forwards with a series of crisp passing moves. They\u2019re a joy to watch at times. So economical. So effective. 49 min: \u201cI think for most all of us anywhere south of Chicago and/or west of the Mississippi chances are good that The Fiver is as readable as this stuff,\u201d writes Bill Mathis. Fair enough but I don\u2019t understand The Fiver at times Bill \u2013 and I often write it. Maybe that\u2019s the problem. Anyway, Argentina have a corner! 47 min: Waldschmidt volleys wide from the corner of the box after a corner made it all the way through to him. Slow start to the half, otherwise. 46 min: Acu\u00f1a is a winger or wing-back so I expect Foyth may be pairing Otamendi at the back now or Argentina have gone to three at the back. They needed to do something to stop the raids down the right. 45 min: It\u2019s the second half. There are two changes for the visitors, though. Marcos Acu\u00f1a is on for one half of Argentina\u2019s comedy duo. Rojo has been hooked but Otamendi is still on. And Sevilla\u2019s Lucas Ocampos is on for Angel Correa. \u201cTantalizing bit of news that, about Petr Cech playing pro ice hockey,\u201d writes Peter Oh. \u201cI guess all those years of wearing a helmet while stood between the sticks for Chelsea and Arsenal really got to him! Germany look like they\u2019ve iced this game already. For the goals, was the Argentina goaltender beaten on his stick side or the glove side? Don\u2019t tell me let the ball go through the five-hole!\u201d Can anyone translate? This is what it must be like for American readers trying to understand The Fiver. \u201cI\u2019m wondering what position(s) the wonderfully versatile and increasingly influential Joshua Kimmich is playing in tonight, and how does it compare with his role(s) at Bayern?\u201d asks Phil Grey. He\u2019s playing centre midfield tonight. And he\u2019s doing it brilliantly. He\u2019s their midfield metronome. He\u2019s played mostly at right-back for Bayern Munich this season but he\u2019s one of those players you feel could slot in absolutely anywhere. He really is the new Lahm. Germany\u2019s next generation look all right. Argentina\u2019s hotch-potch collection of misfits look far from all right. As my colleague, John Brewin, wrote in the first half: And this from Gary Naylor perhaps rings true: 44 min: Gnabry volleys a foot wide after Kimmich pinged a beautiful pass to the back post, where the winger was rushing in. 43 min: Germany\u2019s intensity has dipped a little. They\u2019re still playing the most crisp passes of the two sides, though. 40 min: Now it\u2019s Sule who dishes out some rough stuff in the German left-back position. Free-kick. Paredes pulls a clever low ball back across the German defensive line to Rodrigo, who sends a hopeless shot into space. 38 min: Paredes has just raked his boot down the right achilles of Kimmich, who wants another yellow card to be shown. But the referee is having none of it. That was a yellow all day in a competitive match. 36 min: Correa swipes over from 10 yards after another decent Argentina attack. They\u2019re slowly getting back into this. But at any moment, it feels as though German brilliance, or calamitous Argentinian defending, could lead to a third goal for the home side. 35 min: Germany have just flicked and tricked their way out of an Argentina high-press high after being pinned back into their left-back position. It\u2019s a bit too early for that kind of showboating for me. 33 min: What a strike! Another! This time it\u2019s Rodrigo De Paul, though, who drills a right-footer at goal from 25 yards that beats Ter Stegen and thuds into the far post before ending up miles back up the pitch it was hit so hard. That almost got Argentina back into it. 32 min: Halstenburg almost scores a beauty. It\u2019s a left-footer whipped in at the top-right postage stamp that Marchesin maybe gets a fingertip too to deflect it on to the bar. 31 min: Rojo loses possession (again), Gnabry races towards the box and Rodrigo De Paul cynically pulls him down. Yellow card. Free-kick 25 yards out \u2026 29 min: Argentina enjoy some sterile possession before Can decides he\u2019s had enough of watching this and steps in to set up a crisp Germany counter-attack. Sule threads a ball through the Argentina midfield to the busy Brandt, who pops a pass off to Gnabry. He beats his man and sets up Klostermann on the right, but his cross is floated harmlessly out of play at the back post. 27 min: Kimmich clips the ball to the back post, where Sule heads across goal towards the onrushing Brandt, who misses connecting with the cross by a toenail\u2019s length \u2026 and then clatters into the near post. Replays show he was perhaps a shoelace offside in any case. 26 min: Otamendi is booked for cynically bringing down Brandt on the edge of the box to bring an end to a flowing Germany move. Free-kick, 25 yards out \u2026 24 min: \u201cI\u2019m working on a joke,\u201d begins JR from Illinois with impeccable timing. \u201cKnock knock. Who\u2019s there? Rojo and Otamendi. \u201cThat\u2019s it. What do you think? I guess it\u2019s kinda mean, isn\u2019t it? But really, they\u2019re not very good. And Rojo was just the one who slid in and missed the ball right before the goal. It was a fantastic goal by Gnabry though. Dude\u2019s on fire.\u201d That second one, though. He\u2019s supposed to be playing at centre-back. Oh dear! Rojo tries to nutmeg someone on the left and gets the ball taken off him. With Rojo completely out of position, Germany race forwards with Gnabry playing a simple square pass into the space where Rojo should be for Havertz to sidefoot powerfully home. This could be ugly. 19 min: Argentina look a little rushed in everything they do. They need some zen in their boots. Rodrigo De Paul is especially jumpy in midfield. He looks like he\u2019s trying too hard to please. Germany are just gradually moving through the gears. 17 min: Germany are suddenly all over Argentina. Brandt tries to square to Gnabry when he should shoot on the edge of the box and then Can wallops a shot at goal that is deflected wide for a corner. Halstenburg gets his head to it but it drops kindly for Marchesin. Sule pings a ball across to Klostermann on the right. The wing-back takes a lucky touch and then hares to the line and pulls back a low cross to Gnabry on the edge of the six-yard box. He pokes the ball away from the defender sliding in behind him and then pokes past Marchesin to put Germany 1-0 up. So very simple but a good poacher\u2019s goal from the in-form winger. 12 min: Rodrigo De Paul has just nutmegged two Germany players on a rampant run forwards. He was eventually muscled out of it by S\u00fcle and shouldered to the floor by Halstenberg. The referee\u2019s not keen on this turning into a bad-tempered affair so he calls Kimmich over to have a word. 11 min: Argentina are popping the ball around like Pekerman\u2019s class of 2006. And then crunch! Kimmich clatters into Paredes to bring their rondo session to a grinding halt. He\u2019s booked for his trouble. 9 min: Emre Can clears in the Germany penalty area. It\u2019s a wild clearance that could quite easily be a penalty, given he took as much of the ball as man. 8 min: The Tottenham-slayer, Gnabry, stretches his legs on the right but as he cuts inside he\u2019s faced by Otamendi, who does well to force the winger to knock the ball out of play as he tries to round him. 7 min: \u201cI grew up near Guildford and the highlight for me was my mate Alan buying a trilby from popular 80s menswear establishment Fosters,\u201d writes Steve Hoare. \u201cThe lowlight would be getting carried out of nightclub Bojangles by two burly bouncers for no reason I could think of. Meanwhile, why is there an astronaut walking up North Street behind Luis Figo? I don\u2019t remember them hanging in Guildford when I was there.\u201d I\u2019ve no idea. Gentrification? 6 min: Germany speed things up, playing some neat triangular passes around Argentina on the right but Havertz\u2019s lofted cross into the box is easily plucked out of the air by Marchesin. 4 min: Germany nick the ball off Argentina after some ponderous play at the back by the visitors but they can\u2019t work their way through the compact Argentina midfield. It\u2019s not really got going, to be honest. What\u2019s going on in Guildford? 2 min: It\u2019s a scrappy start, with some sloppy passing from both sides and a couple of crunching tackles as a result. 1 min: We\u2019re under way. Germany, in their famous white shirts are kicking from right to left on my screen. Argentina, in their less famous black away kit are going the other way. There\u2019s a minute\u2019s silence for the two people who were shot and killed near a synagogue in Halle this afternoon. The teams trot out on to the pitch. The national anthems quiver through the air, which means it\u2019s almost time for football. The Westfalenstadion is filling up nicely. It\u2019s Wednesday night in Dortmund \u2013 what else is there to do? There\u2019s a lovely mosaic on the Yellow Wall of a Germany player acrobatically volleying a star. It looks rather splendid. Gian Luca-Waldschmidt is making his Germany debut tonight. The Freiburg striker has scored four times in the Bundesliga this season, which is a decent return from seven games. He was red-hot in the summer at the Under-21 Euros. He scored seven goals for Germany as they finished runners-up to Spain. That\u2019s a goal every 64 minutes! Why does everyone want to go to Guildford? What\u2019s so good about it? If you live there, can you tell me? Breaking news! Nothing to do with this match but what a signing for Guildford Phoenix. Will we see Manuel Neuer on the ice when he retires? On the subject of English players having to go to Germany to develop, Neal Butler would like to point me in the direction of Stamford Bridge. \u201cAhem. Mason Mount, Tammy Abraham, and Fiyako Tomori would presumably beg to differ \u2026\u201d It\u2019s a fair cop, Neal. Germany\u2019s captain tonight is Joshua Kimmich, a wonderfully versatile and increasingly influential player. Here he is at Oktoberfest in Munich, either getting in the spirit or perhaps learning that he\u2019s going to be captaining Germany against Argentina. He\u2019s the new Philipp Lahm. While we wait for kick-off in Dortmund, why not cast your eyes over these youngsters at Premier League clubs. They will probably end up playing in Germany themselves, given that\u2019s the only place young English players seem to flourish these days. Germany starting XI: Ter Stegen; Halstenberg, S\u00fcle, Koch, Klostermann; Can, Kimmich; Gnabry, Havertz, Brandt; Waldschmidt. Niklas Stark has caught the lurgee so Halstenberg comes into defence for Germany. Argentina starting XI: Marches\u00edn; Foyth, Otamendi, Rojo, Tagliafico; Pereyra, Paredes, De Paul; Correa, L. Mart\u00ednez, Dybala. Scaloni named his starting XI yesterday so unless there has been an illness or unfortunate twang among his squad, it should look like the one I\u2019ve published above. Evening! It\u2019s a meeting of glittering heavyweights in Dortmund. Germany and Argentina have won six World Cups between them. Their current iterations are somewhat in transition, though, and require some rebuilding work if they hope to add to that haul anytime soon. Both nations flopped at the 2018 World Cup and Argentina suffered the deep disappointment of being knocked out of the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica by Brazil in the semi-finals. Germany\u2019s form has been patchy \u2013 by their impeccable standards \u2013 since Russia, with a disappointing Nations League campaign and in Euro 2020 qualifying they have looked disjointed at times, never more so than in the 4-2 home defeat by the Netherlands last month. Joachim L\u00f6w is trying to fast-track a new generation of younger players into becoming Germany regulars. Players such as Niklas S\u00fcle, Serge Gnabry and Julian Brandt are assuming more responsibility after L\u00f6w ruthlessly ended the international careers of most of the 2014 World Cup winners, so teething problems are to be expected. With Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen starting in place of Manuel Neuer this evening, and Toni Kroos injured, none of the Brazil 2014 alumni will be on show. Argentina were the runners-up in 2014 and they too are being overhauled by their manager, Lionel Scaloni. His starting XI this evening may look even more experimental than usual given he is without a number of Boca Juniors and River Plate players, who are preparing for the second leg of the Copa Libertadores semi-final second leg. On top of that, Lionel Messi is still suspended and Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Angel Di Mar\u00eda have been left out. Nicolas Otamendi will start this evening. Scaloni will be hoping he doesn\u2019t bring his maverick Manchester City form to the occasion. The lesser-spotted Marcos Rojo will play too. He will be the only starter from the Brazil 2014 final. They have played each other only once since the World Cup final, a Dusseldorf friendly in September 2014. On that occasion Argentina won 4-2. I\u2019m hoping for similar entertainment this evening. Kick-off: 7.45pm BST, 8.45pm local, 3.45pm Buenos Aires. My prediction: Germany 3-2 Argentina.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 10 October. Top stories The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has said that a long-planned Turkish military operation in north-east Syria has begun, as Kurdish forces that currently control the area reported widespread airstrikes and \u201chuge panic\u201d. The move was triggered by Donald Trump\u2019s announcement at the weekend that US troops would withdraw from the region, where thousands of captured Isis fighters and their families are held by Kurdish forces, and threatens to open a bloody new front in the Syrian war. Women and children in the largest Islamic State detention centre in Kurdish-controlled Syria are expecting to be freed in the wake of a Turkish assault on the area, according to people inside the camp. Al-Hawl is home to about 60,000 women and children with links to Isis and 10,000 displaced civilians. The Guardian has revealed the top 20 firms behind a third of all carbon emissions as part of a major investigation into the world\u2019s biggest polluters. New data from world-renowned researchers reveals how this cohort of state-owned and multinational firms are driving the climate emergency that threatens the future of humanity, and details how they have continued to expand their operations despite being aware of the industry\u2019s devastating impact on the planet for decades. The top 20 companies on the list have contributed to 35% of all energy-related carbon dioxide and methane worldwide. A Guardian analysis also reveals how a wave of planned fossil fuel developments across northern Australia would significantly increase the amount of coal and gas the country plans to sell into Asia and push the Paris climate agreement goals further beyond reach. Asylum seekers approved for medevac transfers to Australia are among the 52 men locked up in Port Moresby detention without access to phones or lawyers for the past two months, after Papua New Guinean authorities arrested dozens of men who had been sent by Australia for refugee detention and processing, and confiscated phones and medication. The vast majority are Iranian and more than half are at some point of the medevac process, having applied for it; been approved or refused; or were seeking re-evaluation. The Australian government has confirmed that approvals for medevacs have been \u201ccommunicated\u201d to Port Moresby but said the management of detainees inside Bomana is a matter for the PNG government. World Two people died in the eastern German city of Halle on Wednesday, after a gunman in a military-style outfit tried to force his way into a synagogue in an attempted mass shooting that may be linked to antisemitic, rightwing extremism. Michel Barnier has called on Boris Johnson to rein in the Downing Street aides responsible for attacking Angela Merkel as the EU doubled down on its rejection of the prime minister\u2019s proposals. Donald Trump\u2019s $1.5tn tax cuts helped billionaires pay a lower rate than the working class for the first time in history. Facebook has marked hundreds of thousands of children as \u201cinterested in\u201d adverts about gambling and alcohol, a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Danish Broadcasting Corporation has found. Coleen Rooney has claimed to have caught another footballer\u2019s wife passing her private information to the Sun newspaper, after apparently running an elaborate sting operation. The dramatic accusation set Twitter alight. Opinion and analysis There is a reason Extinction Rebellion protesters are so angry about inaction on climate change, writes Greg Jericho. \u201cThe last year to experience global annual temperatures below the 1951-1980 average was 1976 \u2013 so if you are less than 43 years old you have never experienced a year with below average temperatures.

Pocock convinced Rugby World Cup teammates Bernard Foley and Dane Haylett-Petty to join him in encouraging the sports industry to play a bigger role in sustainability. Thinking time: Thai cave rescue finally gets its first film In the days and weeks following the gruelling rescue of 12 boys and their football coach from the Tham Luong caves in 2018, the Thai government took control of the story. Or, more accurately, took control of the boys and the rights to their story. \u201cThe Ministry of Culture were the custodians of the children\u2019s rights,\u201d says Tom Waller, the director of a new film about the rescue, The Cave. \u201cThey were protecting the boys\u2019 interests for the first six months [after] they got out.\u201d Like tens of millions of people around the world, Waller had watched from afar as one of the worst fears the human psyche can conjure was being played out in real time: that of being trapped in the dark, in a cave, with no way to escape.

The American president announced on Sunday night that US troops would withdraw from the region.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, hours after the bombing had begun, Trump issued a statement mildly criticising the offensive aimed at Kurdish forces which for nearly five years fought alongside the US against Isis.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis morning, Turkey, a Nato member, invaded Syria. The United States does not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea,\u201d the statement said, before noting: \u201cThere are no American soldiers in the area.\u201d</p> \n<p>The UN security council is due to convene on Thursday to discuss the offensive at the request of its five current European members, but it is not expected to deliver a strong rebuke to Turkey, given tacit Russian support and US ambivalence. France was pushing for the council to at least make a joint statement but it was unclear on Wednesday whether even that would be possible.</p> \n<p>The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, called on Turkey to act with restraint and \u201censure that the gains we have made in the fight against Isis are not jeopardised. I will discuss this issue with President Erdo\u011fan Friday.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Turkish leader marked the launch of the offensive, dubbed Operation Peace Spring, with a tweet, saying that it was being conducted by Turkish and Turkish-backed Syrian militias, against Kurdish forces and Isis.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur mission is to prevent the creation of a terror corridor across our southern border, and to bring peace to the area,\u201d the president wrote.</p> \n<p>Turkey says it is seeking to establish a 20-mile (32km) deep buffer zone along the border to secure the country against the threat of what it says are Kurdish terror groups as well as Isis. It also hopes to resettle Syrian refugees in the zone.</p> \n<p>Mustafa Bali, spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) \u2013 which Ankara considers an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) \u2013 confirmed shortly after Erdo\u011fan\u2019s announcement that Turkish warplanes had already begun attacking the region, creating a \u201chuge panic among people\u201d. An SDF soldier shared photographs of plumes of smoke, which he said was the result of airstrikes and artillery fire near the border town of Ras al-Ayn.</p> \n<p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitor, said civilians in Ras al-Ayn and neighbouring villages had begun fleeing deeper inside the Kurdish-held region. Qamishli and Ain Issa, key administrative centres for the SDF, were hit by airstrikes, a spokesman said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/archive-zip/giv-3902qdd6vMiz72ey/\" data-alt=\"Map of Turkey's offensive\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/archive-zip/giv-3902qdd6vMiz72ey/\">Map of Turkey's offensive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>In his statement on Thursday, Trump said: \u201cTurkey has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place \u2013 and we will hold them to this commitment.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn addition, Turkey is now responsible for ensuring all Isis fighters being held captive remain in prison and that Isis does not reconstitute in any way, shape, or form,.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is far from clear how Turkey would take custody, let alone responsibility for the 90,000 men, women and children with links to the terror group currently held by the Kurds.</p> \n<p>The largest camp for women and children, al-Hawl, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/31/inside-al-hawl-camp-the-incubator-for-islamic-states-resurgence\">is home to 74,000 people, and lies outside the parameters of the proposed safe zone</a>.</p> \n<p>Hassan Hassan, an expert on Isis at the Centre for Global Policy, said the terror group was bound to benefit from Turkey\u2019s incursion.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe SDF had fresh and raw intelligence on people who joined Isis and the structures of Isis. Now Turkey comes in and doesn\u2019t have access to much of this information,\u201d Hassan, co-author of Isis: Inside the Army of Terror, said. He added: \u201cThe areas in Syria currently controlled by Turkey are full of corruption, more corrupt even than regime areas. Isis would have no trouble buying loyalty, paying bribes to escape.

      "bodyText": "Turkey has launched an offensive into north-eastern Syria, unleashing air strikes and artillery barrages aimed at US-backed Kurdish forces who control the region. Video footage showed civilians fleeing towns with columns of smoke rising in the background and jet trails visible in the sky. Activists and observers say at least seven civilians have been killed so far. Turkey\u2019s offensive was triggered by a call between Donald Trump and Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, on Sunday, in which the Turks claim Trump handed over leadership of the campaign against Isis in Syria to Ankara. The American president announced on Sunday night that US troops would withdraw from the region. On Wednesday, hours after the bombing had begun, Trump issued a statement mildly criticising the offensive aimed at Kurdish forces which for nearly five years fought alongside the US against Isis. \u201cThis morning, Turkey, a Nato member, invaded Syria. The United States does not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea,\u201d the statement said, before noting: \u201cThere are no American soldiers in the area.\u201d The UN security council is due to convene on Thursday to discuss the offensive at the request of its five current European members, but it is not expected to deliver a strong rebuke to Turkey, given tacit Russian support and US ambivalence. France was pushing for the council to at least make a joint statement but it was unclear on Wednesday whether even that would be possible. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, called on Turkey to act with restraint and \u201censure that the gains we have made in the fight against Isis are not jeopardised. I will discuss this issue with President Erdo\u011fan Friday.\u201d The Turkish leader marked the launch of the offensive, dubbed Operation Peace Spring, with a tweet, saying that it was being conducted by Turkish and Turkish-backed Syrian militias, against Kurdish forces and Isis. \u201cOur mission is to prevent the creation of a terror corridor across our southern border, and to bring peace to the area,\u201d the president wrote. Turkey says it is seeking to establish a 20-mile (32km) deep buffer zone along the border to secure the country against the threat of what it says are Kurdish terror groups as well as Isis. It also hopes to resettle Syrian refugees in the zone. Mustafa Bali, spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) \u2013 which Ankara considers an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) \u2013 confirmed shortly after Erdo\u011fan\u2019s announcement that Turkish warplanes had already begun attacking the region, creating a \u201chuge panic among people\u201d. An SDF soldier shared photographs of plumes of smoke, which he said was the result of airstrikes and artillery fire near the border town of Ras al-Ayn. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitor, said civilians in Ras al-Ayn and neighbouring villages had begun fleeing deeper inside the Kurdish-held region. Qamishli and Ain Issa, key administrative centres for the SDF, were hit by airstrikes, a spokesman said. In his statement on Thursday, Trump said: \u201cTurkey has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place \u2013 and we will hold them to this commitment. \u201cIn addition, Turkey is now responsible for ensuring all Isis fighters being held captive remain in prison and that Isis does not reconstitute in any way, shape, or form,.\u201d It is far from clear how Turkey would take custody, let alone responsibility for the 90,000 men, women and children with links to the terror group currently held by the Kurds. The largest camp for women and children, al-Hawl, is home to 74,000 people, and lies outside the parameters of the proposed safe zone. Hassan Hassan, an expert on Isis at the Centre for Global Policy, said the terror group was bound to benefit from Turkey\u2019s incursion. \u201cThe SDF had fresh and raw intelligence on people who joined Isis and the structures of Isis. Now Turkey comes in and doesn\u2019t have access to much of this information,\u201d Hassan, co-author of Isis: Inside the Army of Terror, said. He added: \u201cThe areas in Syria currently controlled by Turkey are full of corruption, more corrupt even than regime areas. Isis would have no trouble buying loyalty, paying bribes to escape. So definitely Isis will have new opportunities.\u201d Isis claimed an overnight suicide attack by two of its fighters in its former capital of Raqqa, which killed and injured 25 people. The SDF, a US-backed force, is Turkey\u2019s main target. Meanwhile, forces belonging to the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, have also been on the move to the south of Syria\u2019s Kurdish-held region, leaving the SDF pinched between the two. While Trump has sent mixed signals over the Turkish invasion, and the state department remained silent, politicians from both US parties vowed to inflict severe sanctions on Turkey. \u201cTurkey must pay a heavy price for attacking our Syrian Kurdish partners,\u201d Democratic senator Chris van Hollen said on Twitter. \u201cSenators on both sides of the aisle won\u2019t support abandoning the one regional group most responsible for putting Isis on its heels. Our bipartisan sanctions bill is being finalised now.\u201d The earliest sanctions legislation can be proposed is next week when Congress returns from recess. \u201cI have serious concerns about the unilateral military action that Turkey has taken,\u201d the UK\u2019s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said. \u201cThis risks destabilising the region, exacerbating humanitarian suffering, and undermining the progress made against Daesh [Isis] which should be our collective focus. \u201cTurkey has shown considerable generosity in hosting so many Syrian refugees. But we will not support plans for returns until the conditions are in place for a voluntary and safe return home.\u201d Aid groups have warned of a humanitarian catastrophe as thousands flee the expected fighting and re-emergence of Isis. The SDF says it has already withdrawn some soldiers from the prisons and camps holding Isis members to focus on the defence against Turkey, raising fears that Isis sleeper cells could liberate those inside. Save the Children which works with more than 100,000 refugees from Isis living in the region, warned that the 9,000 children there were particularly vulnerable. Sonia Khush, the Syria response director with the charity, warned that \u201cany interruption to camp services which are already overstretched would put lives at risk\u201d. Kurdish leaders in the area issued a general mobilisation call, urging civilians to \u201chead to the border with Turkey ... to resist during this delicate historical moment\u201d. The SDF has resumed digging trenches and tunnels in the border areas, covering streets with metal canopies and stockpiling tyres to burn to block Turkish drone cameras. Kurdish officials also said that they have asked Russia, Assad\u2019s major ally, to facilitate a dialogue with Damascus. The Kurds risk losing the autonomy they won during Syria\u2019s eight-year-old war by realigning with the Syrian regime but such a move is likely to stave off the worst of a Turkish attack. A secondary goal of Turkey\u2019s Operation Peace Spring is to repatriate up to 2 million of the country\u2019s 3.6 million Syrian refugees inside the planned border zone. The Kurds say Ankara\u2019s real goal is to dilute their demographic dominance of the north-east with an influx of mostly Sunni Arab refugees originally from other parts of Syria.",

      "bodyText": "Nancy Pelosi, the House of Representatives speaker and the most powerful Democrat in Congress, announced an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump on 24 September, setting off a fast-moving chain of events. Here are the key players, and here\u2019s a timeline of the key moments in the scandal so far: 2014 Russia annexes Crimea, a peninsula in southern Ukraine. The military occupation, denounced by western powers, sparks the biggest east-west crisis since the cold war. A popular uprising in Ukraine prompts the ouster of the Russian-backed president, Viktor Yanukovych. Hunter Biden, son of Joe Biden (then vice-president of the US under Barack Obama, and instrumental in US-Ukraine policy) joins the board of the scandal-plagued Ukrainian energy company Burisma. 2016 Paul Manafort, chairman of the 2016 Trump presidential campaign, resigns less than four months before the US election, after Ukraine\u2019s anti-corruption agency reveals he had been promised millions of dollars for undeclared consulting work for Kremlin-backed Yanukovych. Manafort is later indicted for failing to register as a foreign agent and numerous financial offenses, and jailed. Trump has since pushed an unsubstantiated theory that the campaign of his 2016 political opponent, Hillary Clinton, played a role in the Ukraine-Manafort revelations. 2019 7 April Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and former New York mayor, voices unsubstantiated allegations on Fox News that Joe Biden pressed for the dismissal of Viktor Shokin, a top Ukrainian prosecutor, in order to block a corruption investigation into Burisma. (The investigation into Burisma was dormant by the time the US, along with other western powers, called for Shokin to resign.) 22 April Volodymyr Zelenskiy, an actor and comedian with no political experience except for playing the president in a TV series, is elected Ukraine\u2019s leader. Trump congratulates him in a phone call. 25 April Joe Biden announces his 2020 presidential campaign. 1 May The New York Times reports that Giuliani has been urging Ukraine to conduct a new investigation into the activities of Joe and Hunter Biden. \u201cGiuliani called Mr Trump excitedly to brief him on his findings,\u201d the paper says. 18 July Trump issues instructions to withhold $392m in military aid from Ukraine, citing concerns over whether the money needed to be spent, according to reports. 25 July Trump and Zelenskiy speak on the phone. 12 August A whistleblower complaint is filed. 13 September Adam Schiff, Democratic congressman and chairman of the House intelligence committee, issues a subpoena for the complaint after Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, a Trump appointee, refuses to hand it over. Days later, reports emerge that Trump asked Zelenskiy during the 25 July phone call to investigate Joe Biden and the candidate\u2019s son, Hunter. Trump admits that he did, but denies wrongdoing. He denies that withholding aid had amounted to a quid pro quo. The aid funds were released on 11 September. 19 September Giuliani is interviewed on CNN and in a heated exchange at first denies that he asked Ukraine to investigate Biden. About 30 seconds later, he reverses himself. \u201cOf course I did,\u201d he says. 24 September The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, announces a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s actions. 25 September White House releases a partial \u201ctranscript\u201d of the 25 July call, hours before Trump\u2019s first face-to-face meeting with Zelenskiy at the United Nations. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be involved in democratic elections of the USA,\u201d Zelenskiy said. \u201cNobody pushed me.\u201d 26 September The whistleblower complaint is released. It alleges the White House tried to cover up the Trump-Ukraine call. 27 September Kurt Volker, Trump\u2019s former special envoy to Ukraine, resigns. 4 October The House congressional committees holding impeachment hearings release Whatsapp messages from US diplomats, handed over by Volker, which show a prestigious invitation for Zelenskiy to visit the White House was dependent on him stating publicly that Ukraine would investigate the Bidens and a supposed Ukrainian role in the 2016 US election, a theory advanced in far-right conspiracy circles. 6 October Lawyers for the first whistleblower say they are now representing a second. 8 October The state department prevents Gordon Sondland, US ambassador to the EU and a Trump donor, from testifying to a congressional impeachment hearing. The White House releases a letter refusing to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry, and accusing Democrats of trying to reverse the result of the 2016 election.",

      "body": "<p>Two people died and two more were severely injured in the eastern German city of Halle on Wednesday after a gunman in a military-style outfit tried to force his way into a synagogue in an attempted mass shooting.</p> \n<p>In a chilling echo of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/christchurch-shooting\">Christchurch mosque shooting</a>, the gunman recorded the attacks on a head-mounted camera and uploaded it online with an antisemitic and rightwing extremist rant. German media identified the killer as Stephan Balliet, a 27-year-old German citizen from the town of Eisleben in Saxony-Anhalt.</p> \n<p>Authorities in the city in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, home to 230,000 people, said they were dealing with a \u201crampage situation\u201d after several shots were fired in the Paulus quarter north of the city centre at about midday.</p> \n<p>One woman was shot dead outside the synagogue near a Jewish cemetery and one man killed in a nearby kebab shop.</p> \n<p>The German interior minister, Horst Seehofer, described it as an antisemitic attack.</p> \n<p>\u201cBased on current information, we have to assume that it was at least an antisemitic attack,\u201d he said. \u201cAccording to the federal prosecutors\u2019 office, there are enough indications that it was possibly a rightwing extremist motive.

Via a security camera, they could make out a man trying to enter the building by shooting at the locks.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe attacker repeatedly shot at the door and also threw several Molotov cocktails, firecrackers and grenades to force his way in,\u201d the head of the the Jewish community in Halle, Max Privorotzki, told Der Spiegel magazine.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a87047a8b161a72abac6cf6e284b04f02e9fa5c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a87047a8b161a72abac6cf6e284b04f02e9fa5c/22_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A screengrab of mobile phone footage showing a man firing shots from behind a car in Halle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A screengrab of mobile phone footage showing a man firing shots from behind a car in Halle.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters Tv/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cBut the door stayed shut, God protected us. The whole thing lasted perhaps five to 10 minutes,\u201d Privorotzki added. Worship continued after the attack, he said.</p> \n<p>A resident interviewed by the news agency DPA said he had seen a man dressed as a police officer take aim and shoot a woman with an automatic rifle outside the synagogue, and then threw a hand grenade over a wall at the Jewish cemetery. The report could not be confirmed.</p> \n<p>Reports in German media suggested the female victim was a passerby rather than a member of the Jewish community.</p> \n<p>Shots were later fired at a kebab shop on nearby Ludwig-Wucherer-Strasse, killing one male customer inside. Witness Konrad R\u00f6sler, 28, told German media a man wearing a military outfit and helmet walked up to the Kiez D\u00f6ner take-away restaurant and threw a stun grenade at the building that bounced off the door frame.

      "bodyText": "Two people died and two more were severely injured in the eastern German city of Halle on Wednesday after a gunman in a military-style outfit tried to force his way into a synagogue in an attempted mass shooting. In a chilling echo of the Christchurch mosque shooting, the gunman recorded the attacks on a head-mounted camera and uploaded it online with an antisemitic and rightwing extremist rant. German media identified the killer as Stephan Balliet, a 27-year-old German citizen from the town of Eisleben in Saxony-Anhalt. Authorities in the city in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, home to 230,000 people, said they were dealing with a \u201crampage situation\u201d after several shots were fired in the Paulus quarter north of the city centre at about midday. One woman was shot dead outside the synagogue near a Jewish cemetery and one man killed in a nearby kebab shop. The German interior minister, Horst Seehofer, described it as an antisemitic attack. \u201cBased on current information, we have to assume that it was at least an antisemitic attack,\u201d he said. \u201cAccording to the federal prosecutors\u2019 office, there are enough indications that it was possibly a rightwing extremist motive. They have taken over the investigations.\u201d Security at synagogues around Germany was boosted in the wake of the attack. Between 70 and 80 people had gathered in the synagogue in the area to celebrate Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year in Judaism, when they heard the shots outside the building. Via a security camera, they could make out a man trying to enter the building by shooting at the locks. \u201cThe attacker repeatedly shot at the door and also threw several Molotov cocktails, firecrackers and grenades to force his way in,\u201d the head of the the Jewish community in Halle, Max Privorotzki, told Der Spiegel magazine. \u201cBut the door stayed shut, God protected us. The whole thing lasted perhaps five to 10 minutes,\u201d Privorotzki added. Worship continued after the attack, he said. A resident interviewed by the news agency DPA said he had seen a man dressed as a police officer take aim and shoot a woman with an automatic rifle outside the synagogue, and then threw a hand grenade over a wall at the Jewish cemetery. The report could not be confirmed. Reports in German media suggested the female victim was a passerby rather than a member of the Jewish community. Shots were later fired at a kebab shop on nearby Ludwig-Wucherer-Strasse, killing one male customer inside. Witness Konrad R\u00f6sler, 28, told German media a man wearing a military outfit and helmet walked up to the Kiez D\u00f6ner take-away restaurant and threw a stun grenade at the building that bounced off the door frame. The man had then fired a shot inside the kebab shop, where five or six people were present, the witness said. One of the kebab shop\u2019s employees told broadcaster NTV the attacker had been \u201ccalm, like a professional \u2013 he did it like I make kebabs\u201d. Two people were taken to hospital with bullet wounds, police confirmed. Reports on the exact number of attackers varied throughout the day, but police confirmed one arrest. \u201cOur forces have detained one person,\u201d police tweeted at 12:44. \u201cPlease remain alert, however. We have deployed forces in and around Halle and are stabilising the situation until we have all the relevant information.\u201d A video, filmed on a mobile phone and broadcast by regional TV station MDR, showed a man in green military gear standing at the back of a parked car, firing a rifle. The attacker broadcast about 35 minutes of footage leading up to and during the attack on Twitch.tv, a live-streaming video platform owned by Amazon that is primarily used for streaming video games, the company confirmed. Speaking in English, the attacker announced himself as a Holocaust denier and blamed feminism for low birth rates in the west, which he said had led to mass immigration. He said \u201cthe Jew\u201d was the root of these problems.

      "bodyText": "When the first shell thudded to earth, the people of Ras al-Ayn were ready. So long had the buildup been \u2013 and so heated the warnings \u2013 that those who fled the opening salvos of Turkey\u2019s offensive in Kurdish northern Syria did so with little panic. On tractors, horses, in cars and on motorbikes, the region\u2019s newest refugees made their way from the border town that had been long pinpointed as the starting point of a Turkish invasion. Turkish jets took off from runways just to the north, sending missiles streaking through the sky and into one of the town\u2019s few high-rise buildings. By sunset, around 15 shells had landed in Ras al-Ayn, according to local official, Hevin Darwiche. As night drew near, new fears began to mount; might darkness bring a ground offensive that would send proxy forces trained by Ankara to retake the predominantly Arab town from the Kurds? Such are the contradictions of the Turkish operation: Kurdish forces that only months ago were fighting alongside the US military against Isis were now about to be attacked with the US president\u2019s explicit permission. Furthermore, many of Turkey\u2019s Arab proxy forces were former US allies several years ago, raised to fight the Syrian regime before Washington lost interest. Nearby, French forces garrisoned close to the border also began to leave the area, according to local reports and regional diplomats. Their raison d\u2019etre had been to defeat the Islamic Stateterror group, the remnants of which remain detained in four camps \u2013 two of which were volatile and tense ahead of the Turkish push. Isis has been contained but, as European diplomats warned this week, continues to pose a lethal threat to global security. Now would not be an ideal time to leave \u2013 were it not for the fact that US forces had abandoned the province first.

In fact, the Syrian military has not left the town during the war \u2013 continuing to man checkpoints in two neighbourhoods and the road to the city\u2019s airport. Several hours west, on the Iraqi side of the border, a Peshmerga guard pointed at nearby farmland, which he said had been attacked by the Turkish airforce during the night. \u201cThey were hitting the PKK, he said. \u201cThey might be difficult friends, but they\u2019re still Kurds.

It also accused investigators of denying Trump due process, including the right to see evidence and cross-examine witnesses, and threatened to end White House cooperation with Congress on important oversight matters.</p> \n<p>The letter set the stage for a historic clash between the executive and legislative branches of the US government. Pelosi, who announced the impeachment inquiry last month after it emerged that Trump pressed Ukraine\u2019s leader to investigate political rival Joe Biden, delivered a scathing response.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe White House letter is only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy, and to insist that the president is above the law,\u201d she said. \u201cThis letter is manifestly wrong, and is simply another unlawful attempt to hide the facts of the Trump administration\u2019s brazen efforts to pressure foreign powers to intervene in the 2020 elections.\u201d</p> \n<p>The speaker added: \u201cThe White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the president\u2019s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction.

You will be held accountable.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ab0d2a46-53aa-4a66-9221-f80241688979\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Article 1 of the United States constitution gives the House of Representatives the sole power to initiate impeachment and the Senate the sole power to try impeachments of the president. A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" \u2013 although the constitution does not specify what \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d are.</p>\n    <p>The process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment. A simple majority of members need to vote in favour of impeachment for it to pass to the next stage. Democrats currently control the house, with 235 representatives.</p>\n    <p>The chief justice of the US supreme court then presides over the proceedings in the Senate, where the president is tried, with senators acting as the jury.

      "bodyText": "The leader of congressional opposition to Donald Trump has declared that his attempts to stall an impeachment inquiry will prove futile, warning the US president: \u201cYou are not above the law.\u201d Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, said Democrats intend to move full speed ahead with their investigation despite the White House declaring it illegitimate, pushing the US towards a constitutional crisis. White House counsel Pat Cipollone wrote to Pelosi and other Democratic leaders on Tuesday: \u201cGiven that your inquiry lacks any legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness, or even the most elementary due process protections, the executive branch [White House] cannot be expected to participate in it.\u201d Cipollone\u2019s eight-page missive objected that the House did not formally vote to begin the impeachment inquiry, breaking with precedent set in the inquiries into Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. It also accused investigators of denying Trump due process, including the right to see evidence and cross-examine witnesses, and threatened to end White House cooperation with Congress on important oversight matters. The letter set the stage for a historic clash between the executive and legislative branches of the US government. Pelosi, who announced the impeachment inquiry last month after it emerged that Trump pressed Ukraine\u2019s leader to investigate political rival Joe Biden, delivered a scathing response. \u201cThe White House letter is only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy, and to insist that the president is above the law,\u201d she said. \u201cThis letter is manifestly wrong, and is simply another unlawful attempt to hide the facts of the Trump administration\u2019s brazen efforts to pressure foreign powers to intervene in the 2020 elections.\u201d The speaker added: \u201cThe White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the president\u2019s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction. Mr President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable.\u201d Trump aides have begun honing their approach after two weeks of what some allies have described as a listless and unfocused response to the inquiry. The letter appeared to put the emphasis on political rebuttal rather than structured legal argument \u2013 signalling a new strategy to counter the impeachment threat by openly defying Congress\u2019s right to investigate the president for high crimes and misdemeanours. The House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, said: \u201cPresident Trump is right to call out this rushed process because Democrats refuse to protect the transparency and basic fairness that have been integral to previous impeachment proceedings.\u201d But the letter was widely scorned by political analysts and legal experts. George Conway, a lawyer married to Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, tweeted: \u201cI cannot fathom how any self-respecting member of the bar could affix his name to this letter. It\u2019s pure hackery, and it disgraces the profession.\u201d Gregg Nunziata, the former chief nominations counsel for Republicans on the Senate judiciary committee, added on Twitter: \u201cWow. This letter is bananas. A barely-lawyered temper tantrum. A middle finger to Congress and its oversight responsibilities. No member of Congress should accept it. Things are bad. Things will get worse.\u201d Cipollone\u2019s intervention came after the Trump administration abruptly blocked a key witness in the Ukraine scandal from appearing before the congressional impeachment inquiry. The state department said the US ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, a Trump political donor, would not be allowed to appear, even though he had already travelled from Europe to testify behind closed doors in Washington. Trump decried the Democratic-led inquiry into whether he abused his office in the pursuit of personal political gain as a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d. Democrats condemned the move, calling it an attempt to obstruct their inquiry, and issued a subpoena for Sondland, seeking documents by 14 October and a deposition on Capitol Hill on 16 October. Schiff said the ambassador\u2019s no-show was \u201cyet additional strong evidence\u201d of obstruction of Congress by Trump and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, that will only strengthen a possible impeachment case. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has said he will not testify before the House intelligence committee unless committee members vote to remove its chairman, Adam Schiff. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t testify in front of that committee until there is a vote of Congress and he is removed,\u201d Giuliani told the Washington Post. \u201cLet them hold me in contempt. We\u2019ll go to court.

      "bodyText": "Centrist Tory MPs believe they have extracted a promise from Boris Johnson that he will not go into an election arguing for a no-deal Brexit and would never make a pact with Nigel Farage, after warning him they could not stand on such a platform. Damian Green, the leader of the One Nation group of 80 Tory MPs, told the Guardian Johnson \u201clooked [him] in the eye\u201d as he pledged the party would not shift to endorsing a no-deal Brexit as the Conservatives\u2019 central policy. Green said he believed Johnson\u2019s reassurances, after he and Gillian Keegan, James Brokenshire and Victoria Prentis met the prime minister in Downing Street to deliver the message that large numbers of Tory MPs would find a no-deal policy unacceptable. \u201cWe went in to say that no deal as the prime aim of government policy would be unacceptable in a manifesto and we were reassured that wasn\u2019t the prime minister\u2019s aim, that he still wants to get a deal now and still thinks that would be the best outcome. He has no intention of putting a no-deal policy in a manifesto,\u201d Green said. \u201cThis arose from a meeting of the One Nation caucus earlier in the week. It was the principal point and we also wanted to be assured again that the Conservative party wouldn\u2019t do a deal with the Brexit party. \u201cWe looked each other in the eye. I accept and believe the reassurances,\u201d he added. \u201cWe accept that no deal has to be a possibility and the One Nation caucus has by and large always been supportive of the government\u2019s policy. What we want is for that to continue.\u201d Downing Street made no comment on the meeting but some insiders thought Green had \u201coverinterpreted\u201d Johnson\u2019s position and the party may yet opt for an explicitly no deal platform to maximise its support from leave voters. Centrist Tory MPs are worried about what would happen if the party had to fight an election before Brexit has happened, after being forced into a three-month extension by the Benn act. Publicly, Johnson will not concede this is a possibility because he insists Brexit will happen on 31 October but most MPs think this is the central scenario \u2013 that his government will have to submit to the delay, possibly following a court order, and then he will immediately challenge Labour to an election to be held in late November. Green and the other One Nation MPs demanded the meeting after a furious backlash among Conservative backbenchers against a briefing from an unnamed No 10 source that suggested the Tories would have to pivot to a no-deal position to outflank Farage. \u201cTo marginalise the Brexit party, we will have to fight the election on the basis of \u2018no more delays, get Brexit done immediately\u2019.\u201d Johnson told the centrist MPs at the meeting to \u201clisten to me, not the briefings\u201d, which is the same line he said to Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, when she raised the issue of the anonymous source messages in cabinet on Tuesday. The briefing in question is widely believed to have come from Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, who is driving his Brexit policy. Johnson\u2019s chief whip, Mark Spencer, and his parliamentary private secretary, James Heappey, have received a series of complaints in the past 24 hours from backbench MPs who say they cannot stand on a no-deal platform. Expectations that up to 50 Tories would choose not stand for their party at the next election in protest could be an underestimate, according to one source. They said the group of 80 One Nation Tories were extremely worried about the government\u2019s potential direction. One backbencher said: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much the only conversation taking place on the backbenches at the moment and it\u2019s going down very poorly. The whole One Nation group would struggle with it. I do not see that there\u2019s a democratic mandate based on a 52-48 referendum result for a no-deal Brexit. \u201cPeople are kicking off about it. I really don\u2019t see it\u2019s going to be the policy. It\u2019s a non-starter. There will be a haemorrhaging of Conservative members of parliament if this happens \u2013 they won\u2019t stand.\u201d Asked whether they would consider their own position, they said: \u201cYeah, I do feel like that.\u201d Another Tory MP said: \u201cThere is lots of worry. Many MPs don\u2019t agree conceptually with it. Others think it paints us as extreme and not friendly to floating voters.\u201d There are more than 100 MPs on the One Nation Tory WhatsApp group and many are said to have written comments critical of Johnson\u2019s potential strategy overnight. The MP said they could not stand back and accept such a position because the \u201cunion would unravel like a gyroscope\u201d and there would be a significant increase to the national debt. \u201cDo I want my kids in the playground being told by another kid that their mum or dad lost their job because of your parent?\u201d they said. Another backbencher said they did not believe Johnson would really pursue a no-deal Brexit and would simply go back to the public with a strategy of getting the deal done should he get a majority, and explain to voters that he would immediately overturn the Benn act, which compels him to request an extension to Brexit. \u201cI don\u2019t believe for a second we will have a policy of no deal,\u201d they said. The former Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve who now sits as an independent, described the No 10 memo sent to the Spectator as \u201cpropaganda\u201d. He said: \u201cThis is a government that is now no longer governing in the traditional sense \u2013 it is engaging in propaganda.\u201d He said the Benn act, which requires the PM to ask for an extension from the EU if there is no agreement by 19 October, remained watertight. Should Johnson try to get round it, he said the alliance of MPs campaigning against no deal were in a \u201creasonable place\u201d to counter him.",

Their fate was thrown into question by Trump\u2019s announcement that he would withdraw the 1,000 US special forces in the area, effectively removing the buffer that has stopped Turkey attacking the SDF. Ankara said the SDF is affiliated to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), which has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state since the 1980s. Trump\u2019s decision was widely criticised as a betrayal of the force that did the bulk of the ground fighting against Isis in Syria, and was one that risked new fighting in the eight-year-old war and could lead to Isis\u2019s resurgence. Isis has already claimed a twin suicide attack in the early hours of Wednesday in its former capital Raqqa, which killed and injured 25 people. SDF officials have repeatedly warned their camps and prisons are overflowing, calling on other countries to repatriate some 20,000 foreigners currently under their watch. Most facilities are chronically understaffed: during a July visit by the Guardian to al-Hawl, there were only 400 guards to keep order over about 70,000 people in the camp. A new alarm was raised over the poor security at al-Hawl and other camps and prisons after SDF spokesperson Mustafa Bali said earlier this week that some of the soldiers currently guarding Isis fighters and their families would be redeployed to the border area to fight off the anticipated Turkish attack. A source who often visits the camp said there were no signs that the SDF had redeployed any soldiers from al-Hawl, but nonetheless the camp was more volatile than usual. Violence at al-Hawl has ebbed and flowed since the camp became home to an unexpected influx of women and children after Isis was driven out of the remnants of its territorial \u201ccaliphate\u201d earlier this year. Riots are common, and at least one guard has died after being stabbed. Last week, an improvised explosive device was discovered there.

In the book, Catch and Kill, Farrow reports that Lauer, the longtime face of the NBC Today show, assaulted former NBC News employee Brooke Nevils at the Sochi Olympics. Nevils told Farrow that Lauer penetrated her in his hotel room, despite her repeatedly declining sex. Lauer, who was fired from NBC in November 2017 after the network received a complaint from one of his colleagues about inappropriate sexual behavior, denied the allegations in a statement, saying the report \u201cdefied common sense\u201d. The allegations in Farrow\u2019s book are the first time the specific rape accusation has been reported. Variety obtained a copy of the book ahead of its release on 15 October. In the book Farrow also alleges NBC News prevented him from publishing a story about alleged sexual abuse by former film executive Harvey Weinstein. Farrow ultimately published the story in the New Yorker in October 2017. Nevils told Farrow that she was covering the Sochi Olympics when Lauer invited her to his hotel room.

She was a fully enthusiastic and willing partner.\u201d Farrow writes that after Nevils reported the incident to NBC News, her \u201cwork life became torture\u201d. In a statement released on Wednesday, NBC News said it had acted swiftly after receiving a complaint in 2017. \u201cMatt Lauer\u2019s conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time. That\u2019s why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague,\u201d it said.",

      "bodyText": "Joey Barton, manager of Fleetwood Town, will stand trial after pleading not guilty to a charge of assaulting Daniel Stendel, his Barnsley counterpart, when the teams met in League One last season. Barton, 37, is alleged to have pushed Stendel from behind, leaving the German needing emergency dental treatment after banging his face on the metal framework of the tunnel at Oakwell. Barnsley made formal complaints to the English Football League and the Football Association after the incident, which came directly after a 4-2 win for Barnsley on 13 April. Stendel left the club earlier this week after a run of disappointing results. Barton appeared at Barnsley magistrates\u2019 court and denied a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He was given unconditional bail and will appear at Sheffield crown court next month for a hearing to prepare for a trial.",

In its toughest intervention to date, the central bank\u2019s financial policy committee (FPC) said digital currencies such as Libra would need to reach the same high standards as those of traditional payments. Threadneedle Street said the cryptocurrency had potential to become \u201csystemically important\u201d to the financial system, and that all parts of the ecosystem around Libra that would be needed to buy, hold and exchange the internet currency must meet its standards. Signalling its future treatment of Libra and other digital currencies that have the potential to become systemically important, it said the digital wallets used to hold them needed to be as resilient as traditional bank accounts. Facebook plans to launch its own digital wallet for holding Libra, known as Calibra. In practice, that would mean digital wallets enabled to hold Libra hitting standards that other cryptocurrencies have so far avoided. These include being part of the UK\u2019s financial services deposit protection scheme, holding capital to protect consumers and being subjected to central bank stress tests. In a warning to Facebook, the Bank\u2019s quarterly FPC assessment of emerging financial risks said: \u201cIf payment tokens were used widely to facilitate routine payments, they should have the same level of operational resilience and safeguarding as the use of debit cards to make payments from current accounts.\u201d The Bank said \u201cend-to-end operational and financial resilience\u201d was required across a payment chain, in a reflection that money transfers are only as safe as the weakest link they might pass through. \u201cThe resilience of the proposed Libra system would rely on the stability of not just the core elements of the Libra Association and Libra Reserve but also the associated critical activities conducted by other firms in the Libra ecosystem, such as validators, exchanges or wallet providers,\u201d the Bank said. The latest intervention came after PayPal became the first company to drop out of the Libra Association, the group of multinationals behind the digital currency, amid mounting regulatory concerns around the world. The French government has said it would block the development of Libra in the EU, while US regulators have suggested its financial underpinnings \u2013 which will involve pegging the value of one Libra against a basket of currencies held in reserve \u2013 could bring the project under the auspices of securities regulators.

Sperm\u2019s always been a worry for me, ever since the day of the 1978 FA Cup final. I\u2019ll spare you the goriest of the details, but the long and, er, short of it is that I fell off my bike going to my nan and grandad\u2019s house to watch the match and sustained serious injuries to my pudenda. Fifteen stitches were required to sew my boyhood up, but I made it home in time for kick off, which is all I cared about. I was only 11, after all.</p> <p>My parents had other worries. I don\u2019t know whether some doctor at casualty at Corbett hospital in Stourbridge had said anything, but they were concerned about how my fertility might be affected. Mercifully, having begat two children 20 years later, all seemed to be in fair working order. And almost 20 years after that, I found myself doing a radio item about the National Sperm Bank. This involved having my own stuff analysed. Having breezily agreed to do this, I found myself in a small room in a fertility clinic in London trying to conjure up a sample, with a colleague called Steve standing outside holding a microphone.</p> <p>\u201cNow,\u201d said the white-coated woman when I handed her the vessel, \u201cwhen I bring your results, are you sure you\u2019re OK for it to be recorded? Many men are sensitive about it.\u201d Why would I care? My procreating days were well behind me. Except suddenly I did care; the concern seemed to be hardwired, as if being pointlessly fertile constituted some meaningful measure of masculinity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/nov/24/sperm-donor-man-who-fathered-200-children\">\u2018I thought \u2013 who will remember me?\u2019: the man who fathered 200 children</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Silly really. My heart bled for the blokes who had struggled with this for real. How much anxiety must those walls have witnessed?</p> <p>It took ages for the woman to reappear. She had a studiedly neutral look on her face. \u201cCan I just check your age again?\u201d she said. She made a couple of notes and then announced that, for men of my age, the World Health Organization reckons 15m sperms per millilitre is the average. With deadpan authority she then told me I was rolling with no fewer than 32m of the things and they were quite active, or something. I felt great relief and, absurdly, no small amount of pride. I was walking an inch taller as I strode out of that clinic. And this feeling grew and grew all day.</p> <p>That evening I was on a long motorway drive. Anytime I overtook a female driver, I made sure my window was up, lest one of my 32m had slipped out earlier and was lurking around me looking for an egg to fertilise.</p> <p>However, it wasn\u2019t long before I was put in my place. During the course of the live show from the National Sperm Bank in Birmingham, I met a guy from Northfield, south of the city, who was one of the star donors. \u201cWhat kind of numbers you posting, mate?\u201d I asked airily, waiting to slap my 32m on the table between us. \u201cEighty-five million,\u201d he replied. Enough said. My sperm might not have that much going for them after all, but I\u2019ll say this much for my virility: anyone who can do a three-hour live show from a sperm bank must be doing something right.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I read that tomatoes might be good for a fella\u2019s sperm count. Sperm\u2019s always been a worry for me, ever since the day of the 1978 FA Cup final. I\u2019ll spare you the goriest of the details, but the long and, er, short of it is that I fell off my bike going to my nan and grandad\u2019s house to watch the match and sustained serious injuries to my pudenda. Fifteen stitches were required to sew my boyhood up, but I made it home in time for kick off, which is all I cared about. I was only 11, after all. My parents had other worries. I don\u2019t know whether some doctor at casualty at Corbett hospital in Stourbridge had said anything, but they were concerned about how my fertility might be affected. Mercifully, having begat two children 20 years later, all seemed to be in fair working order. And almost 20 years after that, I found myself doing a radio item about the National Sperm Bank. This involved having my own stuff analysed. Having breezily agreed to do this, I found myself in a small room in a fertility clinic in London trying to conjure up a sample, with a colleague called Steve standing outside holding a microphone. \u201cNow,\u201d said the white-coated woman when I handed her the vessel, \u201cwhen I bring your results, are you sure you\u2019re OK for it to be recorded? Many men are sensitive about it.\u201d Why would I care? My procreating days were well behind me. Except suddenly I did care; the concern seemed to be hardwired, as if being pointlessly fertile constituted some meaningful measure of masculinity. Silly really. My heart bled for the blokes who had struggled with this for real. How much anxiety must those walls have witnessed? It took ages for the woman to reappear. She had a studiedly neutral look on her face. \u201cCan I just check your age again?\u201d she said. She made a couple of notes and then announced that, for men of my age, the World Health Organization reckons 15m sperms per millilitre is the average. With deadpan authority she then told me I was rolling with no fewer than 32m of the things and they were quite active, or something. I felt great relief and, absurdly, no small amount of pride. I was walking an inch taller as I strode out of that clinic. And this feeling grew and grew all day. That evening I was on a long motorway drive. Anytime I overtook a female driver, I made sure my window was up, lest one of my 32m had slipped out earlier and was lurking around me looking for an egg to fertilise. However, it wasn\u2019t long before I was put in my place. During the course of the live show from the National Sperm Bank in Birmingham, I met a guy from Northfield, south of the city, who was one of the star donors. \u201cWhat kind of numbers you posting, mate?\u201d I asked airily, waiting to slap my 32m on the table between us. \u201cEighty-five million,\u201d he replied. Enough said. My sperm might not have that much going for them after all, but I\u2019ll say this much for my virility: anyone who can do a three-hour live show from a sperm bank must be doing something right.",

Without bail conditions \u2013 often requiring those under investigation to live at a particular address, avoid certain areas or people and report to a police station \u2013 being imposed, cases are being allowed to drift without fixed time limits, according to the Law Society. The Labour MP and shadow justice minister, Yasmin Qureshi, has used parliamentary questions to expose growing delays in processing rape, sexual violence and burglary cases. Figures show the average number of days for the Crown Prosecution Service to process rape allegations, from when the case was first referred to the CPS to completion, has lengthened from 321 in 2008-09 to 495 in 2018-19.

On a cultural level this has prevented clubs from tailoring the supporter experience \u2013 what should be every team\u2019s biggest recruitment tool. United\u2019s 15,000 seat facility is at least three full seasons away. Its timely delivery will be crucial to the prosperity of the enterprise.</p> <p>By then the A-League\u2019s newest concern should at least have a clear identity on the field. Squad building bears the hallmarks of Lou Sticca, one of the best connected operators in Australia. The headline-grabbing signings of Alessandro Diamanti and Panagiotis Kone ensure United will gain an instant level of recognition internationally, and they are recruits that come with cachet in Melbourne\u2019s large football-mad Italian and Greek communities.</p> <p>Establishing the club\u2019s culture has been part of Steve Horvat\u2019s remit as director of football. No staffer has fronted more microphones or been photographed shaking hands more often since the bid was announced than the 32-cap former Socceroo. And it makes sense. Horvat traverses the big stage and the grassroots in Melbourne\u2019s west as well as anybody. His playing career involved stints at Melbourne Knights, Sunshine George Cross and North Geelong Warriors, and he remains a resident in the club\u2019s catchment area, where he is an active contributor to the local football scene.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74d2a5e7d2167b74d270f52a19c01a00fe58bd17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74d2a5e7d2167b74d270f52a19c01a00fe58bd17/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alessandro Diamanti\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The signing of Alessandro Diamanti has piqued interest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Ross/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The addition of Mark Rudan as<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/23/new-a-league-club-western-united-confirm-mark-rudan-as-inaugural-coach\"> foundation head coach</a> is also logical. While Rudan may not be a Victorian product he is Australian and intimately aware of the specific local demands. Alongside Sticca and Horvat, Rudan\u2019s NSL background and uncompromising demeanour provides United with a blue collar sensibility, ensuring there is grit underpinning the grand designs and continental glamour.</p> <p>At Rudan\u2019s disposal will be some of the finest young Australian talent: players like Dylan Pierias, Apostolos Stamatelopoulos and Seb Pasquali. The latter, still only 19, could yet blossom into a once-in-a-generation talent after spending three years at Ajax\u2019s youth academy, one of the finest finishing schools in football.</p> <p>If the structural reasons alone weren\u2019t sufficient to draw you in, the visceral reaction United are likely to generate as they upset apple carts around the country provides the kind of spectacle competitions like the A-League thrive upon. Wellington Phoenix fans, for example, may have reason to dispute any positive sentiment towards Rudan, but their animosity also offers a rare incentive for the Australian football community to glance over the other side of the ditch. And nobody whips up an opposition crowd quite like Besart Berisha.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/08/a-league-2019-20-season-preview-team-by-team-guide\">A-League 2019-20 season preview: team-by-team guide</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If the building blocks for an A-League success story are apparent in Western United, the comparison with Orwell\u2019s pub is to provide a cautionary counterpoint. You see, the Moon Under Water <em>was</em> too good to be true. \u201cThat is to say, there may well be a pub of that name but I don\u2019t know of it, nor do I know any pub with just that combination of qualities,\u201d Orwell conceded.</p> <p>The stadium could be a game-changer, but it is yet to be built. Western Melbourne ticks the metric box but converting football fans into paying customers has long been the great unsolvable riddle of Australian football. Bigger marquee signings have come and gone without a legacy. And those (hopefully) future Socceroos are competing with a host of experienced professionals for minutes.</p> <p>The addition of an 11th team has provided this pre-season with a flicker of optimism and a nod to the A-League\u2019s future. Western United\u2019s progress will be studied with interest to see if the fantasy can become reality.</p>",

United\u2019s 15,000 seat facility is at least three full seasons away. Its timely delivery will be crucial to the prosperity of the enterprise. By then the A-League\u2019s newest concern should at least have a clear identity on the field. Squad building bears the hallmarks of Lou Sticca, one of the best connected operators in Australia. The headline-grabbing signings of Alessandro Diamanti and Panagiotis Kone ensure United will gain an instant level of recognition internationally, and they are recruits that come with cachet in Melbourne\u2019s large football-mad Italian and Greek communities. Establishing the club\u2019s culture has been part of Steve Horvat\u2019s remit as director of football. No staffer has fronted more microphones or been photographed shaking hands more often since the bid was announced than the 32-cap former Socceroo. And it makes sense. Horvat traverses the big stage and the grassroots in Melbourne\u2019s west as well as anybody. His playing career involved stints at Melbourne Knights, Sunshine George Cross and North Geelong Warriors, and he remains a resident in the club\u2019s catchment area, where he is an active contributor to the local football scene. The addition of Mark Rudan as foundation head coach is also logical. While Rudan may not be a Victorian product he is Australian and intimately aware of the specific local demands. Alongside Sticca and Horvat, Rudan\u2019s NSL background and uncompromising demeanour provides United with a blue collar sensibility, ensuring there is grit underpinning the grand designs and continental glamour. At Rudan\u2019s disposal will be some of the finest young Australian talent: players like Dylan Pierias, Apostolos Stamatelopoulos and Seb Pasquali. The latter, still only 19, could yet blossom into a once-in-a-generation talent after spending three years at Ajax\u2019s youth academy, one of the finest finishing schools in football. If the structural reasons alone weren\u2019t sufficient to draw you in, the visceral reaction United are likely to generate as they upset apple carts around the country provides the kind of spectacle competitions like the A-League thrive upon. Wellington Phoenix fans, for example, may have reason to dispute any positive sentiment towards Rudan, but their animosity also offers a rare incentive for the Australian football community to glance over the other side of the ditch. And nobody whips up an opposition crowd quite like Besart Berisha. If the building blocks for an A-League success story are apparent in Western United, the comparison with Orwell\u2019s pub is to provide a cautionary counterpoint. You see, the Moon Under Water was too good to be true. \u201cThat is to say, there may well be a pub of that name but I don\u2019t know of it, nor do I know any pub with just that combination of qualities,\u201d Orwell conceded. The stadium could be a game-changer, but it is yet to be built. Western Melbourne ticks the metric box but converting football fans into paying customers has long been the great unsolvable riddle of Australian football. Bigger marquee signings have come and gone without a legacy. And those (hopefully) future Socceroos are competing with a host of experienced professionals for minutes. The addition of an 11th team has provided this pre-season with a flicker of optimism and a nod to the A-League\u2019s future. Western United\u2019s progress will be studied with interest to see if the fantasy can become reality.",

      "bodyText": "Wallabies flanker David Pocock, along with Rugby World Cup teammates Bernard Foley and Dane Haylett-Petty, have announced their partnership with a scheme that aims to compensate for the carbon emissions associated with travel. Earlier this year, musician Heidi Lenffer, from Australian band Cloud Control, launched FEAT. (Future Energy Artists), an initiative that would allow Australian musicians to invest in a solar farm in south-east Queensland. Lenffer was concerned about the carbon emissions generated by her group\u2019s touring schedule and what she saw as her own contribution to the climate emergency. Now, FEAT. is opening up to other sectors and individuals. When FEAT. was announced, Pocock responded via Instagram \u2013 \u201che was putting enthusiastic emoji responses on a lot of our posts,\u201d Lenffer says \u2013 and contacted another songwriter, Jack River, who put the two of them in touch. \u201cAs an athlete, you\u2019re in a somewhat similar position to artists in that there\u2019s no escaping what you do requires travel, and I\u2019m very conscious of my personal contribution,\u201d says Pocock, who will captain the Wallabies in their final World Cup pool game against Georgia in Japan on Friday. \u201cTo see what FEAT. was doing, and to see people like Heidi getting on with it and trying to harness that energy into actually building the future we know is coming and we all want to see, but need to speed up, that was really exciting.\u201d Lenffer says that while FEAT. started and would always be identified with the musical community, she was keen for the scheme to expand and be inclusive. \u201cWe see allies in other industries as being critical to the success of what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d she says. Money invested in FEAT. is being used to buy ownership stakes in a solar farm called Brigalow, near the town of Pittsworth on the Darling Downs. The floor price for investment is low, just $5. The farm will power the equivalent of over 11,000 homes for 30 years. Pocock presented the scheme to his teammates, trying to impress upon them the carbon footprint of a major sporting tour. \u201cIt\u2019s like any slice of the population. There are some guys who were interested in it, others didn\u2019t really see it as an issue,\u201d he says. \u201cI just presented the guys with what FEAT. was doing, giving them an idea of the Wallabies\u2019 emissions this year and suggesting we team with them as a way of investing an equivalent amount into renewable energy.\u201d He convinced Foley and Haylett-Perry to come on board. \u201cThey\u2019re excited about seeing solutions to these problems that we\u2019re facing \u2026 It\u2019s ridiculous to think that changing lightbulbs and that sort of thing is enough. Those days are over. We need a big system change.\u201d Pocock has been a vocal campaigner about the climate emergency, and has extended that to direct action: in 2014, he was arrested in a protest against Whitehaven Coal\u2019s Maules Creek mine in northern New South Wales. He extended his support to the wave of school strikes started by Greta Thunberg. \u201cIf you look at social change, it very seldom just happens. It ends up taking a percentage of the population actually willing to give up their freedoms and engage in civil disobedience,\u201d he says. He also highlighted how global heating was already impacting on world sport, with a sharp message for rugby\u2019s governing bodies. \u201cI\u2019m not playing rugby in Australia next year, but round one of Super Rugby is in January next year,\u201d he says. \u201cCan you imagine, in the last weekend of January, playing 80 minutes of rugby?

Among those detained is Benham Satah, the Kurdish Iranian man who witnessed the murder of Reza Barati in 2014, and who was allegedly about to be transferred to Australia for care. Two months ago Papua New Guinean authorities arrested dozens of men who had been sent by Australia for refugee detention and processing, and confiscated phones and medication. They were taken to Bomana immigration detention centre, which is annexed to a prison facility in Port Moresby. The vast majority of those in Bomana are Iranian, and more than half are at some point along in the medevac process, having applied for it; been approved or refused; or were seeking reevaluation. The Australian government has confirmed that approvals for medevacs have been \u201ccommunicated\u201d to Port Moresby, but said the management of detainees inside Bomana is a matter for the PNG government. PNG\u2019s chief immigration officer did not respond to questions. The continued lack of transparency and communication has caused alarm among the men\u2019s families overseas, who have sought each other out for support and information. Guardian Australia has been told Satah was approved and was due to be flown to Australia just days before he was arrested, and his family are now scrambling for information. \u201cWe have been waiting for about seven years to hear good news about Benham and now we have not talked with him for more than a month,\u201d Satah\u2019s brother Omid told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe are extremely concerned about his situation because he is sick and needs medical treatment.

At that particular accommodation, the men were only allowed out for two hours every second day \u2013 far more restrictive than other places where men had much longer \u2013 or no \u2013 curfews. Satah, who is in his late 20s, says he has spent what should be \u201cthe best years of my life\u201d in some form of PNG/Australian detention. His mental health has deteriorated , and he suggested someone should film his daily medication routine, which would \u201ckill an elephant\u201d. Satah was one of the first men transferred to Bomana, evidently despite his pending transfer to Australia for treatment. \u201cAbsolutely no one who has been approved for medical transfer has been medically transferred from Bomana,\u201d the chief executive of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, Kon Karapanagiotides said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way any of these men are getting their medical needs met.

All 52 of the detained men been deemed not to be refugees, however at least 20 have never been properly assessed. Having refused to take part in the process in the first years of offshore processing, many are now asking to have their protection claims heard. Advocates, lawyers, and doctors have expressed increasing concern in recent weeks over the lack of information about the men held in Bomana, including their health.

      "body": "<p>My partner, Neil Hunter, who has died aged 86, was a hotelier and restaurateur dedicated to helping others.</p> <p>Born in Newcastle, he was the youngest of three children of Elsie (nee Stephens) and Richard, who owned a tobacconist\u2019s business. Neil won a scholarship from Westgate Hill primary to <a href=\"http://www.dameallans.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Dame Allan\u2019s school</a> in the city. His father died when he was three and Neil was always grateful for the influential mentors and teachers at Dame Allan\u2019s \u2013 and also for its excellent rugby programme. </p> <p>In 1950 he went to RAF Cranwell, Lincolnshire, to train as a pilot and was described as having \u201cgood combative ability\u201d. Eventually he realised that service life was not for him and asked to leave, which did not go down well. Neil\u2019s next move was into hotel management. This change of course included a spell at the Savoy in London, where he met and married Olga Jamieson, a PA to a hospital consultant. They moved to the Lake District, where Neil became manager of the Queen\u2019s hotel in Keswick, and had two daughters.</p> <p>In 1966 they started their own business, the Yew Tree restaurant in Borrowdale, which became hugely successful. Other ventures followed including a small art gallery, joint ownership of the Underscar hotel in Keswick, holiday properties and a partnership selling handcrafted cast-iron fires.

      "bodyText": "My partner, Neil Hunter, who has died aged 86, was a hotelier and restaurateur dedicated to helping others. Born in Newcastle, he was the youngest of three children of Elsie (nee Stephens) and Richard, who owned a tobacconist\u2019s business. Neil won a scholarship from Westgate Hill primary to Dame Allan\u2019s school in the city. His father died when he was three and Neil was always grateful for the influential mentors and teachers at Dame Allan\u2019s \u2013 and also for its excellent rugby programme. In 1950 he went to RAF Cranwell, Lincolnshire, to train as a pilot and was described as having \u201cgood combative ability\u201d. Eventually he realised that service life was not for him and asked to leave, which did not go down well. Neil\u2019s next move was into hotel management. This change of course included a spell at the Savoy in London, where he met and married Olga Jamieson, a PA to a hospital consultant. They moved to the Lake District, where Neil became manager of the Queen\u2019s hotel in Keswick, and had two daughters. In 1966 they started their own business, the Yew Tree restaurant in Borrowdale, which became hugely successful. Other ventures followed including a small art gallery, joint ownership of the Underscar hotel in Keswick, holiday properties and a partnership selling handcrafted cast-iron fires. Olga and Neil separated in 1989. Neil continued to pursue his interest in catering at the Lomond Country Inn, in Kinnesswood, Perthshire, with his nephew David. Neil and I had known each other for many years, and after we began a relationship he came to live with me in Worcester, in 1991, where we opened the Clockwatchers restaurant. He was a generous man who helped many employees to reach their full potential and always made time to work for the benefit of others. He was chair of a group that gained planning permission for the Theatre by the Lake in Keswick, was on the committee for the development of the outdoor adventure charity the Calvert Trust, based at Keswick and Kielder, and was also a board member of the English Touring Theatre. Rugby was an important part of Neil\u2019s life, at school, in the RAF and in Keswick. We both had season tickets for Gloucester Rugby. He was also political; holidays could never start fully until he had found an outlet selling the Guardian. He is survived by me, his daughters, Clare and Rebecca, and four grandchildren.",

Michael Gove?) might take over. That way Johnson could keep his promise about not requesting an article 50 extension himself.

The court was considering two cases. Here is an excerpt.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The first case was commenced in the outer house of the court of session for orders obliging the prime minister to comply with his duties under the Benn Act (a) to send a letter asking for an extension and (b) not to frustrate the Act by e.g. asking other member states to veto the UK\u2019s request for an extension.</p> \n   <p>On Monday the outer house <a href=\"https://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/docs/default-source/cos-general-docs/pdf-docs-for-opinions/2019csoh77.pdf?sfvrsn=0\">said</a> that Boris Johnson: \u201cis subject to the obligations of the [Benn] Act; (b) in the event of neither of the conditions in section 1(1) or (2) being satisfied, the first respondent will comply with section 1(4) no later than 19 October 2019; and (c) that he will not frustrate the purpose of the [Benn] Act or the purpose of any of its provisions. In other words, there can be no doubt that the first respondent now accepts that he must comply with the requirements of the [Benn] Act and has affirmed that he intends to do so.\u201d</p> \n   <p>If Boris Johnson adheres to these statements the entire purpose of the litigation \u2013 that a man elected from 160,000 members of the Conservative party should comply with a law enacted by 46 million elected \u2013 will be satisfied.</p> \n   <p>The second case was commenced in the inner house asking the court, if the prime minister (a) fails to send (as required by section 1 of the Benn Act) the letter asking for an extension or (b) fails to agree an extension offered by the EU (as required by section 3 of the Benn Act), to complete those acts itself.</p> \n   <p>And earlier this morning the inner house held the cases over to 21 October \u2013 the first working day after the prime minister\u2019s obligation to send the Benn Act letter expires. So if the facts do require it, it can make appropriate orders against the prime minister.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d9db3378f083d8b3b9d88b0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-09T10:16:40.962Z\">11.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Scottish court postpones decision on whether to intervene to force Boris Johnson to comply with Benn Act</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Press Association has just snapped this.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Judges at Scotland\u2019s highest civil court will not rule on a legal bid aimed at forcing the prime minister to send a letter requesting a Brexit extension if no withdrawal deal is reached by October 19 until after that date. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d9db2638f083d8b3b9d88a1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-09T10:14:53.832Z\">11.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The proportion of live births in England and Wales to women born outside the UK has fallen for the first time in nearly three decades, the Press Association reports.

Here are five for starters.</p> \n  <p><strong>1) MPs would have to vote for the Saturday session to go ahead in the first place</strong>. The government has been wary of scheduling timetable votes because, unless they have opposition agreement, they tend to lose (which is why the Commons sat during the Tory conference), and it is possible that the Speaker could allow any vote to be hijacked by a move allowing backbenchers control of the Commons timetable.</p> \n  <p><strong>2) If Johnson wants to force MPs to choose between delaying Brexit and a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, he is likely to find that they take the same decision they did when the passed the Benn Act, which effectively ruled out the no-deal option. </strong>That passed its second reading by a majority of 29.</p> \n  <p><strong>3) Any other attempt to get MPs to make a forced choice could fail - because parliamentary procedure does not work like that.</strong> According to the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/09/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-plans-emergency-saturday-sitting-of-parliament-after-eu-summit-live-news?page=with:block-5d9d8d228f084ab8417353fa#block-5d9d8d228f084ab8417353fa\">9.14am), </a>Johnson is interested in the idea of forcing MPs to make a choice - perhaps between a no-deal Brexit and revoking article 50 (ie, cancelling Brexit). But parliament does not have a system for allowing MPs to vote either/or on a proposition. MPs just vote on motions, which they either pass or reject. In practice, MPs would almost certainly vote against no deal, and against revoking article 50.</p> \n  <p><strong>4) Forcing MPs to make a choice could lead to them uniting behind an alternative PM. </strong>Johnson does not have a majority in the Commons, but he has not been replaced because opposition MPs and rebel Tories (who now sit as independents) cannot agree on who could lead an interim government in his place. This seems unlikely to change, although under pressure anything is possible. It is very, very hard to imagine Labour backing anyone other than Jeremy Corbyn as leader of an interim government, but Corbyn himself has not explicitly ruled this out.</p> \n  <p><strong>5) Johnson insists he will not ask for a Brexit delay, even though the Benn Act would require him to, but he also claims he would obey the law.</strong> He has failed to explain how he would resolve this contradiction. His advisers seem to think that the authority of the referendum somehow overrides the authority of parliament, but by summoning parliament to meet on Saturday 19 October, possibly only a few days ahead of a supreme court hearing about the Benn Act, it might make it harder for Johnson to argue that he can legitimately bypass what parliament wants.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d9d9be38f081108db9c4db4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-09T08:39:18.971Z\">9.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>According to<a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/about/faqs/house-of-commons-faqs/business-faq-page/\"> the House of Commons website,</a> the Commons has only sat on Saturdays four times since 1939.</p> \n  <p>Three of those sittings were prompted by way or military conflict: 2 September 1939 (the day before Britain declared war on Germany); 3 November 1956 (the Suez crisis); and 3 April 1982 (the invasion of the Falklands). </p> \n  <p>The other took place on 30 July 1949, when the last sitting before the summer recess was on a Saturday.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has promised centrist Conservative MPs he will not go into an election arguing for a no-deal Brexit and would never make a pact with Nigel Farage. MPs are heading for a Brexit showdown as they will be called to sit for a special parliamentary session on Saturday 19 October \u2013 less than two weeks before Britain\u2019s scheduled departure from the EU. Michel Barnier has called on Boris Johnson to rein in the Downing Street aides responsible for attacking the German chancellor this week as the EU doubled down on its rejection of the prime minister\u2019s proposals. Pro-remain campaigners are preparing to launch contempt proceedings against Boris Johnson if he attempts to renege on promises to seek an extension to Brexit. Boris Johnson could be summoned by the London assembly after failing to provide details of his contact with a US businesswoman and explain how any potential conflict of interest was addressed. Sir John Sawers, a former head of MI6, has said Brexit negotiations have got to \u201can extraordinarily damaging state\u201d because unnamed Downing Street officials have been briefing that the UK might withdraw security cooperation with the EU. Two million people have asked to stay in the UK after Brexit under the government\u2019s EU settlement scheme, latest figures show. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here is my colleague Severin Carrell\u2019s story on the Scottish court of session postponing a decision on whether to intervene to force Boris Johnson to comply with the Benn act requiring him to request a Brexit delay in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The full text of the judgment is here. These are from the lawyer Jolyon Maugham, one of the people who took the issue to court. And this is from the SNP MP Joanna Cherry, who took these cases to court alongside Maugham and the businessman Dale Vince. Cherry said: This decision is a victory for the petitioners and everyone who wants the Tory government to obey the law, and call for an extension, so we can avoid a devastating no-deal Brexit. As a result of this vital court action, the Tory government has been forced to concede the prime minister will comply with the law, and promise to send a letter requesting a Brexit extension. Crucially, he has also had to admit that he will not frustrate the purpose of the Benn act. The court\u2019s decision is a clear signal it will keep a watch on Boris Johnson\u2019s actions \u2013 and is holding a sword of Damocles over him in case he breaks his promise. The Tory prime minister must obey the law and call for an extension, or face the consequences \u2013 including the ability for Scotland\u2019s supreme court to force a request for an extension. A YouGov analysis of 300 surveys shows firm evidence that Britain has turned against Brexit since 2016, according to a report by Nicholas Cecil in the Evening Standard. Cecil says: One of the most striking findings is that 204 out of 226 polls since July 2017 have shown remain ahead, with just seven for leave, and 15 ties. So far this year, just one poll in the series has put Leave ahead, compared to 74 for staying in the EU. The Scottish government has produced an interactive Brexit vulnerabilities map, showing which parts of Scotland would lose out most from Brexit. There is a news release about it here, and the map is here. Rural areas and islands are most at risk, it says. Earlier I referred to today\u2019s Sun story quoting unnamed No 10 sources (them again) saying that Boris Johnson thought there was a reason why he would be able to stay PM, even if he lost a confidence vote in the Commons and MPs wanted someone else to head a government. (See 12.38pm.) If you are interested in the rights and wrongs of this argument, there is a good Twitter thread on this from Philippe Lagass\u00e9, a professor at a Canadian university and a specialist in Westminster politics. It starts here. And here is his conclusion. If you want to know more about the origins of the Lascelles principles (named after Sir Alan Lascelles, private secretary to George VI, who set them out in a letter to the Times using the pseudonym Senex, this thread, by Catherine Haddon from the Institute for Government, is worth reading. Boris Johnson has promised centrist Conservative MPs he will not go into an election arguing for a no-deal Brexit and would never make a pact with Nigel Farage. Damian Green, the leader of the One Nation group of 80 Tory MPs, told the Guardian that Johnson \u201clooked [him] in the eye\u201d as he pledged that he party will not shift to endorsing a no-deal Brexit as the Conservatives\u2019 central policy. Green said he believed Johnson\u2019s reassurances, after he and Gillian Keegan, James Brokenshire and Victoria Prentis all met the prime minister in Downing Street to deliver the message that large numbers of Tory MPs would find a no-deal policy \u201cunacceptable\u201d. Green said: We went in to say that no deal as the prime aim of government policy would be unacceptable in a manifesto and we were reassured that wasn\u2019t the prime minister\u2019s aim, that he still wants to get a deal now and still thinks that would be the best outcome. He has no intention of putting a no-deal policy in a manifesto. This arose from a meeting of the one nation caucus earlier in the week. It was the principle point and we also wanted to be assured again that the Conservative party wouldn\u2019t do a deal with the Brexit party. We looked each other in the eye. I accept and believe the reassurances. We accept that no deal has to be a possibility and the one nation caucus has by and large always been supportive of the government\u2019s policy. What we want is for that to continue. Centrist Tory MPs are worried about what would happen if the party had to fight an election before Brexit has happened, after being forced into a three-month extension by the Benn act. Publicly, Johnson will not concede this is a possibility because he insists Brexit will happen on 31 October but most MPs think this is the most likely scenario \u2013 that his government will have to submit to the delay, possibly following a court order, and then he will immediately challenge Labour to an election to be held in late November. In the debate in the European parliament the Brexit party MEP Belinda de Lucy strongly criticised David Sassoli, the European parliament\u2019s president, for discussing Brexit with John Bercow, the Commons Speaker. (See 3.53pm.) She said that this showed Sassoli was directly intervening in the UK\u2019s domestic politics and that he was trying to stop Brexit. \u201cIt is immoral - shame on you,\u201d she said. Guy Verfhofstadt, the liberal MEP and former Belgian PM who chairs the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group, told De Lucy that it was ridiculous for her accuse MEPs of being undemocratic when her own party was not represented in the UK parliament. He also criticised Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan, saying: I will be less diplomatic than Michel Barnier. I think that the proposal that Boris Johnson has put forward was not serious at all. Not serious at all because it was in fact a virtual proposal. It was not a real proposal. It gives a veto to the DUP in a number of issues. It is putting customs facilities, not on the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, but in all the other parts of the island of Ireland that we don\u2019t know yet. And finally the proposal is to downgrade the political declaration on the future relationship by undercutting, by making a Singapore-at-the-sea, at the North Sea, like the [Brexit party], by in fact destroying the ecological social and labour standards. Here are some of the key quotes from the European parliament hearing. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, criticised the UK government for engaging in a \u201cblame game\u201d. He said Brexit was the choice of the British people. He went on: Although we are respecting that choice. As it stands, we will remain in discussion with the United Kingdom on the terms of its departure. And, personally, I don\u2019t exclude a deal. We are, Michel [Barnier] and myself, working on a deal. And we are not accepting this blame game, which started in London. Juncker said the British should not forget the need for the European parliament to agree any Brexit deal. I would like to repeat, to the attention of our British friends, that there is not only a parliament in Westminster which has to agree, there is a parliament here. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said an agreement was not currently possible. He said: To put things very frankly, though, and to try and be objective, this particular point, we are not really in a position where we are able to find an agreement. David Sassoli, president of the European parliament, said that any Brexit extension should be to allow the British public to express their views - either through an election, or a referendum. He also revealed that he had discussed Brexit with the Commons Speaker, John Bercow. (See 2.45pm.) Tytti Tuppurainen, the Finnish Europe minister, said that a no-deal Brexit was a \u201cdangerously realistic\u201d scenario. (See 2.51pm.) This is from my colleague Rowena Mason. Obviously, this does not mean Boris Johnson has given up trying to take the UK out of the EU on 31 October. It means that, if Brexit does get extended against his wishes, and he has to fight an election, he says he will not campaign on a Brexit party-style no-deal platform, as an unnamed No 10 insider (almost universally assumed to be Dominic Cummings) told the Spectator earlier this week. Michel Barnier has now finished. Here is some comment on what he had to say. From the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming From Mail Online\u2019s James Tapsfield From RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly Barnier says there are other issues dividing the two sides, including what to put in the political declaration. He says there is a risk of having just a very basic free trade agreement. That might involve tax dumping and social regulation dumping (ie, the UK trying to undercut the EU.) He says the EU wants a fair and level playing field. He says, when Brexit happens, it will be long term. He says it is creating serious and specific problems. We need operational, legally-binding solutions \u2013 today, not tomorrow. He says the EU will remain calm, vigilant and constructive. And he says it will be respectful of the UK and its leaders. He says he will be available 24/7 in the coming days to try to reach an agreement. He will respect his mandate, he says. He says it might be \u201cvery difficult\u201d. But, he goes on: If there is goodwill on both sides, I think an agreement is still possible. Barnier turns to his third point - the consent mechanism. He says the EU wants a more important role for the Northern Irish institutions. He says the UK plan would involve a unilateral decision being taken by the Northern Irish authorities. That means they could unilaterally decide not to introduce these arrangements. Barnier turns to the second issue. There must be operational solutions, he says. He says the UK plan does not give the same security as the backstop, because it relies on ideas being worked out during the transition. The UK proposes having a joint committee to find solutions during the transition. But what happens if it can\u2019t? The UK or the EU would then have to impose unilateral checks. But what would happen if the UK did not enforce any checks? He says the UK plan has led to three concerns. First, the border issue. Boris Johnson has rejected the backstop, a safety net agreed with Theresa May, he says. He says the UK and the EU agree on regulatory alignment for goods in Northern Ireland. But there is a dispute about customs. The EU wanted a backstop to avoid border checks. But the UK is asking the EU to accept a system that has not been properly tested, relying on exemptions and derogations and technology that has not been properly tested. He says the EU needs the integrity of the single market and customs union, and proper checks. There must be credible controls, he says. The single market must be credible to consumers and companies. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, is speaking now. He says the UK have a competent and professional negotiating team. But he says the two sides are not in a position to reach an agreement. Time is pressing, he says. Juncker turns to Brexit. He says it was the choice of the UK. He says he is not ruling out a deal. And he does not accept this blame game, \u201cwhich started in London\u201d. He says he would like to repeat, for the sake of the British, that the European parliament would have to approve a Brexit deal, as well as the UK parliament. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, is speaking now. He starts with non-Brexit issues. He is currently talking about EU enlargement (the opposite of Brexit). Tuppurainen says the UK crashing out of the EU is a \u201cdangerously realistic\u201d scenario, she says. She says EU leaders will have to take stock at the summit. Tytti Tuppurainen, the Finnish Europe minister, is speaking now. Finland has the rotating presidency of the EU. She is covering the non-Brexit issues coming up at the summit. And she says the UK plans do not yet provide a basis for an agreement. But the EU will continue to work with UK to get an agreement, she says. Sassoli says MEPs do not want to see no deal. And MEPs want to uphold the rights of citizens. He says he spoke to John Bercow, the Speaker, today. He says any request for an extension should allow the British people to give their views \u2013 either in an election or a referendum. He says he and Bercow agreed on the importance of parliament. David Sassoli, the president of the European parliament, starts by telling MEPs about his talks with Boris Johnson yesterday. He says \u201cnot much progress\u201d has been made since the European parliament last debated this. He says the parliament\u2019s approach is simple; it thinks an orderly exit is the best outcome. But the parliament \u201cwill not accept an agreement at any cost\u201d. It will not accept anything that threatens the Good Friday agreement and the peace process, and the integrity of the single market. He says he told Johnson that the UK plans were not seen by MEPs as \u201ca basis that would allow us to reach an agreement\u201d. MEPs wanted \u201coperable\u201d ideas, he says. After some preliminary business, the European parliament is now starting to talk about next week\u2019s EU summit. David Sassoli, the president of the European parliament, is opening the session now. The European parliament\u2019s plenary session is about to start. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, and Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, are there. They will be updating MEPs on Brexit. There is a live feed here. Here are two stories about splits in the Conservative party around today that are worth flagging up. Sebastian Payne in the Financial Times (paywall) says at least 50 Conservative MPs would revolt against a general election manifesto that pledged to pursue a no-deal Brexit. Scores of Tory MPs oppose the idea and some are considering running on a softer individual Brexit platform or even standing aside as a Conservative candidate. One minister predicted that \u201cat least 50 colleagues could not back no-deal, including several in the cabinet\u201d. Another said: \u201cSo much depends on the language but for me there has to be at least a nod to getting a deal.\u201d Those MPs who would find a manifesto containing a purely no-deal Brexit policy problematic to support include culture secretary Nicky Morgan, justice secretary Robert Buckland and Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith. Damian Green, leader of the One Nation caucus of approximately 60 moderate Tory MPs, is due to lead a delegation to meet Boris Johnson on Wednesday. They are expected to tell the prime mister they cannot support a manifesto based on pursuing a no-deal Brexit. This reaction was prompted by the anonymous No 10 briefing to the Spectator on Monday night saying the Tories would fight the next election on a no-deal platform. Alex Wickham at BuzzFeed says a rift has opened up at the top of Boris Johnson\u2019s government between advisers loyal to the prime minister\u2019s controversial chief aide Dominic Cummings and other senior Johnson allies. The key dividing line is between the Vote Leave grouping which sees leaving the EU as the end goal and is willing to achieve it by any means necessary, and a group of advisers led by [Edward] Lister who see Johnson\u2019s administration as a long-term project beyond Brexit, multiple government sources told BuzzFeed News. The Cummings faction \u2013 which crucially retains the support of the prime minister and forms his inner circle \u2013 is determined to secure an election and produce a hardline pitch to leave voters which seeks to nullify Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party and blame the EU for the breakdown in negotiations, if it cannot agree a deal with Brussels or keep the PM\u2019s promise to deliver Brexit by 31 October. The Vote Leavers hope that an uncompromising Brexit pitch would deliver a majority and that Johnson could then take the UK out of the EU without a deal, or offer Brussels new terms less attractive than his current proposal. A Tory election campaign against the Brexit party would have to harden its position on any future agreement with the EU, offering a reduced Brexit bill and rejecting European court of justice involvement overseeing citizens\u2019 rights, as well as no compromise on the backstop, a government official said. Jeremy Corbyn has said the opposition might try to legislate again to ensure that Boris Johnson complies with the Benn act requiring him to request a Brexit extension in the event of no deal. Responding to the news that Johnson intends to hold a sitting of parliament on Saturday 19 October, Corbyn said: The prime minister has an opportunity on the 19th to announce that he has obeyed the law, signed the letter, and sent it off to Brussels to ask for the extension which will give us time to work out a sensible relationship with Europe. The idea that the prime minister will break the law yet again is something that needs to be borne in mind here. We will do everything we can in parliament, including legislating if necessary, to ensure that parliament makes that application to obey the EU No 2 Act [ie, the Benn act], which is the one that prevents us going into a no-deal crash-out on 31 October. Corbyn also said that in the event of Boris Johnson losing a confidence vote, he should be the person invited to form a government. He said: A caretaker government would be one appointed on the basis that the government has collapsed and the leader of the opposition is invited to form an administration. When this government collapses I will accept that invitation and form an administration solely for the purposes of preventing a crash-out. There is no process other than the leader of the opposition being invited to form that government and that\u2019s what we will follow. Corbyn was speaking to the media on a visit to a wind turbine plant in Southampton, where he was promoting Labour\u2019s plans to create 70,000 offshore windfarm jobs. And this is what Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (PM), told the Irish parliament about the anonymous briefing from Number 10 criticising him. He said: To be honest, I don\u2019t want to give much response to anonymous briefings of that nature. I don\u2019t think much of an anonymous briefing whether they come from Downing Street or if they come from my own ranks, quite frankly. Sammy Wilson, the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, has said that his party would not accept the proposal floated in the Times today (see 11.41am) for a change to the consent mechanism applying to the new version of the Northern Ireland backstop. Under the government\u2019s plans these arrangements would only come into force if the Northern Ireland assembly voted in favour, which in practice would give the DUP a veto. Under an alternative plan reportedly being considered by the EU, the arrangements would apply unless both factions in the assembly \u2013 unionists and nationalists \u2013 voted to end them. Wilson said this proposal was not surprising, but that it had already been rejected by the UK government. Parliament has been clear that such proposals would never be approved. It is not a serious proposal and should not be treated as such. It is a non-runner. Whilst the United Kingdom government has put forward sensible and realistic proposals, it is disappointing that the European Union has retreated to its previous failed plans. This proposal not only rewrites but actually turns the Belfast agreement\u2019s consent mechanism on its head. The United Kingdom must leave the European Union as one country and any decision to enter into regulatory alignment must have the consent of both unionists and nationalists. Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (PM) has told the Irish parliament that the British government\u2019s Brexit stance is causing \u201cgreat difficulty\u201d. He explained: Part of the difficulty at the moment is the position of the UK government, that Northern Ireland must leave the EU customs union and must be part of the UK customs union no matter what the people of Northern Ireland think. That\u2019s their position at the moment and that\u2019s one that is a great difficulty for us because the position of the British government is that the UK must leave the European Union and Northern Ireland must come out of the customs union, whether they like it or not. That creates huge difficulties for us because we want there to be a deal that respects the wishes of the people of Northern Ireland, and indeed the people in this republic too. Here is the Press Association story about the hustings held at Westminster earlier today for the candidates who want to replace John Bercow as Speaker. John Bercow has been described as a \u201cplayground bully\u201d by an MP running to replace him as Commons speaker. Shailesh Vara said he believe Bercow has \u201ctarnished the role of Speaker with his biasness\u201d and said he insults and demeans his colleagues. The nine MPs who have put themselves forward to replace Bercow as Speaker took part in a hustings event in Westminster. Vara was joined by Sir Henry Bellingham, Chris Bryant, Harriet Harman, Meg Hillier, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Dame Eleanor Laing, Sir Edward Leigh and Rosie Winterton. Candidates were asked about Bercow and impartiality, and Vara said: \u201cNo, Speaker Bercow has not been impartial. \u201cAnd frankly speaking, I think he\u2019s tarnished the role of the Speaker with his biasness.\u201d He added: \u201cI would say one other thing that recently we\u2019ve had a lot of debate about the standards of MPs in the Commons. \u201cAnd given that Speaker Bercow has at times behaved like a verbal playground bully in the way that he treats his colleagues, he insults them, demeans them. \u201cI hope that he loses all authority to lecture to MPs as to how they should behave when his own behaviour is in question. \u201cSo I think that the Speaker should always be courteous and polite, authoritative, yes, but not demeaning to his colleagues.\u201d Bellingham said he thought Bercow had been a \u201cfantastic\u201d Speaker, but added: \u201cThe problem with John Bercow is that many of the excellent work he\u2019s done has been impaired by, A, having favourites, I think, in some ways. \u201cAnd, B, too often grandstanding remarks that frankly are a waste of space and time.\u201d Bryant, who wants to be \u201can umpire, not a player\u201d, said of the Speaker role: \u201cI think having an impartial Speaker is absolutely essential to the good functioning of our democracy.\u201d Harman said the role was to be the \u201cchampion of parliament in our parliamentary democracy\u201d, adding: \u201cAnd that\u2019s not them being neutral or impartial, it\u2019s being absolutely a champion of parliament.\u201d Leigh said Bercow is \u201cperceived by a large part of the nation not to be impartial\u201d and said the next Speaker needs to be \u201cmore in the mould\u201d of former speaker Betty Boothroyd. The election of the next Commons speaker will take place on 4 November, after Bercow, who has held the office since 2009, takes the chair for the final time on 31 October. Britain would still have to pay into the EU budget until the end of next year even if it leaves without a deal on 31 October, G\u00fcnther Oettinger, the EU budget commissioner, has said. Speaking at a news conference in Brussels he said the UK was fully signed up to the EU budget for 2020 - its final year of EU contributions. Even if the UK refused to pay up immediately, the EU would recover its money \u201cat a later stage\u201d, he said. He explained: In the 2020 draft budget, the UK is a full partner with all rights and obligations in terms of monies paid and monies received and that is how we understand the law. If the British are not prepared to pay, we are sure we will get the money at a later stage but not immediately. Boris Johnson has often said that if the UK were to leave the EU without a deal, it would no longer have to pay the \u00a339bn owed under the withdrawal agreement. But even though the exact formula used to decide the UK\u2019s legal obligations in that agreement would no longer be agreed between the two parties, British government officials admit that the UK would still owe a very considerable sum to the EU. There has been some interesting speculation in the comments about what might happen at the emergency Saturday sitting of parliament planned for 19 October. Here are two of the more intriguing questions, with my replies. Could Boris Johnson use the sitting to hold a confidence vote? Yes, he could. But even if he won a confidence vote, and argued that that vote effectively overturned the Benn Act (and it is almost impossible to imagine him winning a vote on that basis), the Benn Act would still be law. Until it gets repealed or amended, it still stands. If he lost the confidence vote, under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act MPs would have 14 days to pass a confidence motion in another administration. If that did not happen, there would be an election - with polling day after 31 October. But the Benn Act would still stand - and so there would be no guarantee of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. And Johnson would also be taking the risk that parliament would choose an alternative PM during that 14-day period. The Sun today is running a story saying some in No 10 think that, even in these circumstances, Johnson could remain in office. But experts are extremely sceptical. These are from Charlie Falconer, the former Labour lord chancellor. Could Johnson resign as PM? This is a possibility. People do not normally give up the office of PM voluntarily, but precedent has long since ceased to a reliable guide to what might happen in the Brexit saga. One option would be to resign as a government, and to invite the Queen to make Jeremy Corbyn, or someone else prime minister, on the assumption that Johnson could then get back into power after an election fought on a \u201cBrexit betrayal\u201d platform. But this would be extraordinary risky. Even a PM without a majority has considerable power at his or her disposal (particularly over spending and patronage), and it is quite possible that Corbyn could negotiate a Brexit outcome more acceptable to the public than Johnson\u2019s. Another option would be to resign as prime minister on the basis that another Tory willing to request an article 50 extension (Dominic Raab? Michael Gove?) might take over. That way Johnson could keep his promise about not requesting an article 50 extension himself. But presumably he would only do this if he were confident that the replacement PM would stand aside for him again at some point in the future. That might also be a very risky assumption. Once people get appointed PM, they tend to want to stay. The People\u2019s Vote campaign, which wants a second referendum, says an emergency Saturday sitting on 19 October would give supporters even more of a reason to attend its march in London on the same day. It is put out this statement from the Labour MP Jess Phillips, who backs the campaign. She said: The 19th of October was already set to be a historic day, with hundreds of thousands of people coming to London to demand that the final decision on Brexit is not made by Boris Johnson but by all of us. With the news that Boris Johnson is planning an emergency session of parliament on the same day, there could not be a more important moment for everyone who cares about our country and our future to march, and to insist that we are all given the final say. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, will be giving MEPs an update on the Brexit talks this afternoon alongside Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission. Speaking to Sky News this morning, Barnier said he thought a deal would be \u201cvery difficult, but possible\u201d. He confirmed that the technical talks were carrying on and that he would be having a working lunch with Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, tomorrow. In what seemed a dig at London, and the unattributable briefings hostile to Angela Merkel that were coming out of Downing Street yesterday, he said: The EU will remain calm, vigilant, respectful - respectful - and constructive. Asked if a deal was still possible, he replied: I think the deal is possible and very difficult, but possible. The leader of Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland has said that reports that the EU would replace a Stormont veto on future Brexit arrangements was a non-starter. Michelle O\u2019Neill told Sky News that the devolved assembly should not have any role in the final deal whether the voting system allowed for a veto or not. \u201cLet\u2019s just rule that out. It\u2019s never going to happen,\u201d she said. She added there was \u201cno situation\u201d in which the local assembly can have the final say. Such decisions on constitutional matters had to be taken by governments, not regional assemblies she said. Under Boris Johnson\u2019s proposal Stormont would have the final say on this next year and every four years thereafter. But because of a particular voting mechanism in Stormont designed to ensure no one community can vote for something that would be harmful to another, there was concern that this could hand a de factor veto to the Democratic Unionist party. According to the Times (paywall), the EU is now suggesting eliminating concerns by creating a new requirement that there would have to be a \u201cdouble majority\u201d in Stormont - ie both Sinn Fein and the DUP would have to agree to future arrangements. Sinn Fein\u2019s objection is that such a role for Stormont would plunge Northern Ireland into a unwelcome constitutional crisis every four years. One source said: The institutions are already fragile and to add this into the mix is unwelcome and will destabilise the institutions further and threaten the Good Friday Agreement. They are just not plausible. Other parties including the SDLP and the Ulster Unionist party made the same point to Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith in face-to-face meetings on Friday. UUP leader Robin Swann said on Friday: Northern Ireland would be locked into continual political debates about Brexit and alignment with the rest of the UK or EU. They would set the theme of every Assembly and Westminster election. It plunges Northern Ireland into a referendum in the Assembly Chamber every four years with high stakes consequences for our people. It will keep our businesses and agri-food sector in a perpetual cycle of uncertainty. An emergency sitting of parliament on Saturday 19 October would coincide with what is expected to be a large People\u2019s Vote rally in London, Anna Soubry, the leader of the Independent Group for Change MPs, points out. In a blog for the Good Law Project\u2019s website, the lawyer Jolyon Maugham has published a clear summary of what has happened in the Scottish court of session hearing about the Benn Act. The court was considering two cases. Here is an excerpt. The first case was commenced in the outer house of the court of session for orders obliging the prime minister to comply with his duties under the Benn Act (a) to send a letter asking for an extension and (b) not to frustrate the Act by e.g. asking other member states to veto the UK\u2019s request for an extension. On Monday the outer house said that Boris Johnson: \u201cis subject to the obligations of the [Benn] Act; (b) in the event of neither of the conditions in section 1(1) or (2) being satisfied, the first respondent will comply with section 1(4) no later than 19 October 2019; and (c) that he will not frustrate the purpose of the [Benn] Act or the purpose of any of its provisions. In other words, there can be no doubt that the first respondent now accepts that he must comply with the requirements of the [Benn] Act and has affirmed that he intends to do so.\u201d If Boris Johnson adheres to these statements the entire purpose of the litigation \u2013 that a man elected from 160,000 members of the Conservative party should comply with a law enacted by 46 million elected \u2013 will be satisfied. The second case was commenced in the inner house asking the court, if the prime minister (a) fails to send (as required by section 1 of the Benn Act) the letter asking for an extension or (b) fails to agree an extension offered by the EU (as required by section 3 of the Benn Act), to complete those acts itself. And earlier this morning the inner house held the cases over to 21 October \u2013 the first working day after the prime minister\u2019s obligation to send the Benn Act letter expires. So if the facts do require it, it can make appropriate orders against the prime minister. The Press Association has just snapped this. Judges at Scotland\u2019s highest civil court will not rule on a legal bid aimed at forcing the prime minister to send a letter requesting a Brexit extension if no withdrawal deal is reached by October 19 until after that date. The proportion of live births in England and Wales to women born outside the UK has fallen for the first time in nearly three decades, the Press Association reports. Some 28.2% of births in 2018 were to women not born in the UK, down slightly on 28.4% in 2017. It is the first year-on-year decrease since 1990, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). In total, just over a third (33.8%) of babies born in England and Wales in 2018 had at least one parent who was born outside the UK, the Press Association reports. This was also a small decrease on the previous year. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, will be in Brussels tomorrow for a meeting with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Downing Street has announced. It is being described as more of a stocktaking exercise than as a sign that progress is being made. Two million people have asked to stay in the UK after Brexit under the government\u2019s EU settlement scheme, my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll reports. Here full story is here. And here is the Home Office report (pdf) with the figures. Thank you to all of those who responded to my question about the 1949 Saturday sitting. I have updated the post at 9.39am to include some of them. To get the update to appear, you may need to refresh the page. If you want to know what Boris Johnson\u2019s message to parliament would be on Saturday 19 October, in the event of the UK and the EU failing to agree a Brexit deal at the summit ending the day before, this probably sums it up quite well. But there do seem to be quite a few problems with the notion that an emergency Saturday sitting of parliament on 19 October could give Johnson a means of resolving this crisis. Here are five for starters. 1) MPs would have to vote for the Saturday session to go ahead in the first place. The government has been wary of scheduling timetable votes because, unless they have opposition agreement, they tend to lose (which is why the Commons sat during the Tory conference), and it is possible that the Speaker could allow any vote to be hijacked by a move allowing backbenchers control of the Commons timetable. 2) If Johnson wants to force MPs to choose between delaying Brexit and a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, he is likely to find that they take the same decision they did when the passed the Benn Act, which effectively ruled out the no-deal option. That passed its second reading by a majority of 29. 3) Any other attempt to get MPs to make a forced choice could fail - because parliamentary procedure does not work like that. According to the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg (see 9.14am), Johnson is interested in the idea of forcing MPs to make a choice - perhaps between a no-deal Brexit and revoking article 50 (ie, cancelling Brexit). But parliament does not have a system for allowing MPs to vote either/or on a proposition. MPs just vote on motions, which they either pass or reject. In practice, MPs would almost certainly vote against no deal, and against revoking article 50. 4) Forcing MPs to make a choice could lead to them uniting behind an alternative PM. Johnson does not have a majority in the Commons, but he has not been replaced because opposition MPs and rebel Tories (who now sit as independents) cannot agree on who could lead an interim government in his place. This seems unlikely to change, although under pressure anything is possible. It is very, very hard to imagine Labour backing anyone other than Jeremy Corbyn as leader of an interim government, but Corbyn himself has not explicitly ruled this out. 5) Johnson insists he will not ask for a Brexit delay, even though the Benn Act would require him to, but he also claims he would obey the law. He has failed to explain how he would resolve this contradiction. His advisers seem to think that the authority of the referendum somehow overrides the authority of parliament, but by summoning parliament to meet on Saturday 19 October, possibly only a few days ahead of a supreme court hearing about the Benn Act, it might make it harder for Johnson to argue that he can legitimately bypass what parliament wants. According to the House of Commons website, the Commons has only sat on Saturdays four times since 1939. Three of those sittings were prompted by way or military conflict: 2 September 1939 (the day before Britain declared war on Germany); 3 November 1956 (the Suez crisis); and 3 April 1982 (the invasion of the Falklands). The other took place on 30 July 1949, when the last sitting before the summer recess was on a Saturday. (Anyone know why?) UPDATE: Thank you to all those of you who responded to my question about the 1949 sitting. You can read the Hansard of the day here. And here are some of the replies. These are from Chris White, a former Tory special adviser in the chief whip\u2019s office and the leader of the Commons\u2019 office, on the plan for a Saturday sitting of parliament on 19 October. This week has been seen as the effective deadline for a Brexit deal because, in practice, for an agreement to be signed, the framework would have to be in place by the weekend or early next week ahead of the EU summit starting on Thursday 17 October. The crucial decisions at these summits tend to get taken over dinner in the evening, with talks sometimes going on into the early hours. The summit is due to end on Friday. And this morning the BBC is reporting that Boris Johnson is now considering holding an emergency sitting of parliament on Saturday 19 October to allow MPs to decide the next step forward. On the Today programme Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC\u2019s political editor, said this sitting could be used to allow MPs to approve a deal reached at the summit, in the very unlikely event that the UK and the EU do come to an agreement. In the more probable event of there being no deal, Johnson would use the sitting to reveal how he would try to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October, despite the Benn Act, Kuenssberg said. She also said he would use the session to try to force parliament to take a decision, possibly making MPs to choose between no deal and an extension, or no deal and revoking article 50. Downing Street are confirming that this is a plan, although it would be subject to the usual conditions, ie MPs would have to vote for the sitting on the Saturday to go ahead in the first place. There seems to be at least one very obvious flaw in this proposal; parliament has already expressed a view on no deal versus delaying Brexit. It would prefer to delay Brexit, which is why it passed the Benn Act. It is hard to see what Johnson could do to reverse this vote, although doubtless some ingenious ideas are being kicked around in Dominic Cummings office. More on this shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: The Home Office publishes EU settlement scheme figures. 10am: Candidates to replace John Bercow as Commons Speaker take part in a press gallery hustings. The candidates are; Sir Henry Bellingham, Chris Bryant, Harriet Harman, Meg Hillier, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Dame Eleanor Laing, Sir Edward Leigh, Shailesh Vara and Rosie Winterton. 11am: The Scottish court of session is due to deliver its judgment in the appeal against the ruling saying there was no need to issue an order compelling Boris Johnson to comply with the Benn Act. 1.35pm: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, speaks at at NHS Providers conference. 2pm: The European parliament hears an update from the European commission and council ahead of next week\u2019s EU summit. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "A husband-and-wife team who built their tourism business from the ground up say they hope to save the jobs of all 2,500 former Thomas Cook staff, after buying the collapsed tour operator\u2019s 555 shops. John and Irene Hays, who run Sunderland-based Hays Travel, the Just Go Travel operator, snapped up Thomas Cook\u2019s UK travel agency business for an undisclosed fee, in a takeover sealed at 11.53pm on Tuesday. Trade unions said the deal proved parts of the business were viable, despite the government refusing to provide financial support to keep it alive, while Labour called for a full public inquiry into its collapse last month. The shops will be rebranded under the Hays Travel banner, meaning the 178-year-old Thomas Cook name will disappear from the high street in the wake of its high-profile implosion. The Hays, who have already hired 597 former Thomas Cook staff, said they hoped to double the headcount of their family business by taking on the tour operator\u2019s entire 2,500-strong workforce. \u201cThese people didn\u2019t do anything wrong, one day the company went into liquidation and their jobs had gone,\u201d said John Hays, the managing director of Hays Travel. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve been offering them new positions, they\u2019ve been really emotional. A reasonable percentage have actually cried.\u201d Irene Hays, who chairs the business, said some new recruits \u201cgave us a cuddle even though we didn\u2019t know them from Adam\u201d after a presentation welcoming them to the company. The couple insisted they could make a success of the business where Thomas Cook\u2019s previous management had failed. Irene Hays rubbished a claim by the Ryanair chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, that the number of people booking flights and hotels online meant the package holiday industry was \u201cscrewed\u201d. \u201cNo, we do not agree with Michael O\u2019Leary,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a huge resurgence in package holidays in recent years.\u201d Tour operators trade body Abta said 51% of people it surveyed in July said they had taken a package holiday in the past year, up from 48% in 2018. According to statistics from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the number of package holidays taken in the UK has been rising steadily since 2014, reaching 18.2m last year. The Hays said they had no immediate plans to shut any of the 555 stores, although John Hays acknowledged some closures might become unavoidable in areas where there was an overlap. Hays has 190 shops and will almost quadruple in size following the takeover, which was agreed with the receiver, the government official overseeing Thomas Cook\u2019s liquidation. John Hays opened the first branch of his travel company at the back of his mother\u2019s childrenswear shop in Seaham, County Durham, in 1980, recording sales of \u00a3812 in the first year. Since then the business has expanded across the UK, employing about 1,900 staff with a turnover of more than \u00a31bn last year. To mark the \u00a31bn milestone the company shared a \u00a31m pot with its employees, who each received \u00a3100 for every year they had worked at the company. Despite the vast expansion plan, Irene Hays said her husband, 70, had no plans to hand over to a successor and was \u201cnot going anywhere soon\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m tired because we\u2019ve put in a fair shift since Thomas Cook went down,\u201d said John Hays. \u201cI found the sofas at head office are quite comfortable for sleeping on. But we\u2019re still passionately engaged and we\u2019ve got a strong senior management team.\u201d The pair said they were locked into lease agreements with Thomas Cook\u2019s landlords for nine months but could seek to renegotiate rents in future to cut costs. However, they insisted that a network of bricks-and-mortar high street shops could still be profitable in an internet-dominated world. They pointed to the fact that, unlike Thomas Cook, Hays is free of debt even after the cash-funded acquisition, and operates from lower-cost headquarters in Sunderland. John Hays also said the company\u2019s business model was better suited to the internet age, with web enquiries leading to customer visits on the high street. \u201cThe web was their [Thomas Cook\u2019s] enemy, whereas a Hays Travel member of staff would say the web was their friend,\u201d he said. Thomas Cook\u2019s spectacular failure last month, after the government refused to provide a bailout, stranded 150,000 holidaymakers overseas, landed the government with a repatriation bill expected to exceed \u00a3100m, and put 9,000 jobs at risk. The trade union Unite said the deal with Hays showed that \u201cvarious parts of the business were viable\u201d, calling into question the lack of financial support from the government. \u201cIt is clear that the government\u2019s assessment that providing any financial assistance would risk \u2018throwing good money after bad\u2019 has been proven to be entirely false,\u201d said the assistant general secretary, Diana Holland. The union urged ministers to call a halt to the insolvency process of Thomas Cook\u2019s \u201cprofit-making\u201d airline. Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, called for a \u201cfull public inquiry into the government\u2019s handling of this scandal\u201d. The business minister, Andrea Leadsom, who has been criticised for a lack of involvement to try to save Thomas Cook, welcomed the sale to Hays, saying it would provide \u201csignificant re-employment opportunities\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Pro-remain campaigners are preparing to launch contempt proceedings against Boris Johnson if he attempts to renege on promises to seek an extension to Brexit. Jolyon Maugham QC has sought legal advice on starting court proceedings for contempt next week in the Scottish courts, after senior judges in Edinburgh delayed a decision on ordering the prime minister to comply with the Benn act. Lord Carloway, Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, has already cleared time for an emergency hearing in the court of session at noon on Monday 21 October, where he could issue court orders forcing Johnson to send a letter to the EU asking for an extension to article 50 until 31 January. The UK government\u2019s lawyers promised the court Johnson would honour the requirements of the European Union (withdrawal) (No 2) act by sending the letter if he fails to secure support in the House of Commons for Brexit by Saturday 19 October. The government also promised neither the prime minister nor any other minister or official would try to frustrate the Benn act by sidestepping it or undermining its provisions, despite Johnson\u2019s repeated pledge the UK would leave the EU on 31 October come what may. But Maugham, who took the court action against Johnson along with Dale Vince, the millionaire owner of the Ecotricity green energy company, and Joanna Cherry QC, a Scottish National party MP, said he believed the prime minister was still trying to do this. He confirmed he had asked a leading Scottish QC to prepare a civil action for contempt against Johnson, which would be lodged with the courts next week if there were fresh evidence the prime minister planned to obstruct moves towards an extension of article 50. \u201cIt would be a terrible mistake for the prime minister to imagine such a gross contempt would go unpunished,\u201d Maugham said after the ruling on Wednesday. \u201cThis is serious. This isn\u2019t some trivial administrative breach. This is a deliberate defiance of the will of parliament and the will of the court. If he is in breach of the law, there will be very serious consequences for him personally.\u201d Maugham, Vince and Cherry included a proposal to the court last week that Johnson could be jailed or fined for breaching the act. That was not formally proposed in the court hearing last Friday before Lord Pentland, but remains part of their legal submissions. It became clear on Wednesday that Johnson\u2019s hopes of securing a last-minute deal with the EU were doomed after the collapse of talks with the German government and disclosure from the Irish government that there was no prospect of a deal before 31 October. Johnson has asked for a rare Saturday sitting of the Commons on 19 October for emergency debates and votes. In a highly unusual but significant ruling, Carloway, sitting with Lord Drummond Young and Lord Brodie, said the court needed to wait to see what happened next week before deciding whether it had to enforce the Benn act. \u201cThe political debate requires to be played out in the appropriate forum,\u201d the judges ruled. \u201cThe court may only interfere in that debate if there is demonstrable unlawfulness which it requires to address and to correct. At present, there has been no such unlawfulness.\u201d The three judges agreed with Pentland, who ruled on Monday that there was no proof Johnson was actively taking steps to undermine the Benn act and the government was entitled to have political arguments about its Brexit strategies. Carloway said the situation was very fluid and if Johnson did try to thwart or sidestep the act, this would become clearer after midnight on 19 October. If he breaks his promises to the court, it could issue an interdict, or injunction, ordering Johnson to send the extension request, or it could do so, using unique powers open to Scottish judges known as nobile officium (noble office). That empowers a court to take action on a legal matter where the responsible person fails to do so, or in order to remedy a deficiency. It would be unprecedented but in that situation, the court would write, sign and send the letter specified in the legislation to Brussels and the other 27 EU member states. The judges also hinted strongly in their ruling that they could find Johnson in contempt of court, without a specific application by Dale, Maugham and Cherry, if the prime minister failed to honour the promises government lawyers had made to the court. The government had refused to give the court sworn undertakings, a legally binding pledge that Johnson would do as he had promised, but Carloway implied the \u201cdetailed and specific averments\u201d made by its lawyers were enough. Therefore, coercive orders, such as interdicts or nobile officium rulings, were not needed at this stage. Cherry said Johnson and his aides had to understand the significance of the court suspending judgment. It \u201csurely showed there is some doubt lodged in their minds that the promises made to the court will be adhered to\u201d, she said.",

      "body": "<p>Congratulations to Suzanne Moore for highlighting those who are forgotten in campaigns such as Every Mind Matters (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/07/we-are-in-the-midst-of-a-mental-health-crisis-advice-about-jogging-and-self-care-is-not-enough\" title=\"\">Telling people to jog will not solve this mental health crisis</a>, 8 October). When Jeremy Hunt spoke of the biggest expansion of mental health services in Europe, he referred to expanded provision for people with mild to moderate problems. Those with serious mental heath problems have found that there is no therapy for them, specialist services like assertive outreach have disappeared, and their community mental health teams are too busy managing crises to support them.</p> <p>I work with people who regularly self-harm and feel suicidal. Because the NHS has a tendency to keep them out of services and ignore NICE guidelines aimed at helping them, they find themselves the subjects of reports such as \u201cNo Longer A Diagnosis of Exclusion\u201d and \u201cThe Patients Psychiatrists Dislike\u201d. As they are turned away while seeking help and reading \u201cIf you feel that life is not worth living, you\u2019re harming yourself or have thought about self-harm, it\u2019s important to tell someone\u201d on the Every Mind Matters website they will rightly feel gaslighted. We are building awareness of difficulties for which there is no help. We are encouraging people to talk while leaving them alone. Despite this, the insult of being manipulative and deceitful is thrown at the people wanting help, not those who promise the earth but whose words are dust. It\u2019s clear that some minds don\u2019t matter as much as others.<br><strong>Keir Harding</strong><br><em>Wrexham, Clwyd</em></p> <p>\u2022 The benefits of keeping one\u2019s body healthy to maximise mental wellbeing is well researched, but there is no doubt that, as Suzanne Moore writes, \u201cthe link between mental health, unemployment, bad housing and isolation is real\u201d. Sadly, the medicalisation of mental health sanctions a focus on \u201ctreating\u201d\u2019 mental health in isolation, rather than challenging the cause.</p> <p>This begs the question: what have we learned since 1832? It was then, when a cholera epidemic swept the country, that Dr Duncan pestered the Liverpool authorities with the now blindingly obvious truth that it is pointless treating people for the effects of f\u00e6cally-contaminated water and then returning them to the conditions in which they contracted it. He was appointed the country\u2019s first medical officer of health and with his colleagues revolutionised the sanitary arrangements that eliminated cholera.</p> <p>187 years later we are in an analogous position with mental health \u2013 we treat people\u2019s mental ill-health with CBT or some other proprietary \u201ccure\u201d and then return them to the contaminated conditions in which ill-health thrives. Who is the modern day Dr Duncan who is going to revolutionise society to eliminate some of the blindingly obvious causes of mental ill-health?<br><strong>Nick Broadhead</strong><br><em>Liverpool</em></p> <p>\u2022 With the launch of Every Mind Matters will anyone remember the demise of Every Child Matters? A policy based on a cross-party consensus about how to improve outcomes for children, dismantled in the earliest days of the coalition, when Michael Gove became education secretary in May 2010. One if his first acts was to remove any sign of the previous Department of Children, Families and Schools which initiated the policy. Complicit in this tragedy for children \u2013 consider the rise in mental health problems among young people which Every Mind Matters attempts to address \u2013 was Nick Clegg heading up the children and families taskforce that never met, and disappeared without trace months after the election.</p> <p>At the heart of Every Child Matters was a simple mantra of staying safe, being healthy, enjoying and achieving, that could be as easily understood by an eight-year old as by a director of children\u2019s services. This was a real revolution in the way we as a society raise children, undermined by ideological indifference and apathy by those on a path to austerity. It was another casualty of Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings\u2019 \u201cwilful carelessness\u201d as described by Fiona Millar (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/sep/03/gove-cummings-dark-arts-education-trash-country\" title=\"\">Those \u2018enemies of promise\u2019 are now using the dark arts they honed in education to trash the country</a>, 3 September).</p> <p>Who in these divided times, with this pair in charge, will bet on Every Mind Matters surviving much beyond the press release? <br><strong>Steven Chown</strong><br><em>Chudleigh Knighton, </em><em>Devon</em></p> <p>\u2022 Early intervention is crucial for mental disorders in children: waiting \u201cat least 41 weeks to start their treatment\u201d is an eternity for young people (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/07/mental-healthcare-hit-by-alarming-shortage-of-psychiatrists\" title=\"\">Children\u2019s services hard hit with one in 10 psychiatrist posts left unfilled</a>, 7 October).

      "bodyText": "Congratulations to Suzanne Moore for highlighting those who are forgotten in campaigns such as Every Mind Matters (Telling people to jog will not solve this mental health crisis, 8 October). When Jeremy Hunt spoke of the biggest expansion of mental health services in Europe, he referred to expanded provision for people with mild to moderate problems. Those with serious mental heath problems have found that there is no therapy for them, specialist services like assertive outreach have disappeared, and their community mental health teams are too busy managing crises to support them. I work with people who regularly self-harm and feel suicidal. Because the NHS has a tendency to keep them out of services and ignore NICE guidelines aimed at helping them, they find themselves the subjects of reports such as \u201cNo Longer A Diagnosis of Exclusion\u201d and \u201cThe Patients Psychiatrists Dislike\u201d. As they are turned away while seeking help and reading \u201cIf you feel that life is not worth living, you\u2019re harming yourself or have thought about self-harm, it\u2019s important to tell someone\u201d on the Every Mind Matters website they will rightly feel gaslighted. We are building awareness of difficulties for which there is no help. We are encouraging people to talk while leaving them alone. Despite this, the insult of being manipulative and deceitful is thrown at the people wanting help, not those who promise the earth but whose words are dust. It\u2019s clear that some minds don\u2019t matter as much as others. Keir Harding Wrexham, Clwyd \u2022 The benefits of keeping one\u2019s body healthy to maximise mental wellbeing is well researched, but there is no doubt that, as Suzanne Moore writes, \u201cthe link between mental health, unemployment, bad housing and isolation is real\u201d. Sadly, the medicalisation of mental health sanctions a focus on \u201ctreating\u201d\u2019 mental health in isolation, rather than challenging the cause. This begs the question: what have we learned since 1832? It was then, when a cholera epidemic swept the country, that Dr Duncan pestered the Liverpool authorities with the now blindingly obvious truth that it is pointless treating people for the effects of f\u00e6cally-contaminated water and then returning them to the conditions in which they contracted it. He was appointed the country\u2019s first medical officer of health and with his colleagues revolutionised the sanitary arrangements that eliminated cholera. 187 years later we are in an analogous position with mental health \u2013 we treat people\u2019s mental ill-health with CBT or some other proprietary \u201ccure\u201d and then return them to the contaminated conditions in which ill-health thrives. Who is the modern day Dr Duncan who is going to revolutionise society to eliminate some of the blindingly obvious causes of mental ill-health? Nick Broadhead Liverpool \u2022 With the launch of Every Mind Matters will anyone remember the demise of Every Child Matters? A policy based on a cross-party consensus about how to improve outcomes for children, dismantled in the earliest days of the coalition, when Michael Gove became education secretary in May 2010. One if his first acts was to remove any sign of the previous Department of Children, Families and Schools which initiated the policy. Complicit in this tragedy for children \u2013 consider the rise in mental health problems among young people which Every Mind Matters attempts to address \u2013 was Nick Clegg heading up the children and families taskforce that never met, and disappeared without trace months after the election. At the heart of Every Child Matters was a simple mantra of staying safe, being healthy, enjoying and achieving, that could be as easily understood by an eight-year old as by a director of children\u2019s services. This was a real revolution in the way we as a society raise children, undermined by ideological indifference and apathy by those on a path to austerity. It was another casualty of Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings\u2019 \u201cwilful carelessness\u201d as described by Fiona Millar (Those \u2018enemies of promise\u2019 are now using the dark arts they honed in education to trash the country, 3 September). Who in these divided times, with this pair in charge, will bet on Every Mind Matters surviving much beyond the press release? Steven Chown Chudleigh Knighton, Devon \u2022 Early intervention is crucial for mental disorders in children: waiting \u201cat least 41 weeks to start their treatment\u201d is an eternity for young people (Children\u2019s services hard hit with one in 10 psychiatrist posts left unfilled, 7 October). There are shortages across mental health teams (psychiatrists, nurses, psychologists and therapists). Non-clinical staff (like family support workers and advocates) to help parents navigate our fragmented services are thin on the ground. I long to hear that the government will invest in staffing and staff development to overcome gaps in mental healthcare. However, perhaps a key lesson after the Children Act 2004 was not to start with developing conventional teams around a doctor, but rather a team around the child? Prof Woody Caan Editor, Journal of Public Mental Health \u2022 This Mental Health Awareness Day, Thursday 10 October, NSPCC Scotland wants to increase awareness that babies have mental needs too. We are calling on the Scottish government to invest in the infant-parent relationship as part of our Fight for a Fair Start campaign.

      "bodyText": "The EU\u2019s point-by-point rejection of the government\u2019s proposals for the Northern Ireland border is no surprise (Day the deal was doomed, 9 October). No one can accept a solution that gave Northern Ireland\u2019s politicians a veto on border arrangements. More surprising is the failure of the rebel alliance of MPs to agree a way forward. Surely elements of the 1940 solution make sense with Jeremy Corbyn in the Clement Attlee role as deputy prime minister and a figure like Ken Clarke as prime minister for a fixed term to sort out Brexit. Attlee was leader of the opposition, albeit in the face of a massive Tory majority, but this position worked for him in 1945. Tom Cannon Manchester \u2022 In Wednesday\u2019s Morning Briefing you suggest that Boris Johnson will \u201ctrigger\u201d a general election. Perhaps this should be \u201cattempt to trigger\u201d or even \u201cbeg the opposition for an election\u201d as we do have the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. I suggest the other parties leave Johnson to stew by having an opposition of national unity, abstaining in the vote on the Queen\u2019s speech (which no doubt will have some provocative proposals) and thus effectively giving the opposition control over a decidedly minority government\u2019s agenda. The opposition parties will then have the power to trigger an election at a time of their choosing \u2013 for example, during the chaos of a Tory hard Brexit. Alan Pack Canterbury, Kent \u2022 The imperative provision of the Benn Act is that the prime minister must comply by sending a letter requesting an extension \u201cno later than 19 October 2019\u201d. The imperative applies only to the prime minister. Were Mr Johnson to resign as PM at midday on 19 October and inform the Queen that he still commanded the confidence of the Commons but was unwilling to remain as PM as the deadline stipulated by the Benn Act occurred, but that he would be willing to be recommissioned the following day, the Benn Act would not apply to him when he was recommissioned as the deadline would have passed. Nor would he have contravened the act before his resignation, as the deadline had not yet then arrived. Of course the political cost is another matter. But even Lord Sumption would not contend that the act precludes, or could preclude, a PM unwilling to comply with it from resigning. Charles Sweeney QC Brisbane, Australia \u2022 So Arlene Foster thinks that \u201cthe real objective of Dublin and the European Union\u201d is to trap Northern Ireland in a customs union (Report, 8 October). Isn\u2019t that what the people of Northern Ireland voted for?

Plays will be staged. Their faces will be carved into mountains.</p> <p><strong>Why, exactly? </strong>You didn\u2019t see? OK, here\u2019s the short version: at 10:29am on Wednesday morning, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/09/coleen-rooney-accuses-rebekah-vardy-leaking-stories-sun\">Rooney tweeted a long and rollicking tale of intrigue</a> via a screenshot from the iPhone Notes app. Someone, she said, had been passing the Sun information contained in her private Instagram stories. So she set a trap.</p> <p><strong>A trap? </strong>Yes. Rooney says she blocked everyone but one person from accessing her stories, and then made up a series of elaborate lies to see if they would still reach the newspaper.</p> <p><strong>What lies are we talking about?</strong> There was a story about her signing up to Strictly Come Dancing, and one about her flying to Mexico to have gender-selection treatment for her next baby. All lies, she says, made up simply to trap the person she suspected. And the stories appeared in the paper.</p> <p><strong>So, who did she suspect?</strong> My God, this is tense. To quote Rooney\u2019s tweet: \u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Oh.</strong> But that doesn\u2019t matter, because the drama has entertained us all day.</p> <p><strong>Really?</strong> Oh God, yes. Within minutes of this happening, people had mocked up memes of Guess Who? boardgame boxes and Scooby Doo featuring Rooney uncovering Vardy\u2019s identity. And asking what mystery she will uncover next. It\u2019s been amazing.</p> <p><strong>So people are on Rooney\u2019s side? </strong>A million per cent. She\u2019s everyone\u2019s new hero. Wagatha Christie, they\u2019re calling her.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/09/coleen-rooney-accuses-rebekah-vardy-leaking-stories-sun\">Coleen Rooney accuses Rebekah Vardy of leaking stories to Sun</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Has </strong><strong>Vardy responded to this? </strong>Almost immediately. In another screenshot, she denied the claims, pointed out that \u201cI\u2019m not being funny but I don\u2019t need the money\u201d, and claimed that Rooney was the real villain for doing this \u201cwhen I\u2019m heavily pregnant\u201d.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019m not convinced. </strong>Very few people are. But it\u2019s probably worth pointing out that Rooney isn\u2019t a legally qualified detective, so we shouldn\u2019t necessarily jump to any public conclusions.</p> <p><strong>What about private conclusions?</strong> Are you kidding? Jump away! How could you not? This is the most entertaining thing that has ever happened in the history of the world.</p> <p><strong>Yes but Brexit.</strong> Listen, the planet is a cascade of unending misery right now. Two Wags having an unnecessarily public barney on the internet is exactly the distraction we all need. Give us this, you grump.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> \u201cColeen Rooney is the world\u2019s greatest detective.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t say:</strong> \u201cBut what if they both made this up to trick you into leaking it to the press?\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Name: Wag wars. Age: Brand new. Appearance: Arguably the greatest thing that has ever happened in the entire history of the internet. That\u2019s a bold claim. Yes, but it still stands. Books will be written about the rivalry between Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy. Plays will be staged. Their faces will be carved into mountains. Why, exactly? You didn\u2019t see? OK, here\u2019s the short version: at 10:29am on Wednesday morning, Rooney tweeted a long and rollicking tale of intrigue via a screenshot from the iPhone Notes app. Someone, she said, had been passing the Sun information contained in her private Instagram stories. So she set a trap. A trap? Yes. Rooney says she blocked everyone but one person from accessing her stories, and then made up a series of elaborate lies to see if they would still reach the newspaper. What lies are we talking about? There was a story about her signing up to Strictly Come Dancing, and one about her flying to Mexico to have gender-selection treatment for her next baby. All lies, she says, made up simply to trap the person she suspected. And the stories appeared in the paper. So, who did she suspect? My God, this is tense. To quote Rooney\u2019s tweet: \u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u201d Oh. But that doesn\u2019t matter, because the drama has entertained us all day. Really? Oh God, yes. Within minutes of this happening, people had mocked up memes of Guess Who? boardgame boxes and Scooby Doo featuring Rooney uncovering Vardy\u2019s identity. And asking what mystery she will uncover next. It\u2019s been amazing. So people are on Rooney\u2019s side? A million per cent. She\u2019s everyone\u2019s new hero. Wagatha Christie, they\u2019re calling her. Has Vardy responded to this? Almost immediately. In another screenshot, she denied the claims, pointed out that \u201cI\u2019m not being funny but I don\u2019t need the money\u201d, and claimed that Rooney was the real villain for doing this \u201cwhen I\u2019m heavily pregnant\u201d. I\u2019m not convinced. Very few people are. But it\u2019s probably worth pointing out that Rooney isn\u2019t a legally qualified detective, so we shouldn\u2019t necessarily jump to any public conclusions. What about private conclusions? Are you kidding? Jump away! How could you not? This is the most entertaining thing that has ever happened in the history of the world. Yes but Brexit. Listen, the planet is a cascade of unending misery right now. Two Wags having an unnecessarily public barney on the internet is exactly the distraction we all need. Give us this, you grump. Do say: \u201cColeen Rooney is the world\u2019s greatest detective.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cBut what if they both made this up to trick you into leaking it to the press?\u201d",

Arguably, The Voice UK never managed to give anyone a shot beyond the show itself. The charts no longer look anything like the old reality TV giants that could once crack them. Now, in the age of streaming and all the democratisation that brings, artists have more chance of turning themselves into stars than ever.

Her advice may be blunt, but it also appears to be the most practical. She tells a gay rapper he will have to work harder than everyone else to be the first mainstream out artist in that field (I assume it was filmed before Lil Nas X came out). She tells a rapper with a political bent that the intensity of his rage might not be as commercial as he would like it to be. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really feeling that \u2018murder\u2019 thing, you know, that scares white people,\u201d she shrugs.

Its compromise is weekly blocks of a clutch of episodes, moving us from stage to stage. For the most part, that works just fine. Viewers may not be able to vote for their favourites to stay, but this reinvention of the talent show wheel is so convincing I am happy to take such decisions as simply signs of the future.",

      "body": "<p>Plastic packaging has many amazing qualities. It keeps our food fresh and holds liquids without going soggy. It can also be moulded into a variety of shapes and, unlike glass, it doesn\u2019t shatter if you drop it. But one of the qualities that makes it so useful \u2013 its durability \u2013 also means that it takes approximately 450 years to biodegrade.</p> <p>It\u2019s therefore imperative that we reuse, redesign and recycle plastic packaging so that it doesn\u2019t end up buried in landfill or clogging up our oceans for centuries to come. But given that only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/feb/22/plastics-recycling-trash-chemicals-styrofoam-packaging\">about 14% of plastic packaging gets recycled today</a>, there\u2019s clearly a lot of work still to do \u2013 especially when it comes to creating packaging designs that are easier to recycle, use less material and contain more recycled plastic.</p> <p>One of the biggest barriers to better designs is the higher cost and more constrained supply of recycled plastic compared with virgin types. So, from April 2022, the UK government plans to introduce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/29/uk-to-consult-on-plastic-packaging-tax-chancellor-says\">a new tax on plastic packaging</a> that does not contain a minimum of 30% recycled content. It hopes this will transform the economics of sustainable packaging by driving up demand for recycled materials and discouraging the production of single-use packaging with no recycled content.</p> <p>The EU also wants to make all plastic packaging across Europe recyclable or reusable by 2030, and is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/16/eu-declares-war-on-plastic-waste-2030\">allocating an additional \u20ac100m</a> on top of current spending to research better designs, durability and recyclability. Initiatives such as the Alliance to End Plastic Waste and the New Plastics Economy, which aim to build momentum towards a plastics system based on circular economy principles, have also brought together stakeholders from across the plastics value chain to rethink the way plastics are designed, produced, used, recycled and reprocessed.</p> <h2>Shining a light on black plastic</h2> <p>Black plastic, which is often used to package ready meals, is high on the list of packaging that needs redesigning. The near-infrared technology found in plastic sorting facilities uses light reflection to identify different types of plastic and sort them appropriately. But due to the presence of carbon black, those ready meal trays and other types of black plastic simply absorb the light rather than reflecting it back to the machine, effectively rendering them unrecyclable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"8953ba015e153c24d36cbf7072d1922f6d8fb4f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8953ba015e153c24d36cbf7072d1922f6d8fb4f5/0_185_3545_4429/800.jpg\" alt=\"3d printer, Henkel Headquarter, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, 2019-08-30\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">3D printing a plastic prototype.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carsten Behler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"cbba5671bd07ac77c95d667dc485ade5ef1fdeb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbba5671bd07ac77c95d667dc485ade5ef1fdeb8/553_0_2836_3545/800.jpg\" alt=\"Henkel Headquarter, Thorsten Leopold, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, 2019-09-13\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Thorsten Leopold.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carsten Behler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>3D printing a plastic prototype; Dr Thorsten Leopold</p></li> </ul> <p>Henkel, the global chemical and consumer goods company behind well-known brands such as Loctite, Pritt, Sellotape and Schwarzkopf, Dylon and Colour Catcher, decided to tackle the black plastic problem in partnership with its colouring supplier, Ampacet. Together they developed a black plastic that uses an alternative carbon-free black colour, which can be detected by sorting machines. \u201cWe have already begun integrating it into our product portfolios, starting with our bottles of toilet-cleaning products,\u201d says Dr Thorsten Leopold, head of international packaging development for home care products at Henkel. In time the carbon-free colour should be rolled out across all the company\u2019s black plastic packaging, which will ensure this formerly \u201cunrecyclable\u201d plastic doesn\u2019t become waste.</p> <p>The project is part of Henkel\u2019s goal of making 100% of its consumer packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025, while also increasing the share of recycled plastic in its European consumer goods products to 35%. In order to meet these targets, Henkel\u2019s packaging developers follow three main principles: prevent, reduce and reuse. This means producing less packaging and waste, developing better packaging and enabling a circular economy. For example, the company\u2019s Laundry and Home Care and Beauty Care businesses have recently launched packaging made solely from recycled plastic \u2013 up to half of which is also classed as Social Plastic.</p> <h2>Plastic that alleviates poverty</h2> <p>This Social Plastic comes from Henkel\u2019s partnership with Plastic Bank, a social enterprise that aims to reduce the amount of plastic waste in the environment while helping to alleviate poverty in countries such as Haiti and the Philippines. It encourages people to collect plastic waste and bring it to Plastic Bank recycling collection centres, where it can be exchanged for money, goods or services. The Social Plastic is then integrated back into the plastic supply chain. In total, approximately 200 tonnes of collected Social Plastic will be processed for Henkel this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4a015e1f54c32cf4f132aa80114f80ec17f42492\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a015e1f54c32cf4f132aa80114f80ec17f42492/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plastic Bank\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Plastic Bank recycling collection centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carsten Behler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>A Plastic Bank recycling collection centre</p></li> </ul> <p>Pierre Defaix, global purchasing category lead for plastic resins and masterbatches at Henkel, says that part of the appeal of the partnership is the proven scalability of Plastic Bank\u2019s solution for tackling ocean plastic. \u201cIts business model tackles the environmental challenge of ocean plastic,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut it also has a social dimension that addresses poverty and the lack of work opportunities for many people ... We want to create the demand that will help this business model fly.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/product-innovation-with-henkel/2019/sep/24/tricks-up-their-sleeves-the-packaging-solutions-that-make-for-smarter-recycling\">Tricks up their sleeves: the packaging solutions that make for smarter recycling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As well as using more Social Plastic in future, Henkel is also exploring other ways of improving the lives of plastic collectors. \u201cEarly this year, for instance, Schwarzkopf included four Plastic Bank collectors in its Million Chances charitable initiative, which supports projects that empower women to build a successful personal and professional future.</p> <p>\u201cThis is in the Philippines, where Schwarzkopf teaches disadvantaged young people hairdressing skills so they can change their lives by developing a steady income,\u201d says Defaix.</p> <h2>Recycled plastic challenges</h2> <p>Several issues have to be taken into consideration when incorporating more recycled plastic into product packaging. For instance, the properties of recycled plastic \u2013 such as its colour and odour \u2013 are more varied than those of virgin plastic. \u201cThis is something of a challenge for our supply chain, but also for the performance of our products,\u201d says Leopold.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"3dd9fc3081eeca15be4c07a2b1c7387048e3022b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dd9fc3081eeca15be4c07a2b1c7387048e3022b/0_676_3545_4429/800.jpg\" alt=\"Henkel Headquarter, social plastic production line, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, 2019-09-13\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bottles produced from recycled plastic on the Social Plastic production line.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carsten Behler/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"21df41b8174a3769f3887951f90b3ac9b3252b98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21df41b8174a3769f3887951f90b3ac9b3252b98/0_211_3545_4429/800.jpg\" alt=\"Philippe Blank of Henkel.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philippe Blank of Henkel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carsten Behler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Bottles produced from recycled plastic on the Social Plastic production line; Philippe Blank of Henkel</p></li> </ul> <p>Certain colours of recycled polyolefin plastics, for instance, are hard to source in large amounts. Recycled PET plastic also tends to be less transparent than a virgin equivalent, and may have a greyish or yellowish tinge. That poses a challenge when it comes to creating beauty products with shelf appeal. \u201cObviously there\u2019s a huge demand from our marketeers, and also from the consumers themselves, that the product, in terms of packaging, needs to be attractive,\u201d says Philippe Blank, head of innovation and sustainability for Henkel Beauty Care. \u201cIt\u2019s not a solution to end up with beauty packaging that only comes in shades of grey or yellow.\u201d</p> <p>In some cases, designers might add a coloured tint to recycled PET to hide the fact that it\u2019s not as transparent as the virgin kind. Sleeves that completely cover the bottle are another option. \u201cThat means you can put a lot of recycled plastic into the body,\u201d says Leopold, \u201cand the greyish or yellow colour of the bottle is covered by the sleeve. That\u2019s a nice example of how smart design can foster the use of recycled plastic.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0e52175c438c7b8e4f050bc6136fef58a72e3adc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e52175c438c7b8e4f050bc6136fef58a72e3adc/44_1291_3503_4024/871.jpg\" alt=\"Katja Gerhards, Henkel Headquarter, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, 2019-08-30\" width=\"871\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Smarter multi-layer design</h2> <p>Smart design is also part of Henkel\u2019s approach to making multi-layer packaging more sustainable. This type of packaging, which consists of multiple layers of film, foil, plastic or paper, is tear-resistant, lightweight and good at keeping out external factors. However, the layers are difficult to separate during the recycling process, so the packaging is often incinerated or thrown into landfill sites after use.</p> <p>The padded mailers that protect e-commerce purchase during transit fall under this category of packaging. Around 20bn of them are used each year, which adds up to a heavy environmental footprint \u2013 one that Henkel engineers have helped to make a bit lighter by designing a new type of recyclable mailer. \u201cThe product that we came up with can be put straight into the paper recycling bin,\u201d says Marcin Lapaj, global business development manager for the circular economy at Henkel. \u201cIt shows how a traditional product can be reinvented and made in a different way, with circularity as priority number one.\u201d</p> <p>Of course Henkel isn\u2019t the only company that\u2019s trying to make plastic packaging more sustainable. In the UK, Coca-Cola has developed new technologies that mean 100% of the packaging the company uses in its \u201cSmartwater\u201d bottles is now recyclable. Samsung, meanwhile, has substituted all the plastic packaging used for its products for environmentally sustainable materials such as recycled and bio-based plastics and paper. And where these companies lead others will hopefully follow, so that plastic waste becomes part of the past rather than the future.</p> <p><em>Further information about Henkel\u2019s efforts to make plastic more sustainable can be found at: <a href=\"https://www.henkel.co.uk/spotlight/features/plastic\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.henkel.co.uk/spotlight/features/plastic</a></em></p>",

It\u2019s therefore imperative that we reuse, redesign and recycle plastic packaging so that it doesn\u2019t end up buried in landfill or clogging up our oceans for centuries to come. But given that only about 14% of plastic packaging gets recycled today, there\u2019s clearly a lot of work still to do \u2013 especially when it comes to creating packaging designs that are easier to recycle, use less material and contain more recycled plastic. One of the biggest barriers to better designs is the higher cost and more constrained supply of recycled plastic compared with virgin types. So, from April 2022, the UK government plans to introduce a new tax on plastic packaging that does not contain a minimum of 30% recycled content. It hopes this will transform the economics of sustainable packaging by driving up demand for recycled materials and discouraging the production of single-use packaging with no recycled content. The EU also wants to make all plastic packaging across Europe recyclable or reusable by 2030, and is allocating an additional \u20ac100m on top of current spending to research better designs, durability and recyclability. Initiatives such as the Alliance to End Plastic Waste and the New Plastics Economy, which aim to build momentum towards a plastics system based on circular economy principles, have also brought together stakeholders from across the plastics value chain to rethink the way plastics are designed, produced, used, recycled and reprocessed. Shining a light on black plastic Black plastic, which is often used to package ready meals, is high on the list of packaging that needs redesigning. The near-infrared technology found in plastic sorting facilities uses light reflection to identify different types of plastic and sort them appropriately. But due to the presence of carbon black, those ready meal trays and other types of black plastic simply absorb the light rather than reflecting it back to the machine, effectively rendering them unrecyclable. 3D printing a plastic prototype; Dr Thorsten Leopold Henkel, the global chemical and consumer goods company behind well-known brands such as Loctite, Pritt, Sellotape and Schwarzkopf, Dylon and Colour Catcher, decided to tackle the black plastic problem in partnership with its colouring supplier, Ampacet. Together they developed a black plastic that uses an alternative carbon-free black colour, which can be detected by sorting machines. \u201cWe have already begun integrating it into our product portfolios, starting with our bottles of toilet-cleaning products,\u201d says Dr Thorsten Leopold, head of international packaging development for home care products at Henkel. In time the carbon-free colour should be rolled out across all the company\u2019s black plastic packaging, which will ensure this formerly \u201cunrecyclable\u201d plastic doesn\u2019t become waste. The project is part of Henkel\u2019s goal of making 100% of its consumer packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025, while also increasing the share of recycled plastic in its European consumer goods products to 35%. In order to meet these targets, Henkel\u2019s packaging developers follow three main principles: prevent, reduce and reuse. This means producing less packaging and waste, developing better packaging and enabling a circular economy. For example, the company\u2019s Laundry and Home Care and Beauty Care businesses have recently launched packaging made solely from recycled plastic \u2013 up to half of which is also classed as Social Plastic. Plastic that alleviates poverty This Social Plastic comes from Henkel\u2019s partnership with Plastic Bank, a social enterprise that aims to reduce the amount of plastic waste in the environment while helping to alleviate poverty in countries such as Haiti and the Philippines. It encourages people to collect plastic waste and bring it to Plastic Bank recycling collection centres, where it can be exchanged for money, goods or services. The Social Plastic is then integrated back into the plastic supply chain. In total, approximately 200 tonnes of collected Social Plastic will be processed for Henkel this year. A Plastic Bank recycling collection centre Pierre Defaix, global purchasing category lead for plastic resins and masterbatches at Henkel, says that part of the appeal of the partnership is the proven scalability of Plastic Bank\u2019s solution for tackling ocean plastic. \u201cIts business model tackles the environmental challenge of ocean plastic,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut it also has a social dimension that addresses poverty and the lack of work opportunities for many people ... We want to create the demand that will help this business model fly.\u201d As well as using more Social Plastic in future, Henkel is also exploring other ways of improving the lives of plastic collectors. \u201cEarly this year, for instance, Schwarzkopf included four Plastic Bank collectors in its Million Chances charitable initiative, which supports projects that empower women to build a successful personal and professional future. \u201cThis is in the Philippines, where Schwarzkopf teaches disadvantaged young people hairdressing skills so they can change their lives by developing a steady income,\u201d says Defaix. Recycled plastic challenges Several issues have to be taken into consideration when incorporating more recycled plastic into product packaging. For instance, the properties of recycled plastic \u2013 such as its colour and odour \u2013 are more varied than those of virgin plastic. \u201cThis is something of a challenge for our supply chain, but also for the performance of our products,\u201d says Leopold. Bottles produced from recycled plastic on the Social Plastic production line; Philippe Blank of Henkel Certain colours of recycled polyolefin plastics, for instance, are hard to source in large amounts. Recycled PET plastic also tends to be less transparent than a virgin equivalent, and may have a greyish or yellowish tinge. That poses a challenge when it comes to creating beauty products with shelf appeal. \u201cObviously there\u2019s a huge demand from our marketeers, and also from the consumers themselves, that the product, in terms of packaging, needs to be attractive,\u201d says Philippe Blank, head of innovation and sustainability for Henkel Beauty Care. \u201cIt\u2019s not a solution to end up with beauty packaging that only comes in shades of grey or yellow.\u201d In some cases, designers might add a coloured tint to recycled PET to hide the fact that it\u2019s not as transparent as the virgin kind. Sleeves that completely cover the bottle are another option. \u201cThat means you can put a lot of recycled plastic into the body,\u201d says Leopold, \u201cand the greyish or yellow colour of the bottle is covered by the sleeve. That\u2019s a nice example of how smart design can foster the use of recycled plastic.\u201d Smarter multi-layer design Smart design is also part of Henkel\u2019s approach to making multi-layer packaging more sustainable. This type of packaging, which consists of multiple layers of film, foil, plastic or paper, is tear-resistant, lightweight and good at keeping out external factors. However, the layers are difficult to separate during the recycling process, so the packaging is often incinerated or thrown into landfill sites after use. The padded mailers that protect e-commerce purchase during transit fall under this category of packaging. Around 20bn of them are used each year, which adds up to a heavy environmental footprint \u2013 one that Henkel engineers have helped to make a bit lighter by designing a new type of recyclable mailer. \u201cThe product that we came up with can be put straight into the paper recycling bin,\u201d says Marcin Lapaj, global business development manager for the circular economy at Henkel. \u201cIt shows how a traditional product can be reinvented and made in a different way, with circularity as priority number one.\u201d Of course Henkel isn\u2019t the only company that\u2019s trying to make plastic packaging more sustainable. In the UK, Coca-Cola has developed new technologies that mean 100% of the packaging the company uses in its \u201cSmartwater\u201d bottles is now recyclable. Samsung, meanwhile, has substituted all the plastic packaging used for its products for environmentally sustainable materials such as recycled and bio-based plastics and paper. And where these companies lead others will hopefully follow, so that plastic waste becomes part of the past rather than the future.

      "body": "<p>In the pantheon of famous rats, there is Pizza Rat, Master Splinter from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and of course, Remy from Ratatouille. But there are the other rats, the ones that live a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs beneath floorboards or kitchen skirtings. You notice them only when you awaken on the sofa, household quiet, to hear the tell-tale clatter of tiny feet, or when you stumble to the sink in the middle of the night for a glass of water, and notice a shadow creeping across the floor.</p> <p>If you live in an urban area, rats are par for the course. But are they as ubiquitous as the pest-control experts would have you believe? Speaking to the Sun, Paul Bates of Cleankill Pest Control warned of a looming rat blitzkrieg heading for British homes. \u201cRecent heavy rain has forced many rats above ground,\u201d Bates said. And as the weather is getting colder, the rats are moving in. \u201cRats will move closer to food supplies indoors and [look] for somewhere warm to nest \u2013 that means people\u2019s homes.\u201d Most ominously of all, Bates warned that there is nowhere to hide from that forthcoming invasion of Britain\u2019s estimated 120m brown rats. \u201cNo house is completely rodent-proof.\u201d</p> <p>Are rat numbers on the rise? \u201cNo,\u201d says Prof Richard Ashley, a professor of urban water at the University of Sheffield.

      "bodyText": "In the pantheon of famous rats, there is Pizza Rat, Master Splinter from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and of course, Remy from Ratatouille. But there are the other rats, the ones that live a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs beneath floorboards or kitchen skirtings. You notice them only when you awaken on the sofa, household quiet, to hear the tell-tale clatter of tiny feet, or when you stumble to the sink in the middle of the night for a glass of water, and notice a shadow creeping across the floor. If you live in an urban area, rats are par for the course. But are they as ubiquitous as the pest-control experts would have you believe? Speaking to the Sun, Paul Bates of Cleankill Pest Control warned of a looming rat blitzkrieg heading for British homes. \u201cRecent heavy rain has forced many rats above ground,\u201d Bates said. And as the weather is getting colder, the rats are moving in. \u201cRats will move closer to food supplies indoors and [look] for somewhere warm to nest \u2013 that means people\u2019s homes.\u201d Most ominously of all, Bates warned that there is nowhere to hide from that forthcoming invasion of Britain\u2019s estimated 120m brown rats. \u201cNo house is completely rodent-proof.\u201d Are rat numbers on the rise? \u201cNo,\u201d says Prof Richard Ashley, a professor of urban water at the University of Sheffield. Ashley has researched the UK\u2019s rat population in our sewer systems. Ashley tells me that it\u2019s difficult to verify the 120m figure, but all the evidence shows that the UK\u2019s rat population has remained relatively stable.

I\u2019m 45 now and live just south of the city in Greystones, County Wicklow, on the glorious coast.</p> <p><strong>The thing I love most about my city is \u2026<br></strong>It\u2019s a small, raw city with this really rich fabric. In the space of a couple of hundred yards you can pass from modern to Victorian and Georgian-era buildings and get lost down alleys with medieval roots. It\u2019s full of rabbit holes and conversations that start, and before you know it you\u2019re way away from the plan you set out with.</p> <p><strong>If a friend is coming to stay, I\u2019ll always take them to \u2026<br></strong>Capel Street, which you won\u2019t find on traditional walking tours. It used to be Dublin\u2019s most fashionable street but fell into disrepair. Now there\u2019s a resurgence of independent businesses there today, including <a href=\"https://brotherhubbard.ie/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brother Hubbard</a>, one of my favourite brunch spots, and <a href=\"http://www.camerino.ie/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Camerino</a>, a gorgeous bakery and cafe. There\u2019s also a load of really random stores \u2013 a Brazilian grocery shop and a hardware shop, for example \u2013 dotted along the way. It\u2019s one of those streets where every building feels like it\u2019s from a different era.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"8d295f2caae8dd65643fe9b5ac541d12123121c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d295f2caae8dd65643fe9b5ac541d12123121c0/0_0_2480_3100/800.jpg\" alt=\"P\u00f3l \u00d3 Conghaile: \u2018Dublin is a living, breathing cultural crossroads.\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">P\u00f3l \u00d3 Conghaile: \u2018Dublin is a living, breathing cultural crossroads.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"1b81e6c94264f8b44476401e8b052ccfb8109dfd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b81e6c94264f8b44476401e8b052ccfb8109dfd/2167_408_2795_3494/800.jpg\" alt=\"Camerino Bakery, Capel Street, Dublin: Caryna Camerino\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caryna Camerino outside her bakery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Breithaupt/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37667dba8030a28fb347e5cd5fc2e02fda9e44f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37667dba8030a28fb347e5cd5fc2e02fda9e44f5/0_0_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Camerino Bakery, Capel Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Camerino Bakery, Capel Street.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Breithaupt/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Caryna Camerino outside her cafe and bakery on Capel Street</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Art lovers should head to \u2026<br></strong>The <a href=\"http://www.hughlane.ie/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hugh Lane gallery</a> has great Jack Yeats paintings but the highlight for me is Francis Bacon\u2019s studio, which was airlifted down to the last paintbrush and rag from his mews in London and reassembled in the gallery.

      "bodyText": "Home is \u2026 I grew up in County Galway, but I was born in Dublin and came back to Trinity College to study \u2013 and stayed. I\u2019m 45 now and live just south of the city in Greystones, County Wicklow, on the glorious coast. The thing I love most about my city is \u2026 It\u2019s a small, raw city with this really rich fabric. In the space of a couple of hundred yards you can pass from modern to Victorian and Georgian-era buildings and get lost down alleys with medieval roots. It\u2019s full of rabbit holes and conversations that start, and before you know it you\u2019re way away from the plan you set out with. If a friend is coming to stay, I\u2019ll always take them to \u2026 Capel Street, which you won\u2019t find on traditional walking tours. It used to be Dublin\u2019s most fashionable street but fell into disrepair. Now there\u2019s a resurgence of independent businesses there today, including Brother Hubbard, one of my favourite brunch spots, and Camerino, a gorgeous bakery and cafe. There\u2019s also a load of really random stores \u2013 a Brazilian grocery shop and a hardware shop, for example \u2013 dotted along the way. It\u2019s one of those streets where every building feels like it\u2019s from a different era. Caryna Camerino outside her cafe and bakery on Capel Street Art lovers should head to \u2026 The Hugh Lane gallery has great Jack Yeats paintings but the highlight for me is Francis Bacon\u2019s studio, which was airlifted down to the last paintbrush and rag from his mews in London and reassembled in the gallery. It\u2019s an unholy mess and fascinating to peer into. IMMA, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, down in Kilmainham, is in the west of the city where not a lot of people get out to, but it\u2019s a great counterpoint to the National Gallery and all the old-school stuff. Music lovers should head to \u2026 Dublin is a living, breathing cultural crossroads. One example of that is the Secret Book and Record Store on Wicklow Street, where a sandwich board on the pavement directs you into a cavern-like space. Then there\u2019s All City on Crow Street in Temple Bar, which is a vanguard of Dublin\u2019s underground hip-hop and dance scene that doubles as a vinyl store and sells spray paints to street artists. Fashion lovers should check out \u2026 The Powerscourt Centre is this lovely intimate shopping mall bang in the middle of the city, with great design stores. There\u2019s a shop called Atrium with stuff by lots of great Irish designers, including Chupi for jewellery and Jill De B\u00farca, who does amazing modern embroidery. Atrium at the Powerscourt Centre sells work by Irish designers My go-to coffee shop is \u2026 There\u2019s one called Laine, My Love on Talbot Street right by my office. It\u2019s a really rough and ready street with a mix of dereliction and old department stores and tattoo parlours and in the middle of it these guys have opened recently selling sandwiches and coffee from Roasted Brown \u2013 Roasters + Makers in County Wicklow. Get the best brunch at \u2026 Meet Me in the Morning on Pleasants Street. It\u2019s very pared back and minimalist but authentic, and doesn\u2019t do the traditional Irish breakfast. You\u2019ll find fresh leaves and chorizo from West Cork and artisan sourdough, but it\u2019s not pretentious or overpriced. Or there\u2019s Brother Hubbard on Capel Street, which does a great mix of Middle Eastern and Irish cuisine. Brother Hubbard on Capel Street does a mean brunch For an extra-special evening \u2026 I\u2019d start at a place called Taste at Rustic by Dylan McGrath on South Great George\u2019s Street that does a really cool mix of Irish and Japanese food \u2013 or, if it\u2019s a really special occasion, the best chef in the city is Mickael Viljanen at Greenhouse on Dawson Street.

Now, let\u2019s make something clear: Brandt has full license to extend forgiveness to the woman who shot and killed his brother. But what cannot be ignored is the way whiteness often operates in a moment like this, effectively dismissing the victim, and centering the white person\u2019s experience of the incident.</p> <p>These moments are continually usurped as avenues for white redemption, with black victims being asked to \u201cmake nice\u201d with the perpetrators of their trauma. It\u2019s like the boy on the playground who you had to apologize to, because all of a sudden he\u2019s upset that he got in trouble for hitting you. And what\u2019s worse? Black people are <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thedailyshow/videos/2291091921018183/?v=2291091921018183\">never afforded</a> the same kind of empathy within the US criminal justice system. Ever.</p> <p>It\u2019s something we have long bemoaned, especially as more and more of these incidents unfold in public view. Writer Jemelle Hill tackled the topic in a 2018 op-ed in the Atlantic titled <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/12/problem-when-they-go-low-we-go-high/577543/\">Sometimes I Wish the Obamas Wouldn\u2019t Go High</a>.</p> <p>Hill, speaking about Michelle Obama\u2019s mantra \u201cWhen they go low, we go high\u201d, wrote: \u201cI sometimes wonder if the people who often cite that quote have a full understanding of the emotional toll it takes on people of color to have to constantly absolve the racism directed at them.\u201d</p> <p>Coined during the 2016 election, Obama\u2019s phrase has become the rallying cry of black people everywhere, acting as a handy stress ball or meditation spell whenever we are confronted with (usually racial) unpleasantness.</p> <p>Sadly, this low-high binary almost always ends up in service to whiteness. Not only does it absolve the guilt and responsibility of the offending party, it also works to make black people complicit in the accountability process. Why do I have to continually stifle my outrage, anger, pain or trauma just to make you feel OK about getting your just reward?</p> <p>And speaking of justice and consequences, Judge Kemp\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jemelehill/status/1179529295426834432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fus%2Fjudges-embrace-of-convicted-murder-amber-guyger-in-courtroom-causes-stir\">conduct </a>also bears particular mentioning. It says a lot about this specific racial dynamic not just on the ground, but throughout our higher institutions. Kemp has since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/08/amber-guyger-case-judge-defends-hugging-former-police-officer\">defended </a>herself, telling the Associated Press: \u201cI came down to extend my condolences to the Jean family and to encourage Ms Guyger, because she has a lot of life to live.\u201d Despite the fact that a complaint has been filed against her with Texas authorities because of the gesture, Kemp stands by her decision.</p> <p>The discomfort around the courtroom gestures was also later echoed by Botham\u2019s mother. Shortly after the hearing, Allison Jean <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amber-guyger-trial-botham-jeans-mother-reacts-to-sentencing-and-emotional-hug/\">told CBS</a> News\u2019s Omar Villafranca that she was surprised by the moment. \u201cWhat Brandt did was to cleanse his heart towards Amber. I do not want it to be misconstrued as a complete forgiveness of everybody.\u201d As she points out, there are plenty of people to blame for what happened to her son, but that responsibility is not just Guyger\u2019s.</p> <p>For me, framing these types of incidents as \u201cteachable moments\u201d not only puts the onus on black victims to concede in some way to their abusers. It also suggests that black people be somehow remorseful that someone is actually facing consequences for the harm they have suffered.</p> <p>Black people deserve justice, and we shouldn\u2019t have to apologize for getting it.</p> <ul> <li><p>Tayo Bero is a freelance journalist</p></li> </ul>",

It\u2019s something we have long bemoaned, especially as more and more of these incidents unfold in public view. Writer Jemelle Hill tackled the topic in a 2018 op-ed in the Atlantic titled Sometimes I Wish the Obamas Wouldn\u2019t Go High. Hill, speaking about Michelle Obama\u2019s mantra \u201cWhen they go low, we go high\u201d, wrote: \u201cI sometimes wonder if the people who often cite that quote have a full understanding of the emotional toll it takes on people of color to have to constantly absolve the racism directed at them.\u201d Coined during the 2016 election, Obama\u2019s phrase has become the rallying cry of black people everywhere, acting as a handy stress ball or meditation spell whenever we are confronted with (usually racial) unpleasantness. Sadly, this low-high binary almost always ends up in service to whiteness. Not only does it absolve the guilt and responsibility of the offending party, it also works to make black people complicit in the accountability process. Why do I have to continually stifle my outrage, anger, pain or trauma just to make you feel OK about getting your just reward? And speaking of justice and consequences, Judge Kemp\u2019s conduct also bears particular mentioning. It says a lot about this specific racial dynamic not just on the ground, but throughout our higher institutions. Kemp has since defended herself, telling the Associated Press: \u201cI came down to extend my condolences to the Jean family and to encourage Ms Guyger, because she has a lot of life to live.\u201d Despite the fact that a complaint has been filed against her with Texas authorities because of the gesture, Kemp stands by her decision. The discomfort around the courtroom gestures was also later echoed by Botham\u2019s mother. Shortly after the hearing, Allison Jean told CBS News\u2019s Omar Villafranca that she was surprised by the moment. \u201cWhat Brandt did was to cleanse his heart towards Amber. I do not want it to be misconstrued as a complete forgiveness of everybody.\u201d As she points out, there are plenty of people to blame for what happened to her son, but that responsibility is not just Guyger\u2019s. For me, framing these types of incidents as \u201cteachable moments\u201d not only puts the onus on black victims to concede in some way to their abusers. It also suggests that black people be somehow remorseful that someone is actually facing consequences for the harm they have suffered. Black people deserve justice, and we shouldn\u2019t have to apologize for getting it. Tayo Bero is a freelance journalist",

John B Goodenough of the University of Texas at Austin, M Stanley Whittingham of Binghamton University and Akira Yoshino of Meijo University will receive equal shares of the 9m Swedish kronor (\u00a374o,000) prize, which was announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm on Wednesday.

Wycombe Wanderers manager Gareth Ainsworth is the early favourite to replace Ross and would almost certainly be a popular appointment coming as he does armed with decent managerial credentials, a reputation as a top bloke <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2019/oct/02/gareth-ainsworth-wycombe-football-league\">who drives an American muscle car</a> and fronts a rock band named Cold Blooded Hearts. He\u2019s been operating for seven years on a shoestring at Wycombe, where he insists he is happy, but has made no secret of his hope to manage a club with loftier ambitions. Including caretakers, Sunderland are now looking to recruit their 11th manager in 10 years and, if only by the law of averages, should surely hit upon one that can stop the wheels from coming off the clown car sooner rather than later.

      "bodyText": "A MYSTERY FOR WAGATHA CHRISTIE? While there is little or no shame in being sacked from your job as manager of the basket case club that is Sunderland, it is a measure of just how far the club has fallen that news of Jack Ross\u2019s dismissal has been completely overshadowed by Coleen Rooney. Wayne\u2019s better half has had Social Media Disgrace Twitter in thrall after doing her best Jessica Fletcher impersonation to identify and expose a source of treachery, who has allegedly been peddling salacious and entirely false t1ttle-tattle about her to the tabloid press. Using tactics so simple, yet brilliantly planned and ruthless she should immediately be installed among the favourites to succeed Ross, Mrs Rooney says she trapped and identified the unwitting owner of the only Instachat account that was privy to the posts in question, forcing the woman behind it into a very public denial that she was the rat. Tasked with following that, The Fiver was hoping for less thin gruel than a League One side\u2019s search for a new manager, but it being international week we can only play the rubbish cards chucked our way by the dealer. Sixth in League One despite being the best funded team in the division and in dire need of a return to the Championship, Sunderland announced the decision to sack Ross after 18 months at the helm on Tuesday. \u201cThis has been a decision that has been made with a heavy heart,\u201d parped chairman Stewart Donald, who is currently gyrating lasciviously in the Alan Partridge-in-a-leather-thong-style before a cabal of uber-rich American investors, who many fans of the club believe have cooled their interest because \u2026 well, we\u2019ve all seen that documentary on Netflix and good things tend not to happen to Sunderland. Or do they? Wycombe Wanderers manager Gareth Ainsworth is the early favourite to replace Ross and would almost certainly be a popular appointment coming as he does armed with decent managerial credentials, a reputation as a top bloke who drives an American muscle car and fronts a rock band named Cold Blooded Hearts. He\u2019s been operating for seven years on a shoestring at Wycombe, where he insists he is happy, but has made no secret of his hope to manage a club with loftier ambitions. Including caretakers, Sunderland are now looking to recruit their 11th manager in 10 years and, if only by the law of averages, should surely hit upon one that can stop the wheels from coming off the clown car sooner rather than later. Ainsworth may well be the man, but for those of you who lost interest in this story halfway through the second paragraph, we can reveal it\u2019s \u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cJust women going to the stadium will break a taboo for the hardliners in Iran. Their eyes are going to be [getting] used to seeing women inside the stadium.

Do say: \u201cI liked environmental activism before it was cool.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cAt this stage, maybe we should just buy a new environment.\u201d",

Following a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/08/england-women-portugal-international-friendly-matcn-report\" title=\"\">gritty win against Portugal</a> he was bullish about England\u2019s progress: \u201cThe performances over the last two games in my opinion have been outstanding,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m pleased with the players, I\u2019m pleased with the spirit, I\u2019m pleased with the direction that we\u2019re going.\u201d</p> <p>Except this was not an outstanding performance. It was a disjointed one. The Lionesses were wasteful up front and struggled to stretch or break down a well-organised Portuguese defence. The goal was lucky: a gift from goalkeeper Patr\u00edcia Morais who spilled the ball into Beth Mead\u2019s path for a simple tap-in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/08/england-women-portugal-international-friendly-matcn-report\">Beth Mead snatches win for England after Morais\u2019s goalkeeping howler</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Lionesses were overdue a bit of luck but \u2013 regardless of the lengthy list of absentees \u2013 with one of the biggest national team investments in the world, one of the only fully professional leagues, and a deepening player pool, they should not be struggling against a country 26 places below them in the Fifa world rankings. Yes, teams will bunker in against them, they are \u201ca scalp\u201d, as Neville has said, but how many times can you be scalped before questions are asked about the wounds?</p> <p>Neville\u2019s distortion of the narrative of games is sounding more and more delusional and is becoming increasingly frustrating. The win against Portugal was extremely tough. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/05/england-women-brazil-friendly-international-match-report\" title=\"\">loss to Brazil on Saturday</a> was actually a much more rounded performance but lacking the clinical final ball and containing the lapses in concentration that have become too frequent.</p> <p>Asked about when the process will end and England will start showing the consistency expected of a top team he gave an interesting reply after Tuesday\u2019s game: \u201cMaybe Euro 2021, maybe the Olympics, we\u2019re building for the biggest stages, Wembley [and the friendly against Germany] is a big stage next month and we want to perform,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re planning to win a gold medal in Japan, we\u2019re planning to win a home Euros.\u201d</p> <p>That is a long time to wait for results. A very long time. It is 20 months into Neville\u2019s tenure and supporters are being asked to wait roughly another 22 months. The manager had not won one of the five games before Tuesday\u2019s victory and some of his squad selections, with in-form players often left out, have rightly been questioned.</p> <p>Neville said on Monday that he could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/07/phil-neville-would-leave-england-if-it-was-right-lionesses\" title=\"\">take journalists and fans questioning his methods</a> and the team\u2019s performances but he does not seem able to handle the criticism. Instead of letting it wash over him, or treating it as constructive or honest opinion, he is wildly lashing out. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/07/phil-neville-would-leave-england-if-it-was-right-lionesses\" title=\"\">After the defeat to Brazil he said</a>: \u201cI read some shocking reports about it being a slow performance, like \u2018the football was tepid\u2019 \u2013 that football wasn\u2019t \u2018tepid\u2019 on Saturday.\u201d The report in question did not even say it was poor, just lukewarm. Yet that same journalist was the focus of his attentions after the win in Set\u00fabal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3aac019001d908fbedc14afaefce6dd47f5d8385\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3aac019001d908fbedc14afaefce6dd47f5d8385/0_0_4436_2981/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England celebrate Beth Mead\u2019s goal against Portugal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England celebrate Beth Mead\u2019s goal against Portugal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chloe Knott for The FA/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPhil, we\u2019ve all been talking about the five games without a win \u2013 now that run is over, what have you learned from it to take forward?\u201d he was asked.</p> <p>\u201cYou wanted me sacked didn\u2019t you?\u201d was his aggressive reply. \u201cThat\u2019s what you put in your article the other day, you wanted me sacked.\u201d The journalist clarified that she had not.

I read it,\u201d he continued. It seemed as if he had just been waiting for an I-told-you-so moment, and that a narrow win against Portugal would have to do. It was not dissimilar to what he <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">said after the victory against Norway</a> in September, when he also defended his record: \u201cThe risks we took last year in terms of rotations, I don\u2019t see many managers in world football doing that in the women\u2019s game,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see many managers in women\u2019s football playing the types of short corners we play, taking the risks we do on the field in terms of expansiveness.

      "bodyText": "Sometimes it can feel like Phil Neville is speaking a different language. Following a gritty win against Portugal he was bullish about England\u2019s progress: \u201cThe performances over the last two games in my opinion have been outstanding,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m pleased with the players, I\u2019m pleased with the spirit, I\u2019m pleased with the direction that we\u2019re going.\u201d Except this was not an outstanding performance. It was a disjointed one. The Lionesses were wasteful up front and struggled to stretch or break down a well-organised Portuguese defence. The goal was lucky: a gift from goalkeeper Patr\u00edcia Morais who spilled the ball into Beth Mead\u2019s path for a simple tap-in. The Lionesses were overdue a bit of luck but \u2013 regardless of the lengthy list of absentees \u2013 with one of the biggest national team investments in the world, one of the only fully professional leagues, and a deepening player pool, they should not be struggling against a country 26 places below them in the Fifa world rankings. Yes, teams will bunker in against them, they are \u201ca scalp\u201d, as Neville has said, but how many times can you be scalped before questions are asked about the wounds? Neville\u2019s distortion of the narrative of games is sounding more and more delusional and is becoming increasingly frustrating. The win against Portugal was extremely tough. The loss to Brazil on Saturday was actually a much more rounded performance but lacking the clinical final ball and containing the lapses in concentration that have become too frequent. Asked about when the process will end and England will start showing the consistency expected of a top team he gave an interesting reply after Tuesday\u2019s game: \u201cMaybe Euro 2021, maybe the Olympics, we\u2019re building for the biggest stages, Wembley [and the friendly against Germany] is a big stage next month and we want to perform,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re planning to win a gold medal in Japan, we\u2019re planning to win a home Euros.\u201d That is a long time to wait for results. A very long time. It is 20 months into Neville\u2019s tenure and supporters are being asked to wait roughly another 22 months. The manager had not won one of the five games before Tuesday\u2019s victory and some of his squad selections, with in-form players often left out, have rightly been questioned. Neville said on Monday that he could take journalists and fans questioning his methods and the team\u2019s performances but he does not seem able to handle the criticism. Instead of letting it wash over him, or treating it as constructive or honest opinion, he is wildly lashing out. After the defeat to Brazil he said: \u201cI read some shocking reports about it being a slow performance, like \u2018the football was tepid\u2019 \u2013 that football wasn\u2019t \u2018tepid\u2019 on Saturday.\u201d The report in question did not even say it was poor, just lukewarm. Yet that same journalist was the focus of his attentions after the win in Set\u00fabal. \u201cPhil, we\u2019ve all been talking about the five games without a win \u2013 now that run is over, what have you learned from it to take forward?\u201d he was asked. \u201cYou wanted me sacked didn\u2019t you?\u201d was his aggressive reply. \u201cThat\u2019s what you put in your article the other day, you wanted me sacked.\u201d The journalist clarified that she had not. She had merely, like many others, pointed out that after five games without a win Hope Powell was sacked in 2013 \u2013 that run included slumping out of a major tournament with a single point. \u201cYes you did, I read it. I read it,\u201d he continued. It seemed as if he had just been waiting for an I-told-you-so moment, and that a narrow win against Portugal would have to do. It was not dissimilar to what he said after the victory against Norway in September, when he also defended his record: \u201cThe risks we took last year in terms of rotations, I don\u2019t see many managers in world football doing that in the women\u2019s game,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see many managers in women\u2019s football playing the types of short corners we play, taking the risks we do on the field in terms of expansiveness. That takes courage and bravery \u2026\u201d He continued: \u201cWe made nine changes against Japan [in the SheBelieves Cup]. For a game we needed to win, to win a trophy that we\u2019ve never won before. People would have criticised me but I was brave enough to make those decisions because I trusted the players and they trusted me \u2026 I have a vision that no one else has. I\u2019ve got bravery that no other coach has. So thank your lucky stars. I think with the players we\u2019ve got we can go far.\u201d He was dismayed with how his comments were taken. During his England tenure Neville has not come across as arrogant, but rather as a person who speaks before he thinks and does not always compute the consequences of his words until he has reflected on them later. There can be sympathy towards that because there is an honesty there, but many will lose patience when it becomes a repeat problem, both in him as a person and a manager. For someone so frustrated by criticism and words, it is somewhat ironic that he is talking himself out of the job faster than his players can play him out of it.

      "body": "<p>The European Union is no topic for a novel. It\u2019s not fiction. It\u2019s boring. That\u2019s what everyone told me when I began writing <a href=\"https://www.europaeditions.co.uk/book/9781787702097/our-europe\">Our Europe: Banquet of Nations</a>. So why did I decide to go ahead in spite of everything? Because I belong to a generation born with the notion that the construction of Europe would be the lasting, unchanging political framework of our lives as citizens. Now this same generation may witness its disintegration.</p> <p>Today\u2019s Europe is cut off from its own people, and no longer knows how to arouse political enthusiasm. All we see now is its unwieldiness; we forget the utopia at its heart. And yet I remain convinced that, despite our often legitimate anger and frustration with the slowness and dissension within the EU, it remains the most astonishing political adventure of recent decades. Where else and when have 28 countries decided, freely and democratically, to join their fates together?</p> <p>I opted for the form of a poem rather than an essay, because I believe that the language of poetry is best suited to tell the story of the ashes and utopia from which we were born. Our Europe: Banquet of Nations is a long narrative poem about how one can still want to be European today, and ardently. Here are 10 books that have shaped Europe as we know it.</p> <p><strong>1. The Iliad and the Odyssey by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/homer\">Homer</a><br></strong>I\u2019m cheating a little by beginning with these two. But how can I not? From the very beginning there have been wars and voyages, interminable fighting and then the long wandering that follows victory. The Iliad and the Odyssey have engendered so many other works, appeared in other forms, been re-examined (from Virgil to Joyce), that, when it comes to literature, they are Europe\u2019s shared foundation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b40e307ac018c17f790a83d857ecac3b0ea0518\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b40e307ac018c17f790a83d857ecac3b0ea0518/0_32_2600_1559/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Austrian author Stefan Zweig, pictured circa 1920.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Austrian author Stefan Zweig, pictured circa 1920.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imagno/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://zweigatfredonia.com/2016/03/15/messages-from-a-lost-world-new-collection-of-zweig-essays-reviewed-in-the-nation/\">The Sleepless World by Stefan Zweig</a></strong><strong><br></strong>Zweig is our great, worried European. His entire opus could find its place on a reading list about Europe, but I like this essay (published in <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2016/03/30/review-stefan-zweig-messages-lost-world-europe-brink\">Messages from a Lost World: Europe on the Brink</a>) because it develops the motifs of insomnia and nervousness. Zweig sensed the world around him was becoming agitated, and that this would lead to bloodshed.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/03/featuresreviews.guardianreview22\">The Leopard by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa</a><br></strong>I cannot talk about Europe without mentioning the Mediterranean, and The Leopard is one of the greatest Mediterranean novels. It has been unjustly overshadowed in recent years by Visconti\u2019s fine film; one must read Lampedusa to immerse oneself in these southern lands where splendour and misery live side by side, and to understand that our heritage is one of both blood and light.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a58114f5cbfea3e6b05d2961849921cafe9001a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a58114f5cbfea3e6b05d2961849921cafe9001a1/0_119_5134_3081/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Londons National Theatre stages Brecht\u2019s Threepenny Opera in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Londons National Theatre stages Brecht\u2019s Threepenny Opera in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>4. The Threepenny Opera by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/21/bertolt-brecht-hero-michael-hofmann\">Bertolt Brecht</a><br></strong>Read it, listen to it, or see it performed: Brecht\u2019s cheeky voice and Kurt Weill\u2019s music remind us that our works must never forget the people. And when I think of The Threepenny Opera, I cannot help but think of the production by Giorgio Strehler \u2013 another great figure of European culture \u2013 which I saw in Paris in 1986, at the age of 14, and which I shall never forget.</p> <p><strong>5. Discourse on Colonialism by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/21/3\">Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire</a><br></strong>I love this text. I often go back to it: one must read it over and over to be reminded of what Europe did when it reigned over the world. Each country wanted to go farther and faster than its neighbours, when it came to colonial predation. It is part of our history. And C\u00e9saire reminds us of this, in an enraged and poetic language, and with a mad energy.</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/jul/16/the-truce-how-primo-levi-rediscovered-humanity-after-auschwitz\">The Truce by Primo Levi</a><br></strong>I could have chosen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/22/primo-levi-auschwitz-if-this-is-a-man-memoir-70-years\">If This Is a Man</a>, a sober and clinical telling of our great black hole. But The Truce sheds light on an a lesser-known, less debated aspect of the Holocaust: the return.

      "bodyText": "The European Union is no topic for a novel. It\u2019s not fiction. It\u2019s boring. That\u2019s what everyone told me when I began writing Our Europe: Banquet of Nations. So why did I decide to go ahead in spite of everything? Because I belong to a generation born with the notion that the construction of Europe would be the lasting, unchanging political framework of our lives as citizens. Now this same generation may witness its disintegration. Today\u2019s Europe is cut off from its own people, and no longer knows how to arouse political enthusiasm. All we see now is its unwieldiness; we forget the utopia at its heart. And yet I remain convinced that, despite our often legitimate anger and frustration with the slowness and dissension within the EU, it remains the most astonishing political adventure of recent decades. Where else and when have 28 countries decided, freely and democratically, to join their fates together? I opted for the form of a poem rather than an essay, because I believe that the language of poetry is best suited to tell the story of the ashes and utopia from which we were born. Our Europe: Banquet of Nations is a long narrative poem about how one can still want to be European today, and ardently. Here are 10 books that have shaped Europe as we know it. 1. The Iliad and the Odyssey by Homer I\u2019m cheating a little by beginning with these two. But how can I not? From the very beginning there have been wars and voyages, interminable fighting and then the long wandering that follows victory. The Iliad and the Odyssey have engendered so many other works, appeared in other forms, been re-examined (from Virgil to Joyce), that, when it comes to literature, they are Europe\u2019s shared foundation. 2. The Sleepless World by Stefan Zweig Zweig is our great, worried European. His entire opus could find its place on a reading list about Europe, but I like this essay (published in Messages from a Lost World: Europe on the Brink) because it develops the motifs of insomnia and nervousness. Zweig sensed the world around him was becoming agitated, and that this would lead to bloodshed. 3. The Leopard by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa I cannot talk about Europe without mentioning the Mediterranean, and The Leopard is one of the greatest Mediterranean novels. It has been unjustly overshadowed in recent years by Visconti\u2019s fine film; one must read Lampedusa to immerse oneself in these southern lands where splendour and misery live side by side, and to understand that our heritage is one of both blood and light. 4. The Threepenny Opera by Bertolt Brecht Read it, listen to it, or see it performed: Brecht\u2019s cheeky voice and Kurt Weill\u2019s music remind us that our works must never forget the people. And when I think of The Threepenny Opera, I cannot help but think of the production by Giorgio Strehler \u2013 another great figure of European culture \u2013 which I saw in Paris in 1986, at the age of 14, and which I shall never forget. 5. Discourse on Colonialism by Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire I love this text. I often go back to it: one must read it over and over to be reminded of what Europe did when it reigned over the world. Each country wanted to go farther and faster than its neighbours, when it came to colonial predation. It is part of our history. And C\u00e9saire reminds us of this, in an enraged and poetic language, and with a mad energy. 6. The Truce by Primo Levi I could have chosen If This Is a Man, a sober and clinical telling of our great black hole. But The Truce sheds light on an a lesser-known, less debated aspect of the Holocaust: the return. Levi invites us to imagine what Europe was like a few months after the Allied victory: a field of ruins, full of shadows trying to return home. 7. Letters to a German Friend (in Resistance, Rebellion and Death) by Albert Camus Camus wrote these three letters in the midst of the war in 1943, while he was in the French resistance. They are a sharp and intelligent reminder of what must constitute our shared foundation: individual freedom, humanism, and the fight against barbarism. When Camus evokes this Europe, yet to be built, he calls on us to build it \u201cin the wind of intelligence\u201d. There is no finer compass. 8. In Europe by Geert Mak This book is a journey both through present-day Europe and through time. It is a gold mine of information and knowledge and, above all, a precious exercise in repeatedly changing one\u2019s point of view. This is what we are constantly learning how to do in Europe, and it is both difficult and thrilling: each history can be told from another point of view, and we are all the richer for this multiple vision. 9. Compass by Mathias \u00c9nard Like its author, Compass is big and generous. Impressively erudite, the author invites us through his main character \u2013 a sickly, insomniac Viennese orientalist and music lover \u2013 to head down the road with him on his past journeys. In the novel, Vienna and Damascus mirror each other, as do Europe and Palmyra, in a dialogue of a thousand loving exchanges between east and west. 10. The Life of Ismail Ferik Pasha: Spina Nel Cuore by Rhea Galanaki One of the countless episodes in European history with which I was unfamiliar is that of the Cretan uprising of 1866. Contemporary Greek novelist Rhea Galanaki tells us the story of Greece\u2019s struggle to throw off the Ottoman and Egyptian yoke, through the true story of two brothers who end up confronting one another. \u2022 Our Europe: Banquet of Nations by Laurent Gaud\u00e9 (translated by Alison Anderson and published by Europa, \u00a310.99).

Glengarriff\u2019s woollen mills are worth a peep for traditional sweater seekers, but be sure to take the short <a href=\"http://www.harbourqueenferry.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">boat trip</a> to the botanical delight of Garnish Island, while you\u2019re here.

The breathtaking eight-mile route spaghettis across the Caha mountains from Cork into neighbouring Kerry \u2013 with awesome panorama views from the summit.

Glengarriff\u2019s woollen mills are worth a peep for traditional sweater seekers, but be sure to take the short boat trip to the botanical delight of Garnish Island, while you\u2019re here. You may even be lucky enough to spot seals basking along the shores of Bantry Bay. From there, heading south-west on the peninsula towards Adrigole, you\u2019ll discover ancient sites such as the Leitrim Beg wedge grave, before taking in Ireland\u2019s most spectacular mountain road \u2013 the Healy Pass. The breathtaking eight-mile route spaghettis across the Caha mountains from Cork into neighbouring Kerry \u2013 with awesome panorama views from the summit. Once back on sea level, drive to the fishing pier of Killmackillogue to enjoy some fresh-off-the-trawler seafood (think mussels or fresh crab) at Helen\u2019s Bar. 22 miles Continuing south on the R571 (and back into Cork) you\u2019ll skirt coastal roads, stone walls and sheep farms, while in the distance the famous Skellig Islands burst out of the horizon like emerald pyramids.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson could be summoned by the London assembly after failing to provide details of his contact with a US businesswoman and explain how any potential conflict of interest was addressed. The assembly\u2019s oversight committee gave Johnson 14 days to explain how grants and privileged access to trade trips were awarded to Jennifer Arcuri during his time as mayor. Johnson\u2019s confidential response was sent to the watchdog on Tuesday night an hour after the initial deadline. The letter was marked \u201cconfidential and not for publication\u201d but a spokeswoman for the committee said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t answer any of our questions.\u201d The committee chair, Labour\u2019s Len Duvall, has asked for legal advice about whether the watchdog can discuss the letter at an open meeting next Wednesday. The meeting is also expected to decide whether the committee should use its powers to summon the former mayor to answer questions in person as it did over his failed garden bridge project. And it could even decide to force Johnson to hand over private text messages and emails he sent to Arcuri. Duvall said the committee planned to take the matter further. \u201cNothing in [Johnson\u2019s] response, in our opinion, reflects the need for confidentiality,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, the response is insufficient as far as our request for information is concerned. \u201cWe are focused on our investigation and considering next steps. A number of options are open to us. They include speaking to various people and using our power of summons.\u201d The committee was alarmed by revelations in the Sunday Times that Arcuri was awarded thousands of pounds in public money, including \u00a311,500 by the mayor\u2019s promotional agency London &amp; Partners. Johnson\u2019s office also intervened to give her a place on trade missions to New York and Tel Aviv with the then mayor, after she was initially turned down because she failed to meet the criteria. This week, Arcuri confirmed she shared a \u201cvery close bond\u201d with Johnson and he visited her east London flat up to 10 times, but she insisted she was not given favourable treatment by the then mayor or his officials. Last month, Duvall wrote to Johnson asking for details and a timeline of all contact with Arcuri throughout his mayoralty. He also asked for an explanation of how his \u201calleged relationship was disclosed and taken into account in any and all dealings with the GLA [Greater London Authority] and other parts of the GLA family\u201d. It is understood Johnson\u2019s confidential response failed to provide those details. The prime minister has insisted \u201cfull propriety\u201d was followed and he has no interest to declare over Arcuri. Meanwhile, the Independent Office for Police Conduct is expected to make a decision before the end of the month on whether to launch an investigation into allegations of misconduct in public office. An official at the Greater London authority formally referred the allegations to the police watchdog, because Johnson headed the mayor\u2019s office for policing and crime as part of his role. Separately, the current London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has launched an independent review of how Arcuri was given sponsorship and access to trade trips. And the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport is withholding more than half of a \u00a3100,000 grant awarded this year to Arcuri\u2019s company Hacker House, pending a review into how the money was allocated.",

The chain, which operates 35 stores and concessions in the UK and Ireland, had been seeking a buyer before being put into administration on Tuesday. Sports Direct owner, Mike Ashley, and Hilco Capital, the owner of Homebase, had been reported as potential bidders in a last-ditch attempt to sell the loss-making business kicked off by its parent company in August. Matt Smith, joint administrator for Links of London, said: \u201cThe company has had to contend with difficult trading conditions that have impacted the whole retail sector. \u201cThe directors have been seeking alternative solutions, including consideration of a CVA, refinancing or sale, but have unfortunately been unable to conclude such a transaction.\u201d A CVA is an insolvency process that allows retailers to close stores and cut their rent bills if they can reach agreement with landlords.

Last month, retailers and unions called for urgent government action to help struggling high streets as data showed the number of shops, pubs and restaurants lying empty was rising at the fastest pace in nearly a decade. There was a net decline of 1,234 in the number of chain store outlets on Britain\u2019s top 500 high streets in the first six months of this year, according to analysis by accountants PwC and high street analysts the Local Data Company (LDC). Chains including Karen Millen, Jack Wills, Bathstore, Patisserie Valerie and Debenhams have gone into administration this year after the collapse of House of Fraser, Evans Cycles, Maplin and Poundworld in 2018. Some of those chains are still in business, taken over by new operators after their collapse, but have closed outlets. About 57,000 retail jobs disappeared in the three months to August compared with the same period in 2018. In August, Folli Follie confirmed it had appointed advisory firms Deloitte and Savigny Partners to look at potential sale options for the jewellery retailer.

      "bodyText": "Finally, European stock markets have shrugged off this morning\u2019s pessimism, closing higher tonight. The FTSE 100 has finished 23 points higher at 7,166, up 0.3%. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says hopes of a limited trade deal lifted equities: Traders breathed a sigh of relief that there were no more negative headlines ahead of the US \u2013 Sino trade talks, due to start tomorrow. With the Trump administration blacklisting 28 Chinese tech firms and limiting Chinese officials visa the talks had looked destined to fail even before they had begun. However, more recently this afternoon, reports are circulating that China is still interested in achieving a deal, just a much more limited deal and on the condition that no more tariffs are imposed by Trump. This would not be the broad trade agreement that could put an end to the trade dispute; optimism for such a deal is running low. However, the markets would accept a limited deal as a significant improvement from the current situation. But let\u2019s not forget we have been here many times before, where the markets are optimistic of progress only to be disappointed. Here\u2019s our news story on the rescue of Thomas Cook\u2019s retail arm by Hays Travel, the Just Go Travel operator: Just in: the number of vacancies across the US economy has dropped. According to the JOLTs survey, there were 7.051 million job openings in America in August. That\u2019s down from 7.17m in July, and weaker than the 7.19m expected. July\u2019s figures has been revised down from 7.21 million, which also indicates the US labour market isn\u2019t as strong as thought. Instant reaction: This isn\u2019t too good. Wall Street has opened higher, as investors cling onto reports that China is open to a \u2018partial trade deal\u2019. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 186 points, or around 0.7% at the open, recovering some of Tuesday\u2019s 314-point losses. Investors are still edgy, though, given the recent deterioration in relations between the US and China. Vincent Mivelaz of Swissquote predicts tense negotiations when the two sides sit down in Washington tomorrow. On the trade front, it seems that ministerial negotiations are expected to be tense following the latest announcement by the State Department to restrict visas to certain Chinese officials while prohibiting Chinese AI companies from buying products from US companies without prior approval from the US government. European markets are also up in afternoon trading: FTSE 100: up 30 points or 0.4% at 7173 German DAX: up 133 points or 1.1% at 12,103 French CAC: up 38 points or 0.7% at 5,495 The oil price is rising sharply, as Turkey announces it has begun military action in Syria. Brent crude has jumped by 1.6%, to $59.18 per barrel. The move has been expected since Donald Trump announced he was withdrawing forces from the Turkey-Syria border, and could lead to fresh military clashes in the region. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has tweeted that the operation, called Spring of Peace, will target two Kurdish groups -- the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) and the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), along with Daesh (or ISIS). The Syrian Democratic Forces, the Kurdish-led militia, has reported that Turkey has begun air strikes on civilian areas -- here\u2019s their head of press: This map shows the situation: More details here: Four years ago, the thought of paying to lend money to Greece was laughable. But today, Athens has successfully sold \u20ac487.5m of three-month bonds at an average yield of just below zero (-0.02%). That means investors paid more than the face value of the bonds, and are guaranteed to make a loss, unless they can sell the debt on at an even higher price before it matures in January 2020. Quite a turnaround from 2015, when the risk that Greece would tumble out of the eurozone drove bond yields to dangerously high levels, and triggered the introduction of capital controls. Athens\u2019 new government may see it as a vote of confidence from investors, who also flocked to an offering of 10-year debt on Tuesday. But it may also show anxiety over the global economy, with traders keen to park their money anywhere safe. Yanis Varoufakis, Greece\u2019s former finance minister, isn\u2019t optimistic: Another struggling UK retailer has fallen into administration. Today\u2019s victim is Links of London, the high street jewellery chain which employs around 350 people across the UK. It\u2019s been trying to find a buyer for months, with Sports Direct chief Mike Ashley (who else?) apparently showing an interest. Soybean prices have risen to their highest level in almost three months. The news that Beijing would offer to buy more US agricultural goods pushed the price of a bushel of the protein-packed beans to $9.27 3/4 (according to Reuters data). Apple is in the firing line in China today, for offering iPhone users an app that allows activists in Hong Kong to report police movements. The People\u2019s Daily newspaper claimed that HKmap.live \u201cfacilitates illegal behaviour,\u201d adding: \u201cIs Apple guiding Hong Kong thugs?\u201d the newspaper said. Heads-up. The FT have now corrected their story.... removing the claim that China will offer to buy an extra $10bn of US goods per year. They\u2019re now saying that Beijing would propose buying an extra 10m tonnes of soybeans, from 20m to 30m tonnes per year. That would be worth around $3.25bn at current rates -- so not quite as impressive an offer. Still a lot of soybeans, though, and a sign that China is hoping to make some progress in this week\u2019s talks. Investors are shaking off their earlier pessimism, and hoping that we might see some trade war progress after all. The New York stock exchange is now expected to open higher, but not actually claw back all Tuesday\u2019s fall. Another intriguing development -- China is apparently proposing buying an extra $10bn of American farm products. The Financial Times says that vice-premier Liu He will make the offer when he sits down in Washington tomorrow. The FT\u2019s man in Beijing, Tom Mitchell, says: Chinese officials are offering to increase annual purchases of US agricultural products by $10bn a year as they seek an interim agreement between Beijing and Washington that will stave off a new round of tariff hikes on October 15, according to people briefed on the two countries\u2019 ongoing negotiations. China\u2019s lead trade negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, is scheduled to begin two days of talks with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday, followed by a meeting with President Donald Trump on Friday if the discussions go well. \u201cLiu He is coming with real offers, it\u2019s not an empty visit,\u201d said one of the people briefed on the talks. \u201cThe Chinese are ready to de-escalate. America exported around $23bn of agricultural goods, such as soybeans, to China in 2018, so an extra $10bn would be very significant for US farmers. There\u2019s some scepticism about the idea of a partial trade deal between the US and China, despite Beijing\u2019s apparent enthusiasm. Jon Ferro of Bloomberg doesn\u2019t believe Washington will embrace the idea when talks resume tomorrow. Foreign exchange trader Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fongern points out that any partial deal could easily unravel: This London-based trader reckons the market rally will soon fizzle out... Newsflash: Global stock markets are suddenly strengthening, on a report that China is open to a \u201cpartial trade deal\u201d. A Chinese official has told Bloomberg that Beijing isn\u2019t confidence of a comprehensive agreement this week (who is?!). However, they are apparently open to the idea of a partial deal -- as long as Donald Trump didn\u2019t impose any more tariffs on goods. In return, China could offer some \u2018non-core\u2019 concessions, such as buying more US agricultural products. But it wouldn\u2019t move on key sticking points such as subsidies for Chinese firms, or the \u2018forced technology transfers\u2019 imposed on American firms hoping to break into China. Such a limited \u2018deal\u2019 wouldn\u2019t resolve the tensions between the two countries, but it could prevent things getting worse. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index has just gained almost 1%, with Germany\u2019s DAX gaining 1.3%. In London, the FTSE 100 pushed up to 7183, up 40 points or 0.55% today. The Bank of England has warned of a material risk of economic disruption from no-deal Brexit. In its latest financial policy summary, the BoE also sounds the alarm that entrenched political uncertainty is hitting the British economy and putting-off overseas investors. My colleague Richard Partington is at the Bank, and reports: Threadneedle Street said that preparations for a no-deal scenario later this month had improved over the past year, and that major British banks were ready to withstand the fallout from the disruption. However, it said business investment in Britain was faltering, financial markets and business activity would be disrupted, and that the value of British assets had come under selling pressure. Global investors are also growing increasingly reluctant to buy into commercial property and lend to high-risk UK companies, it warned, in a sign of the uncertainty facing the economy. Publishing its final financial stability report before the deadline at the end of the month, it said: \u201cAlthough actions by businesses and authorities have resulted in some improvement in the preparedness of the UK economy for a no-deal Brexit, material risks of economic disruption remain.\u201d \u201cFinancial stability is not the same as market stability. Significant further asset price volatility is to be expected in a disorderly Brexit.\u201d The pound has come under sharp selling pressure in recent days as hopes of a deal between Britain and the EU fade. The Bank\u2019s financial policy committee (FPC) also warned Facebook that its Libra cryptocurrency would need to meet tough regulations before it could launch the payments system in Britain. In a warning shot to the social media company, it said that digital wallets used for holding the digital currency would need to meet the same safety standards as the rules for regular bank accounts. \u201cIf payment tokens were used widely to facilitate routine payments, they should have the same level of operational resilience and safeguarding as the use of debit cards to make payments from current accounts,\u201d the Bank said. Just in: The Bank of England has warned that the trade war between the United States and China is harming the world economy. The minutes of its latest Financial Policy Committee meeting, just released, cite the dispute as the biggest short-term threat to financial stability. But it also believes banks can handle it. The Bank says: Following the latest announcements, average bilateral tariffs between the United States and China are around 20 percentage points higher than at the start of 2018. These tariffs \u2013 and the uncertainty associated with intensifying trade tensions \u2013 have contributed to slowing global growth and are likely to weigh on global growth in the coming quarters. The trade war has also increased downside risks to the global outlook. Global growth could slow more sharply if the trade war were to lead to a tightening of financial conditions or to further reductions in business confidence and investment. A broadening of the trade war beyond tariff measures to restrictions on technology and capital, and to other jurisdictions, would magnify global risks and fragment the global economy. Even if a protectionist-driven global slowdown were to spill over to the UK at the same time as a worst-case disorderly Brexit, the FPC judges that the core UK banking system would be strong enough to absorb, rather than amplify, the resulting economic shocks. Newsflash: Thomas Cook\u2019s entire UK retail estate has been sold, two weeks after the company collapsed. The UK\u2019s Official Receiver has just announced that Hays Travel - Britain\u2019s largest independent travel agent - is buying all Thomas Cook\u2019s 555 stores around the UK. This will \u201cproviding re-employment opportunities for a significant number of former employees\u201d of Thomas Cook, the Receiver says. It\u2019s not clear exactly how many jobs will be saved, but Hays have already recruited 421 former Thomas Cook staff, and have made offers to other employees who lost their jobs. KPMG partner Jim Tucker, who has been running Thomas Cook\u2019s retail arm since the firm folded, says it is an \u201cextremely positive outcome\u201d. It provides re-employment opportunities for a significant number of former Thomas Cook employees, and secures the future of retail sites up and down the UK high street. Over in the City, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has clawed back some of yesterday\u2019s losses. The blue-chip index has gained 16 points, or 0.2%, to 7,162, having lost 54 points yesterday. Just East, the takeaway firm, is leading the rally after its Netherlands-based rival - and suitor - Takeaway.com posted strong results; an 87% increase in third-quarter orders on Wednesday, driven by organic growth and acquisitions. Back in July, Just Eat agreed to be taken over by Takeaway.com in a \u00a39bn deal, which will create a fast food delivery giant. Heads-up: Reuters is reporting that China is considering blocking US visitors with \u201canti-China links\u201d from getting visas. That would be a retaliation to America\u2019s new visa restrictions on Chinese officials, over the Xinjiang crackdown. It also underlines how relations between Beijing and Washington are heading south. Reuters says: China is planning tighter visa restrictions for U.S. nationals with ties to anti-China groups, people with knowledge of the proposed curbs said, following similar U.S. restrictions on Chinese nationals, as relations between the countries sour. China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security has for months been working on rules to limit the ability of anyone employed, or sponsored, by U.S. intelligence services and human rights groups to travel to China. The proposed changes follow the introduction by the United States of tighter rules for visas for Chinese scholars in May. New U.S. visa restrictions announced on Tuesday, on Chinese government and Communist Party officials the United States believes responsible for the detention or abuse of Muslim minorities, had bolstered the case for the new Chinese restrictions, one of the sources said. \u201cThis is not something we want to do but we don\u2019t seem to have any choice,\u201d the source said. Here\u2019s the full story: Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at financial services firm Northern Trust, has told CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d show that a trade war breakthrough looks unlikely It is clear from just the events of today and recent days that the trade negotiations with China are definitely not getting any closer to resolution. If anything, they\u2019re getting further away,\u201d David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, says trade war \u201cwoes\u201d are making traders a little scared. At the start of the week, Beijing made it clear they won\u2019t be compromising on industrial policy or government subsidies. Liu He, China\u2019s vice premier, will be leading the next round of trade discussions, but he will not carry the \u2018special envoy\u2019 title. The US government has put visa restrictions on Chinese officials as a response to China\u2019s treatment of the muslim community in Xinjiang. Beijing called on the US to keep out of Chinese internal affairs, which put pressure on stocks in Asia. When you add that to the mix, you can see why traders aren\u2019t overly optimistic for the trade talks that will take place tomorrow. Its\u2019s not a great sign that tensions are already creeping up in advance of the negotiations, but at least they are going ahead. Trade war anxieties knocked some Asia-Pacific stock markets into the red today. Australia is closely reliant on the Chinese economy. It\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX index lost 0.7% with consumer-focused companies, energy firms and miners leading the fallers. Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell 0.6%, and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng lost 0.7%. However the Shanghai Composite ended the day higher, up 0.4%, despite the rising tensions with the US. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Hopes of a breakthrough in the US-China trade war are fading, even before the two side sit down for their latest attempt to resolve a dispute that is hurting the world economy badly. Relations between the two countries appear to be deteriorating, with America imposing fresh curbs on Chinese companies -- and Beijing threatening to hit back. China\u2019s vice-premier, Liu He, is leading a delegation of major economic officials for a new round of high-stakes trade talks with US counterparts in Washington on Thursday and Friday. But those talks are being overshadowed by America\u2019s decision to blacklist Chinese technology companies from buying US-made goods, over alleged human rights abuses against Muslim groups. The US has also imposed visa restrictions on Chinese government and Communist party officials over their actions in the Xinjiang region, where more than a million Uighur people have been detained in camps. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared that China must end its \u201cdraconian surveillance and repression\u201d, saying: \u201cThe United States calls on the People\u2019s Republic of China to immediately end its campaign of repression in Xinjiang, release all those arbitrarily detained, and cease efforts to coerce members of Chinese Muslim minority groups residing abroad to return to China to face an uncertain fate. China\u2019s commerce ministry has swiftly hit back, telling Washington to drop its sanctions and stop making \u201cirresponsible remarks\u201d. It also threatened to take \u201cnecessary measures\u201d to protect Chinese interests; a warning that US companies could face reciprocal sanctions? Even America\u2019s basketball players and cartoonist have been dragged into the spat. Chinese broadcasters are refusing to show Houston Rockets games after a team executive tweeted support for Hong Kong protesters, while South Park is being censored following an episode making fun of, er, Chinese censorship. The atmosphere is hardly conducive for a breakthrough that could see tariffs lifted. Chinese media have even suggested that Liu He\u2019s delegation could return from Washington a day early! Not encouraging. So, understandably, Wall Street fell yesterday, with the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 both losing over 1%. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank adds: Trade-sensitive stocks were hit hardest, with the NASDAQ down -1.67% while the Philadelphia semiconductor index fell -3.12% (its worst day since August and down to a one-month low. Also coming up We may get fresh insights into the chances of another US interest rate cut today. America\u2019s top central banker, Jerome Powell, is speaking in Kansas City at an \u201cAsk the Fed\u201d event. Yesterday Powell revealed that the Fed will restart buying US government bonds, in an attempt to prevent liquidity drying up in the markets. He insisted this wasn\u2019t a new QE-style stimulus scheme, As Rob Carnell of ING writes: What is interesting is just how vociferously Powell mentioned that this wasn\u2019t QE, saying \u201cI want to emphasis that growth of our balance sheet for reserve purposes should in no way be confused with the large-scale asset purchase programs that we deployed after the financial crisis. In no sense is this QE\u201d, Powell added. It is though, isn\u2019t it?... The Federal Reserve will also release the minutes of last month\u2019s meeting, when it cut interest rates for the second time this year. Plus, the latest JOLTS report on job vacancies may also show whether American companies are cutting back on hiring. The agenda 3pm BST: US JOLTS report on job vacancies 3.30pm BST: Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell takes part in a \u201cFed Listens\u201d event in Kansas City 7pm BST: Minutes of the September Federal Reserve\u2019s FOMC meeting released",

      "body": "<p>Although highly rated by her male peers, including Dizzy Gillespie, the Los Angeles based jazz trumpeter and vocalist Clora Bryant, who has died aged 92, recorded only twice. Her sole \u201cname\u201d album, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4l7GKWGqLg\" title=\"\">Gal With </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4l7GKWGqLg\" title=\"\">a Horn</a>, was issued in 1957, while a second recording made in 1982 merely featured her as an accompanist to the blues singer <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/arts/music/linda-hopkins-died-gospel-singer-on-broadway.html\" title=\"\">Linda Hopkins</a>.</p> <p>Reflecting on why greater recognition seemed to have been denied her, the saxophonist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/apr/30/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Teddy Edwards</a>, a frequent bandstand companion, could only say: \u201cYou know, she\u2019s as good as any man. She has range and ideas and enough talent to go to the top.\u201d</p> <p>Bryant always knew that her gender and colour would pose challenges in her desire to be taken seriously as a modern jazz trumpeter. Apart from a period in the house band at Club Alabam on Central Avenue in LA, where she backed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2015/apr/07/billie-holidays-centenary-a-life-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Billie Holiday</a>, Bryant, self-proclaimed as a \u201ctrumpetiste\u201d, was often seen, sequin-clad, in all-girl combos. It was only in her middle years that she emerged as a regular participant in the best big bands and small groups in LA and beyond.</p> <p>Hearing her play at the North Sea jazz festival in 1987 with Jeannie and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/mar/29/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Jimmy Cheatham</a>\u2019s Sweet Baby Blues Band and later at festivals in LA, was enough to confirm her status as a star jazz soloist \u2013 and to question why her recording opportunities had been so few.</p> <p>Rather remarkably, Bryant wrote directly to Mikhail Gorbachev in 1988 suggesting she might be \u201cthe first lady horn player to be invited to your country to perform\u201d. Perhaps even more strikingly, Gorbachev issued an invitation \u2013 and with the help of the LA musical community, who funded her travel, she and her sons toured Soviet Russia a year later to great acclaim.</p> <p>Born in Denison, Texas, Clora was the youngest of three children of Charles Bryant, a day labourer, and his wife, Eulila, who died when Clora was two. She took up the trumpet in high school, excited by the jazz she heard on the radio and much encouraged by her father. \u201cI\u2019m behind you all the way,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Despite offers from elite music colleges, she opted instead, in 1943, for the historically all-black <a href=\"https://www.pvamu.edu/\" title=\"\">Prairie View A&amp;M University</a> near Houston as it had an all-female big band, the Prairie View Co-Eds. She toured widely with them, eventually appearing at the Apollo theatre, Harlem, in 1944.</p> <p>When her father took a job in the LA shipyards in 1945, he moved the family permanently to the city. Once there, Bryant joined the celebrated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/jan/10/broadcasting.tvandradio1\" title=\"\">International Sweethearts of Rhythm</a> big band as a featured soloist but stayed only briefly. Entranced by the all-action scene on Central Avenue, then the centre of black show business in LA, and inspired by beboppers such as the trumpeter Howard McGhee, she impressed everyone with her powerful sound as she sought to measure herself against the best local jazz stars in the Avenue\u2019s wall-to-wall jam sessions. \u201cI\u2019d always have my horn with me. I wanted to be part of it. I wanted to learn something,\u201d she said. Once, famously, it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/mar/21/charlie-parker-julie-macdonald-sculpture\" title=\"\">Charlie Parker</a> who sat in and sagely told her: \u201cStick to what you can do. And know what you can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Rather than playing bebop or modern jazz for a living, Bryant was often typecast in all-female units such as the Queens of Rhythm, in which she played trumpet and drums simultaneously.</p> <p>She was also in the violinist <a href=\"https://music.si.edu/story/woman-violin-ginger-smock-and-los-angeles-jazz-scene\" title=\"\">Ginger Smock</a>\u2019s sextet in 1951 when they became the first all-black group to host a regular, although short-lived, TV show. After moving for a while to New York, she joined the Billy Williams Revue in Las Vegas for two years from 1960 and then teamed up with her brother the vocalist Mel Bryant in a song-and-dance act that kept going throughout the 1960s and 70s.</p> <p>Back in LA from 1979 she formed her own proper jazz group called Swi-Bop, finished her degree at UCLA and worked with Edwards in his sextet while also playing Dixieland with Roger Jamieson\u2019s New Orleanians. In a mixed bag of playing opportunities, she appeared with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/dec/13/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Bill Berry</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/15/gerald-wilson\" title=\"\">Gerald Wilson</a> big bands and took engagements with the Cheathams, the singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jun/14/guardianobituaries.musicnews\" title=\"\">Nellie Lutcher</a> and the R&amp;B pioneer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jan/19/johnny-otis\" title=\"\">Johnny Otis</a>.</p> <p>By 1992, the work had dried up \u2013 and Bryant was living with her son on social security, in a home damaged during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/22/rodney-king-riots-25-year-anniversary-los-angeles\" title=\"\">Rodney King riots</a>. After quadruple heart bypass surgery in 1996, she ceased playing the trumpet \u2013 but ever determined, began lecturing on jazz history in local colleges and grade schools.</p> <p>She often wrote about her jazz experiences, always with an emphasis on the glory days of Central Avenue, and was generous with her time to researchers like me. One project that gave her immense satisfaction was her successful campaign in 1991 to have a star dedicated to Gillespie on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p> <p>The music writer <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonard-Feather\" title=\"\">Leonard Feather </a>called Bryant \u201cone of the unsung heroines of the jazz trumpet\u201d, this neglect partly rectified when she was honoured with the Mary Lou Williams Women in Jazz award in 2002 at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC.

      "bodyText": "Although highly rated by her male peers, including Dizzy Gillespie, the Los Angeles based jazz trumpeter and vocalist Clora Bryant, who has died aged 92, recorded only twice. Her sole \u201cname\u201d album, Gal With a Horn, was issued in 1957, while a second recording made in 1982 merely featured her as an accompanist to the blues singer Linda Hopkins. Reflecting on why greater recognition seemed to have been denied her, the saxophonist Teddy Edwards, a frequent bandstand companion, could only say: \u201cYou know, she\u2019s as good as any man. She has range and ideas and enough talent to go to the top.\u201d Bryant always knew that her gender and colour would pose challenges in her desire to be taken seriously as a modern jazz trumpeter. Apart from a period in the house band at Club Alabam on Central Avenue in LA, where she backed Billie Holiday, Bryant, self-proclaimed as a \u201ctrumpetiste\u201d, was often seen, sequin-clad, in all-girl combos. It was only in her middle years that she emerged as a regular participant in the best big bands and small groups in LA and beyond. Hearing her play at the North Sea jazz festival in 1987 with Jeannie and Jimmy Cheatham\u2019s Sweet Baby Blues Band and later at festivals in LA, was enough to confirm her status as a star jazz soloist \u2013 and to question why her recording opportunities had been so few. Rather remarkably, Bryant wrote directly to Mikhail Gorbachev in 1988 suggesting she might be \u201cthe first lady horn player to be invited to your country to perform\u201d. Perhaps even more strikingly, Gorbachev issued an invitation \u2013 and with the help of the LA musical community, who funded her travel, she and her sons toured Soviet Russia a year later to great acclaim. Born in Denison, Texas, Clora was the youngest of three children of Charles Bryant, a day labourer, and his wife, Eulila, who died when Clora was two. She took up the trumpet in high school, excited by the jazz she heard on the radio and much encouraged by her father. \u201cI\u2019m behind you all the way,\u201d he said. Despite offers from elite music colleges, she opted instead, in 1943, for the historically all-black Prairie View A&amp;M University near Houston as it had an all-female big band, the Prairie View Co-Eds. She toured widely with them, eventually appearing at the Apollo theatre, Harlem, in 1944. When her father took a job in the LA shipyards in 1945, he moved the family permanently to the city. Once there, Bryant joined the celebrated International Sweethearts of Rhythm big band as a featured soloist but stayed only briefly. Entranced by the all-action scene on Central Avenue, then the centre of black show business in LA, and inspired by beboppers such as the trumpeter Howard McGhee, she impressed everyone with her powerful sound as she sought to measure herself against the best local jazz stars in the Avenue\u2019s wall-to-wall jam sessions. \u201cI\u2019d always have my horn with me. I wanted to be part of it. I wanted to learn something,\u201d she said. Once, famously, it was Charlie Parker who sat in and sagely told her: \u201cStick to what you can do. And know what you can\u2019t.\u201d Rather than playing bebop or modern jazz for a living, Bryant was often typecast in all-female units such as the Queens of Rhythm, in which she played trumpet and drums simultaneously. She was also in the violinist Ginger Smock\u2019s sextet in 1951 when they became the first all-black group to host a regular, although short-lived, TV show. After moving for a while to New York, she joined the Billy Williams Revue in Las Vegas for two years from 1960 and then teamed up with her brother the vocalist Mel Bryant in a song-and-dance act that kept going throughout the 1960s and 70s. Back in LA from 1979 she formed her own proper jazz group called Swi-Bop, finished her degree at UCLA and worked with Edwards in his sextet while also playing Dixieland with Roger Jamieson\u2019s New Orleanians. In a mixed bag of playing opportunities, she appeared with the Bill Berry and Gerald Wilson big bands and took engagements with the Cheathams, the singer Nellie Lutcher and the R&amp;B pioneer Johnny Otis. By 1992, the work had dried up \u2013 and Bryant was living with her son on social security, in a home damaged during the Rodney King riots. After quadruple heart bypass surgery in 1996, she ceased playing the trumpet \u2013 but ever determined, began lecturing on jazz history in local colleges and grade schools. She often wrote about her jazz experiences, always with an emphasis on the glory days of Central Avenue, and was generous with her time to researchers like me. One project that gave her immense satisfaction was her successful campaign in 1991 to have a star dedicated to Gillespie on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The music writer Leonard Feather called Bryant \u201cone of the unsung heroines of the jazz trumpet\u201d, this neglect partly rectified when she was honoured with the Mary Lou Williams Women in Jazz award in 2002 at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC. She was featured in the 2014 film The Girls in the Band and highlighted in the 1989 documentary Trumpetistically, Clora Bryant. She is survived by her children, April and Charles, from her marriage to the bassist Joe Stone, which ended in divorce, and Darrin and Kevin, from her relationship with the drummer Leslie Milton. \u2022 Clora Larea Bryant, jazz trumpeter, born 30 May 1927; died 25 August 2019",

It\u2019s time for it to go, before more guilty men walk free.\u201d</p> <p>She said she wanted the Scottish government to take a broader look at how the legal system served victims of sexual violence, including the requirement of corroboration \u2013 two separate sources of evidence before a case can proceed to trial \u2013 which is especially difficult for rape prosecutions where the accused argues that the sexual activity was consensual.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest impact of corroboration is preventing cases getting to court in the first place. At the very least we want to get rid of not proven, but given what we know about low conviction rates and how traumatising the court experience is for victims, it\u2019s time for a more transformative change.\u201d</p> <p>Yousaf said the study would be subject to a targeted consultation over the winter with judges, victims\u2019 groups and others.</p> <p>He said \u201cnothing is off the table\u201d in terms of potential reforms, adding: \u201cCentral to these discussions will be whether we should move from a three- to a two-verdict system.\u201d</p>",

Welcoming the landmark research, Scotland\u2019s justice secretary, Humza Yousaf, said whether to move from a three- to a two-verdict system was central to further consultation on reform. The Scottish legal system has a number of unique features \u2013 including the three-verdict system and the requirement for corroboration \u2013 which are thought to impact disproportionately on rape and sexual assault cases, leading to markedly lower prosecution and conviction rates. Not proven is one of three options available to a jury or court along with guilty and not guilty. It leaves the accused innocent in the eyes of the law but critics argue it is confusing for juries and the public. The comprehensive study, presented in Edinburgh on Wednesday, discovered that during deliberations jurors viewed not proven as a \u201ccompromise\u201d verdict, meaning \u201cguilty but you can\u2019t prove it in court\u201d. Miss M, who won a landmark civil action after the criminal case against the man she accused of raping her on a university freshers\u2019 week night out was found not proven, has been campaigning for reform of the Scottish system for nearly a year. \u201cThis must add to the momentum,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cThis research shows that not proven is failing survivors.\u201d The research, commissioned by the Scottish government and involving 64 mock juries and nearly 1,000 participants, also found that the existence of the not proven option had an impact on jurors independent of deliberations, suggesting that removing it might incline more jurors towards a guilty verdict. It concluded that individual jurors were also significantly less likely to favour a guilty verdict when the not proven verdict was available, a difference that was apparent both before and after deliberating \u201cindicating that, in finely balanced trials, the availability of not proven may tip more jurors towards acquitting even before they have discussed the evidence\u201d. The two-year study, carried out by Ipsos MORI Scotland Prof James Chalmers and Prof Fiona Leverick of the University of Glasgow law school and Prof Vanessa Munro from the University of Warwick, followed the deliberations of each jury after they watched a video of a fictional but realistic Scottish trial, either concerning a rape or an assault. It also examined other elements to the Scottish jury system that differ from most English-language jurisdictions: including having 15 members rather than 12, and that verdicts are returned by simple majority, ie eight out of 15 jurors, rather than requiring juries to reach unanimity or near unanimity. In 2017-18, only 10% of reported rape and attempted rape cases were prosecuted in Scotland: of these 43.3% resulted in convictions \u2013 the lowest of any crime \u2013 while 19% were found not proven, compared with 17% for all crimes and offences. Responding to the research, Sandy Brindley, the chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland, said: \u201cThis research shows a significant level of misunderstanding about the not proven verdict. It\u2019s time for it to go, before more guilty men walk free.\u201d She said she wanted the Scottish government to take a broader look at how the legal system served victims of sexual violence, including the requirement of corroboration \u2013 two separate sources of evidence before a case can proceed to trial \u2013 which is especially difficult for rape prosecutions where the accused argues that the sexual activity was consensual. \u201cThe biggest impact of corroboration is preventing cases getting to court in the first place. At the very least we want to get rid of not proven, but given what we know about low conviction rates and how traumatising the court experience is for victims, it\u2019s time for a more transformative change.\u201d Yousaf said the study would be subject to a targeted consultation over the winter with judges, victims\u2019 groups and others. He said \u201cnothing is off the table\u201d in terms of potential reforms, adding: \u201cCentral to these discussions will be whether we should move from a three- to a two-verdict system.\u201d",

Although the series will mainly focus on contemporary classical music, Volume 1 features Pioro playing Bach\u2019s Partita No 2 in D minor, one of the most beautiful \u2013 but most performed \u2013 pieces of music ever. Greenwood agrees. \u201cIt has everything, and with Daniel it sounds like a fresh piece of music.\u201d</p> <p>Named after his favourite eight-note musical scale (\u201cYeah, I know \u2013 nerdy\u201d) Octatonic also plans to focus on intimate works by soloists or small groups. Volume 2 features Oliver Coates performing Industry, <a href=\"https://michaelgordonmusic.com/\">Michael Gordon</a>\u2019s work for cello and electronics, and pianist <a href=\"http://www.katherinetinker.com/\">Katherine Tinker</a> playing Greenwood\u2019s Three Miniatures from Water.</p> <p>The idea for Octatonic, explains Greenwood, came after a late-night visit to <a href=\"http://bleep.com/\">Bleep</a>, the hip online independent record shop. \u201cI was looking for the classical section,\u201d he says, \u201cand I realised there isn\u2019t one.

There is something about listening to it on vinyl \u2013 you feel compelled to hear the whole thing. It\u2019s an event in itself.

It seems to be lots of men, standing around watching another man, and no one\u2019s dancing and there\u2019s not much joy.

He has subsequently been the group\u2019s guitarist, keyboardist and arranger, with a freedom to incorporate everything from banjo to harp into their sound.

He saw Anderson at the Prom, he says, \u201cthrowing out a hundred film ideas \u2026 A horror film was something we discussed.\u201d He pauses. \u201cBut I suppose There Will Be Blood is horror in its own way.

But when you sit and watch PT\u2019s films with him, you realise they\u2019re all comedies. He\u2019s literally chuckling away through the whole thing.\u201d</p> <p>Greenwood\u2019s work as a composer has greatly benefited his working relationship with Radiohead. \u201cI\u2019m less fearful of getting strings in now,\u201d he says. \u201cWith <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI2oS2hoL0k\">Burn </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI2oS2hoL0k\">the Witch</a>, I finally had the gall to say, let\u2019s leave this completely unfinished and let the strings finish it.

Greenwood agrees that environmental awareness has improved since the early 00s when Radiohead began campaigning for Greenpeace, but is reluctant to see the group as a standard-bearer. \u201cAre you saying our legacy will be, \u2018We warned you it was going to be terrible, and now it is?\u2019 Wow. Good times.\u201d</p> <p>He also thinks criticisms of campaigners, such as Radiohead, who regularly use air travel to work, are often deployed to distract from the bigger picture. \u201cYes, this person is a hypocrite because they flew. But if picking holes in someone\u2019s green credentials is all you need to convince yourself there\u2019s no climate change problem then you\u2019re kind of an idiot.\u201d</p> <p>As we leave, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/26/julia-holter-aviary-review-beauty-and-brains-in-a-90-minute-epic\">Julia Holter</a> track is playing over the cafe speakers amid the clatter of brunch. \u201cThere was something Alan Bennett said,\u201d says Greenwood, as he puts on his coat, \u201cabout music having burst its banks. It used to be in these little confined spaces where you\u2019d seek it out and have an experience. This music playing now was recorded by people concentrating on it. But we\u2019re just kind of talking over it. One of my hopes for Octatonic is that it\u2019s a way to hear people playing closely, create that little space, and the next time you\u2019re walking past a poster for a concert in a church, or some solo violin music, you might want to pop in and seek out the real thing.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Volume 1: Partita No 2 in D minor and Volume 2: Industry, Water are out on <a href=\"https://octatonicrecords.com/\">Jonny Greenwood\u2019s Octatonic Records</a>.</p></li> </ul>",

It caught the attention of director Paul Thomas Anderson, then working on There Will Be Blood. \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen any of his films,\u201d says Greenwood in a stage whisper, \u201cbut he sent me some clips and I thought, it\u2019s going to be nice to be in a band with this person!\u201d His music for Anderson\u2019s 2012 film The Master is brilliantly unnerving. He saw Anderson at the Prom, he says, \u201cthrowing out a hundred film ideas \u2026 A horror film was something we discussed.\u201d He pauses. \u201cBut I suppose There Will Be Blood is horror in its own way. Even Phantom Thread: the innocent village girl brought to the evil old man\u2019s house at the top of the hill. But when you sit and watch PT\u2019s films with him, you realise they\u2019re all comedies. He\u2019s literally chuckling away through the whole thing.\u201d Greenwood\u2019s work as a composer has greatly benefited his working relationship with Radiohead. \u201cI\u2019m less fearful of getting strings in now,\u201d he says. \u201cWith Burn the Witch, I finally had the gall to say, let\u2019s leave this completely unfinished and let the strings finish it. In the past, I wouldn\u2019t have had the brass neck.\u201d As for future Radiohead plans, there are none. Since June, when the group released MiniDiscs [Hacked] \u2013 18 hours of material from their OK Computer recording sessions \u2013 activities have been quiet. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he says, with an apologetic smile. \u201cWe don\u2019t tour until we\u2019ve got new music and new music doesn\u2019t happen until we get together and that doesn\u2019t happen until everyone\u2019s free.\u201d The group donated the profits from MiniDiscs [Hacked] to Extinction Rebellion. Greenwood agrees that environmental awareness has improved since the early 00s when Radiohead began campaigning for Greenpeace, but is reluctant to see the group as a standard-bearer. \u201cAre you saying our legacy will be, \u2018We warned you it was going to be terrible, and now it is?\u2019 Wow. Good times.\u201d He also thinks criticisms of campaigners, such as Radiohead, who regularly use air travel to work, are often deployed to distract from the bigger picture. \u201cYes, this person is a hypocrite because they flew. But if picking holes in someone\u2019s green credentials is all you need to convince yourself there\u2019s no climate change problem then you\u2019re kind of an idiot.\u201d As we leave, a Julia Holter track is playing over the cafe speakers amid the clatter of brunch. \u201cThere was something Alan Bennett said,\u201d says Greenwood, as he puts on his coat, \u201cabout music having burst its banks. It used to be in these little confined spaces where you\u2019d seek it out and have an experience. This music playing now was recorded by people concentrating on it. But we\u2019re just kind of talking over it. One of my hopes for Octatonic is that it\u2019s a way to hear people playing closely, create that little space, and the next time you\u2019re walking past a poster for a concert in a church, or some solo violin music, you might want to pop in and seek out the real thing.\u201d Volume 1: Partita No 2 in D minor and Volume 2: Industry, Water are out on Jonny Greenwood\u2019s Octatonic Records.",

Hagibis earned super status \u2013 the most severe category \u2013 after winds passed the 150mph threshold, peaking at 180mph. It is far larger than Typhoon Faxai which \u2013 on the day of England\u2019s arrival for the World Cup \u2013 brought Tokyo to a standstill, killing three people and leaving a million homes without power. Hagibis is weakening, but its power remains destructive.</p>\n    <p><b>How did it grow so fierce?&nbsp;</b>US Navy meteorologist Robert Speta told the Japan Times the storm had gone through an 'explosive intensification in a matter of hours', adding: 'In fact it was an historic amount of intensification in such a short time. This only happens when all the right ingredients are in place. Like if you had a fire and instead of throwing gasoline on it to make it bigger you also grabbed some lighter fluid, a bit of oil and a couple of aerosol cans for good measure.'</p>\n    <p><b>What are those ingredients?&nbsp;</b>Warm sea temperature, high humidity, Coriolis force, low wind shear and atmospheric instability.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Which games are affected?&nbsp;</b>Besides the Pool C decider in Yokohama on Saturday, Scotland\u2019s match with Japan at the same venue 24 hours later. Ireland\u2019s Pool A game against Samoa on Saturday and Wales\u2019s Pool&nbsp;D match with Uruguay on Sunday are on the other side of Japan, so likely out of the storm\u2019s main path.

Warner Bros\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/25/review-batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice\">Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice</a> provided the superhero smackdown every comic book fan thought they wanted to see, but it ruined the Dark Knight for the big screen for the best part of a decade (outside of those zippy and imaginative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/09/the-lego-batman-movie-review-funny-exciting-and-packed-with-gags\">Lego Batman</a> flicks). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/23/the-phantom-menace-at-20-star-wars\">Star Wars: The Phantom Menace</a> gave us Anakin Skywalker before he turned to the dark side, but George Lucas\u2019s decision to show us the future Darth Vader as a child ended up infantilising the prequel and its followups. Alien Resurrection brought Sigourney Weaver\u2019s Ellen Ripley back from the dead as a clone of herself, but \u2026 well, <a href=\"https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/11/alien-resurrection-set-a-new-low-for-lazy-sequels/\">you know the rest</a>.</p> <p>Todd Phillips\u2019 Joker has the same problem. A few weeks ago <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/05/a-batman-v-joker-movie-could-make-marvels-avengers-look-like-the-powerpuff-girls\">in this column</a>, I speculated that Warner Bros are likely to want to unite Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s clown prince of Gotham with Robert Pattinson\u2019s caped crusader in a putative sequel to the forthcoming The Batman. But having now seen Joker, it\u2019s much more difficult to imagine anybody wanting it to be the spark that ignites a new cinematic universe of darker Gotham stories.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/t433PEQGErc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Phillips\u2019s movie is essential viewing for anyone with more than a passing affection for the 1970s and early 80s films of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro \u2013 King of Comedy and Taxi Driver in particular \u2013 to which it pays fulsome tribute with its vision of a troubled, semi-psychotic working-class white male left to fend for himself by society, with disastrous results. Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s performance as Arthur Fleck is one of startling, nihilistic majesty \u2013 a jewel found shining among dead things. And yet this is not a film to fire up the fanboys and girls with excitement about future episodes \u2013 despite <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/film/joaquin-phoenix-says-hes-open-potential-joker-sequel-2555233\">Phoenix\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/film/joaquin-phoenix-says-hes-open-potential-joker-sequel-2555233\">stated desire to return to the role</a>. For it takes the Joker, and the uncaring Gotham that spawned him, to such jagged, curdled depths of inhumanity that it\u2019s difficult to imagine even Batman being able to pierce the doom-laden malaise.</p> <p>Where earlier incarnations of the Joker \u2013 Jack Nicholson\u2019s leering pantomime villain; Heath Ledger\u2019s sketchy schemer \u2013 had a sense of spiky and operatic joie de vivre, there is nothing about Fleck\u2019s descent into madness likely to have the average viewer leave the cinema with a spring in their step. He murders his own mum, kills his friends and stalks his pretty neighbour like the worst kind of incel freak. This is a tale of desperation and decay; of a cruel, cruel world that creates an even crueller man. Perhaps the Joker we see right at the end of the movie, when he has become a hero to hordes of Gotham\u2019s discarded young men, has the potential to become the kind of larger-than-life villain that everybody loves to hate. But it is hard to imagine anyone ever warming to Phoenix\u2019s tortured, pencil-thin iteration. The natural response here is a blend of pity and revulsion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63285b6317b61d90e5f9127f178d63759fe3b8ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63285b6317b61d90e5f9127f178d63759fe3b8ac/0_181_3384_2030/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Nicholson as the Joker in Batman (1989).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Operatic joie de vivre \u2026 Jack Nicholson as the Joker in Batman (1989).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Snap/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps Joker could provide a sort of Casino Royale-style reset for the Batman universe, wiping out every last trace of over-the-top silliness, so Matt Reeves\u2019 The Batman (due in 2021) can start out with a fresh slate. Phillips\u2019s film certainly sets up a future confrontation between Batman and the Joker \u2013 the former has an axe to grind because Fleck\u2019s actions inadvertently led to the murder of his parents, while the latter resents Bruce Wayne for getting the gilded upbringing he believes he was cruelly denied.</p> <p>And yet this would likely be a version of the caped crusader\u2019s home city even more malevolent and stripped of fantasy stylings than Christopher Nolan\u2019s much-loved Dark Knight trilogy. At some stage we will have to ask ourselves what the point of these comic book movies is, if all the fun stuff has been flushed into the Gotham sewers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://time.com/5693879/joker-opening-weekend-october-record/\">Despite </a><a href=\"https://time.com/5693879/joker-opening-weekend-october-record/\">its box-office success</a>, Phillips\u2019 movie may only ever have been intended as a tantalising one-shot, a \u201cwhat-if\u201d entry in the style of the controversial comic book from which it draws so much inspiration, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/mar/14/the-killing-joke-at-30-what-is-the-legacy-of-alan-moore-shocking-batman-comic\">Alan Moore\u2019s The Killing Joke</a>. Intriguingly, though, that graphic novel ultimately ended up feeding into wider DC Comics continuity. At the end of the movie, it is hinted that Fleck has escaped incarceration in Arkham Asylum to wreak havoc on the streets of Gotham. I wonder if this version of the Joker, as marvellous as Phoenix\u2019s performance is, really ought to have been kept locked up in a padded cell, so we never have to see him on the big screen again.</p>",

Phillips\u2019s movie is essential viewing for anyone with more than a passing affection for the 1970s and early 80s films of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro \u2013 King of Comedy and Taxi Driver in particular \u2013 to which it pays fulsome tribute with its vision of a troubled, semi-psychotic working-class white male left to fend for himself by society, with disastrous results. Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s performance as Arthur Fleck is one of startling, nihilistic majesty \u2013 a jewel found shining among dead things. And yet this is not a film to fire up the fanboys and girls with excitement about future episodes \u2013 despite Phoenix\u2019s stated desire to return to the role. For it takes the Joker, and the uncaring Gotham that spawned him, to such jagged, curdled depths of inhumanity that it\u2019s difficult to imagine even Batman being able to pierce the doom-laden malaise. Where earlier incarnations of the Joker \u2013 Jack Nicholson\u2019s leering pantomime villain; Heath Ledger\u2019s sketchy schemer \u2013 had a sense of spiky and operatic joie de vivre, there is nothing about Fleck\u2019s descent into madness likely to have the average viewer leave the cinema with a spring in their step. He murders his own mum, kills his friends and stalks his pretty neighbour like the worst kind of incel freak. This is a tale of desperation and decay; of a cruel, cruel world that creates an even crueller man. Perhaps the Joker we see right at the end of the movie, when he has become a hero to hordes of Gotham\u2019s discarded young men, has the potential to become the kind of larger-than-life villain that everybody loves to hate. But it is hard to imagine anyone ever warming to Phoenix\u2019s tortured, pencil-thin iteration. The natural response here is a blend of pity and revulsion. Perhaps Joker could provide a sort of Casino Royale-style reset for the Batman universe, wiping out every last trace of over-the-top silliness, so Matt Reeves\u2019 The Batman (due in 2021) can start out with a fresh slate. Phillips\u2019s film certainly sets up a future confrontation between Batman and the Joker \u2013 the former has an axe to grind because Fleck\u2019s actions inadvertently led to the murder of his parents, while the latter resents Bruce Wayne for getting the gilded upbringing he believes he was cruelly denied. And yet this would likely be a version of the caped crusader\u2019s home city even more malevolent and stripped of fantasy stylings than Christopher Nolan\u2019s much-loved Dark Knight trilogy. At some stage we will have to ask ourselves what the point of these comic book movies is, if all the fun stuff has been flushed into the Gotham sewers. Despite its box-office success, Phillips\u2019 movie may only ever have been intended as a tantalising one-shot, a \u201cwhat-if\u201d entry in the style of the controversial comic book from which it draws so much inspiration, Alan Moore\u2019s The Killing Joke. Intriguingly, though, that graphic novel ultimately ended up feeding into wider DC Comics continuity. At the end of the movie, it is hinted that Fleck has escaped incarceration in Arkham Asylum to wreak havoc on the streets of Gotham. I wonder if this version of the Joker, as marvellous as Phoenix\u2019s performance is, really ought to have been kept locked up in a padded cell, so we never have to see him on the big screen again.",

Fiji are a side packed full of first\u2011class talent, who many fancied to make the quarter-finals. Alas, they are now reduced to trying to throw a spanner in someone else\u2019s works (Wales\u2019s). Otherwise, the key game in this pool was Wales-Australia, won by the former in just the sort of bloody-minded fashion they have made their own lately.</p> \n  <p><strong>What\u2019s still at stake? </strong>Fiji may yet throw that spanner on Wednesday but it would be of limited use to them. Wales finish against Uruguay on Sunday and will surely take maximum points. In which case it would be Australia who likely benefit, the Wallabies finishing with a game against Georgia on Friday. An upset there is not quite out of the question, but it would be big \u2013 of Tonga\u2011France-in-2011 proportions, if not quite Brighton 2015. If Wales beat Fiji (and they are currently 17-point favourites to do so) they will top the group with a win over Uruguay, which would pitch Australia into the England\u2011New Zealand side of the draw. Fiji look safe for third place, which would mean Georgia back on the qualification beat for 2023.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d44ad5592b282032a4d41c9a6da9b83b05418544\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d44ad5592b282032a4d41c9a6da9b83b05418544/0_0_3968_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Uruguay celebrate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uruguay\u2019s players celebrate after their shock victory over Fiji.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d9d9c358f08fbb0c1723944\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-09T08:59:05.879Z\">9.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Here\u2019s Gerard with the weather ... </h2> \n  <p>England and Scotland\u2019s pool deciders this weekend are under threat from one of the most violent super typhoons in recent history, potentially causing chaos for tens of thousands of travelling supporters.</p> \n  <p>World Rugby may be forced into taking the unprecedented step of cancelling Saturday\u2019s Pool C match between England and France as well as Scotland\u2019s crucial fixture with Japan 24 hours later as the category five super typhoon heads for Yokohama.

      "bodyText": "Just before we sign off \u2026 Paul Rees was at the Oita Stadium to see Wales prevail in a bruising encounter against Fiji. Here\u2019s how he saw it ... Warren Gatland speaks: \u201cIt was tough,\u201d says the Welsh coach, in an interview with ITV. \u201cFrom 10-0 down I would have taken a bonus point win. It was a tough game and they have some wonderful individual athletes who really tested us. \u201cI\u2019m pleased with that performance and that result. Hopefully it will set us up nicely for going forward. At half-time I felt a few of their forwards were starting to feel the pace of the game and I told my boys to stay going at them.\u201d Wales now look on course to face France in the quarter-final. Wales 29-17 Fiji: Fiji\u2019s interest in this year\u2019s World Cup comes to an end, their bizarre defeat at the hands of Uruguay ultimately costing them a place in the quarter-finals. Wales still have to face Uruguay on Sunday and a win will ensure they go into the knockout stages as Pool winners. 81 min: Wales scrum as the clock goes into the red. The ball\u2019s booted into touch and Wales have won a fairly brutal contest. But at what cost? Two of their most important players, Dan Biggar and Jonathan Davies, took heavy knocks. 79 min: Fiji winger Semi Radradra is announced as man of the match. Having scored a hat-trick of tries, Josh Adams might have something to say about that, but I think it\u2019s the correct decision. I certainly wouldn\u2019t like to argue the toss with Semi over it. He\u2019s a ferocious unit - strong as an ox, lightning fast and manages to get everywhere. It\u2019s like there\u2019s three or four of him on the pitch. 76 min: Speaking of Wales injuries, the demeanour of Jonathan Davies on the bench appears to be that of a man who might be of a mind his World Cup is over. Here\u2019s hoping that\u2019s not the case, but the outside centre would be a huge loss if that does happen to be the case. 74 min: Wales look to have got the better of Fiji, but their medical staff are going to be kept busy in the coming days. Fiji are nails-hard and I\u2019ve lost count of the number of Welsh players who are either limping around the pitch or have been forced off with knocks. Fiji are going out of the World Cup, but can leave with their heads held high on the back of this performance. 72 min: Liam Williams leaps to catch a high ball and is absolutely clattered by Semi Radradra upon landing. Radradra is excellent value for money and has been outstanding for Fiji today; Williams isn\u2019t going to forget that tackle in a hurry. 71 min: Wyn Jones, Tom Francis and Jake Ball make way for Wales substitutes Rhys Carre, Dillon Lewis and Aaron Shingler. 69 min: Liam Williams flops over the lineafter being put in by Gareth Davies after good work by Ross Moriarty. The try is converted by Patchell and Wales have put a considerable amount of daylight between themselves and Fiji. They also have have their bonus point. 67 min: Elliot Dee comes off the bench to replace Wales hooker Ken Owens. 66 min: Fiji have possession just outside the Wales 22. Volavola kicks wide at an angle to the right and the ball bounces kindly for Leone Nakarawa, who gathers. A rogue pass from the second-row gifts possession back to Wales. 64 min: The visibly strugglingJosh Adams charges into wall of Fijian resistance with ball in hand, deep inside his own half. 63 min: Josh Adams seems to have done himself a mischief in scoring that try and is visibly hobbling. Ross Moriarty is also receiving medical attention. Jonathan Davies has gone off injured to be replaced by Owen Watkin. 61 min: Working in just a few inches of spaces, Jonathan Davies offloads brilliantly to Josh Adams, who somehow gets the ball down in the corner without going into the touch despite being tackled by two Fijians. That was outstanding from Davies, who galloped down the channel before somehow getting the ball to Adams for his hat-trick try. He got over despite Semi Radradra\u2019s desperate covering tackle. 60 min: \u201cWith all due respect, I\u2019m not sure Monsieur Garces is the chief culprit,\u201d writes Richard, with a pedantry update. \u201cThe TMO is becoming totally overbearing.\u201d That\u2019s you told, New Zealand\u2019s Ben Skreen! 58 min: Wales penalty. Rhys Patchell slots the ball between the posts from a long way out. It\u2019s all square. 56 min: Good news. Dan Biggar is back on his feet and able to jog off the field to rapturous applause from the capacity crowd for his head injury assessment. He\u2019s replaced by Rhys Patchell. 55 min: A breakdown in communication results in Dan Biggar and Liam Williams colliding as they try to catch a dropping ball. Biggar takes an accidental hit to the head and appears to be out cold. 54 min: Fiji get seven points as their human wrecking ball, the outstanding Semi Radradra crashes through another couple of tackles and is stopped illegally as Wales bring down the rolling maul. Dan Biggar follows the ref back to the halfway line, protesting at the injustice of it all. Wales are behind. 52 min: \u201cYou stopped the momentum!\u201d announces referee Jerome Garces as he brandishes a yellow card in the direction of James Davies, for a cynical tackle. 51 min: A break through the middle by Semi Radradra is stopped by James Davies, who grabs a handful of his shirt and holds on tight as the Fijians surged forward. Radrada\u2019s pass is intercepted by Josh Navidi. 49 min: Semi Radradra goes over for Fiji after another spellbinding move, but there\u2019s a break for more \u201cpedantry\u201d from the match officials. They\u2019re checking on a pass from Murimurivalu in the build-up, which they correctly adjudge to have been forward. 47 min: Wales turn the ball over inside their own 22, slightly to the left of their own posts. A wonderful tackle by Jake Ball put a stop to an intricate passing move from the Fiji backline and enabled Wales to win back possession. 45 min: Kini Murimurivalu kicks for touch and misses, but his side have advantage and get a penalty for a high tackle by Alun Wyn Jones. Ben Volavola kicks for touch deep in Wales territory. Fiji lineout about 10 yards from the Welsh line. 43 min: Wales scrum, just inside their own half. Jonathan Davies plays a grubber kick down the touchline for Josh Adams to chase, but Kini Murimurivalu mops up at the back. Fiji proceed to make 50 yards up the pitch after powerful running by Waisea Nayacalevu. Play resumes for the second half. Under pressure from Wales, Fiji\u2019s Semi Kunatani does well to stop his opposite number James Davies as he marauds up the pitch. Lineout for Fiji halfway inside their own half. An email: \u201cThoroughly enjoyable Barry?\u201d writes Richard. \u201cThe refereeing is descending into pedantic farce.\u201d Well, that\u2019s me told although I\u2019d rather the ref be pedantic and correct than take a laissez faire approach and get his decisions wrong. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve noticed Monsieur Garces being overly fussy. Well, that was fun. A hugely entertaining first half draws to a close with Wales coming from behind after a dreadful start to lead by just four points. It\u2019s evenly poised, but Fiji are looking a little tired. 40 min: Fiji lineout deep inside their own half. They win a penalty and the gong goes for half-time. They decide to kick for touch so they can go in to the dressing-room for a well-earned breather. 39 min: From a scrum on the Wales five-metre line, Ross Moriarty takes the ball and gallops upfield to the Fiji 22. Wales lose possession through poor decision-making by Hadleigh Parkes, who picks the wrong pass. 38 min: Yet another disallowed try. Ben Volavola floats a pass out wide to full-back Murimurivalu, who charges over in the corner. His try is ruled out because the pass from his fly-half was quite obviously forward. 36 min: Fiji put Wales under pressure for the first time in a while and have the ball on their opponents\u2019 22. With Wales lined out across the pitch, committing few players to the breakdown, Fiji are finding it difficult to breach their defence. They keep plugging away. 35 min: No, he isn\u2019t. He is in fact replaced by Jale Vatubua. Apologies. 33 min: Fiji centre Levani Botia is forced off with a thigh injury he carried into this game. He is replaced, I think, by Nikola Matawalu. 30 min: Desperate defending by Fiji, as Wales set up camp on their line. It\u2019s not good enough, however. Unable to plough through the Fiji defence, Wales play the ball out wide from Williams to Davies and on to Josh Adams on the wing. He goes over in the corner and Dan Biggar scores the touchdown with another fine kick from the touchline. 28 min: More pressure from Wales deep in Fiji territory, but the defence is stout. Fiji knock them back 10 or 15 metres, but their wing-forward Semi Kunatani is sin-binned for something or other. I won\u2019t lie - I haven\u2019t a clue what he did. Ah, here we go - I think it might have been for a late tackle on Dan Biggar after the Wales fly-half had released the ball. 26 min: After lengthy deliberations which seem fairly inconclusive, the referee and TMO decide that Adams might have put a toe in touch and don\u2019t award the try. It was a wonderful tackle from Fiji scrum-half Frank Lomani to deny him. 26 min: Wales have three consecutive five-metre scrums. They drive for the Fiji line, making ground before Ross Moriarty takes the ball from his own feet and passes to Gareth Davies. He pings the ball out to Josh Adams, who sprints on to it and goes over in the corner. He\u2019s tackled brilliantly as he goes over and appears to brush the touchline with his toe. Will the try to given? 24 min: Wales lineout five metres from the Fiji line after excellent play from Davies and Adams forces Josua Tuisova to put the ball out of play. They win the lineout and Dan Biggar chips the ball over the Fiji defence into the in-goal area. It bounces out of play before it can be touched down. 22 min: Dan Biggar boots a loose ball down the field towards the Fiji posts, but it\u2019s gathered by Levani Botia. Fiji have possession, deep in their own half. Frank Lomani clears with a kick from the back of a ruck that is almost charged down. Fiji get away with it. For now. 21 min: We\u2019re 20 minutes in and this is a thoroughly enjoyable game of rugby. Wales began atrociously, but seem to be getting their act together. Ken Owens returns from his spell in purgatory and they have their full complement of players again. A high cross-field kick to the corner from Dan Biggar. Under pressure from Ben Volavola, Josh Adams leaps high in the air and catches the ball before crashing over in the corner. Wales are off the mark. Dan Biggar puts the ball over from the touchline to add the extras. 17 min: Fiji second-row Tevita Cavubati is sin-binned for coming into the ruck leading with his shoulder and hitting a Wales player near the neck area. Referee Jerome Garces gives him his marching orders and then takes both captains to one side to tell them to get their players to behave themselves. It\u2019s a bit harsh - despite the two yellow cards, this hasn\u2019t been a dirty game. So far. 16 min: Jonathan Davies finds himself on the receiving end of a crashing, tooth-rattler of a tackle from Fiji No8 Viliame Mata. It\u2019s completely fair and above board, but the Wales centre will have felt that one. 14 min: Wales scrum on the halfway line. Flanker James Davies comes off, so replacement hooker Elliot Dee can come on to take the place of Owens in the front row. 12 min: Ken Owens remains on the Naughty Step, for his tip tackle on Villame Mata that referee Jerome Garces and his TMO Ben Skeen considered \u201cdangerous\u201d. Owens flipped Mata up in the air as he tackled him in the build-up to that disallowed try. Brilliant from Fiji! It couldn\u2019t be simpler really, as Fiji play the ball out wide through assorted various pairs of hands. It comes to full-back Kini Murimurivalu, who surges forward and dives over the line despite having four - four! - Welsh players being around and in front of him. Wales are getting slaughtered here. Once again, Ben Volavola misses the conversion. 8 min: Fiji kick for touch and get themselves a lineout about 10 metres from the Wales line. They win it and start going through the phases. 7 min: Another disallowed try! Wales are caught dozing as Fiji bamboozle them with a brilliant move that ends with scrum-half Frank Lomani touching down for a \u201ctry\u201d that is disallowed for a forward pass from Semi Radradra. There\u2019s more drama as Wales hooker Ken Owens is sin-binned for a dangerous tackle in the build-up. Fiji have a penalty. 6 min: Disallowed try: Josh Navidi takes a pass from George North and goes over for Wales, but his try is disallowed for a knock on by Hadleigh Parkes in the build-up. Great score! FIji have a five-metre scrum and out on the right wing, Josua Tuisova takes a pass from scrum-half Frank Lomani. The winger is as strong as a charging bull as he goes over in the corner, despite being tackled by three different Welshmen - Josh Navidi, Josh Adams and Dan Biggar - who were unable to stop him touching the ball down. The conversion is missed. 2 min: Great play from Fiji, who surge through the centre making plenty of ground. The ball\u2019s offloaded to hooker Samuel Matavesi, who is eventually bundled out over the touchline. Wales win the lineout. 1 min: Following an intimidating performance of Fiji\u2019s pre-match cibi, play gets under way with, Ben Volavola doing the honours with a drop kick. It\u2019s gathered by Ross Moriarty, who bursts towards the halfway line. From the ruck, Gareth Davies hoists a box kick which is gathered by Kini Murimurivalu, the full-back. Not long now: Both sets of players get their last-second preparations under way before leaving their dressing rooms and lining up in the tunnel. The players of Wales wear red shirts, white shorts and red socks. Fiji\u2019s wear white shirts, black shorts and black socks. They march out on to the pitch and line up either side of referee Jerome Garces and his team of match officials. Cue: the national anthems. Today\u2019s match officials Referee: Jerome Garces (France) Assistant referees: Romain Poite (France) and Karl Dickson (England) TMO: Ben Skeen (New Zealand). Pool D: The story so far The only other upset of the pool stage saw Urugay beat Fiji Glorious though this was, it was not the upset a neutral might have chosen. Fiji are a side packed full of first\u2011class talent, who many fancied to make the quarter-finals. Alas, they are now reduced to trying to throw a spanner in someone else\u2019s works (Wales\u2019s). Otherwise, the key game in this pool was Wales-Australia, won by the former in just the sort of bloody-minded fashion they have made their own lately. What\u2019s still at stake? Fiji may yet throw that spanner on Wednesday but it would be of limited use to them. Wales finish against Uruguay on Sunday and will surely take maximum points. In which case it would be Australia who likely benefit, the Wallabies finishing with a game against Georgia on Friday. An upset there is not quite out of the question, but it would be big \u2013 of Tonga\u2011France-in-2011 proportions, if not quite Brighton 2015. If Wales beat Fiji (and they are currently 17-point favourites to do so) they will top the group with a win over Uruguay, which would pitch Australia into the England\u2011New Zealand side of the draw. Fiji look safe for third place, which would mean Georgia back on the qualification beat for 2023. Here\u2019s Gerard with the weather ... England and Scotland\u2019s pool deciders this weekend are under threat from one of the most violent super typhoons in recent history, potentially causing chaos for tens of thousands of travelling supporters. World Rugby may be forced into taking the unprecedented step of cancelling Saturday\u2019s Pool C match between England and France as well as Scotland\u2019s crucial fixture with Japan 24 hours later as the category five super typhoon heads for Yokohama. Both matches were among the most in-demand when tickets went on sale. Gerard Meagher has the latest from Tokyo ... Wales: L Williams; North, Jonathan Davies, Parkes, Adams; Biggar, G Davies; Wyn Jones, Owens, Francis, Ball, Alun Wyn Jones (c), Navidi, James Davies, Moriarty. Replacements: Carre, Dee, Lewis, Shingler, Wainwright, T Williams, Patchell, Watkin. Fiji: Murimurivalu; Tuisova, Nayacalevu, Botia, Radradra; Volavola, Lomani; Ma\u2019afu, S Matavesi, Saulo, Cavubati, Nakarawa, Waqaniburotu (c), Kunatani, Mata. Replacements: Dolokoto, Mawi, Ravai, Ratuniyarawa, Yato, Matawalu, Vatubua, J Matavesi. The 40,000-capacity Oita Stadium on Kyushu Island is the venue for today\u2019s Pool D showdown between Wales and Fiji, where the teams will do battle under a closed roof that has been the cause of much humidity during previous games played in this tournament. At times during New Zealand\u2019s match against Canada, the ball was more slippery than a wet bar of soap. Wales are already assured of a quarter-final place, but a win today followed by victory over Uruguay on Sunday would guarantee them top spot and help them avoid the England-New Zealand half of the draw. Following their surprise defeat at the hands of Uruguay, Fiji cannot can\u2019t qualify for the quarter-finals but look good to finish in third spot.",

      "body": "<p>If Wales reach the final they will look back on this match as England did after beating Australia in the 2003 climax having overcome Samoa in the group stage after being overrun initially and 10 points down in as many minutes.</p> \n<p>The same happened to Warren Gatland\u2019s side here as Fiji, out of the tournament all but mathematically before the kick-off, played as only they can, offloading outrageously to thwart a rush defence, handling with aplomb and running so hard that tacklers were splattered.</p> \n<p>Sixteen years ago Samoa led England with 18 minutes to go and here Fiji were 17-14 ahead 18 minutes into the second half. Wales had lost their outside-half Dan Biggar, who suffered a second head injury in as many games and will now miss the final pool game against Uruguay after colliding with his teammate Liam Williams. They were down to 14 men with the flanker James Davies in the sin-bin for his team\u2019s persistent infringing. Their captain, Alun Wyn Jones, of all players, had not long before dropped a pass in his own half and it was the point in the game where the Six Nations champions needed someone to step up.</p> \n<p>Salvation appeared in the form of Jonathan Davies after Rhys Patchell had kicked a penalty to level the scores at 17 apiece. Fiji, who had dominated Australia for long periods before inexplicably losing to Uruguay, had not lost their early fire and enthusiasm, the likes of Semi Radradra \u2013 how the tournament will miss the powerful yet balletic wing who was named man of the match \u2013 Frank Lomani, Leone Nakarawa and Josua Tuisova bristling with intent and menace.

      "bodyText": "If Wales reach the final they will look back on this match as England did after beating Australia in the 2003 climax having overcome Samoa in the group stage after being overrun initially and 10 points down in as many minutes. The same happened to Warren Gatland\u2019s side here as Fiji, out of the tournament all but mathematically before the kick-off, played as only they can, offloading outrageously to thwart a rush defence, handling with aplomb and running so hard that tacklers were splattered. Sixteen years ago Samoa led England with 18 minutes to go and here Fiji were 17-14 ahead 18 minutes into the second half. Wales had lost their outside-half Dan Biggar, who suffered a second head injury in as many games and will now miss the final pool game against Uruguay after colliding with his teammate Liam Williams. They were down to 14 men with the flanker James Davies in the sin-bin for his team\u2019s persistent infringing. Their captain, Alun Wyn Jones, of all players, had not long before dropped a pass in his own half and it was the point in the game where the Six Nations champions needed someone to step up. Salvation appeared in the form of Jonathan Davies after Rhys Patchell had kicked a penalty to level the scores at 17 apiece. Fiji, who had dominated Australia for long periods before inexplicably losing to Uruguay, had not lost their early fire and enthusiasm, the likes of Semi Radradra \u2013 how the tournament will miss the powerful yet balletic wing who was named man of the match \u2013 Frank Lomani, Leone Nakarawa and Josua Tuisova bristling with intent and menace. Like Ireland against Japan, Wales were struggling to contain an attacking threat they were not used to. Then Davies, who had not enjoyed his best match, throwing a pass intended for Josh Adams into touch in the first half, made the decisive intervention, running on to the ball at pace and an angle, fending off Jake Vatubua and accelerating into the 22. There was a time when distribution was not among his attributes, but he kept running hard, drawing the defence before flicking a pass out of the back of his left hand to Adams on the wing. Fiji\u2019s two tries in the opening 10 minutes had come down Adams\u2019s flank. He rushed out of the line prematurely before the first, giving himself no chance to tackle Tuisova after a five-metre scrum, and he bounced off the full-back Kini Murimurivalu, who scored the second after Radradra had come into midfield from his wing and taken the ball from a deep position to thwart a rush defence which stalled to leave space out wide. He then scored two tries as Wales took a 14\u201110 lead and was denied two more by superb tackles from Lomani, a player who emerged from World Rugby\u2019s fast-track system. When Adams received Davies\u2019s pass he was close to the touchline 10 metres out with two defenders sweeping across. He somehow stayed in field before acrobatically touching down to claim his hat-trick and give Wales a lead they were to supplement with a bonus-point try through Liam Williams. It was a breathless contest \u2013 seven tries, five more which were disallowed and four yellow cards, two of which, for Ken Owens and Tevita Cavubati for dangerous challenges, may attract the interest of the citing commissioner. Davies suffered a knee injury after being clattered as he passed and was immediately taken off. Adams followed after having his right leg strapped when victory was secured. Gatland said both had suffered dead legs and that they were expected to be fit for the quarter-final, which will be against France if their game against England on Saturday is called off because of Typhoon Hagibis, but Biggar\u2019s return will be determined by an independent specialist.

Our crisis of environmental injustice is the result of decades of discrimination and environmental racism compounding in communities that have been overlooked for too long. It is the result of multiple choices that put corporate profits before people, while our government looked the other way. It is unacceptable, and it must change.\u201d</p> <p>The policy package builds on Warren\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/03/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-climate-change-plan.html?auth=login-email&amp;login=email\">previously announced</a> platform to combat the climate crisis by investing $3tn over the next decade to combat global heating. The plan\u2019s acknowledgment of environmental racism \u2013 the disproportionate impact of the environmental crisis on people of colour \u2013 comes after Senator Kamala Harris <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/07/kamala-harris-and-aoc-just-injected-environmental-justice-into-the-2020-race/\">pushed the issue at the first Democratic debate in July</a>. It has since been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/us/politics/environmental-justice-climate-town-hall.html\">acknowledged</a> by most of the high-profile Democratic candidates, 13 of whom have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/climate-change/green-new-deal/\">endorsed a Green New Deal resolution</a>.</p> <p>But Warren\u2019s newly released platform stands out as one of the most detailed plans among the candidates.</p> <p>The US senator for Massachusetts argues that the climate crisis represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to tackle decades of environmental discrimination and injustice fueled by the fossil fuel economy by creating millions of decent stable American jobs in clean and renewable energy, infrastructure, and manufacturing, which would unleash the best of American innovation and creativity.</p> <p>\u201cWe also cannot fight climate change with a low-wage economy. Workers should not be forced to make an impossible choice between fossil fuel industry jobs with superior wages and benefits and green economy jobs that pay far less,\u201d the plan states.</p> <p>To address this, Warren pledges to make her proposed $1.5tn Green Manufacturing procurement plan contingent on companies providing fair wages, paid family and medical leave, and collective bargaining rights. In a nod to Trump\u2019s blue-collar base, she promises investment in training for fossil fuel workers \u2013 coalminers, oil rig workers, and pipeline builders \u2013 to ensure they are not left behind by the Green Deal transition.</p> <p>In addition, Warren proposes new legislation \u2013 the Climate Risk Disclosure Act \u2013 which would require banks and other companies to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and price their exposure to climate risk into their valuations. Improving transparency about corporate fossil fuel dependence, would accelerate the transition to clean energy, claims Warren.</p> <p>Warren pledges to elevate environmental justice at the executive and federal level, in stark contrast to the rollback of environmental protections and systematic sacking of pollution and climate scientists under Trump.</p> <p>The National Environmental Justice Advisory Council would report directly to the White House, and includefrontline community leaders at the highest levels.</p> <p>Trump has threatened to slash the EPA budget by almost a third, including its civil rights office, and to dismantle its Office of Environmental Justice entirely. Warren promises to expand both programmes, and instruct the civil rights office to more aggressively pursue cases of environmental discrimination: nine out of 10 complaints between 1997 and 2013 were rejected.</p> <p>The plan also promises more proactive and coordinated data assessments by federal government agencies to identify communities at risk due to pollution and contamination, which the senator says will affect the way in which corporations are granted permits under clean air and water laws.</p> <p>Water is another focus area. The policy proposal highlights widespread challenges faced by rural and urban communities across the country in accessing clean water, as a result of inadequate investment in public water systems and poor enforcement of water quality standards which led to major health scandals in Flint and Newark, New Jersey.</p> <p>In rural areas, Warren wants to boost the Conservation Stewardship Program to $15bn annually to help limit agricultural runoff that harms local wells and water systems. In cities, decaying water infrastructure would be refurbished by fully funding the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund and the Clean Water State Revolving Fund.</p> <p>In 2018, the three costliest environmental catastrophes globally took place in the US, and low-income communities, people with disabilities, and people of color were worst affected. Warren pledges to quintuple funding for Fema\u2019s Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program, which the Trump administration has threatened to slash, and prioritise disaster and climate mitigation in communities at high risk of extreme, increasingly common, weather events including floods, storms and wildfires.</p> <p>The final point in her five-point plan builds on earlier commitments to aggressively prosecute corporate polluters especially those contributing to the climate crisis and environmental discrimination. This includes her proposed Corporate Executive Accountability Act which could signal hefty fines and jail time for company executives found guilty of criminal negligence which resulted in environmental damage.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Democratic presidential frontrunner Elizabeth Warren has unveiled an ambitious climate and environmental justice plan that places poor communities of color at the centre of a sweeping reform package aimed at bolstering environmental protection, curbing pollution and preserving clean water and air. The plan, shared with the Guardian ahead of launch, references a number of predominantly minority communities suffering from severe pollution, including those in Flint and southern Detroit in Michigan, the Navajo nation and Reserve, Louisiana. Reserve is the focus of a year-long Guardian series, Cancer Town, focused on air pollution linked to cancer in the town. The detailed policy proposal draws on the seminal 17 principles of environmental justice formulated by the National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit in 1991- widely lauded but mostly ignored by consecutive federal governments. Warren\u2019s plan states: \u201cWe didn\u2019t get here by accident. Our crisis of environmental injustice is the result of decades of discrimination and environmental racism compounding in communities that have been overlooked for too long. It is the result of multiple choices that put corporate profits before people, while our government looked the other way. It is unacceptable, and it must change.\u201d The policy package builds on Warren\u2019s previously announced platform to combat the climate crisis by investing $3tn over the next decade to combat global heating. The plan\u2019s acknowledgment of environmental racism \u2013 the disproportionate impact of the environmental crisis on people of colour \u2013 comes after Senator Kamala Harris pushed the issue at the first Democratic debate in July. It has since been acknowledged by most of the high-profile Democratic candidates, 13 of whom have endorsed a Green New Deal resolution. But Warren\u2019s newly released platform stands out as one of the most detailed plans among the candidates. The US senator for Massachusetts argues that the climate crisis represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to tackle decades of environmental discrimination and injustice fueled by the fossil fuel economy by creating millions of decent stable American jobs in clean and renewable energy, infrastructure, and manufacturing, which would unleash the best of American innovation and creativity. \u201cWe also cannot fight climate change with a low-wage economy. Workers should not be forced to make an impossible choice between fossil fuel industry jobs with superior wages and benefits and green economy jobs that pay far less,\u201d the plan states. To address this, Warren pledges to make her proposed $1.5tn Green Manufacturing procurement plan contingent on companies providing fair wages, paid family and medical leave, and collective bargaining rights. In a nod to Trump\u2019s blue-collar base, she promises investment in training for fossil fuel workers \u2013 coalminers, oil rig workers, and pipeline builders \u2013 to ensure they are not left behind by the Green Deal transition. In addition, Warren proposes new legislation \u2013 the Climate Risk Disclosure Act \u2013 which would require banks and other companies to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and price their exposure to climate risk into their valuations. Improving transparency about corporate fossil fuel dependence, would accelerate the transition to clean energy, claims Warren. Warren pledges to elevate environmental justice at the executive and federal level, in stark contrast to the rollback of environmental protections and systematic sacking of pollution and climate scientists under Trump. The National Environmental Justice Advisory Council would report directly to the White House, and includefrontline community leaders at the highest levels. Trump has threatened to slash the EPA budget by almost a third, including its civil rights office, and to dismantle its Office of Environmental Justice entirely. Warren promises to expand both programmes, and instruct the civil rights office to more aggressively pursue cases of environmental discrimination: nine out of 10 complaints between 1997 and 2013 were rejected. The plan also promises more proactive and coordinated data assessments by federal government agencies to identify communities at risk due to pollution and contamination, which the senator says will affect the way in which corporations are granted permits under clean air and water laws. Water is another focus area. The policy proposal highlights widespread challenges faced by rural and urban communities across the country in accessing clean water, as a result of inadequate investment in public water systems and poor enforcement of water quality standards which led to major health scandals in Flint and Newark, New Jersey. In rural areas, Warren wants to boost the Conservation Stewardship Program to $15bn annually to help limit agricultural runoff that harms local wells and water systems. In cities, decaying water infrastructure would be refurbished by fully funding the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund and the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. In 2018, the three costliest environmental catastrophes globally took place in the US, and low-income communities, people with disabilities, and people of color were worst affected. Warren pledges to quintuple funding for Fema\u2019s Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program, which the Trump administration has threatened to slash, and prioritise disaster and climate mitigation in communities at high risk of extreme, increasingly common, weather events including floods, storms and wildfires. The final point in her five-point plan builds on earlier commitments to aggressively prosecute corporate polluters especially those contributing to the climate crisis and environmental discrimination. This includes her proposed Corporate Executive Accountability Act which could signal hefty fines and jail time for company executives found guilty of criminal negligence which resulted in environmental damage.",

Furthermore, the teaching over pastoral distinction conveniently overlooks the fact that Oxbridge students actually do receive teaching outside their college, particularly at Masters and PhD level. Ian Wang, captain of this year\u2019s Corpus Christi Cambridge team finds the rule hard to justify: \u201cThere\u2019s not really a legitimate reasoning for it, as far as I can see, other than \u2018We think Oxford and Cambridge are special.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Concerns about diversity on University Challenge are hardly new: every series brings with it a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/11/male-contestants-university-challenge-female-entrants-bbc\">lament about the persistence of the all-white, all-male team</a>.

Every series since time immemorial has featured an array of questionable knitwear, a student who can correctly identify Tchaikovsky\u2019s Fifth Symphony in E Minor but go blank at George Michael\u2019s Faith, and a seemingly endless barrage of Oxford and Cambridge teams. While the predictability of contestants floundering in the face of pop music will forever prove entertaining, the domination of various Oxbridge colleges is anything but. And dominate they do: across the show\u2019s 48 series finals, only 10 have been between two non-Oxbridge institutions, most recently Manchester\u2019s victory over UCL in 2013. Last series, 11 of the 28 teams were Oxbridge colleges. Thankfully, due to clever match scheduling, it has been 32 years since we\u2019ve had a single institution final (Oxford-only finals occurred in 1965, 1972 and 1987, and Cambridge-only finals in 1970, 1973, 1978).

      "body": "<p>Kate Moss only has to snap her fingers and any piece of hot-off-the-catwalk designer fashion that catches her eye will be tissue-wrapped and fast-tracked to her door. She doesn\u2019t need to look at price tags or concern herself with waiting lists. What Moss wants in her wardrobe, Moss gets, straight away. If she wants the Paris fashion week hit dress from the cover of Vogue or the It bag on this month\u2019s billboards, it is hers for the asking.</p> <p>But what has been her signature high-fashion look? Vintage, that\u2019s what. Vintage is to Moss as Givenchy was to Audrey Hepburn and as Herm\u00e8s is to Jane Birkin. It is the name in the label of her best-ever looks. The lemon-yellow dress she wore to a New York fashion week dinner in 2003, which she later reincarnated in her Topshop collection? A vintage piece by 1950s French couturier Jean Dess\u00e8s. The black cocktail dress with feathered off-the-shoulder hemline she wore on the red carpet at Cannes in 1998? A vintage shantung silk piece, given a minimal 90s spin with scraped back hair and simple black strappy slingback sandals. At Glastonbury in 2005, with cut-off denim shorts and Hunter wellies? A 1970s Roncelli leather jacket.</p> <p>Now that it is the height of sustainable, zeitgeist cool to wear vintage, can we take a moment to acknowledge that Moss has been across this since the days when she was going out with Johnny Depp. Secondhand to her has never been second best. When she threw herself a 30th birthday party \u2013 at Claridges, in the full-on bling glare of 2004 \u2013 the look she splashed out on for the occasion was not Tom Ford for Gucci, but a dramatic retro sequinned gown with matching cape she found in a vintage store. Her passion for Vivienne Westwood\u2019s pirate-style strapped flat ankle boots, which she first bought on Portobello market, has lasted longer than any of her relationships. When she wants to look special, she goes vintage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6e5fc102de351f39397b759c7953911222fcb1e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e5fc102de351f39397b759c7953911222fcb1e6/2_0_8885_5333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"L to R: Moss in 1998 with Johnny Depp; in Cannes with Depp the same year; New York, 1997.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">L to R: Moss in 1998 with Johnny Depp; in Cannes with Depp the same year; New York, 1997 \u2013 \u2018This dress was a vintage find. We always had such fantastic Halloween parties in New York.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty Images and Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What can mere mortals learn about wearing vintage from how Moss wears vintage? There are some nuggets of wisdom in a book she has edited, Musings on Fashion and Style: Museo de la Moda, in collaboration with the Chilean fashion museum. Firstly, she looks at the garment, not the label. When she shops for the 1970s peasant-style dresses she loves, she sifts the racks for the colours that look right, first of all. And when she bought that lemon-yellow dress, the one that would have broken the internet had it been possible then, she didn\u2019t know who Dess\u00e8s was. Second, Moss knows what suits her. Bias-cut dresses, for instance, are a vintage-shop treasure, which Moss loves for being flattering, subtly sexy and easy to have fun in. In the words of Madeleine Vionnet, whose bias-cut gowns were the toast of 1930s Paris, \u201cwhen a woman smiles, her dress should smile with her\u201d.</p> <p>The perfect vintage look sometimes means going the extra mile, and Moss puts in the time and effort. On the hunt for the perfect dress for the Ed Wood premiere in 1994, she found a silver fringed dress in a vintage store in Florida that the boutique owner told her had once belonged to Errol Flynn\u2019s wife. It was transparent, so Moss \u201casked Calvin [Klein] for a slip\u201d to wear beneath, cutting the slip with scissors at mid thigh to show some leg. The pale grey silk shorts suit she wore at the A-list fashion wedding of stylist Katy England and Bobby Gillespie in 2006 was in fact a vintage Ossie Clark silk jacket, for which she had commissioned a tailor to make a matching pair of shorts.</p> <p>Moss has been on 30 British Vogue covers and thousands of newspaper front pages. She has made cameos on film and television, been painted by Lucian Freud and sculpted in bronze by Marc Quinn. She has a remarkable roll-call of vintage moments \u2013 and in the best of them, she\u2019s wearing vintage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8bf9c44354c6b3f99ba3ee0d24a6d091922a67c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bf9c44354c6b3f99ba3ee0d24a6d091922a67c5/2_0_8885_5333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Musings on Fashion and Style: Museo de la Moda by Kate Moss.

Jorge [Yarur, the museum\u2019s founder] and I immediately got on as we share the same love of vintage clothing, so we talked about other ways of collaborating together.</p> <p><strong>Will you often search out vintage all over the world?</strong><br>I always keep my eye out and try to visit vintage stores on my travels. I have found some great places that I return to whenever I can and have lots of favourites in London, too.</p> <p><strong>Which pieces were you most excited to discover?</strong><br>I think Marilyn Monroe\u2019s clothes. The sweater sets and the little black cocktail dress by Jean Louis were so cute.</p> <p><strong>There are clothes worn by Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe</strong><strong> and Jimi Hendrix</strong><strong>. Whose clothes were you most </strong><strong>starstruck</strong><strong> by?</strong><br>The Jimi Hendrix jacket was the best. Jorge let me try it on, it was quite incredible to be wearing something he had worn on stage.</p> <p><strong>Did the pieces in your </strong><strong>wardrobe influence the categories here \u2013 lace, Victorian etc? Why do you go back to these things?</strong><br>Yes, the concept was to show how I have appreciated and worn vintage for many years and then to show them in their historical context within the museo\u2019s collection.</p> <p><strong>Which are your favourite items in the exhibition?</strong><br>The Dior cocktail dress and the crepe evening dress from 1927.</p> <p><strong>How would you wear them now?</strong><br>With a strappy heel and diamonds.</p> <p><strong>You have now been vintage shopping for a long time. What have you learned</strong><strong>?</strong><br>I just go with my first instincts when I see something I like. It doesn\u2019t matter to me the designer or the era, just that the item appeals to me and looks good when I try it on.</p> <p><strong>Do you like the history and </strong><strong>stories</strong><strong> that vintage clothes contain?</strong><br>Yes, I love the idea that the clothes have a history and have been worn previously. Who knows what they have experienced? Also, it\u2019s good that clothes are recycled and worn again rather than being thrown out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d9af72f60045945395672e6ca61e236ecb66fe1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9af72f60045945395672e6ca61e236ecb66fe1b/0_0_2894_3678/787.jpg\" alt=\"Musings on Fashion and Style: Museo de la Moda by Kate Moss.\" width=\"787\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Musings on Fashion and Style: Museo de la Moda by Kate Moss.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rizzoli</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What have been your best finds?</strong><br>My original Vivienne Westwood Sex boots I found at Portobello market in the 90s.</p> <p><strong>Do you keep everything?</strong><br>I try to, but as I wear the clothes out and about not all have survived.</p> <p><strong>How did you first discover designers </strong><strong>such as Thea Porter and Ossie Clarke?</strong><br>Anita Pallenberg introduced me to them.</p> <p><strong>You say you would like to have lived in Paris in the 20s</strong><strong>.

      "bodyText": "Kate Moss only has to snap her fingers and any piece of hot-off-the-catwalk designer fashion that catches her eye will be tissue-wrapped and fast-tracked to her door. She doesn\u2019t need to look at price tags or concern herself with waiting lists. What Moss wants in her wardrobe, Moss gets, straight away. If she wants the Paris fashion week hit dress from the cover of Vogue or the It bag on this month\u2019s billboards, it is hers for the asking. But what has been her signature high-fashion look? Vintage, that\u2019s what. Vintage is to Moss as Givenchy was to Audrey Hepburn and as Herm\u00e8s is to Jane Birkin. It is the name in the label of her best-ever looks. The lemon-yellow dress she wore to a New York fashion week dinner in 2003, which she later reincarnated in her Topshop collection? A vintage piece by 1950s French couturier Jean Dess\u00e8s. The black cocktail dress with feathered off-the-shoulder hemline she wore on the red carpet at Cannes in 1998? A vintage shantung silk piece, given a minimal 90s spin with scraped back hair and simple black strappy slingback sandals. At Glastonbury in 2005, with cut-off denim shorts and Hunter wellies? A 1970s Roncelli leather jacket. Now that it is the height of sustainable, zeitgeist cool to wear vintage, can we take a moment to acknowledge that Moss has been across this since the days when she was going out with Johnny Depp. Secondhand to her has never been second best. When she threw herself a 30th birthday party \u2013 at Claridges, in the full-on bling glare of 2004 \u2013 the look she splashed out on for the occasion was not Tom Ford for Gucci, but a dramatic retro sequinned gown with matching cape she found in a vintage store. Her passion for Vivienne Westwood\u2019s pirate-style strapped flat ankle boots, which she first bought on Portobello market, has lasted longer than any of her relationships. When she wants to look special, she goes vintage. What can mere mortals learn about wearing vintage from how Moss wears vintage? There are some nuggets of wisdom in a book she has edited, Musings on Fashion and Style: Museo de la Moda, in collaboration with the Chilean fashion museum. Firstly, she looks at the garment, not the label. When she shops for the 1970s peasant-style dresses she loves, she sifts the racks for the colours that look right, first of all. And when she bought that lemon-yellow dress, the one that would have broken the internet had it been possible then, she didn\u2019t know who Dess\u00e8s was. Second, Moss knows what suits her. Bias-cut dresses, for instance, are a vintage-shop treasure, which Moss loves for being flattering, subtly sexy and easy to have fun in. In the words of Madeleine Vionnet, whose bias-cut gowns were the toast of 1930s Paris, \u201cwhen a woman smiles, her dress should smile with her\u201d. The perfect vintage look sometimes means going the extra mile, and Moss puts in the time and effort. On the hunt for the perfect dress for the Ed Wood premiere in 1994, she found a silver fringed dress in a vintage store in Florida that the boutique owner told her had once belonged to Errol Flynn\u2019s wife. It was transparent, so Moss \u201casked Calvin [Klein] for a slip\u201d to wear beneath, cutting the slip with scissors at mid thigh to show some leg. The pale grey silk shorts suit she wore at the A-list fashion wedding of stylist Katy England and Bobby Gillespie in 2006 was in fact a vintage Ossie Clark silk jacket, for which she had commissioned a tailor to make a matching pair of shorts. Moss has been on 30 British Vogue covers and thousands of newspaper front pages. She has made cameos on film and television, been painted by Lucian Freud and sculpted in bronze by Marc Quinn. She has a remarkable roll-call of vintage moments \u2013 and in the best of them, she\u2019s wearing vintage. How did you become involved with the Museo de la Moda? I was invited to open an exhibition there in April 2018. Jorge [Yarur, the museum\u2019s founder] and I immediately got on as we share the same love of vintage clothing, so we talked about other ways of collaborating together. Will you often search out vintage all over the world? I always keep my eye out and try to visit vintage stores on my travels. I have found some great places that I return to whenever I can and have lots of favourites in London, too. Which pieces were you most excited to discover? I think Marilyn Monroe\u2019s clothes. The sweater sets and the little black cocktail dress by Jean Louis were so cute. There are clothes worn by Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe and Jimi Hendrix. Whose clothes were you most starstruck by? The Jimi Hendrix jacket was the best. Jorge let me try it on, it was quite incredible to be wearing something he had worn on stage. Did the pieces in your wardrobe influence the categories here \u2013 lace, Victorian etc? Why do you go back to these things? Yes, the concept was to show how I have appreciated and worn vintage for many years and then to show them in their historical context within the museo\u2019s collection. Which are your favourite items in the exhibition? The Dior cocktail dress and the crepe evening dress from 1927. How would you wear them now? With a strappy heel and diamonds. You have now been vintage shopping for a long time. What have you learned? I just go with my first instincts when I see something I like. It doesn\u2019t matter to me the designer or the era, just that the item appeals to me and looks good when I try it on. Do you like the history and stories that vintage clothes contain? Yes, I love the idea that the clothes have a history and have been worn previously. Who knows what they have experienced? Also, it\u2019s good that clothes are recycled and worn again rather than being thrown out. What have been your best finds? My original Vivienne Westwood Sex boots I found at Portobello market in the 90s. Do you keep everything? I try to, but as I wear the clothes out and about not all have survived. How did you first discover designers such as Thea Porter and Ossie Clarke? Anita Pallenberg introduced me to them. You say you would like to have lived in Paris in the 20s. What appeals to you about this era? I love the decadence of the 20s: the parties, the fashion. I themed one of my birthday parties The Beautiful and Damned. What was the first secondhand piece you bought? Ribbed roll neck jumpers from the 70s from Oxfam. What is the first thing you do when you enter a vintage store? I scan the rails really quickly then pull the pieces I am instantly drawn to before trying them on. Do you have any tips for shopping vintage on a budget? Head to the charity shops, you can still find brilliant pieces there if you are prepared to hunt around.

Catshead is an ancient British variety that makes a good all-round cooker: slices keep their shape reasonably well for an open tart, and it makes a sharp, flavoursome puree.

It is sweetly fruity and astringent, with a distinctive aftertaste that some have (I think unkindly) likened to peardrops. Which flavours dominate will depend on when you eat it: an ashmead\u2019s picked now will taste quite different from one picked at Christmas, or from one kept in storage. There are conflicting theories about who Ashmead was, but in favour is one that says the original tree arose in the garden of William Ashmead, who lived in or close to Clarence Street, Gloucester.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43ba1eb4c4fd446e277a32608f150176c21ec764\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43ba1eb4c4fd446e277a32608f150176c21ec764/0_0_2982_1664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Herefordshire beefing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"558\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Herefordshire beefing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Folio Society</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Herefordshire beefing</strong></h2> <p>Beefings \u2013 there are several varieties, including herefordshire, norfolk and striped \u2013 are curiosities. They are primarily culinary apples, but rather than fluff or melt, the meaty flesh becomes soft and dense. They gave their name to biffins, a once-popular treat made by baking whole apples in a cool oven for several hours, weighted down to flatten them (a beefing\u2019s tough skin made it ideal for this treatment), resulting in a rich, caramelised sweetmeat. Views vary on the origin of the name: it may relate to their \u201cbeefy\u201d looks, especially when dried.</p> <h2><strong>Blenheim orange</strong></h2> <p>The history of many apples is lost in the mists of time, but that of the blenheim orange is well documented. The first sapling sprang up in about 1740 beside the garden wall of the still-new Blenheim Palace. One George Kempster recognised the potential of its sweet, firm apples and the trees he propagated gained local renown as Kempster\u2019s pippin (\u201cpippin\u201d is commonly attached to an apple from a chance sowing rather than deliberate hybridising). In 1804, the fourth Duke of Marlborough permitted it to be renamed blenheim orange. Aficionados appreciate a blenheim with cheese. The apple also works well in salads, as the cut flesh does not brown quickly. Storing enriches the flavour \u2013 these apples keep until Christmas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1ef6960a0be85bbaa9dd04500d524d8ecde5e44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1ef6960a0be85bbaa9dd04500d524d8ecde5e44/0_0_1496_1533/976.jpg\" alt=\"Tower of glamis.\" width=\"976\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tower of glamis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Folio Society</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Tower of glamis</strong></h2> <p>Scotland has many heritage varieties of apple, and this is a crisp, aromatic cooker that \u201cstews down very well\u201d, according to the cooks at Glamis Castle\u2019s visitor kitchens.

Ashmead\u2019s kernel Looks can deceive, and the modest exterior of ashmead\u2019s kernel conceals a rich complexity of flavour. It is sweetly fruity and astringent, with a distinctive aftertaste that some have (I think unkindly) likened to peardrops. Which flavours dominate will depend on when you eat it: an ashmead\u2019s picked now will taste quite different from one picked at Christmas, or from one kept in storage. There are conflicting theories about who Ashmead was, but in favour is one that says the original tree arose in the garden of William Ashmead, who lived in or close to Clarence Street, Gloucester. Herefordshire beefing Beefings \u2013 there are several varieties, including herefordshire, norfolk and striped \u2013 are curiosities. They are primarily culinary apples, but rather than fluff or melt, the meaty flesh becomes soft and dense. They gave their name to biffins, a once-popular treat made by baking whole apples in a cool oven for several hours, weighted down to flatten them (a beefing\u2019s tough skin made it ideal for this treatment), resulting in a rich, caramelised sweetmeat. Views vary on the origin of the name: it may relate to their \u201cbeefy\u201d looks, especially when dried. Blenheim orange The history of many apples is lost in the mists of time, but that of the blenheim orange is well documented. The first sapling sprang up in about 1740 beside the garden wall of the still-new Blenheim Palace. One George Kempster recognised the potential of its sweet, firm apples and the trees he propagated gained local renown as Kempster\u2019s pippin (\u201cpippin\u201d is commonly attached to an apple from a chance sowing rather than deliberate hybridising). In 1804, the fourth Duke of Marlborough permitted it to be renamed blenheim orange. Aficionados appreciate a blenheim with cheese. The apple also works well in salads, as the cut flesh does not brown quickly. Storing enriches the flavour \u2013 these apples keep until Christmas. Tower of glamis Scotland has many heritage varieties of apple, and this is a crisp, aromatic cooker that \u201cstews down very well\u201d, according to the cooks at Glamis Castle\u2019s visitor kitchens. Tower of glamis was one of the varieties grown extensively during the 19th century in the orchards that stretched across Clydesdale and the Carse of Gowrie. It doesn\u2019t appear to have been bred at the castle itself, but its name carries all the seductive images of Scottish royalty and romantic castles \u2013 a minor Scottish treasure.

Huge congratulations go to John Goodenough, Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino for the development of lithium-ion batteries. Here is my colleague Nicola Davis\u2019s news story on the prize: My Guardian colleagues will be covering the two Literature Prize announcements (2018 and 2019), which will be tomorrow from 12 noon UK time. More reaction from Royal Society President Venki Ramakrishnan: \u201cProfessor Goodenough\u2019s contributions in the field of materials science have fundamentally shaped the technology we take for granted today. From powering the smartphone in your pocket, to his defining work on the properties of magnetism, these contributions have opened new avenues for scientific investigation and engineering. \u201cThe cathode he developed for the lithium ion battery built on the work of his fellow laureate Professor Whittingham, and was made commercially viable by the work of Professor Yoshino. Scientific breakthroughs are rarely \u2013 if ever \u2013 a solo endeavour and it is absolutely fitting that this year\u2019s Nobel Prize for Chemistry should be shared in this way. \u201cI look forward to celebrating with John in person when he picks up his Copley Award at the Society this evening.\u201d I was advised to Google \u201cJohn Goodenough laugh\u201d - apparently he is renowned for having a laugh that can be heard several rooms away. I can confirm it is truly infectious. Prof David also told me that Goodenough still goes to the lab every day at the age of 97. That\u2019s dedication and passion for you. I\u2019ve just spoken to Prof Bill David, a former student of John Goodenough, who worked for him in Oxford. He is due to have afternoon tea at the Royal Society with Goodenough and two other chemists this afternoon - he says noone has cancelled yet so as far as he\u2019s concerned it\u2019s going ahead. He had some wonderful comments about his former boss. \u201cHe\u2019s just the best of people. He took me on when I was a young lad, 25, I hadn\u2019t even finished my doctorate. He has an amazing mind, encyclopaedic in terms of his knowledge.\u201d David said that Goodenough\u2019s move into battery science was \u201crational\u201d and conscious prompted by the 1970s oil crisis. \u201cHe made the positive decision to get involved with [battery] research,\u201d he says. \u201cHe has genius combined with a passionate desire to make a positive contribution to humanity. He\u2019s a very principled man.\u201d If you\u2019ve just realised that you\u2019re not up to speed on battery technology and what it means for the environment, we ran this useful briefing in January with everything you need to know Here are the official citations for this year\u2019s winners: The 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry are awarded to John Goodenough, M. Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino \u201cfor the development of lithium-ion batteries\u201d. Through their work, they have created the right conditions for a wireless and fossil fuel-free society, and so brought the greatest benefit to humankind. I\u2019ve just been told that John Goodenough is not in Texas, as I suggested earlier, but is actually in London to have dinner at the Royal Society this evening. He\u2019s there to receive to Copley Medal, the world\u2019s oldest scientific prize. Perfect place for a Nobel night out! Nobel prizes are awarded for science that is deemed to \u201chave conferred the greatest benefit on humankind\u201d. This can be interpreted in a fairly liberal way: sometimes the benefit is pure intellectual enrichment. The benefits of this year\u2019s chemistry prize are very tangible. They have driven a technological revolution and, according to the Nobel committee, can also be viewed as a green technology. \u201cThe importance of this technology for a more sustainable world has increased its relevance in recent times which makes it a more timely award now,\u201d says Hansson. If you missed the announcement... here it is again In this interview with John Goodenough in June, he revealed he\u2019s still working on batteries and hopes to see his final PhD student graduate (if you\u2019re that student, do get in touch!). He said: \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be taken. But I suppose it\u2019ll be one of these days soon. At my age I don\u2019t take someone on who is going to do a four-year PhD stint. My last student is a pretty good boy. I plan to see him graduate. That\u2019s my plan. But of course I\u2019m not in control. I live day by day, that\u2019s all I can do.\u201d This year\u2019s prize is clearly one that people have been expecting for a long time - but were this year\u2019s winners surprised? A journalist at the press briefing if any of the laureates said \u201cFinally!\u201d when they got the phone call this morning. \u201cNone of them used the word \u2018finally\u2019,\u201d Hansson says. \u201cThey were delighted. I don\u2019t know whether they had been waiting for the news for years.\u201d He says they managed to get through to Yoshino, in Japan, and Whittingham, who is normally based in New York, but is in Europe this week for a conference. And here\u2019s Prof Saiful Islam, of Bath University: \u201cI\u2019m delighted that John B Goodenough, M Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino have been awarded the chemistry Nobel prize for the development of lithium-ion batteries which have power the portable revolution and will play a big part in next-generation electric vehicles. In my view, this award is long overdue and it\u2019s great to see that this important area of materials chemistry has been recognised.\u201d I\u2019m getting some reaction in from the scientific world... Here\u2019s Prof Mark Miodownik, a materials scientist from University College London: \u201cI\u2019m so glad lithium-ion batteries finally recognised! They are one of the most influential pieces of materials science that influence the modern life of everyone on the planet. It remarkable too that although 30 years old, they have not been eclipsed by a better battery technology even now, which makes you realise what a remarkable discovery they are.\u201d Nobel committee say they haven\u2019t yet been able to reach John Goodenough with the good news. It\u2019s currently 5am in Texas, where he is based. Yoshino says it was \u201camazing\u201d to get the call. Man of few words. Apparently he sounded happy when he received the call though. A reporter asks whether he carried out the research to help make more environmental technologies or to make money. \u201cCuriosity\u201d was the main driving force, says Yoshino. The line isn\u2019t great, but I think he said \u201cI started working on this in 1981. I invented lithium ion battery in 1985\u201d. Goran Hansson, secretary-general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, suggests this is a \u201clong time\u201d. Seems relatively quick to me, given it\u2019s a Nobel-winning advance. They\u2019ve got Akira Yoshino, the Japanese laureate on the phone. I\u2019ll update you with his reaction to winning the prize shortly. Echoing Jim Peebles\u2019 comments yesterday, Goodenough said in a recent interview with The Times: \u201cAt the time we developed the battery it was just something to do,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what electrical engineers would do with the battery. I really didn\u2019t anticipate cellphones, camcorders and everything else.\u201d This will be a popular win - one that people have been anticipating for years. The three laureates each played a critical role in the development of lithium ion batteries. In the early 1970s, Stanley Whittingham used lithium\u2019s enormous drive to release its outer electron when he developed the first functional lithium battery. John Goodenough doubled the lithium battery\u2019s potential, creating the right conditions for a vastly more powerful and useful battery. Akira Yoshino succeeded in eliminating pure lithium from the battery, instead basing it wholly on lithium ions, which are safer than pure lithium. This made the battery workable in practice. Olof Ramstrom, of the chemistry prize committee is bringing the puns out. \u201cThis is a highly charged story of tremendous potential,\u201d he says of the latest announcement. Lithium ion batteries were the first truly lightweight batteries, that have paved the way for portable electronics, like mobile phones, pacemakers. Electric cars, as well. Goodenough (97) is the new oldest person ever to get the Nobel prize. Last year Arthur Ashkin (at 96) was the oldest It\u2019s batteries! Ooh here we go, they\u2019re taking their seats. Announcement any moment now... Seems a good time to remind you what the point of the Nobels are. Here\u2019s a piece I wrote with my colleague, Ian Sample, this week on some of the big questions behind the big prizes. Including some nice graphics, not by us, on the numbers of men and women who\u2019ve been awarded prizes The announcement is due at 10.45... but they do like to keep us waiting. Noone has taken their seats on the podium yet. Could be a delay getting a new laureate on the phone. Here\u2019s Marie Curie, looking quite stern. She was the first person to receive two Nobels, although there have been a few others since. Here\u2019s G\u00f6ran K Hansson, secretary-general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and the man who gets to make the calls. Nice office... is that William Morris wallpaper? Predictions are always tricky for chemistry, especially since in recent decades chemistry has expanded to encompass biochemistry, materials science and various other disciplines that don\u2019t easily slot into medicine or physics prizes. Afterall everything is made from chemicals. John B Goodenough and others who helped develop lithium-ion batteries are seen as favourites. The Crispr pioneers Jennifer Doudna, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Feng Zhang are seen as likely future winners, although following the human gene editing scandal in China earlier in the year, this might not be seen as the best year to recognise their achievement. The question of who to recognise for Crispr would also be contentious, with various patent battles and disputes over who holds claim to discovery ongoing in the courts. Other contenders include Marvin Caruthers of the University of Colorado, Leroy Hood of the Institute for Systems Biology, and Michael Hunkapiller, CEO of DNA sequencing company Pacific Biosciences. They made significant contributions to the development of modern DNA sequencing techniques in the 1980s. Karl Deisseroth of Stanford University, and Gero Miesenb\u00f6ck of the University of Oxford have been suggested for their development of optogenetics, which has helped reveal the inner workings of the brain and nervous system. I\u2019ve also consulted with my colleague, Nicola Davis, who is our in-house chemist on the science desk. She\u2019s extremely excited about today\u2019s announcement - as long as it\u2019s \u201cproper chemistry\u201d that wins. Here\u2019s her prediction: Predicting the prize for chemistry is always tough, not least because the field encompasses so many disciplines from materials science to biochemistry. But I\u2019d take a punt that this year\u2019s winner is Omar Yaghi for his work on metal-organic frameworks. These are a type of 3d crystalline materials made of metal clusters, or ions, joined together by organic molecules - they can contain lots of pores, meaning they have a vast surface area. It is said that if one gram of such a material was laid out flat to form a sheet one atom thick, it would cover sixty tennis courts. This is great for trapping and storing substances, such as hydrogen. But metal-organic frameworks can also be useful for speeding up chemical reactions since they offer a multitude of carefully designed sites at which liquids or gases can come together and react. Yaghi scooped the prestigious Wolf prize last year, so he is well on track for a further gong. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has handed out 110 Nobel prizes in chemistry since 1901. They have gone to 181 individuals with Frederick Sanger being the only double chemistry laureate, winning in 1958 for his work on the structure of insulin and in 1980 for DNA sequencing. Frances Arnold, who was awarded the prize in 2018, is just one of five female chemistry laureates. Here we go: day three of the 2019 Nobel prizes! We\u2019ve already had the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine on monday, when Sir Peter Ratcliffe at Oxford University, Gregg Semenza at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and William Kaelin at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston shared the award for discovering how cells sense and respond to an oxygen shortage. Physics was yesterday. One half of the 9m Swedish kronor (\u00a3740,000) prize went to the cosmologist, Jim Peebles, and the other half was shared between Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz. Between them, these scientists paved the way for our understanding of how the universe evolved, what\u2019s in it (mostly dark matter and energy) and discovered the first planet beyond our solar system. Impressive. But today is all about the chemistry prize. If you\u2019ve been responsible for a major chemical discovery in the past half century or so, and your phone is ringing right now, it\u2019s probably worth picking up. Everyone else, please join us for the live announcement, comment and analysis. We\u2019ll find out the winner \u2013 or more likely the winners \u2013 no earlier than 10.45am.",

      "bodyText": "The online casino Casumo has been forced to retract an advert that offered free spins and bonuses to people who Googled ways to bar themselves from gambling. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld a complaint about an advert, paid for by Malta-based Casumo, which has previously paid penalties of \u00a35.85m for failures in systems designed to protect problem gamblers. The advertising regulator said the complainant had searched: \u201cHow to unsubscribe from all gambling,\u201d only for an advert for a Casumo app to appear. The advert, in the paid-for listings that appear above organically generated search results, was headed: \u201cWelcome bonus to new players Casumo 100% and 20 free spins,\u201d and also invited people to \u201ccreate an account &amp; play now!\u201d Casumo told the ASA it had systems in place to stop its adverts appearing when certain search terms were used, to avoid fuelling problem gambling. But the company said it had not included \u201cunsubscribe\u201d within those terms because it felt it was associated with customers wanting to be removed from mailing lists or marketing, rather than trying to block themselves from gambling. Gambling companies are required to assist problem gamblers in excluding themselves from betting activity. An industry-wide tool, called GamStop, designed to enable addicts to bar themselves from all gambling sites at a stroke, has been beset by problems and is yet to be approved by the Gambling Commission. Casumo, which removed the ad at the ASA\u2019s request, told the regulator that it could not anticipate every variation of Google search terms to ensure consumers were not shown its adverts. The ASA said: \u201cWe acknowledged that on receipt of the complaint Casumo had immediately taken action to address where their ads were served. \u201cHowever, because we considered there was a strong possibility that vulnerable consumers seeking to prevent exposure to gambling ads and access to gambling websites might have been served a gambling ad following a search for \u2018how to unsubscribe from all gambling\u2019, we concluded that the ad had not been responsibly targeted.\u201d Casumo was one of three online casino firms forced by the Gambling Commission to pay \u00a314m in penalties last year, over failings in systems designed to prevent money laundering and protect problem gamblers. It was also accused earlier this year of ignoring a gambling addict\u2019s \u201cobvious\u201d signs of addiction, as she blew \u00a3125,000 while receiving inducements to bet.",

      "bodyText": "A Scottish court has delayed a decision on whether Boris Johnson should be forced to ask for a Brexit extension until after the final deadline has passed next week. Anti-Brexit campaigners had asked the three judges, Lord Carloway, who is the lord president, Lord Brodie and Lord Drummond Young, to issue court orders forcing Johnson to send the letter to the EU as required under the Benn act. That legislation, the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act, requires Johnson to write to the EU asking for an extension until 31 January if he fails to get a Brexit deal agreed at Westminster by 19 October. In an unusual move, Carloway said the issues were so significant and time-sensitive that the court could not make a definitive ruling on whether the prime minister had broken the Benn act until 19 October had passed. He said the judges would suspend a final ruling on whether to order Johnson to comply, or send the Benn act letter to the EU itself, until Monday 21 October. Then, he said, \u201cthe court will expect to be addressed on the facts that present themselves\u201d. They had also asked the court to use their unique powers, known as nobile officium, to write that letter on his behalf if he failed to do so. Carloway said they would also postpone a decision on that until 21 October. Carloway, Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, had signalled on Tuesday he was likely to order a delay after Lord Pentland, a judge sitting in the outer house of the court of session, had ruled on Monday that the prime minister\u2019s promises to obey the Benn act had to be taken seriously. Carloway, Brodie and Drummond Young\u2019s ruling broadly supported Pentland\u2019s view that since the prime minister had not yet broken the law it was difficult to issue an interdict, or injunction, forcing him to obey it. It would also be inappropriate, they added, for the court to use its nobile officium powers to write and send that letter on the prime minister\u2019s behalf for the same reasons. \u201cIn this case, whether the prime minister will ever be required to send a letter seeking an extension is uncertain. The UK government and the EU may reach a deal. Parliament may approve a no-deal Brexit,\u201d Carloway said. \u201cUntil the time for sending a letter arises, the prime minister has not acted illegally, whatever he or his officials have said privately or in public.\u201d As a result, the applicants \u201cdo not have grounds for a reasonable apprehension\u201d that Johnson would break the law. In Tuesday\u2019s emergency hearing, lawyers for the UK government had insisted the prime minister\u2019s promises to obey the Benn act were sincere. The government acknowledged on Friday, for the first time, that Johnson was legally bound to both send the required letter and not to frustrate or sidestep the act. David Johnston QC, acting for the government, told the court on Tuesday the prime minister also accepted he would face legal sanctions if he broke the law. \u201cI would have to accept that the court will be able to deal with that one way or another,\u201d he said. Johnston said it would be unjustified and inappropriate for the court to use its nobile officium powers in this type of case. Anti-Brexit campaigners should instead seek a judicial review but only after the Benn act deadline had passed. Carloway said the court rejected that approach. He said there was so little time available between 21 October and Brexit day on 31 October that starting new legal proceedings was impossible. The court heard on Tuesday that restarting the process would almost certainly mean an outer house hearing, an appeal to the inner house of the court of session, then an appeal to the UK supreme court in London, which would then have to return its decision back to the court in Edinburgh to enact it. And in order to meet the Benn act\u2019s requirements, the letter seeking an extension would need to be sent to all 27 EU member states as well as all the relevant EU institutions. In Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, acting for the litigants Dale Vince, Jolyon Maugham and Joanna Cherry, had said there was copious evidence from Johnson, government ministers and Downing Street officials that the UK government planned to thwart or sidestep the Benn act. The lead theory, set out in newspaper briefings and leaked memos, is that Downing Street will privately lobby EU governments to block an extension request, or use some other device to stop it. \u201cOne shouldn\u2019t be taken in by any kind of schtick that the prime minister is simply an overgrown schoolboy playing at being prime minister, as if he was Just William leading his cabinet band of outlaws,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cThis is serious stuff.

I think that gives the players great confidence.\u201d</p> <p>It will not spill into overconfidence with Klopp at the helm. As he illustrated on Friday, when bluntly stating he would rather quit Liverpool than allow himself to be filmed inside the changing room, few managers are more adept at cutting through the hype. With two Club World Cup fixtures in Qatar to squeeze into December\u2019s schedule, the inevitability of injuries, Manchester City\u2019s calibre and the small matter of it only being October, the Liverpool manager will leave title talk to others and treat any questions on the subject with disdain. His message, as always, has been received by the players. As Virgil van Dijk has insisted: \u201cAnything can happen still.\u201d</p> <p>Liverpool\u2019s experience of the past 29 years cautions against premature celebrations even as they savour the most commanding lead a team have held at this stage of a Premier League season. But this is a Liverpool team that left their backpack in Madrid and are unburdened by the past. Last season they gave Manchester City no margin for error going into their meeting at the Etihad Stadium in January. This year that pressure has come around in autumn.</p>",

They have gone close a few times over the last few years in the League Cup, the Europa League and the Champions League final but, actually having won it, that lets them know they can be winners. I think that gives the players great confidence.\u201d It will not spill into overconfidence with Klopp at the helm. As he illustrated on Friday, when bluntly stating he would rather quit Liverpool than allow himself to be filmed inside the changing room, few managers are more adept at cutting through the hype. With two Club World Cup fixtures in Qatar to squeeze into December\u2019s schedule, the inevitability of injuries, Manchester City\u2019s calibre and the small matter of it only being October, the Liverpool manager will leave title talk to others and treat any questions on the subject with disdain. His message, as always, has been received by the players. As Virgil van Dijk has insisted: \u201cAnything can happen still.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s experience of the past 29 years cautions against premature celebrations even as they savour the most commanding lead a team have held at this stage of a Premier League season. But this is a Liverpool team that left their backpack in Madrid and are unburdened by the past. Last season they gave Manchester City no margin for error going into their meeting at the Etihad Stadium in January. This year that pressure has come around in autumn.",

      "bodyText": "A wave of planned fossil fuel developments by major companies across northern Australia would significantly increase the amount of coal and gas the country plans to sell into Asia and push the Paris climate agreement goals further beyond reach, a Guardian analysis reveals. If the proposals go ahead, the science and policy institute Climate Analytics estimates that by 2030 Australia, with 0.3% of the global population, will be linked to about 13% of the greenhouse gases that can be emitted if the world is to meet the goals set in Paris. Ian Dunlop, a former Shell executive and chairman of the Australian Coal Association turned commentator and author, said the support for this expansion among Australia\u2019s industry leaders and major political parties suggested they \u201cstill don\u2019t believe climate change is an issue\u201d. The potential expansion of fossil fuel developments includes: \u2022 In the remote north-west, the Australian company Woodside Energy is leading a proposal to develop what would be the country\u2019s largest liquefied natural gas export hub, expanding an industry that has tripled in size since 2012. \u2022 In the Northern Territory, the lifting of a moratorium on fracking, after pressure from Scott Morrison\u2019s Coalition federal government and industry lobbying to increase gas supply, has opened up exploration in the Beetaloo sub-basin. The resources minister, Matthew Canavan, says it could supply domestic and international customers for more than 200 years. \u2022 And in outback Queensland, preliminary groundwork has begun on the Indian billionaire Gautam Adani\u2019s Carmichael coalmine, which made global headlines after being approved by the state government in June, nine years after first being flagged. Adani\u2019s plan for the first phase of the Carmichael mine has been significantly scaled back, from 60m to 10m tonnes of thermal coal a year, but opponents say even a small mine has the potential to open up the vast Galilee coal basin for wider development. Climate Analytics estimates if all seven mines proposed for the basin were fully developed they would add 857m tonnes of heat-trapping carbon dioxide to the atmosphere each year, equivalent to more than 2% of annual global emissions. Few people expect development of the Galilee to happen on that scale. Doubts are growing about the future appetite for exports of thermal coal, which is used to burn in power plants. There has been a 75% fall in the number of new coal plants planned across the world since 2015, largely due to a shift by investors away from coal after the Paris deal. But influential federal and state minerals lobby groups and companies, some led and advised by former cabinet ministers, continue to push for approval and support for new developments. The chief economist\u2019s office last year listed 53 new or expanded coalmine proposals across the country. Official government projections assume Australian coal exports will continue to increase until at least 2050. Australia is the world\u2019s biggest exporter of coal and rivals Qatar as the biggest exporter of liquified natural gas. Coal exports have more than doubled since the turn of the century, while gas sales have grown even more rapidly from a low base this decade. The progressive thinktank the Australia Institute found the country had become the third-largest exporter of fossilised carbon after Saudi Arabia and Russia. Dunlop said the proposed developments \u201cwould guarantee we are going way over 2C\u201d. He added: \u201cThe reality is that climate change is now an immediate existential threat to human civilisation as we know it. \u201cIt is patently obvious we\u2019ve been taken for fools by our politicians. We are in a position where they will maximise short-term financial advantage if they can get away with it, even if it destroys the Australian community in the process.\u201d Adani mine The Adani mine is the highest profile of Australia\u2019s proposed fossil fuel expansions, and has become emblematic of the country\u2019s battle between fossil fuel developments that could bring jobs to regional communities and combating the climate crisis. After its approval, Rolling Stone described it as \u201cthe world\u2019s most insane energy project\u201d. It finally received the green light from the Queensland Labor government shortly after the May federal election, when its party was thrashed across the state by the Liberal-National Coalition, particularly in regional areas where support for coal is strong. Despite cross-party support, with the exception of the Australian Greens, its development remains under a cloud. Activists are being trained at protest camps to block construction. A recent report by the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a pro-clean-energy thinktank, found Adani was relying on $4.4bn subsidies and tax concessions and would not be bankable without them. A royalties deal with the state government was unresolved at the time of writing. The company disputed the institute\u2019s report and said it had not received special treatment. It did not respond to an email requesting a response to the facts in this story. A key question for whether the Adani project could lead to further development of the Galilee basin is the infrastructure it would bring, including a rail line to a port more than 185 miles (300km) away, a port expansion and an airport. All have been dropped or shelved, with the company now proposing a rail spur to an existing freight network with limited carrying capacity. At its revised scale, Adani would export coal that when burned would emit about 26m tonnes a year, equivalent to about 5% of Australia\u2019s current annual emissions. The argument in favour of the Adani development is similar to the one used in many developing countries \u2013 that coal is a cheap, reliable fuel needed to help lift people out of poverty. But environmentalists are already worried about Australia\u2019s emissions, which have been rising since 2015, when the Coalition repealed a national carbon pricing scheme that required polluters to pay for their emissions. Government analysis has blamed most of the increase on the expanding liquified natural gas industry, particularly in northern Western Australia. Yet the most significant liquified natural gas proposal is still in development. Known as the Burrup Hub expansion, it would tap gas from the Browse, Scarborough and Pluto basins off the north-west Australian coast and use existing facilities to process it for export. Companies involved in the development include Shell, BP and BHP. A new analysis by the Conservation Council of Western Australia, based on data from the proponents, has found the total emissions from the new gasfields and the expanded liquified natural gas processing facilities that make up the Burrup Hub proposal would be nearly 20m tonnes a year. It says there would be at least another 80m tonnes a year in \u201cscope three\u201d emissions when the gas is burned overseas. The Conservation Council director said over a proposed 50-year lifespan that could mean up to 5bn tonnes of emissions from the hub.

New data from world-renowned researchers reveals how this cohort of state-owned and multinational firms are driving the climate emergency that threatens the future of humanity, and details how they have continued to expand their operations despite being aware of the industry\u2019s devastating impact on the planet. The analysis, by Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute in the US, the world\u2019s leading authority on big oil\u2019s role in the escalating climate emergency, evaluates what the global corporations have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions these fossil fuels are responsible for since 1965 \u2013 the point at which experts say the environmental impact of fossil fuels was known by both industry leaders and politicians. The top 20 companies on the list have contributed to 35% of all energy-related carbon dioxide and methane worldwide, totalling 480bn tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) since 1965. Those identified range from investor-owned firms \u2013 household names such as Chevron, Exxon, BP and Shell \u2013 to state-owned companies including Saudi Aramco and Gazprom. Chevron topped the list of the eight investor-owned corporations, followed closely by Exxon, BP and Shell. Together these four global businesses are behind more than 10% of the world\u2019s carbon emissions since 1965. Twelve of the top 20 companies are state-owned and together their extractions are responsible for 20% of total emissions in the same period. The leading state-owned polluter is Saudi Aramco, which has produced 4.38% of the global total on its own. Michael Mann, one of the world\u2019s leading climate scientists, said the findings shone a light on the role of fossil fuel companies and called on politicians at the forthcoming climate talks in Chile in December to take urgent measures to rein in their activities. \u201cThe great tragedy of the climate crisis is that seven and a half billion people must pay the price \u2013 in the form of a degraded planet \u2013 so that a couple of dozen polluting interests can continue to make record profits.

The latest study builds on previous work by Heede and his team that has looked at the historical role of fossil fuel companies in the escalating climate crisis. The impact of emissions from coal, oil and gas produced by fossil fuel companies has been huge. According to research published in 2017 by Peter Frumhoff at the Union of Concerned Scientists in the US and colleagues, CO2 and methane emissions from the 90 biggest industrial carbon producers were responsible for almost half the rise in global temperature and close to a third of the sea level rise between 1880 and 2010.

In November 1965, the president, Lyndon Johnson, released a report authored by the Environmental Pollution Panel of the President\u2019s Science Advisory Committee, which set out the likely impact of continued fossil fuel production on global heating. In the same year, the president of the American Petroleum Institute told its annual gathering: \u201cOne of the most important predictions of the [president\u2019s report] is that carbon dioxide is being added to the Earth\u2019s atmosphere by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas at such a rate by the year 2000 the heat balance will be so modified as possibly to cause marked changes in climate beyond local or even national efforts.\u201d Heede added: \u201cLeading companies and industry associations were aware of, or wilfully ignored, the threat of climate change from continued use of their products since the late 1950s.\u201d The research aims to hold to account those companies most responsible for carbon emissions, and shift public and political debate away from a focus just on individual responsibility. It follows a warning from the UN in 2018 that the world has just 12 years to avoid the worst consequences of runaway global heating and restrict temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The study shows that many of the worst offenders are investor-owned companies that are household names around the world and spend billions of pounds on lobbying governments and portraying themselves as environmentally responsible. A study earlier this year found that the largest five stock-market-listed oil and gas companies spend nearly $200m each year lobbying to delay, control or block policies to tackle climate change. Heede said the companies had a \u201csignificant moral, financial, and legal responsibility for the climate crisis, and a commensurate burden to help address the problem\u201d. He added: \u201cEven though global consumers from individuals to corporations are the ultimate emitters of carbon dioxide, the Climate Accountability Institute focuses its work on the fossil fuel companies that, in our view, have their collective hand on the throttle and the tiller determining the rate of carbon emissions and the shift to non-carbon fuels.\u201d",

Nations, cities and business leaders have committed to reducing emissions; protesters around the world are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/30/time-is-running-out-xr-activists-on-why-they-risked-arrest\" title=\"\">demanding action</a>. I have great hope that emissions will be curbed, but I am concerned that the phenomenally profitable fossil fuel companies have the capital, skills and political clout to outwit any efforts to eliminate emissions by 2050. How can emissions decline to any significant degree if oil, gas and coal companies are committed to actually increasing the supply of fossil fuels?</p> \n<p>That\u2019s why we decided to take them on. The Climate Accountability Institute was formed in 2011 to confront fossil fuel companies. We calculated the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change\" title=\"\">emissions traceable</a> to their annual production of crude oil, natural gas and coal historically \u2013 atmospheric warming is driven chiefly by past emissions and long-term carbon dioxide concentrations \u2013 and estimated future emissions based on their proven reserves. We challenged their inadequate plans to reduce the climate impacts of the carbon supply chain.

The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the <a href=\"http://climateaccountability.org/\">Climate Accountability Institute</a>,&nbsp;calculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers. Heede said: \"The fact that consumers combust the fuels to carbon dioxide, water, heat and pollutants does not absolve the fossil fuel companies from responsibility for knowingly perpetuating the carbon era and accelerating the climate crisis toward the existential threat it has now become.\"</p>\n    <p>One aim of the project is to move the focus of debate from individual responsibilities to power structures \u2013 so our reporters also examined the financial and lobbying structures that let fossil fuel firms keep growing, and discovered which elected politicians were voting for change.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Another aim of the project is to press governments and corporations to close the gap between ambitious long-term promises and lacklustre short-term action. The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating.

I challenge oil executives to manage their companies in line with the best science on climate change. </p> \n<p>The pursuit of next quarter\u2019s profits must be shifted to embrace climate stewardship, or we leave as our legacy a bereft planet and a broken moral compass.

At the same time oil, natural gas and coal companies have benefited for decades from hundreds of billions in government subsidies incentivising fossil fuel development, as well as regulatory preferences and other taxpayer-funded costs, such as military protection for shipping lanes. Overall, companies are the beneficiaries of what climate economist Nicholas Stern has called the \u201cgreatest market failure the world has seen\u201d. We need to eliminate subsidies and regulatory preferences, and to price carbon so as to \u201cinternalise\u201d the vast costs of climate damages now mostly paid by people who did not cause the problem, such as today\u2019s farmers and tomorrow\u2019s children. Unravelling this tangled web is as complex as it is urgent if we are to avoid the frightening consequences of runaway climate chaos. Nations, cities and business leaders have committed to reducing emissions; protesters around the world are demanding action. I have great hope that emissions will be curbed, but I am concerned that the phenomenally profitable fossil fuel companies have the capital, skills and political clout to outwit any efforts to eliminate emissions by 2050. How can emissions decline to any significant degree if oil, gas and coal companies are committed to actually increasing the supply of fossil fuels? That\u2019s why we decided to take them on. The Climate Accountability Institute was formed in 2011 to confront fossil fuel companies. We calculated the emissions traceable to their annual production of crude oil, natural gas and coal historically \u2013 atmospheric warming is driven chiefly by past emissions and long-term carbon dioxide concentrations \u2013 and estimated future emissions based on their proven reserves. We challenged their inadequate plans to reduce the climate impacts of the carbon supply chain. We work with investigators, human rights commissioners, advocates and lawyers in an effort to curb the carbon industry\u2019s enthusiasm for unabated fossil fuel development. Our data is used by scientists and climate modellers to attribute climate impacts (such as sea level rise and ocean acidification) to each of the 100 fossil fuel companies in our database. It is used by lawyers seeking damages from specific companies for costs to protect or rebuild vulnerable homes and infrastructure from sea level rise, flooding or other attributable effects of climate change. Fossil fuel companies must not be allowed to sit on the sidelines, professing support for climate action while they continue to contribute to worsening climate chaos. I challenge oil executives to manage their companies in line with the best science on climate change. The pursuit of next quarter\u2019s profits must be shifted to embrace climate stewardship, or we leave as our legacy a bereft planet and a broken moral compass. We preside over our own future, and we owe it to our descendants and ourselves to eliminate climate change as a threat to our survival well before mid-century. Let\u2019s get on with it. \u2022 Richard Heede leads Climate Accountability Institute\u2019s Carbon Majors project, which traces carbon dioxide emissions to oil, gas, and coal producers",

      "bodyText": "The Chevron refinery that looms over Richmond, California, its muted orange tanks nestled into the scrubby low-slung hills above San Francisco Bay, is older than the city itself. The refinery processes nearly 250,000 barrels of crude oil each day. When it \u201cflares\u201d, as it did more often in 2018 than in any other year over the past decade, dark smoke spirals up and across town in the bay breeze. When it explodes, like it did in 1989, 1999 and 2012, the thick cloud is visible across the bay and beyond, a blot against the sky that ascends before falling and settling on everything within a multi-mile vicinity that is not covered, closed or sealed up. A fire on 6 August 2012 sent more than 15,000 people to seek treatment for respiratory distress at local hospitals. Richmond has long been known for the three Cs: crime, corruption and Chevron. You could also add coal to that list, which the Levin-Richmond terminal began exporting out of the city in 2013, along with coke, the petroleum-refining byproduct. Despite its proximity to San Francisco and Silicon Valley\u2019s wealth, Richmond\u2019s median household income is below the California state average, with more than 15% of residents living in poverty. More than 80% of residents are people of colour. And Richmond children have roughly twice the rate of asthma as their neighbours countywide. \u201cIt\u2019s a textbook example of an environmental justice community,\u201d said Matt Holmes, the executive director of the nonprofit Groundwork Richmond. \u201cI think the whole country owes Richmond a debt.\u201d And the city is here to collect. Richmond may be a company city, but it is in open and sustained conflict with the industries that sustain it. Environmental justice activists here are fighting a multi-front war against the fossil fuels that gave the city life, but which, they argue, are also slowly killing it. California\u2019s Democratic politics and green global reputation belie the state\u2019s large role in fossil fuel production. The five refineries that dot the eastern span of the bay coast have a combined daily capacity of more than 825,000 barrels, and four of the five export the oil-refining byproduct pet coke. Chevron\u2019s roots run deep in California \u2013 its headquarters is 34 miles inland from Richmond. The company contributes at least 10% of the city\u2019s budget through property taxes and fees, which it has frequently contested in court, seeking refunds and reductions. It also employs more people than any other single company \u2013 3,456 in 2016 \u2013 gives back tens of millions in local community benefits and operates its own local online newspaper, the Richmond Standard, to get out the good word about the fossil fuel giant. The population in closest proximity to the refinery has disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Data from the California Environmental Protection Agency places every community bordering the Chevron facility in the 99th centile for asthma. And since the refinery\u2019s modernisation plan has come online, with the addition of a new hydrogen plant, its incidents have spiked. It was this Richmond that in 2003 inspired activists to form the Richmond Progressive Alliance. The RPA ran a multi-partisan list of candidates for city government in 2004, who vowed to take no corporate money, instead keeping their hands clean and ready to take on Chevron should they win office. \u201cThe community in many ways were like: \u2018Chevron\u2019s been here for ever, you know, for 100 years, and we can\u2019t beat City Hall when they are all aligned with Chevron.

The Levin-Richmond Terminal Corporation was already exporting pet coke, which contains lead, arsenic and mercury. In 2013, it began exporting coal, too, from Utah and Colorado mines \u2013 according to activists, nearly 1m metric tonnes were exported through Richmond in 2018. Because coal is prone to combust, it is transported in uncovered train cars, leaving the dust to catch the wind and scatter. Local residents and activists only realised what was happening months, if not years, later, when they noticed the new trains and the coat of thin black grime that came with them. \u201cHistorically we have terrible health impacts in Richmond, but we have a whole bunch of sources of pollution,\u201d said Janet Johnson, an organiser at No Coal in Richmond. \u201cThis is an issue that has united communities all across Richmond.

In response to the Guardian\u2019s questions, Chevron said it had \u201ca longstanding commitment to reduce emissions at our [Richmond] facility. \u201cRichmond refinery operates under the strict rules and regulations established by the California Air Resources board and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, the agencies responsible for monitoring and regulating sources of air emissions.\u201d It declined to answer questions about the lawsuit or the health problems in the area, but pointed to its financial support for local groups, particularly in education. The \u201ccap and trade\u201d programme, designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, has also been hailed as landmark environmental policy. But politicians and activists in Richmond say it has established a market of pollution for the fossil fuel industry that disproportionately hurts them. \u201cIt does nothing to reduce pollution at their sources, including communities like Richmond, where we\u2019ve seen emissions actually go up, because they\u2019re purchasing offsets they can afford,\u201d said Andr\u00e9s Soto, an RPA co-founder and community organiser at Communities for a Better Environment. As part of a bill renewing cap and trade in 2017, the state established volunteer steering committees in highly polluted cities to involve communities in local air-quality planning.

At one point he called his home \u201cthe Ruins\u201d. At night he and his three brothers \u201ctook it in turns to wet the bed \u2013 there were many times when I dreamt I was asleep in a submarine that had just been torpedoed\u201d. At school there were meatheads who made monkey noises and picked fights. \u201cNot this again,\u201d Henry said to one of them. \u201cY\u2019must really fancy me, cos you\u2019re always tryin\u2019 to get to me to roll around on the ground with ya.\u201d \u201cShut y\u2019mouth, coon.\u201d \u201cHere we go,\u201d Henry replied. \u201cYou hit me, I hit you \u2013 we fall on the ground and hug. Why don\u2019t we go and have dinner and a movie first? Cut out all the fighting?\u201d</p> <p>For a while, the comic stage offered a safe harbour. So many light entertainers from the 70s have been found guilty of abusing their fame, it\u2019s a relief to read Henry paying tribute to the artistry and friendship of performers such as Bob Monkhouse, Leslie Crowther and Ken Dodd. <em>Crackerjack</em> presenter Don Maclean \u201cwould stalk the stage like a velociraptor \u2013 marking out his territory and spraying jokes at each point of the compass \u2026 I hero-worshipped him\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I didn\u2019t want to smash the oppressor, or kill Whitey. I wanted to smash box office records and buy my Mama a house</p> <footer> <cite>Lenny Henry</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Henry\u2019s accounts of touring in a stage version of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/aug/29/broadcasting2\" title=\"\">The Black and White Minstrel Show</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/aug/29/broadcasting2\" title=\"\"> </a>are finely recalled. He gets to meet girls, former matinee idols, the sequin-wearing magicians Anna and Maria \u2013 and their outsized parrot, Miggsy. His companions were, he says, \u201cvagabonds, mountebanks and felons \u2013 constantly moving from town to town, wreaking havoc and then skipping town before daybreak to avoid hostile landlords, one-night stands or irate husbands\u201d. That itinerary of broken-down cinemas and working men\u2019s clubs (\u201cwooden taps for the beer and ancient bags of pork scratchings and crisps and nuts pinned to the wall\u201d) ground him down. As did his suspicion that the Minstrels were using him as a \u201cpolitical football\u201d in order to avoid accusations of racism.</p> <p>Prejudice was up front and proud in those days. West Indian kids yelled \u201cWhite man! Yu is a white man!\u201d at Henry because of his Dudley accent. Later, after he married fellow comedian Dawn French, members of the National Front stuffed burning rags through their letterbox. Yet looking at a photograph of himself from 1978, he notes: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to smash the oppressor, or kill Whitey. I wanted to smash box office records and buy my Mama a house.\u201d And he also admits: \u201cI do wish I stood up more against racism. I wonder if turning one\u2019s back is really the answer.\u201d</p> <p>Being a mimic allowed him, for a few minutes each night, to become someone else. And to be applauded for it. But while mimicry can be subversive, a way to cock a snook at authority, it can also be mere parrotry, survival through self-cancellation. For Henry, \u201cit was a pathway \u2013 it was integration writ large\u201d. He says that when he joined <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jun/18/overnights1\" title=\"\">Tiswas</a></em>, the anarchic Saturday morning children\u2019s programme on ITV, he suspected the cast pitied him for having spent so much time in conservative company.</p> <p>Henry\u2019s instability, his search for a voice of his own, extends to his prose. He can be chatty and colloquial, all banter and bonhomie, recalling teenage high jinks with dizzied abandon. He can also be a bit pompous (\u201cI\u2019ve slowly come to understand the complexities of displacement, loneliness and the need for companionship\u201d) and overly citational (quoting Derek Walcott, Nelson Mandela, CS Lewis). In the final, misguided section of the book he shifts to mentor mode, dispensing advice on microphone technique to would-be comics.</p> <p>He suggests he is readying two more volumes of memoir. That seems excessive. <em>Who Am I Again?</em> is raw, touching and all over the place. He says it\u2019s not an autobiography, but a biography (\u201cbecause I\u2019m writing about someone I used to know\u201d). He suspects he\u2019s not black enough, not manly enough. Often he feels adrift, lost, in a \u201cduvet of sadness\u201d. The book ends with the question in its title left unanswered.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Who Am I Again? </em>is published by Faber (\u00a320).

At night he and his three brothers \u201ctook it in turns to wet the bed \u2013 there were many times when I dreamt I was asleep in a submarine that had just been torpedoed\u201d. At school there were meatheads who made monkey noises and picked fights. \u201cNot this again,\u201d Henry said to one of them. \u201cY\u2019must really fancy me, cos you\u2019re always tryin\u2019 to get to me to roll around on the ground with ya.\u201d \u201cShut y\u2019mouth, coon.\u201d \u201cHere we go,\u201d Henry replied. \u201cYou hit me, I hit you \u2013 we fall on the ground and hug. Why don\u2019t we go and have dinner and a movie first? Cut out all the fighting?\u201d For a while, the comic stage offered a safe harbour. So many light entertainers from the 70s have been found guilty of abusing their fame, it\u2019s a relief to read Henry paying tribute to the artistry and friendship of performers such as Bob Monkhouse, Leslie Crowther and Ken Dodd. Crackerjack presenter Don Maclean \u201cwould stalk the stage like a velociraptor \u2013 marking out his territory and spraying jokes at each point of the compass \u2026 I hero-worshipped him\u201d. Henry\u2019s accounts of touring in a stage version of The Black and White Minstrel Show are finely recalled. He gets to meet girls, former matinee idols, the sequin-wearing magicians Anna and Maria \u2013 and their outsized parrot, Miggsy. His companions were, he says, \u201cvagabonds, mountebanks and felons \u2013 constantly moving from town to town, wreaking havoc and then skipping town before daybreak to avoid hostile landlords, one-night stands or irate husbands\u201d. That itinerary of broken-down cinemas and working men\u2019s clubs (\u201cwooden taps for the beer and ancient bags of pork scratchings and crisps and nuts pinned to the wall\u201d) ground him down. As did his suspicion that the Minstrels were using him as a \u201cpolitical football\u201d in order to avoid accusations of racism. Prejudice was up front and proud in those days. West Indian kids yelled \u201cWhite man! Yu is a white man!\u201d at Henry because of his Dudley accent. Later, after he married fellow comedian Dawn French, members of the National Front stuffed burning rags through their letterbox. Yet looking at a photograph of himself from 1978, he notes: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to smash the oppressor, or kill Whitey. I wanted to smash box office records and buy my Mama a house.\u201d And he also admits: \u201cI do wish I stood up more against racism. I wonder if turning one\u2019s back is really the answer.\u201d Being a mimic allowed him, for a few minutes each night, to become someone else. And to be applauded for it. But while mimicry can be subversive, a way to cock a snook at authority, it can also be mere parrotry, survival through self-cancellation. For Henry, \u201cit was a pathway \u2013 it was integration writ large\u201d. He says that when he joined Tiswas, the anarchic Saturday morning children\u2019s programme on ITV, he suspected the cast pitied him for having spent so much time in conservative company. Henry\u2019s instability, his search for a voice of his own, extends to his prose. He can be chatty and colloquial, all banter and bonhomie, recalling teenage high jinks with dizzied abandon. He can also be a bit pompous (\u201cI\u2019ve slowly come to understand the complexities of displacement, loneliness and the need for companionship\u201d) and overly citational (quoting Derek Walcott, Nelson Mandela, CS Lewis). In the final, misguided section of the book he shifts to mentor mode, dispensing advice on microphone technique to would-be comics. He suggests he is readying two more volumes of memoir. That seems excessive. Who Am I Again? is raw, touching and all over the place. He says it\u2019s not an autobiography, but a biography (\u201cbecause I\u2019m writing about someone I used to know\u201d). He suspects he\u2019s not black enough, not manly enough. Often he feels adrift, lost, in a \u201cduvet of sadness\u201d. The book ends with the question in its title left unanswered. \u2022 Who Am I Again? is published by Faber (\u00a320).

With settled status, any children born in the UK will automatically be British citizens. With pre-settled status, the child would be born with pre-settled status, unless it qualified for British citizenship directly through one of the parents.</p>\n    <p>The deadline for applying is 30 June 2021, or 31 December 2020 if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.

With windy, dry weather in the forecast and warnings of extreme fire danger, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric utility said it will start turning off power to 34 counties in northern and central California after midnight Wednesday. It may take several days to fully restore power, Michael Lewis, the senior vice-president of PG&amp;E\u2019s electric operations, said in a statement. Separately, the Southern California Edison utility website said more than 106,000 of its customers in parts of eight counties could face power cuts. The affected regions include an area of wine country north of San Francisco where several fires two years ago killed 22 people and destroyed thousands of homes. On the second anniversary of the disaster, survivors of those fires said they were poised to lose the insurance coverage that allowed them to pay for temporary housing while they waited out the rebuilding process of their new homes. In the Santa Rosa area \u2013 which was heavily affected by the fires \u2013 only 20% of reconstruction has been completed while 62.5% is still in process. The outages will also affect portions of the agricultural Central Valley, the state\u2019s northern and central coasts and the Sierra Nevada foothills, where a November wildfire blamed on PG&amp;E transmission lines killed 85 people and devastated the town of Paradise. In Butte County, where Paradise is located, people lined up at gas stations Tuesday morning to fill up their cars and portable containers with fuel for generators. They also rushed to stores to buy flashlights, ice chests and batteries. San Francisco is the only county in the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area where power will not be affected. Some of California\u2019s most destructive blazes in recent years were started by PG&amp;E power lines. This year, the company agreed to pay billions of dollars to a group of insurance companies representing claimants from deadly northern California wildfires in 2017 and 2018. But the potential outages will not be limited to fire-prone areas because the utilities must turn off entire distribution and transmission lines to much wider areas to minimize the risk of wildfires. The California department of forestry and fire prevention said it had increased staffing in preparation for extreme fire weather and what was expected to be the strongest wind event so far this fire season. \u201cWith some of the most destructive and deadliest fires occurring October through December, we need Californians to not be complacent,\u201d said the Cal Fire chief, Thom Porter, in a news release. \u201cResidents need to be ready to evacuate at a moment\u2019s notice in the event of a wildfire.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The fierce rivalry between Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s Godolphin operation and John Magnier\u2019s Coolmore Stud moved from the racecourse to the sales ring, as the sport\u2019s biggest players engaged in a bidding war for a Dubawi half-brother to Group One winner Barney Roy on the first day of Tattersalls\u2019 prestigious Book 1 sale. The winning bid of 3.6m gns [\u00a33.78m], eventually made on behalf of Godolphin, was the highest price paid for a yearling in Europe this year. He is the most expensive purchase for Godolphin at Book 1 since Sheikh Mohammed paid 4m gns for the filly Gloam in 2017. \u201cWe knew he was a lovely horse but you don\u2019t expect that sort of figure when you go in there,\u201d said Adrian O\u2019Brien, from the consignor Hazelwood Bloodstock. \u201cI\u2019m blown away. To be honest, when we got up around the million I was quite satisfied and the rest was just an amazing experience, to watch those figures go up. \u201cI think Coolmore was the under-bidder and it\u2019s what every consignor dreams of to get Darley [Sheikh Mohammed] and Coolmore on one. He\u2019s been beautiful from day one.\u201d Earlier, a colt by Dubawi out of the Group One-winning mare The Fugue was the first lot to be knocked down for a seven-figure price as Tattersalls\u2019 October Book 1 Sale, Europe\u2019s most prestigious yearling auction, got under way in Newmarket. David Redvers, bidding on behalf of Qatar Racing, made the final bid of 1m gns. He will join John Gosden, who trained The Fugue to win four Group One races for Lord Lloyd-Webber. It is the second year running that Redvers has gone to seven figures at Book 1 for a Dubawi yearling from Lloyd-Webber\u2019s Watership Down Stud. Kevin Ryan, who has enjoyed -several valuable successes during his first two seasons training for leading owner Sheikh Mohammed Obaid, secured another seven-figure colt to run in the Sheikh\u2019s colours, paying 1m gns for a half-brother to the Group One winners, Tamarkuz and Without Parole. Wednesday\u2019s best bets The new jumps season gets under way a week earlier than expected at Wincanton, when the track will stage one of the final fixtures transferred from now-defunct Towcester (the last \u201cTowcester\u201d fixture of all, in case anyone wants to mark it, was scheduled for 19 December). The flat Somerset track could hardly offer more of a contrast with the famously demanding uphill finish at Towcester, a reminder of the important variety that is lost whenever a course closes, but it is also one of the most popular smaller venues in the game and will hopefully pull in a decent crowd thanks to a flat-rate \u00a310 ticket. Oleg (3.10) will take plenty of beating in the novice handicap chase, while it is a slight surprise to find Romanor (3.45) as the outsider of six runners in the handicap hurdle. Capitaine is the class act in the field, having won a Grade Two novice hurdle back in December 2016, and running for the first time since a wind-op too, but this is his first start since May and he is giving at least 12lb to all five of his opponents. Romanor should have a fitness edge and has been running well over the summer, including at Plumpton last time when he was given plenty to do. He has dropped another 2lb in the ratings and looks over-priced at around 15-2. Gone Platinum (1.15) and Misty Bloom (1.45) should both go well on the day\u2019s other jumps card at Ludlow, while Duke Of Condicote (2.55) has been well backed overnight for the nursery at Nottingham. He improved when fifth on heavy ground at Goodwood last time and 73 is a very fair opening mark for Alan King\u2019s colt. Marnie James (6.40) is also worth close inspection at Kempton. He was down the field in the Portland Handicap last time but had previously put up a couple of big runs for his new trainer, Jedd O\u2019Keeffe, following a mid-season switch from Iain Jardine.

      "body": "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s decision to abandon America\u2019s partners in the majority Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is yet another illustration of how the president\u2019s rash foreign policy results in disastrous consequences.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/08/the-guardian-view-on-trump-and-syria-damage-has-been-done\">The Guardian view on Trump and Syria: damage has been done | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To be sure\ufe0f, this is a complicated foreign policy challenge. The small US military presence in Syria is not sustainable forever. Still, US officials argued it\u2019s necessary to fight the Islamic State, protect our Kurdish partners and carve out a safe place for civilians amid the ongoing Syrian disaster. If the SDF-liberated areas could be stabilized, it was hoped, the US presence might provide leverage to try to end the war diplomatically. Whether one supports the mission or wants to wash America\u2019s hands of the Middle East, this is a tough call.<br> But none of this complexity matters because Trump can\u2019t make a coherent policy decision. Rather than craft a withdrawal plan, Trump made the decision on a whim after a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-85/\">call</a> with Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, leaving American allies and interests out to dry.</p> <p>America\u2019s Kurdish partners are in danger. The SDF have led the fight against Isis and suffered 11,000 killed. But without US help, the Kurds now face a deadly onslaught from both Turkey and a resurgent Isis. When they learned about Trump\u2019s policy reversal, some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RichardEngel/status/1181149669017231360\">reportedly</a> called Americans \u201ctraitors\u201d.</p> <p>The fight against Isis will be crippled. Despite Trump\u2019s claims, Isis continues its insurgency. The SDF was the heart of the strategy to keep the pressure on Isis, leading raids, manning checkpoints and stabilizing liberated areas. The Kurds will now be forced to defend against a Turkish attack, and Isis will exploit the opening to regroup. More immediately, the Kurds are holding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/07/us-withdrawal-from-syria-leaves-fate-of-isis-fighters-and-families-in-detention-uncertain\">thousands</a> of Isis fighters because no one else would take responsibility. These fighters may escape or be released if the Kurds are forced to flee a Turkish offensive.</p> <p>America\u2019s closest allies were caught completely by surprise. Trump didn\u2019t warn the UK or France, even though both countries also have troops on the ground.</p> <p>This move will also further confuse US policy towards Turkey. While Turkey is a Nato ally, it has become more authoritarian under Erdo\u011fan, and the US-Turkey alliance is on the rocks. But the US can\u2019t pick a policy: it is threatening to sanction Turkey for buying Russian military equipment; but Trump gave Turkey the green light to massacre US partners; after announcing his Syria decision, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1181232249821388801\">tweeted</a> that if Turkey does anything \u201coff limits\u201d, Trump would \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey \u2026\u201d, which was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1181547331822456832\">followed</a> by praise of Turkey and an invitation to Washington for Erdo\u011fan.</p> <p>Russia and Syria are the real winners. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has long supported Syrian president Bashar al-Assad\u2019s brutal war, intentionally targeting civilians, schools and hospitals. The Syrian regime will now have even more of a free hand to seek its retribution, and Russia will reap the benefits.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s decision to abandon America\u2019s partners in the majority Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is yet another illustration of how the president\u2019s rash foreign policy results in disastrous consequences. To be sure\ufe0f, this is a complicated foreign policy challenge. The small US military presence in Syria is not sustainable forever. Still, US officials argued it\u2019s necessary to fight the Islamic State, protect our Kurdish partners and carve out a safe place for civilians amid the ongoing Syrian disaster. If the SDF-liberated areas could be stabilized, it was hoped, the US presence might provide leverage to try to end the war diplomatically. Whether one supports the mission or wants to wash America\u2019s hands of the Middle East, this is a tough call. But none of this complexity matters because Trump can\u2019t make a coherent policy decision. Rather than craft a withdrawal plan, Trump made the decision on a whim after a call with Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, leaving American allies and interests out to dry. America\u2019s Kurdish partners are in danger. The SDF have led the fight against Isis and suffered 11,000 killed. But without US help, the Kurds now face a deadly onslaught from both Turkey and a resurgent Isis. When they learned about Trump\u2019s policy reversal, some reportedly called Americans \u201ctraitors\u201d. The fight against Isis will be crippled. Despite Trump\u2019s claims, Isis continues its insurgency. The SDF was the heart of the strategy to keep the pressure on Isis, leading raids, manning checkpoints and stabilizing liberated areas. The Kurds will now be forced to defend against a Turkish attack, and Isis will exploit the opening to regroup. More immediately, the Kurds are holding thousands of Isis fighters because no one else would take responsibility. These fighters may escape or be released if the Kurds are forced to flee a Turkish offensive. America\u2019s closest allies were caught completely by surprise. Trump didn\u2019t warn the UK or France, even though both countries also have troops on the ground. This move will also further confuse US policy towards Turkey. While Turkey is a Nato ally, it has become more authoritarian under Erdo\u011fan, and the US-Turkey alliance is on the rocks. But the US can\u2019t pick a policy: it is threatening to sanction Turkey for buying Russian military equipment; but Trump gave Turkey the green light to massacre US partners; after announcing his Syria decision, Trump tweeted that if Turkey does anything \u201coff limits\u201d, Trump would \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey \u2026\u201d, which was followed by praise of Turkey and an invitation to Washington for Erdo\u011fan. Russia and Syria are the real winners. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has long supported Syrian president Bashar al-Assad\u2019s brutal war, intentionally targeting civilians, schools and hospitals. The Syrian regime will now have even more of a free hand to seek its retribution, and Russia will reap the benefits. Trump has a knack for making decisions that help Russia and hurt the US. The decision was not even coordinated within the US government. The secretary of defense quickly came out with a statement \u2013 which was later deleted \u2013 trying to walk back Trump\u2019s statement that Turkey could start an operation against the Kurds. And the immediate reaction on the ground in Syria appeared to be confusion. The US \u2013 again, under Trump \u2013 looks incompetent. And yet, none of this is surprising. Trump doesn\u2019t make policy decisions considering normal interests like those above \u2013 he has impulses that steer the most powerful country the world has ever known. Trump\u2019s foreign policy has been so disastrous that the House of Representatives is in the midst of an impeachment inquiry over the fact that the president attempted to extort a foreign power \u2013 Ukraine \u2013 to fabricate smears against Trump\u2019s domestic political rival. Trump then also publicly asked China \u2013 which is supposed to be America\u2019s greatest geopolitical rival \u2013 to help create a scandal for Trump\u2019s opponent. So what caused this particular disaster? Was it Trump\u2019s self-admitted conflict of interest with Turkey? Perhaps Erdo\u011fan offered to make up dirt on Trump\u2019s opponents? Maybe Trump asked him to? Or maybe it was simply what a National Security Council source told Newsweek: \u201cPresident Trump was definitely out-negotiated.\u201d Despite all of this, removing the US military presence at some point might actually be the right call.

Customers will be able to book an appointment with a Home Tech Expert, to help install a new technology product or fix a technical problem. Repair visits will be free for all BT home broadband, TV and phone line customers. The initiative is reminiscent of Team Knowhow, the service set up by Dixons Carphone, which owns Currys and PC World, which replaced its TechGuys service in 2010. In 2006, Carphone Warehouse, now part of Dixons Carphone, brought US firm Best Buy\u2019s pioneering IT help service, Geek Squad, to the UK. In March, the Financial Conduct Authority fined Carphone Warehouse \u00a329.1m for mis-selling the Geek Squad mobile phone insurance and technical support service over a seven-year period. \u201cWe\u2019re creating a brand new team of 900 colleagues that we\u2019re calling Home Tech Experts,\u201d said Philip Jansen, chief executive of BT. \u201cThey\u2019ll take away the complexity our customers can face in setting up and getting the most out of their technology, providing more personal, more local customer service direct to people\u2019s homes.\u201d The BT brand will also be making a high street comeback 15 years after shutting its last retail store. BT intends to transform 600 EE shops across the UK, which it acquired following the \u00a312.5bn deal to buy the mobile phone company in 2015, into dual-branded outlets. Jansen said boosting its high street presence was \u201cgoing against the tide\u201d amid widespread retail store closures. The British Retail Consortium estimates that one in 10 shops in town centres are lying empty. BT said the dual-branded stores would provide consumers and small business customers with local access to its sales and support experts with \u201ceverything from getting online for the first time to the latest in smart home technology\u201d. The company said it is also accelerating by a year its plan to return all of its customer call centres to the UK and Ireland and will complete the initiative by January 2020. Last May, BT announced plans to cut 13,000 jobs over three years and move out of its central London headquarters after almost 150 years to cut \u00a31.5bn in costs.

What was once a deliciously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/16/man-white-suit-french-studiocanal\">subversive Ealing comedy</a> has, however, now become a riotously busy, squealing farce. It\u2019s enjoyable on its own terms and boasts a fine performance from Stephen Mangan but it lacks the Ealing touch.</p> <p>Even though the action has been updated from 1951 to 1956, the premise remains the same: a lone scientist, Sidney Stratton, invents a synthetic material that never wears out. Briefly acclaimed, it\u2019s a discovery that has to be suppressed because it would disrupt the market and destroy jobs. But while the story follows the Alexander Mackendrick movie, itself based on a stage play by Roger MacDougall, the tone could hardly be more different. Within the first few minutes, we have exploding apparatus, fart jokes and a skiffle number written by Charlie Fink in which Sidney stands on a table and sings: \u201cI\u2019m going to make the world a better place.\u201d Subtlety is clearly not the name of the game. Even the show\u2019s topical gags, including one about circumventing the law for the good of the country, are remorselessly underlined.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f288b5e4da7b1db8c4495d38e2ef0e2b858adac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f288b5e4da7b1db8c4495d38e2ef0e2b858adac/0_0_2414_1555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sue Johnston, Rina Fatania and Stephen Mangan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"644\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Good-hearted \u2026 Sue Johnston, Rina Fatania and Stephen Mangan</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nobby Clark</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The basic style is one of breezy populism perfectly well executed. Mangan\u2019s Sidney is totally unlike the saintly innocent portrayed by Alec Guinness but he is toothily engaging, tirelessly energetic and has a coyly seductive dance with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jan/29/kara-tointon-interview-absent-friends\">Kara Tointon</a>, who invests an industrialist\u2019s daughter with an independent spirit. There is decent support from Richard Cordery as her bellicose dad, Richard Durden as a decrepit tycoon and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/feb/22/coronation-street-sue-johnston-month-soaps\">Sue Johnston</a> as a good-hearted landlady.</p> <p>Foley\u2019s production and Michael Taylor\u2019s design also brim with invention: a car suddenly materialises like an unfolding bed, the boss\u2019s baronial mansion is filled with sword fights, miniaturised figures engage in a chase across a Lowryesque landscape. It is all hectically and boisterously theatrical but what I missed was the movie\u2019s quietly satirical portrait of a sclerotic society in which it appeared nothing would ever change.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.delfontmackintosh.co.uk/tickets/the-man-in-the-white-suit/\">At Wyndham\u2019s theatre, London, until 11 January</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This is Sean Foley\u2019s version of a beloved movie that depicted a stagnant Britain in which capital and labour unite to thwart innovation. What was once a deliciously subversive Ealing comedy has, however, now become a riotously busy, squealing farce. It\u2019s enjoyable on its own terms and boasts a fine performance from Stephen Mangan but it lacks the Ealing touch. Even though the action has been updated from 1951 to 1956, the premise remains the same: a lone scientist, Sidney Stratton, invents a synthetic material that never wears out. Briefly acclaimed, it\u2019s a discovery that has to be suppressed because it would disrupt the market and destroy jobs. But while the story follows the Alexander Mackendrick movie, itself based on a stage play by Roger MacDougall, the tone could hardly be more different. Within the first few minutes, we have exploding apparatus, fart jokes and a skiffle number written by Charlie Fink in which Sidney stands on a table and sings: \u201cI\u2019m going to make the world a better place.\u201d Subtlety is clearly not the name of the game. Even the show\u2019s topical gags, including one about circumventing the law for the good of the country, are remorselessly underlined. The basic style is one of breezy populism perfectly well executed. Mangan\u2019s Sidney is totally unlike the saintly innocent portrayed by Alec Guinness but he is toothily engaging, tirelessly energetic and has a coyly seductive dance with Kara Tointon, who invests an industrialist\u2019s daughter with an independent spirit. There is decent support from Richard Cordery as her bellicose dad, Richard Durden as a decrepit tycoon and Sue Johnston as a good-hearted landlady. Foley\u2019s production and Michael Taylor\u2019s design also brim with invention: a car suddenly materialises like an unfolding bed, the boss\u2019s baronial mansion is filled with sword fights, miniaturised figures engage in a chase across a Lowryesque landscape. It is all hectically and boisterously theatrical but what I missed was the movie\u2019s quietly satirical portrait of a sclerotic society in which it appeared nothing would ever change. \u2022 At Wyndham\u2019s theatre, London, until 11 January.",

That\u2019s all from me. Bye!</p> <blockquote> <p>That\u2019s the easy part done, the hard bit is still to come. Scotland beat Russia 61-0, their biggest win in 15 years, and earned the bonus point they needed just five minutes into the second half. That means that they now have 10 points in the pool, which puts them one behind Ireland, and four behind Japan, who they need to beat in Yokohama on Sunday. It\u2019ll have to be a handsome victory, too, because if Japan pick up a bonus point for losing by seven points or less, Scotland will need one too, for scoring four tries or more. Assuming that is, they get to play at all.</p> <p>Super Typhoon Hagibis is forecast to hit the Tokyo area this weekend. World Rugby have not announced their contingency plans yet and it is not clear whether, when, or where the match will go ahead. The Russians will be gone by then.

It was an excellent performance and shows the depth that we have. I thought Adam Hastings brought a really good balance to his game. Some excellent kicking in the first half put pressure on the Russians, so they had to play from deep, and then his running game and link play was excellent.

But will Scotland be able to weather their own storm and emerge from an unexpectedly tempestuous Pool A into the sunlight uplands of the knock-out stages? To do so they need maximum points from their next two matches, here and against the hosts in Yokohama on Sunday. They go into this game with a massively changed team \u2013 only Darcy Graham remains from the XV that started the win over Samoa \u2013 having decided, not unreasonably, to train maximum firepower on Japan. Russia have been extremely consistent \u2013 they have conceded no fewer than 30 points in their three games thus far, and no more than 35 \u2013 and make nine changes to the team that lost to Ireland. By the looks of the latest weather forecast there will be plenty of plain sailing on the Pacific Ocean just off the coast of the Shizuoka Prefecture, but will Scotland enjoy similar conditions in the Shizuoka Stadium? Time will tell, and not much of it at that.

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s a match report from Andy Bull in Shizuoka. That\u2019s all from me. Bye! That\u2019s the easy part done, the hard bit is still to come. Scotland beat Russia 61-0, their biggest win in 15 years, and earned the bonus point they needed just five minutes into the second half. That means that they now have 10 points in the pool, which puts them one behind Ireland, and four behind Japan, who they need to beat in Yokohama on Sunday. It\u2019ll have to be a handsome victory, too, because if Japan pick up a bonus point for losing by seven points or less, Scotland will need one too, for scoring four tries or more. Assuming that is, they get to play at all. Super Typhoon Hagibis is forecast to hit the Tokyo area this weekend. World Rugby have not announced their contingency plans yet and it is not clear whether, when, or where the match will go ahead. The Russians will be gone by then. They looked utterly spent, and turned in their worst game yet. Much more here: The rugby isn\u2019t over for the day quite yet: Barry Glendenning is on the Wales v Fiji beat here: All the vital pool tables and results and stuff have been lovingly collated for you here: Russia\u2019s captain, Vasily Artemyev, has been presented with a brand new No15 shirt while his team-mates gather around applauding. He probably doesn\u2019t need any more No15 shirts, but it\u2019s the thought that counts. Gregor Townsend has a chat: They played some excellent rugby. That first 10-15 minutes of the game was very competitive. Russia were here to play, they moved the ball wide, we know how physical they are, they challenge well, the breakdowns, so we had to put a really resilient performance together and take the gaps when they started to appear. It was an excellent performance and shows the depth that we have. I thought Adam Hastings brought a really good balance to his game. Some excellent kicking in the first half put pressure on the Russians, so they had to play from deep, and then his running game and link play was excellent. Still a few areas to improve, but both him and George Horne combined very well. We\u2019ll see what happens on Saturday now with the Samoa-Ireland game, because that is a factor if Ireland don\u2019t get maximum points and it could be a three-way tie. But we know we have to win and we have to win by seven clear points if we\u2019re going to get into the last eight, and that\u2019ll be a big challenge because Japan are a very good team and have had a pretty good rest going into this game. So Scotland have won their last two games by an aggregate score of 95-0, and that\u2019s despite having two tries ruled out here for slightly forward passes (though ITV are currently arguing that George Horne\u2019s fourth try should have stood). There was some excellent play here, with Darcy Graham\u2019s fantastic run for the all-important fourth try the highlight. John Barclay, Scotland\u2019s captain, has a chat: We enjoyed that one. To be honest we were a little bit nervous coming into the game because of what we\u2019d seen Russia do to other teams in the tournament. So we prepared really well. I was proud of the boys, really professional, stuck to how we wanted to play the game and it was a good result. The Japan game wasn\u2019t on our minds at all, to be honest. I think we\u2019d have been doing a disservice to Russia if we\u2019d done that. I spoke to the boys in the week, if we have one eye on Japan it\u2019s easy to take your eye off this game. Certainly the guys who were playing were very focused on this game. 81 mins: Time for one more try! Adam Hastings touches down! But again the final pass, this time from Tommy Seymour, went forwards and it\u2019s chalked off! The game ends with Hastings\u2019 head in his hands as the hat-trick is ripped from his grasp. 79 mins: Again excellent from Adam Hastings. 78 mins: Good work from Duncan Taylor on the left helps Scotland surge into Russian space, and when the ball is worked to the right Stuart McInally manages to sprint to the line before Dmitrii Gerasimov can bring him down! 76 mins: A try for the captain, John Barclay! He runs the final 30m against nonexistent opposition. The final defender, German Davydov, just stands still and ushers him past. Hopeless from Russia, who allow Barclay to touch down between the posts and give Hastings an easy conversion. 74 mins: Iurii Kushnarev rampages down the left for a while, signs of life and ambition still for Russia. But once he\u2019s tackled, they lose the ball in short order. 72 mins: There has been a discernible loss of intensity in the last few minutes. Russia concede a penalty for a no-arms tackle on Hastings. They could probably have banked the points but Scotland kick to touch, in search of another try. 69 mins: Russia lose another line-out. Their World Cup is not so much ending as unravelling. 65 mins: It\u2019s chalked off. That was a poor mistake from Bradbury, who fluffed a completely straightforward pass. Not that it matters much at this stage. 64 mins: Russia are once again sliced open by a surging Scot. This time it\u2019s WP Nel, who does his best impression of a sprinter for a while before offloading. The ball is worked left where Bradbury feeds Horne for another. It looked like the final pass went forwards, but will it be checked? 60 mins: At the seventh attempt, Hastings finally misses a conversion. 59 mins: Ramil Gaisin kicks clear, but within moments Russia are falling apart again! Pete Horne starts the rampage, passing inside to Henry Pyrgos, and he draws the final defender before feeding Horne to administer the coup de grace! 57 mins: That was an extremely difficult conversion made to look completely straightforward by a player brimming with confidence. Adam Hastings has had an immaculate evening. 55 mins: Two kicks lead to a sixth try. Duncan Taylor with the first, which travels 40m or so and rolls around a bit before being kicked away by Russia and into touch. Scotland take it quickly and Kinghorn prods through another kick which rolls conveniently down the right flank without ever quite making it into touch, and Tommy Seymour sprints onto it to touch down! 52 mins: Turns out Russia\u2019s defence is extremely flimsy. Scotland have scored some far too straightforward tries today, and that was another. 51 mins: A fifth try! And a first from a forward, as Scotland drive forwards before George Turner spins out of the maul with the ball in his hands and sprints to the line! 49 mins: Scotland threaten again, only for Kinghorn to fluff the final offload. 48 mins: Graham is immediately removed from the fray, to bask in the glory of that fabulous run. 46 mins: A successful conversion from Hastings, wide on the left. It had been an inauspicious start to the second half, until Graham sent it blooming into brilliant life. 45 mins: It\u2019s the try they wanted! And what a run from Darcy Graham! He catches a kick deep inside his own half, skips through any number of tiny slivers of space and finally presents George Horne with the final 10 metres of empty grass! 41 mins: Not a great start: Kinghorn\u2019s kick doesn\u2019t travel the requisite 10 metres, so Russia have a scrum on the centre spot. 41 mins: And they\u2019re off! The players are back out, and Blair Kinghorn preparing to get the game restarted. If Scotland haven\u2019t been perfect, they have at least made no significant missteps, and capitalised ruthlessly on their opponents\u2019. Russia\u2019s best chance was always to be strong defensively, maintaining that even if the Scots scored a single try, and capitalise on Scottish desperation when their four-try target started to look out of reach. Instead they conceded one try and then crumbled. 41 mins: George Horne knocks on as he\u2019s brought down a yard from the line, and the opportunity is lost. Scotland go into the break with three tries in the bank and one still to get. 40 mins: The gong sounds, with Scotland five yards from the line. 39 mins: Scotland threaten again as the half nears its conclusion. They are just inside Russia\u2019s 20-yard line, and pushing hard. 37 mins: Hastings tries another chip-and-run. This time he collects it hard on the left flank, and his attempt to kick it onwards for Graham to run on to only sends it spinning into touch. Here\u2019s a local weather update: 35 mins: A slightly scrappy phase of play this. \u201cNice to see the changing rooms in the stadium,\u201d says Rory Davies. \u201cWhen living nearby, we rented the stadium to play a game against a local Brazilian team (a reenactment of the 2002 world cup game). When we had the meeting with the guy in charge, he asked which changing rooms we wanted to use. The regular, or the one that Beckham used. As it was a municipally owned stadium, everything was ridiculously cheap. I think we paid 200 yen (just over a pound) to rent the managers\u2019 perspex \u201cdugouts\u201d and another 200 yen for corner flags and nets. And yes, we chose the Beckham changing rooms.\u201d So is the one Russia used a Beckham changing room or a regular one? Scotland\u2019s looks identical, for wht it\u2019s worth. 32 mins: Russia have also managed to lose a couple of their lineouts already. Stanislav Selskii goes long with one but none of his team-mates know about it, the ball bounces into Scottish hands and they are threatening again. 31 mins: Fraser Brown comes off, with Magnus Bradbury coming on. 28 mins: Here are the last two tries (you might not be able to see them if you\u2019re outside the UK, for which I apologise). The first is bad from Russia, the second worse. 25 mins: Incredible scenes. Having looked robust for nearly 20 minutes Russia have just fallen apart, conceding two completely unnecessary tries to leave Scotland just one away from the treasured bonus, with nearly an hour to find it! 22 mins: An absolute horrorshow! From a Russia line-out on their five-yard line Dmitriy Perov collects the ball and passes to his left. George Horne anticipates, intercepts and touches down before any Russian can react! 19 mins: Another one! And it\u2019s a horrendous mistake from Vasily Artemyev! Hastings chips through optimistically and finds himself in a race for the ball against Tagir Gadzhiev. He gets there first and kicks it forwards again, but it\u2019s overhit and it looks certain that Artemyev will get there first and save the day for Russia. Somehow, though, he dives past the ball without touching it, and Hastings touches down! 17 mins: Fine work from Hastings, though that was depressingly easy from a Russian perspective. Scotland have only once had the ball within 10 yards of the line, and they managed to convert it into a try in short order. 14 mins: And it leads to the first try! The ball is worked to Adam Hastings, and his dummy throws three Russian players and allows him to skip past the wrongfooted Dmitriy Perov\u2019s feeble final challenge and to the line! 13 mins: Scotland manage to convert a Russia scrum into one of their own, deep in Russian territory, right in front of the posts. 9 mins: There was hardly any kicking done by either team in the first five minutes, but hardly anything else in the last few. 7 mins: Darcy Graham runs down the left wing but the ball is pushed out of his grasp as the tackle comes in, bounces forwards and Russia take it. 4 mins: For all Russia\u2019s possession they were only moving backwards, and eventually they kick and Scotland grab it. Now it\u2019s blue shirts pushing. 3 mins: A strong start from Russia, who have kept hold of the ball through 14 phases so far. 2 min: One change to the published team sheets: the referee, Mathieu Raynal of France, is unwell so England\u2019s Wayne Barnes, who was due to assist, has replaced him. 1 min: They\u2019re off! Russia get the game started. Right then. Preamble complete. Time for action. The anthems are sung. The local kid standing with Gordon Reid in mascot\u2019s uniform does a game job of singing along with Flower of Scotland. The teams are on their way out! Behind them, the fans in the posh seats clap half-interestedly, but on TV it certainly sounds like there\u2019s a lot of noise in the stadium. TV cameras have just brought us the latest scenes from inside the dressing rooms. I can tell you they don\u2019t look like this any more. Not long ago, however, they were probably the tidiest dressing rooms I have ever seen. Gregor Townsend has a chat: Since the draw was made we\u2019ve always had an eye on what selection we were going to make for this game, and players have known that their opportunity would come if they haven\u2019t been involved in the first two games. The majority of this team played against Georgia a few weeks ago and played really well. We\u2019ve got similar opposition tonight and we\u2019re looking for a similar performance. It\u2019s definitely win or bust. A bonus point would help, make our job less difficult than it already is on Sunday, and I believe with this squad we can score four tries. But it might take a long while to break Russia down. We\u2019ve just got to be relentless with our effort but also be patient with how we play. Due to nobody telling me, I can\u2019t tell you who won the toss. I can tell you that it has happened. The early game has finished, with Argentina winning 47-17 in what was their fourth and final game of the pool stage. They become the second team to complete their four pool fixtures and the first to end their World Cup campaign. Here\u2019s some pre-match reading, courtesy of Andy Bull in Japan: Argentina are currently romping to victory against the USA, with a little over 10 minutes to play. Lee Calvert has the latest: Hello world! A few days ago there was talk that this game might have to be abandoned because of Typhoon Hagibis, though Gordon Reid insisted the Scots would happily play through it \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re from Scotland. Rain. Hail. It doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019ve coped with a lot more.\u201d Today, though, the forecast is for sunny skies and no more than a gentle breeze.

      "bodyText": "The easy bit is done, the hard part is still to come. Scotland thrashed Russia 61-0 and got the bonus point they badly needed. It was their biggest win since they beat Japan, funnily enough, by 92 points back in 2004. They are due to play the Brave Blossoms in Yokohama this Sunday, and they need to beat them again if they are going to make it through to the quarter-finals. They will have to do it handsomely, because if Japan pick up a bonus point for losing by seven points or fewer, Scotland will need to get one for scoring four tries or more. It could get more complicated. Ireland play Samoa on Saturday, and there is a chance that all three teams could finish tied on 15 points each. If that happens top spot would all come down to points difference, with the runner-up then decided by head-to-head between second and third. The permutations are already messy, then, and that\u2019s before super Typhoon Hagibis sweeps in. It is forecast to hit the Tokyo area sometime this weekend.

It was accompanied by a comment saying: \u201cAngela Merkel\u2019s demand that Britain leaves Northern Ireland to rot inside the customs union is reprehensible and shows the true colours of our supposed \u2018European allies\u2019.\u201d The furore came after a No 10 source said Merkel\u2019s demands for Northern Ireland after Brexit had made a deal \u201cessentially impossible\u201d, leading to accusations that Boris Johnson was trying to play a \u201cstupid blame game\u201d. In the Commons on Tuesday, the Independent Group for Change MP Chris Leslie criticised the \u201cdeliberate dog-whistle briefing\u201d and warned of its consequences. \u201cIt has sparked a series of frankly racist attacks against the Germans, from Leave.EU and others,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an extremely dangerous course for the government to embark on, and I want to hear \u2013 right now \u2013 the minister condemn and distance himself from it.\u201d Michael Gove, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, dissociated himself from \u201cany sort of racist or demeaning language towards Germany\u201d and said he had reaffirmed the UK\u2019s commitment to friendship at a German day of national unity event at the country\u2019s embassy last week. \u201cThe Germans are our friends and our allies, and Germany is a great country,\u201d he told MPs, after politicians from across the spectrum had earlier criticised the image. The Labour MP David Lammy tweeted: \u201cDear Germany and the EU, please accept our apologies and do not be fooled into thinking Leave.EU\u2019s xenophobic bile is representative of the UK. A clear majority of Brits now oppose Brexit in all its forms. A vast, young and vibrant pro-EU movement in Britain stands with you.\u201d The Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesperson, Tom Brake, said the advert was \u201cinsulting and offensive\u201d. \u201cLanguage such as this is stoking divisions within our society and should not be considered acceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cEU citizens are our neighbours, friends and family. This demonstrates the depths that Leave.EU will go to as they try and tear our country apart.\u201d Banks tweeted an apology on Wednesday morning, saying: \u201cThe Leave.EU team went too far yesterday but the real outrage is the German suggestion that Northern Ireland be separated from the UK. As a result we will delete the post and apologise accordingly \u2026 on reflection the point could have been made better.\u201d Leave.EU retweeted the post as it said: \u201cWe\u2019re sorry.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Bristol Rovers, or indeed any League One club, are scarcely mentioned in the same breath as Premier League or Champions League winners but sandwiched between Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Sadio Man\u00e9 in the nation\u2019s goalscoring charts, Jonson Clarke-Harris is in good company. Only Ag\u00fcero, Teemu Pukki and James Collins of Luton have more league goals than the 19 he has registered this calendar year. Since joining Rovers on deadline day in January from Coventry, where he started his career as a 15-year-old, no player in the country\u2019s top four tiers has scored more league goals.</p> <p>Ten years ago Clarke-Harris, raised by his mother in Kirby Frith on the outskirts of Leicester, was a rugged centre-back playing for Beaumont Town and Judgemeadow. But Coventry, six months after overlooking his credentials as a defender, were quick to pounce midway through a six-week trial when, playing up front, Clarke-Harris lit up an under-17s match at Derby. After the game, the then Coventry academy manager, Gregor Rioch, who now holds the same post at Wigan, was giving Clarke-Harris a lift to the train station when the striker received a call from Leicester inquiring regarding his availability.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/08/barnsley-sack-manager-daniel-stendel\">Barnsley sack manager Daniel Stendel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI was due to head off home straight down the A50 but I ended up going off in the opposite direction,\u201d Rioch explains. \u201cI drove him home and on the way there I rang our head of recruitment and said: \u2018Meet me at Jonson\u2019s house, we\u2019re going to sign the forms there.\u2019 I drove an hour south, met our head of recruitment in his kitchen, signed all the paperwork and did the two-and-a-half-hour journey home.\u201d</p> <p>It was a fittingly roundabout journey for the now 25-year-old, who finally appears to have settled at his ninth club in a nomadic career including two spells at Coventry and loans at MK Dons, Doncaster and Southend, where he first worked under Graham Coughlan, now his manager at Bristol Rovers.</p> <p>Coughlan spotted the striker playing in a reserves match for Peterborough following his release from Coventry at 18. \u201cIt didn\u2019t quite happen \u2013 maybe it was too soon, maybe he was too young \u2013 but the talent was there,\u201d says Coughlan, who has tapped into that ability since making Clarke-Harris his first signing nine months ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0c4a4420e3e20468fb63f616799ef709c3b61d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0c4a4420e3e20468fb63f616799ef709c3b61d1/0_281_4300_2581/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clarke-Harris pounces to round off a hat-trick against Blackpool in March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonson Clarke-Harris pounces to round off a hat-trick against Blackpool in March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dougie Allward/JMP/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clarke-Harris, who remains Coventry\u2019s youngest ever player having faced Morecambe aged 16 and 21 days, failed to fulfil his talent at the club but his former youth coaches do not have a bad word to say about him. Of his debut, Rioch says: \u201cI\u2019ve spoke with him and he felt that happened too quickly, because he was still getting used to a changing-room environment, he hadn\u2019t had an academy or a team upbringing.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s got this perception but he\u2019s got a heart of gold, a real soft spot about him \u2013 he won\u2019t be pleased with me saying that because he will want centre-backs to be frightened to death of him \u2013 and he\u2019s matured into a fantastic young man.\u201d</p> <p>Richard Stevens, his former academy coach, says: \u201cHe was a handful \u2013 in a nice way. He\u2019s been in teams, he\u2019s been out of teams, he\u2019s had to ride lots of challenges but he\u2019s come out of the other end of it.\u201d The Coventry first-team coach Jason Farndon, who worked with Clarke-Harris in the academy, emphasises the folly of judging a book by its cover. \u201cThe warpaint of the tattoos and the gold teeth are a bit of a mask,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the first thing you see, but he\u2019s a good kid.

      "bodyText": "Bristol Rovers, or indeed any League One club, are scarcely mentioned in the same breath as Premier League or Champions League winners but sandwiched between Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Sadio Man\u00e9 in the nation\u2019s goalscoring charts, Jonson Clarke-Harris is in good company. Only Ag\u00fcero, Teemu Pukki and James Collins of Luton have more league goals than the 19 he has registered this calendar year. Since joining Rovers on deadline day in January from Coventry, where he started his career as a 15-year-old, no player in the country\u2019s top four tiers has scored more league goals. Ten years ago Clarke-Harris, raised by his mother in Kirby Frith on the outskirts of Leicester, was a rugged centre-back playing for Beaumont Town and Judgemeadow. But Coventry, six months after overlooking his credentials as a defender, were quick to pounce midway through a six-week trial when, playing up front, Clarke-Harris lit up an under-17s match at Derby. After the game, the then Coventry academy manager, Gregor Rioch, who now holds the same post at Wigan, was giving Clarke-Harris a lift to the train station when the striker received a call from Leicester inquiring regarding his availability. \u201cI was due to head off home straight down the A50 but I ended up going off in the opposite direction,\u201d Rioch explains. \u201cI drove him home and on the way there I rang our head of recruitment and said: \u2018Meet me at Jonson\u2019s house, we\u2019re going to sign the forms there.\u2019 I drove an hour south, met our head of recruitment in his kitchen, signed all the paperwork and did the two-and-a-half-hour journey home.\u201d It was a fittingly roundabout journey for the now 25-year-old, who finally appears to have settled at his ninth club in a nomadic career including two spells at Coventry and loans at MK Dons, Doncaster and Southend, where he first worked under Graham Coughlan, now his manager at Bristol Rovers. Coughlan spotted the striker playing in a reserves match for Peterborough following his release from Coventry at 18. \u201cIt didn\u2019t quite happen \u2013 maybe it was too soon, maybe he was too young \u2013 but the talent was there,\u201d says Coughlan, who has tapped into that ability since making Clarke-Harris his first signing nine months ago. Clarke-Harris, who remains Coventry\u2019s youngest ever player having faced Morecambe aged 16 and 21 days, failed to fulfil his talent at the club but his former youth coaches do not have a bad word to say about him. Of his debut, Rioch says: \u201cI\u2019ve spoke with him and he felt that happened too quickly, because he was still getting used to a changing-room environment, he hadn\u2019t had an academy or a team upbringing. \u201cHe\u2019s got this perception but he\u2019s got a heart of gold, a real soft spot about him \u2013 he won\u2019t be pleased with me saying that because he will want centre-backs to be frightened to death of him \u2013 and he\u2019s matured into a fantastic young man.\u201d Richard Stevens, his former academy coach, says: \u201cHe was a handful \u2013 in a nice way. He\u2019s been in teams, he\u2019s been out of teams, he\u2019s had to ride lots of challenges but he\u2019s come out of the other end of it.\u201d The Coventry first-team coach Jason Farndon, who worked with Clarke-Harris in the academy, emphasises the folly of judging a book by its cover. \u201cThe warpaint of the tattoos and the gold teeth are a bit of a mask,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the first thing you see, but he\u2019s a good kid. He came into the academy and professional football when he was 16, which in this day and age is very late.\u201d Clarke-Harris is relishing his status as Rovers\u2019 talisman but it was at Oldham under the now-Bristol City manager Lee Johnson, who signed the striker for around \u00a34,000, where he made his first dent in the Football League before a \u00a3350,000 move to the Championship with Rotherham a season later. Clarke-Harris is the latest in a long line of forwards to thrive in blue-and-white quarters, including Matty Taylor, Billy Bodin, Ellis Harrison and Rickie Lambert. Coughlan believes a mutual trust has allowed the striker to flourish. \u201cI find players move around willy-nilly, they chop and change too quickly, but Jonno has found a home here and people that have his best interests at heart,\u201d he says. \u201cI just think he\u2019s in a really good place mentally, a great place physically and professionally. I hope he\u2019s settled, he\u2019s enjoying it and he wants to have longevity with both myself and Bristol Rovers.\u201d The manager is the first to get a consistent tune out of Clarke-Harris but the Dubliner has no intention of letting the striker rest on his laurels. \u201cTwo or three weeks ago I didn\u2019t think he was at it so I told him he wasn\u2019t getting any days off,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen the rest of the lads were off that week, Jonno had to put up with me.

There\u2019s also a unicorn tattoo, on Al-Kadhi\u2019s chest, the rump of which they used to rub, for comfort and luck.</p> <p>And then, of course, there was drag. \u201cWhenever I\u2019ve had violence against me, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/18/transphobically-abused-bus-passengers-did-nothing\" title=\"\">or something really upsetting has happened</a>, the first thing I think is: I need to be in drag, and on stage tonight,\u201d Al-Kadhi says.</p> <p>Getting ready is a kind of meditation. \u201cI\u2019m talking the meticulous drawing of the brow. Trying to get every line right. I love it. So peaceful.\u201d We have finally found somewhere to talk, settling with a coffee in a theatre cafe, and their fingers are tracing careful arches above each eye as they speak. \u201cGluing eyebrows, putting on foundation. It\u2019s the transportation.

I felt like I was lying. I was trying to live out things that I didn\u2019t actually believe about myself. Everyone was looking to me as this voice of liberation. And I just wasn\u2019t that ... Whenever the drag came off, I would have a nervous breakdown.\u201d </p> <p>Al-Kadhi, who performs as Glamrou, says they experienced their \u201cfirst set of breakdowns\u201d around this time. But they still scored the highest first in their year, so some portion of life must have remained intact; or, perhaps, the devastation was medicated with an obsession with work.</p> <p>Even now, Al-Kadhi works six days a week, 9am to 9pm. Unicorn was written in six weeks of solid 10-hour days. \u201cAs soon as I stop working, I feel quite a lot of sorrow,\u201d they say, toying nervously with the toggle of their hoodie. \u201cIf I take a day or two off, I can\u2019t stop crying. The amount of work it takes for a queer person to do well in life is exhausting!\u201d</p> <p>As a young man, whenever Al-Kadhi was caught by their parents watching gay TV shows or films or referring to their homosexuality in texts to friends, their parents would confront<strong> </strong>them. \u201cMy dad actually said to me: \u2018You don\u2019t have to keep talking to us about this gay stuff. Talk to us about the weather if you have to. Just don\u2019t bring that up.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Yet despite this conflict, love runs through this book. Al-Kadhi\u2019s mother, they say, \u201csays I\u2019m the greatest love of her life\u201d. She says that still? Even while Al-Kadhi celebrates their queer identity in drag performances?</p> <p>\u201cShe does say that. But she always caveats it: \u2018You\u2019re the greatest love of my life \u2013 and the person who\u2019s ruined my life.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Writing the book was partly an attempt to understand this relationship. \u201cA lot of women in the Middle East tend to be the voicepiece of the patriarchy because of the domestic role that they occupy,\u201d Al-Kadhi says.</p> <p>Their mother is presented as someone who will go to any lengths for the right look. She once deployed the services of a welder to effect a last-minute repair to a dress. All this might make a person appear ridiculous. \u201cBut I got it \u2013 \u2019cos me too! Clothes mean a lot to me,\u201d Al-Kadhi says. The two recently bonded over their mother\u2019s quest for a tropical-themed hat. \u201cI\u2019m the daughter she never had.\u201d</p> <p>So it is not surprising that, as Glamrou, their favourite outfits are \u201cthe ones that remind me of my mum \u2026 There\u2019s this emerald, snakeskin-type dress. Whenever I wear it, everyone says: \u2018You look like your mum!\u2019 I love wearing that. I also love wearing Islamic abayas.\u201d</p> <p>Their early drag aped white stars such as Lady Gaga and Lana Del Rey, and in this sense clothing once caused a fissure not just between Al-Kadhi and their mother, but between Al-Kadhi and their cultural heritage and even race. Now, however, costume is helping them to narrow the gaps. \u201cI like that feeling of <a href=\"https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/xwe45k/unicorn-amrou-al-kadhi-extract\" title=\"\">inserting myself in my heritage through being queer,</a>\u201d they say.</p> <p>Religion too is no longer something to be feared. Al-Kadhi uses the pronoun \u201cthey\u201d for Allah. \u201cThe way that I conceptualise Allah is that they\u2019ve gone from being a source of self-punishment to being a source of self-love.\u201d</p> <p>Al-Kadhi has even left their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/15/denim-world-tour-review-soho-theatre\" title=\"\">old drag group, Denim</a>, to pursue solo performance in a show called Glamrou: From Quran to Queen, because \u201call the other Denims are white \u2026 Whenever I tried to explore race within the show it would have to be quite a cursory five minutes.\u201d Striking out on their own has given Al-Kadhi a platform from which to address race \u2013 last week they <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/uk/naga-munchetty-bbc-breakfast-donald-trump-racism-drag-queen-amrou-al-kadhi-643270\" title=\"\">praised Naga Munchetty live on the BBC for speaking out against racism</a>. </p> <p>The memoir acts as a sort of guidebook to this wholesale reassertion of a cohesive identity, culminating in the moment when Al-Kadhi explains that they regard their biological mother as a sort of long-lost drag mother. Have they ever told her this?</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I have actually said that once. And she just said: \u2018Why would you want to be a woman?\u2019 Oddly enough, her position as a woman and my position as a queer person in society brings us really close despite the huge gulf of things we can\u2019t talk about.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ddd3f6008b36700a2a436ed0b1b8da25526135ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddd3f6008b36700a2a436ed0b1b8da25526135ab/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amrou Al-Khadi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018For me, the one thing that really helps is putting it out there and having it resonate with people.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ramy, Al-Kadhi\u2019s twin brother, is the only family member to have watched Al-Kadhi perform. \u201cHe\u2019s very proud of me. I think he\u2019s more in awe, to be honest \u2013 of how different my life has turned out to everyone I am related to,\u201d Al-Kadhi says.</p> <p>But Ramy has not seen the book; neither have Al-Kadhi\u2019s parents. \u201cThankfully, they are not stocking it in Dubai any time soon,\u201d Al-Kadhi says. When they told their mother about the memoir, she said: \u201c\u2018Is there anything I\u2019m not going to like?\u2019 And I said: \u2018Well, you don\u2019t like the fact that I do drag, you don\u2019t like the fact that I\u2019m gay, you don\u2019t like the fact that I wear pink socks. So you are not going to like most of this book \u2026 I don\u2019t know if I will have a relationship with them after this.\u201d</p> <p>So why do it?</p> <p>\u201cI have had all kinds of therapy, meds, everything,\u201d Al-Kadhi says. \u201cFor me, the one thing that really helps is putting it out there and having it resonate with people \u2026 I said to my mum: \u2018It\u2019s my only coping mechanism.\u2019 It stops me from doing something quite dangerous to myself. I didn\u2019t have a choice. I had to write it.\u201d They are pulling at the top of their hoodie again \u2013 nervously, I assume. But Al-Kadhi smiles and says what they are really doing is touching the rump of the unicorn beneath.</p> <p><em>Unicorn: The Memoir of a Muslim Drag Queen is published by HarperCollins.

There\u2019s also a unicorn tattoo, on Al-Kadhi\u2019s chest, the rump of which they used to rub, for comfort and luck. And then, of course, there was drag. \u201cWhenever I\u2019ve had violence against me, or something really upsetting has happened, the first thing I think is: I need to be in drag, and on stage tonight,\u201d Al-Kadhi says. Getting ready is a kind of meditation. \u201cI\u2019m talking the meticulous drawing of the brow. Trying to get every line right. I love it. So peaceful.\u201d We have finally found somewhere to talk, settling with a coffee in a theatre cafe, and their fingers are tracing careful arches above each eye as they speak. \u201cGluing eyebrows, putting on foundation. It\u2019s the transportation. Very mindful.\u201d It was at Cambridge University that Al-Kadhi discovered drag, organising events and becoming a \u201cdrag mother\u201d to their fellow queens in the university\u2019s first professional drag band. \u201cWhen I started doing drag, it felt like the ultimate rejection of everything I was taught in the Middle East.\u201d But the variance between the joy of performance and the repercussions from disapproving family in Dubai only heightened the sense of being at odds with themselves. It wasn\u2019t liberating? \u201cIt wasn\u2019t! I felt like I was lying. I was trying to live out things that I didn\u2019t actually believe about myself. Everyone was looking to me as this voice of liberation. And I just wasn\u2019t that ... Whenever the drag came off, I would have a nervous breakdown.\u201d Al-Kadhi, who performs as Glamrou, says they experienced their \u201cfirst set of breakdowns\u201d around this time. But they still scored the highest first in their year, so some portion of life must have remained intact; or, perhaps, the devastation was medicated with an obsession with work. Even now, Al-Kadhi works six days a week, 9am to 9pm. Unicorn was written in six weeks of solid 10-hour days. \u201cAs soon as I stop working, I feel quite a lot of sorrow,\u201d they say, toying nervously with the toggle of their hoodie. \u201cIf I take a day or two off, I can\u2019t stop crying. The amount of work it takes for a queer person to do well in life is exhausting!\u201d As a young man, whenever Al-Kadhi was caught by their parents watching gay TV shows or films or referring to their homosexuality in texts to friends, their parents would confront them. \u201cMy dad actually said to me: \u2018You don\u2019t have to keep talking to us about this gay stuff. Talk to us about the weather if you have to. Just don\u2019t bring that up.\u2019\u201d Yet despite this conflict, love runs through this book. Al-Kadhi\u2019s mother, they say, \u201csays I\u2019m the greatest love of her life\u201d. She says that still? Even while Al-Kadhi celebrates their queer identity in drag performances? \u201cShe does say that. But she always caveats it: \u2018You\u2019re the greatest love of my life \u2013 and the person who\u2019s ruined my life.\u2019\u201d Writing the book was partly an attempt to understand this relationship. \u201cA lot of women in the Middle East tend to be the voicepiece of the patriarchy because of the domestic role that they occupy,\u201d Al-Kadhi says. Their mother is presented as someone who will go to any lengths for the right look. She once deployed the services of a welder to effect a last-minute repair to a dress. All this might make a person appear ridiculous. \u201cBut I got it \u2013 \u2019cos me too! Clothes mean a lot to me,\u201d Al-Kadhi says. The two recently bonded over their mother\u2019s quest for a tropical-themed hat. \u201cI\u2019m the daughter she never had.\u201d So it is not surprising that, as Glamrou, their favourite outfits are \u201cthe ones that remind me of my mum \u2026 There\u2019s this emerald, snakeskin-type dress. Whenever I wear it, everyone says: \u2018You look like your mum!\u2019 I love wearing that. I also love wearing Islamic abayas.\u201d Their early drag aped white stars such as Lady Gaga and Lana Del Rey, and in this sense clothing once caused a fissure not just between Al-Kadhi and their mother, but between Al-Kadhi and their cultural heritage and even race. Now, however, costume is helping them to narrow the gaps. \u201cI like that feeling of inserting myself in my heritage through being queer,\u201d they say. Religion too is no longer something to be feared. Al-Kadhi uses the pronoun \u201cthey\u201d for Allah. \u201cThe way that I conceptualise Allah is that they\u2019ve gone from being a source of self-punishment to being a source of self-love.\u201d Al-Kadhi has even left their old drag group, Denim, to pursue solo performance in a show called Glamrou: From Quran to Queen, because \u201call the other Denims are white \u2026 Whenever I tried to explore race within the show it would have to be quite a cursory five minutes.\u201d Striking out on their own has given Al-Kadhi a platform from which to address race \u2013 last week they praised Naga Munchetty live on the BBC for speaking out against racism. The memoir acts as a sort of guidebook to this wholesale reassertion of a cohesive identity, culminating in the moment when Al-Kadhi explains that they regard their biological mother as a sort of long-lost drag mother. Have they ever told her this? \u201cYeah, I have actually said that once. And she just said: \u2018Why would you want to be a woman?\u2019 Oddly enough, her position as a woman and my position as a queer person in society brings us really close despite the huge gulf of things we can\u2019t talk about.\u201d Ramy, Al-Kadhi\u2019s twin brother, is the only family member to have watched Al-Kadhi perform. \u201cHe\u2019s very proud of me. I think he\u2019s more in awe, to be honest \u2013 of how different my life has turned out to everyone I am related to,\u201d Al-Kadhi says. But Ramy has not seen the book; neither have Al-Kadhi\u2019s parents. \u201cThankfully, they are not stocking it in Dubai any time soon,\u201d Al-Kadhi says. When they told their mother about the memoir, she said: \u201c\u2018Is there anything I\u2019m not going to like?\u2019 And I said: \u2018Well, you don\u2019t like the fact that I do drag, you don\u2019t like the fact that I\u2019m gay, you don\u2019t like the fact that I wear pink socks. So you are not going to like most of this book \u2026 I don\u2019t know if I will have a relationship with them after this.\u201d So why do it? \u201cI have had all kinds of therapy, meds, everything,\u201d Al-Kadhi says. \u201cFor me, the one thing that really helps is putting it out there and having it resonate with people \u2026 I said to my mum: \u2018It\u2019s my only coping mechanism.\u2019 It stops me from doing something quite dangerous to myself. I didn\u2019t have a choice. I had to write it.\u201d They are pulling at the top of their hoodie again \u2013 nervously, I assume. But Al-Kadhi smiles and says what they are really doing is touching the rump of the unicorn beneath. Unicorn: The Memoir of a Muslim Drag Queen is published by HarperCollins.

      "bodyText": "MPs are heading for a Brexit showdown as they will be called to sit for a special parliamentary session on Saturday 19 October \u2013 less than two weeks before Britain\u2019s scheduled departure from the EU. The sitting will happen two days after the EU summit and, with Boris Johnson\u2019s attempts to strike a Brexit deal all but dead, is likely to be a decisive moment in determining the country\u2019s future. Cabinet ministers are privately concerned at suggestions the prime minister may try to circumvent the Benn act \u2013 passed into law last month \u2013 which is aimed at forcing him to request a Brexit delay if he fails to reach a deal. According to the House of Commons website, Parliament has sat only four times on Saturdays in the past 80 years \u2014 including the day before the outbreak of the second world war, the Suez crisis in 1956 and for the invasion of the Falklands in 1982. Johnson has always insisted the country will leave the EU on 31 October but No 10 also says the prime minister will comply with the law. His hopes of securing a breakthrough in crunch Brexit talks were dealt another blow when the Irish finance minister said his government did not want any customs checks in Ireland. Paschal Donohoe denied his government was trying to trap Northern Ireland into a closer relationship with the EU and separate it from the UK by trying to prevent customs or tariff checks. Johnson is to meet the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, on Thursday and try to persuade him to agree to plans which the British government argues need to include some form of Irish border checks, with a potential no-deal Brexit just weeks away. Asked whether his government held the position that there could not be any customs checks in Ireland, Donohoe told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cFirstly in terms of the charge that the Irish government is trying to trap anybody in any kind of arrangement, that is absolutely not the case. \u201cWe, of course, utterly respect the decision that the British people have made to leave the European Union, as a country that has much experience of referenda ourselves. \u201cThe so-called backstop was always an insurance policy but, equally, yes, you are correct to say that we do not want to see the return of customs checks and tariffs on our island.\u201d Asked to clarify whether he meant he did not want customs checks anywhere, he replied: \u201cWell, I would say on Ireland. The reason for that goes beyond economics, it goes beyond trade. It goes back to the kind of experience my country and I have gone through in my own lifetime where I have seen those kind of things and the erosion of the all-Ireland economy becoming a catalyst for the kind of political challenges on our island and in Ireland that I don\u2019t want to return.\u201d Pressed on what the point of Varadkar\u2019s meeting with Johnson was, given the Irish position, he replied: \u201cBecause the stakes are so high that constructive engagement is the only choice, because the stakes of what this could mean not only for shared history between both countries that are so precious but for a shared future which we want to see continue in the future while we take our different journeys with respect to Europe. \u201cIt means, even with the short time that is left, of course the Irish government, of course the taoiseach, of course myself, we want to engage.\u201d Asked to confirm whether the Irish would accept customs checks if they were enforced by the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit, he replied: \u201cWell, what we have indicated is that if we are in a no-deal setting, we\u2019ll have to put in place some kind of arrangements to ensure that we can give confidence to, for example, French shoppers that Irish lamb that is leaving Ireland is Irish lamb.\u201d Asked to clarify whether some form of \u201carrangements\u201d in effect meant a customs check, he said: \u201cWell, we have to engage and we\u2019re working with the European commission on what those things could be that will give confidence regarding the future of our economy.\u201d",

Last December the influential manufacturers\u2019 association BGMEA made it clear that owners would close factories if the minimum wage increased further.

The streets, turned muddy by the rain, are lined with corner shops, barbers and vegetable sellers.

She does have amenities such as a fan and a fridge. She joined the union after it helped her when she was about to be fired for being pregnant, she says. Now she has lost her job. Begum believes it is primarily because she is a union member. But she doesn\u2019t seem too fazed. One thing that has changed is her self-assurance, the pride in her abilities: \u201cI am not worried.

It\u2019s a public holiday in Bangladesh, the one time of year the 25-year-old can leave the mayhem of the city behind and see her family: her mother, her aunt. And her daughter. \u201cThere she is!\u201d Her little girl is standing in front of the two-bedroom tin hut in a remote village 200km (125 miles) north of Chittagong, south-east Bangladesh. Mother and daughter embrace. If she could, the young seamstress would still live here. The air is fresher, there is more space, and some of her friends still live in the village. There\u2019s just one problem: \u201cThere isn\u2019t any work.\u201d Agriculture has ceased to be a feasible source of income. Money doesn\u2019t grow on trees \u2013 it is spun in the textile looms of the city. And so this family copes as best it can, the older women raising the child while Tasnia works six-day weeks, sewing T-shirts and jeans for global consumers, for about 8,400 taka (\u00a380) a month. These three generations are a neat microcosm of an entire nation. The older women, who grew up in the years after independence in 1971, worked in unpaid labour, trying to survive in the grinding poverty for which the country became renowned in the 1970s. The young girl, a 21st-century child, schooled and spirited, will in all probability enjoy better prospects. And in the middle, Tasnia Akter, from the \u201cfactory generation\u201d, one of approximately 4.5 million textile workers who have transformed the fortunes and reputation of Bangladesh. The crucial question is this: is Akter a glorious paragon of the \u201crise and rise\u201d of Bangladesh, with its 50-year journey to becoming a middle-income nation powered by hard-working women? Or is she a sickening example of an exploited labourer who ruins her health for companies making high margins and consumers who buy cheap jeans? The answer: perhaps a bit of both. \u201cSure, Tasnia suffers a lot, she has to support her family \u2013 but I had to suffer much more,\u201d says her aunt, Honufa Begum.

But I don\u2019t want to be a slave. I don\u2019t want to always be on my toes, waiting for orders. At least when I come home in the evening from the factory, I am done for the day.\u201d Changed fortunes When the history is written of how much of humanity was lifted out of poverty in the decades after 1980, Bangladesh will provide one of the biggest chapters. GDP has soared vertiginously since 1980. The number of people living below the poverty line has fallen from more than 44% in 1991 to less than 13%. Numbers for neonatal and maternal mortality have dwindled. Family sizes have fallen. People now live on average one-third longer than they used to 40 years ago \u2013 a gain in longevity that is practically without rival anywhere in the world. But it has not come without tragedy, toil and exploitation. Six years ago, the Rana Plaza factory collapsed in Dhaka, killing more than 1,100 people, injuring more than 2,300.

A general manager of the company where Tasnia Akter works says the new rules of business are simple: \u201cNo compliance, no contracts.\u201d \u201cIf you compare pre-Rana Plaza and post-Rana Plaza, the one thing that really has changed is safety,\u201d says Kalpona Akter (no relation to Tasnia), a labour activist and executive director of the Bangladesh Centre for Worker Solidarity (BCWS). Between 2005 and 2012, more than 500 workers died in textile factories. After 2014, the annual number of fatalities has remained \u201cwell under 30\u201d, according to the Stern Centre for Business and Human Rights at New York University . \u201cWorkers are now more aware of their rights,\u201d says Kalpona Akter. When she founded BCWS in 2000, few workers knew they had any rights at all. \u201cNow workers perhaps won\u2019t die in the factory \u2013 but they will nevertheless slowly die of malnourishment,\u201d Hasan Maruf Rumi says. The activist and politician explains how it is impossible to feed a family on the new minimum wage of 8,000 taka. While the minimum wage has indeed been doubled, it is still only half of what the unions had suggested \u2013 and far from a living wage. A study by CPD found that the overall cost of living for garment workers had increased by 86% between 2013 and 2018, with food costs up 57%. Last December the influential manufacturers\u2019 association BGMEA made it clear that owners would close factories if the minimum wage increased further. It called on brands to increase their prices as a result. Nothing happened. When asked how much she thinks she deserves, Tasnia Akter says: 10,000 taka, around \u00a396. In Chittagong, many workers live near the factories. The streets, turned muddy by the rain, are lined with corner shops, barbers and vegetable sellers. Nadira Begum, a 26-year-old sewing operator, shares a room with her three-year-old daughter in a compound with other families. Her husband shows up from time to time; he has another wife as well. \u201cAs soon as there is a raise, everything gets more expensive,\u201d she says. She already pays around 3,000 taka per month for the room. While Begum earns about nine times as much as her mother, she is unsure whether her purchasing power has gone up much. She does have amenities such as a fan and a fridge. She joined the union after it helped her when she was about to be fired for being pregnant, she says. Now she has lost her job. Begum believes it is primarily because she is a union member. But she doesn\u2019t seem too fazed. One thing that has changed is her self-assurance, the pride in her abilities: \u201cI am not worried. I am a skilled worker; I will just go and get another job.\u201d \u2022 Tasnia Akter\u2019s name has been changed This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

The eight-page missive came after the Trump administration abruptly blocked a key witness in the Ukraine scandal from appearing before the congressional impeachment inquiry and sets up a clash between the White House and Congress \u2013 the executive and legislative branches \u2013 in the weeks ahead. The letter appeared to put the emphasis on political rebuttal rather than structured legal argument \u2013 perhaps marking a new strategy to counter the impeachment threat with stalling and counter-attacking. Trump aides have begun honing their approach after two weeks of what some allies have described as a listless and unfocused response to the inquiry. The inquiry was launched by the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, last month after it emerged that, in a July phone call, Trump had pressed the leader of Ukraine to investigate a political rival, Joe Biden. The president and his allies have sought to question the inquiry\u2019s legitimacy. In particular, the White House objects that the House did not formally vote to begin the impeachment inquiry, breaking with precedent set in the inquiries into Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. Pelosi has insisted the House is well within its rules to conduct oversight of the executive branch under the constitution regardless of a vote. The administration is also sharply critical of the conduct of House intelligence committee chairman, Adam Schiff, whose committee is leading the inquiry, and it appears determined to stonewall Democrats for as long as possible. In its most aggressive response yet, Cipollone wrote in the letter, released in the late afternoon on Tuesday: \u201cYour unprecedented actions have left the president with no choice. In order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.\u201d Cipollone\u2019s letter threatens to end cooperation with Congress on important oversight matters, accusing members of formulating their investigation \u201cin a manner that violates fundamental fairness and constitutionally mandated due process\u201d. It adds: \u201cTo comply with the Constitution\u2019s demands, appropriate procedures would include \u2013 at a minimum \u2013 the right to see all evidence, to present evidence, to call witnesses, to have counsel present at all hearings, to cross-examine all witnesses, to make objections relating to the examination of witnesses or the admissibility of testimony and evidence, and to respond to evidence and testimony.\u201d In a statement responding to the letter, Pelosi said: \u201cThe White House letter is only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy, and to insist that the President is above the law.

      "body": "<p>In 1991, less than a year after Tory MPs deposed her as party leader and prime minister, Margaret Thatcher appeared on the platform at the Conservatives\u2019 annual conference with her successor, John Major. Thatcher was not scheduled to speak, Charles Moore explains, but the Tory hierarchy realised that her standing with the party membership meant that a brief appearance couldn\u2019t be avoided. Yet the event did not go according to plan. For six minutes, the audience cheered, applauded, stamped, and chanted, \u201cWe want Maggie!\u201d Her parliamentary assassins looked on miserably.</p> <p>It\u2019s a great moment in a book full of them. But arguably it\u2019s also a moment the Conservatives have been stuck in ever since. With their ever escalating hostility to the EU, their stubborn faith in free-market capitalism, their unease with urban and northern Britain and their yearning for a mighty leader, the Tories are still the party Thatcher largely created during her epic leadership from 1975 to 1990. Moore\u2019s monumental official biography \u2013 three volumes, almost 3,000 pages, the books published at regular intervals since her death in 2013 \u2013 has played a significant part in maintaining Thatcherism\u2019s hold over the party. All three books are measured in tone and have their critical passages but Moore is, at bottom, a believer. Near the end of this concluding volume, when he finally lets his hair down, he calls her \u201cthe greatest genius ever to direct the affairs of the United Kingdom\u201d.</p> <p>Yet for non-believers this volume ought to be the most palatable, since it covers her declining years in government, from 1987 to 1990, and her often melancholy 23 years afterwards. It also appears with both conservatism and capitalism seemingly in crisis: even the Financial Times has started using the slogan \u201cCapitalism: Time for a Reset\u201d. Unlike Thatcher\u2019s previous biographers, Moore has the chance to judge her against the troubled, unsustainable world she helped create.</p> <p>He begins with a beautifully balanced section on the ambiguousness of her position in 1987. On the one hand, she had just won her third successive general election, and by a landslide; on the other, her ascendancy had lasted so long, by the impatient standards of British politics, that even close colleagues were tiring of her. Previously more flexible than her Iron Lady persona suggested \u2013 her first two terms as premier had been full of well-timed U-turns \u2013 during her third term Thatcher really did become rigid. She remained an adherent of the contentious economic doctrine of monetarism, despite its huge social costs and erratic benefits, while her chancellor, the clever, competitive Nigel Lawson, had moved on in his policy thinking.</p> <p>Similarly, during the late 80s, Thatcher became steadily more convinced that European integration was a project Britain should resist, almost regardless of how that resistance affected relations with our closest neighbours. Her foreign secretary Geoffrey Howe \u2013 once an ally, now increasingly alienated \u2013 disagreed. The two senior ministers began to plot against her, more aggressively, Moore suggests, than they were prepared to admit in their memoirs. Meanwhile, the Tory hierarchy and parliamentary party, which had never completely accepted that they should be led by a radical woman, watched closely for any sign that Thatcher\u2019s performance or popularity was deteriorating.</p> <p>In 1989, around the tenth anniversary of her election as prime minister, the polls turned decisively against her and the Conservatives. Voters had tired of her abrasive, imperial style, and the damage her iconoclastic policies had done to the fabric of Britain. Meanwhile, like most ageing governments, hers had become \u201caccident-prone\u201d, as Moore pithily puts it, beset by increasingly visible splits, scandals and administrative errors. In 1990 Thatcher\u2019s many internal enemies finally moved to unseat her.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Moore builds a Westminster drama that is compelling and emotionally raw des\u00adpite the fact that many readers will know the key scenes already</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Moore conveys brilliantly the sense of the walls closing in: first slowly and erratically, with regular apparent reprieves for Thatcher, and then very fast. As her official biographer, and a famous journalist and rightwinger, he has had access to more verbal and written sources than probably any other historian of Thatcherism, and he uses them to build a Westminster drama that is compelling and emotionally raw despite the fact that many readers will know the key scenes already. Some parts have a novelistic quality rarely found in the careful pages of political biographies.</p> <p>Early on the morning of her last day in office, for example, her hairdresser Paul Allen realised that he had forgotten to bring a comb to 10 Downing Street. None of the staff there had one, and Thatcher was too distraught for him to ask her. So he decided to look for one surreptitiously in her official apartment. \u201cThe flat was, as usual, open,\u201d Moore writes. \u201cHe crept upstairs and knocked softly on every door lest the prime minister should be behind it. She was not. Allen extracted the comb and fled downstairs.\u201d</p> <p>Unfortunately for the book\u2019s rhythm, the chapters covering the causes and details of her downfall are interrupted by a huge section about her foreign policy achievements. To an extent, this digression is probably unavoidable: abroad, Thatcher\u2019s power and status peaked later than they did at home. Her telegenic persona, her sheer longevity as a leader, the spread of Thatcherite free-market policies around the world, and the end of the cold war \u2013 Moore suggests her rapport with the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev played a key part \u2013 all gave her an almost impregnable international reputation by the end of the 80s. Moore even tries to burnish it further, by arguing that she was a pioneering voice against climate change, and an underestimated contributor to the ending of apartheid.</p> <p>The former chapter is more convincing than the latter. While Moore provides plenty of evidence that she helped the African National Congress (ANC) behind the scenes, he does not properly consider whether her public condemnation of the ANC as \u201ca typical terrorist organisation\u201d in 1987, or her loud opposition to the international campaign of sanctions against South Africa, helped prolong the apartheid government\u2019s hold on power. Revealingly, according to Moore her \u201cterrorist\u201d speech against the ANC came after the organisation had warned it might attack British businesses in South Africa, in protest at her sanctions stance. For Thatcher, the interests of business nearly always came first.</p> <p>This was not just ideological. A scientist by training, she \u201cwas instinctively happier with matters that could be quantified\u201d, Moore writes \u2013 with the seemingly hard data of profit rather than with the fuzzier outlines of social trends. This is a crucial point about Thatcherism. She was often incurious about, or actively hostile to, the huge changes afoot in social values in late 20th century Britain, regarding sexuality, race and non-economic personal freedoms. So her social policies lost their attractiveness to many voters long before her free-market ones did.</p> <p>Yet having highlighted her fogeyishness, Moore \u2013 perhaps because he is a bit of a fogey himself \u2013 does not explore its implications. For all the awesome scale and thoroughness of his trilogy, over 20 years in the researching and writing, the shifting social texture of Britain under Thatcher is largely missing. Without it, the books fall short of being definitive. Thatcher fell, and the still-Thatcherite Tory party has struggled since, not just because of political plots and personalities \u2013 grippingly portrayed here though they are \u2013 but because Thatcherism gradually stopped offering dreams and solutions to ordinary Britons.</p> <p>Another disappointment is this volume\u2019s treatment of her life after Downing Street. Almost a quarter of a century is wrapped up in fewer than 120 pages, and with few revelations. <em>Herself Alone</em> is a sad, suggestive title, but the book\u2019s intention is signalled more accurately by its cover: a flatteringly unlined and commanding portrait of Thatcher taken in 1991, before her decline really set in, by the celebrity photographer of dominant women Helmut Newton. Thatcherism, the book implies, remains as full of potential as ever. Moore criticises her governing tone as insensitive and divisive, but not the substance of what her governments did. A comparison of the Britain she promised and the country we have actually lived in since is not something this book dares to offer.</p> <p>Instead, we get a few concluding insights into Thatcher as a person. They are all sharp, and often make her seem more sympathetic. Perhaps the best of all is this: \u201cMrs Thatcher combined an immense assurance about following her own way with a permanent uneasiness in life.\u201d She created an uneasy country for the rest of us to live in.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Margaret Thatcher: Volume Three is published by Allen Lane (\u00a335).

      "bodyText": "In 1991, less than a year after Tory MPs deposed her as party leader and prime minister, Margaret Thatcher appeared on the platform at the Conservatives\u2019 annual conference with her successor, John Major. Thatcher was not scheduled to speak, Charles Moore explains, but the Tory hierarchy realised that her standing with the party membership meant that a brief appearance couldn\u2019t be avoided. Yet the event did not go according to plan. For six minutes, the audience cheered, applauded, stamped, and chanted, \u201cWe want Maggie!\u201d Her parliamentary assassins looked on miserably. It\u2019s a great moment in a book full of them. But arguably it\u2019s also a moment the Conservatives have been stuck in ever since. With their ever escalating hostility to the EU, their stubborn faith in free-market capitalism, their unease with urban and northern Britain and their yearning for a mighty leader, the Tories are still the party Thatcher largely created during her epic leadership from 1975 to 1990. Moore\u2019s monumental official biography \u2013 three volumes, almost 3,000 pages, the books published at regular intervals since her death in 2013 \u2013 has played a significant part in maintaining Thatcherism\u2019s hold over the party.

      "bodyText": "The biggest, most expensive new smartphone from Apple is the iPhone 11 Pro Max, and you\u2019ll need a small fortune to buy it. The new 6.5in iPhone 11 Pro Max costs from \u00a31,149 and is in effect its smaller 5.8in iPhone 11 Pro sibling put in a photocopier with a 12% magnification applied. It has the exact same aluminium and glass design, the same notched screen with Face ID, the same camera arrangement on the back and the same Lightning port in the bottom. It is the same phone. Except that enlarging everything (apart from thickness) by 10%-12% creates a very different experience. Like the iPhone XS Max it replaces, the iPhone 11 Pro Max is really difficult to use with one hand. At 77.8mm it is hand-stretchingly wide, wider still than the already massive OnePlus 7 Pro (75.9mm) and even the positively gigantic Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ (75.9mm), and at 226g it is heavier than competitors by a full 20g. But more than that, the rounded stainless steel sides provide no grip at all, meaning your fingers simply slip off them when you stretch across to reach the other side of the screen or the top left corner, which you frequently need to do in iOS. It\u2019s a combination that either results in hand pain or wallet pain, as it slips out of your fingers and plummets on to the unforgiving floor below. You then stick it in a case, which makes it even bigger. If there was ever a phone to benefit from a grip accessory of some kind, this is it. So unless you have giant hands, the iPhone 11 Pro Max is exclusively a two-handed phone. But I\u2019d argue that there are always times when you need to use a phone one-handed: public transport, carrying a bag, taking a selfie and so on. The 6.5in Super Retina XDR \u201cPro level\u201d OLED screen is just as wonderful as the one on the smaller iPhone 11 Pro, although it isn\u2019t a massive leap over that fitted to significantly cheaper rivals such as the OnePlus 7 Pro. Flip it over and the frosted, almost metallic-like glass and square camera lump with three lenses poking out is new. Specifications Screen: 6.5in Super Retina XDR (OLED) (458ppi) Processor: Apple A13 Bionic RAM: 4GB of RAM Storage: 64GB, 256GB or 512GB Operating system: iOS 13 Camera: Triple 12MP rear cameras with OIS, 12MP front-facing camera Connectivity: LTE, wifi 6, NFC, Bluetooth 5, Lightning, Ultra Wideband and GPS Dimensions: 158 x 77.8 x 8.1 mm Weight: 226g A13 Bionic The iPhone 11 Pro Max has the same A13 Bionic chip, 4GB of RAM and at least 64GB of storage as the rest of the iPhone 11 line, and performs similarly. Everything happens promptly, including intensive tasks such as video editing and gaming, and it should be a top performer for years to come. The use of Lightning over the newer, more adaptable and useful USB-C is disappointing, as is the 64GB of starting storage. If you want to use your massive phone screen to watch video or play games, or you shoot any number of photos or 4K videos, you\u2019re going to fill that up in no time. Apple says it has managed to make the iPhone 11 Pro last five hours longer between charges than the iPhone XS Max, which managed 27 hours in my testing. The iPhone 11 Pro Max beats that estimate by some margin, lasting just minutes shy of a full 48 hours between charges. That means the phone lasts from 7am on day one until about 6.50am on day three, propelling the iPhone 11 Pro Max into the two-day battery club previously only populated by a variety of Huawei\u2019s top phones. That was after the iOS 13.1.2 update, while using it as my primary device without a smartwatch attached, sending and receiving 100 emails and messages, 80 push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day. The iPhone 11 Pro Max ships with an 18W USB-C fast charger and a USB-C to Lightning cable in the box. A full charge from flat took two hours 20 minutes, but hit 50% in 31 minutes and 70% in 46 minutes, slowing charging to a trickle above 95%. The phone also gets pretty hot when fast charging. It can wirelessly charge too, but can\u2019t charge other devices. It\u2019s also worth noting that iOS 13 includes a battery optimisation feature, which is designed to learn your habits and only charge the battery past 80% when it thinks you need it to extend its longevity. iOS 13.1.2 The iPhone 11 Pro shipped with iOS 13 but was quickly updated three times to iOS 13.1.2, following the same issues suffered with the iPhone 11. Dark mode, swipe typing on the Apple keyboard, improved quick setting access and menstrual cycle tracking are all new highlights of iOS 13. The iPhone 11 Pro Max also has a few additions for the large screen such as a split-screen view in Mail, Calendar, Messages and others that aren\u2019t present on the smaller iPhone 11 Pro. It also supports a few tricks to help with one-handed use such as bringing the top of the screen down or moving the keyboard to one of the sides, which itself is difficult to do with your right hand as the button to activate it is in the bottom left corner of the screen. It\u2019s the back gesture, which is a swipe in from the left edge of the screen, that\u2019s a killer for a right-handed user. Trying to do that with one hand is equal parts frustration and dread. Apple leads the industry in software updates, providing at least five years of support from release, where other manufacturers cap out at about three years, and has recently shown a surprising ability to rapidly push out bug fix updates in quick succession. Camera The iPhone 11 Pro Max has Apple\u2019s new triple 12-megapixel camera setup \u2013 the same as the smaller iPhone 11 Pro. The combination of ultrawide, wide and telephoto cameras gives you the ability to shoot at 0.5x, 1x or 2x optical zoom, then up to 10x digital zoom. Overall, it\u2019s a massive step up on previous iPhone cameras, and better still than the cheaper iPhone 11. Apple\u2019s new night mode brings it up to par with the best rivals on very low-light photography, while the new deep fusion technology rolling out with iOS 13.2 is getting closer than ever to the clarity of fine detail of an SLR with a large lens. The photos used for this review were all shot on an iPhone 11 Pro running iOS 13.2 beta. After lagging the ultra-competitive camera competition for some time, Apple is firmly up with the best with the iPhone 11 Pro line. Observations The iPhone 11 Pro Max is water resistant to IP68 standards of up to 4m for 30 minutes \u2013 which is 2m deeper last year\u2019s iPhone XS Max Bluetooth performance is much improved, with stronger connections to even the weakest of headphones Face ID is still best-in-class, now slightly faster and working at slightly wider angles The new U1 chip enables enhanced location abilities, but so far it\u2019s only used for directional AirDrop file sharing The highly polished stainless steel is easy to mark and dull in even careful general use The pressure sensitive screen of previous iPhones is gone and with it 3D Touch, so you can\u2019t press harder on things any more Price The iPhone 11 Pro Max costs \u00a31,149 for 64GB of storage, \u00a31,299 for 256GB or \u00a31,499 for 512GB in black, green, silver or gold. For comparison, the iPhone 11 Pro costs \u00a31,049, the iPhone 11 costs \u00a3729 and the iPhone XR costs \u00a3629. The OnePlus 7 costs \u00a3499, the Samsung Galaxy S10 costs \u00a3799 and the Huawei P30 Pro costs \u00a3799. Verdict There\u2019s an excellent super-sized smartphone within Apple\u2019s grasp, but unfortunately the iPhone 11 Pro Max isn\u2019t it. A design that works at the much smaller size of the 5.8in iPhone 11 Pro simply doesn\u2019t at the gargantuan 6.5in iPhone 11 Pro Max, meaning Apple\u2019s biggest phone suffers from terrible ergonomics. I get that uniformity is Apple\u2019s schtick, but in this case it actively makes the product worse. Of all the massive phones I\u2019ve used across the years, the heavy, slippery iPhone 11 Pro Max and iPhone XS Max before it are the only ones to give me serious hand pain. It\u2019s literally a crying shame, because everything else about it \u2013 from the camera, the screen and the performance \u2013 is great. When it comes down to it, only the genuinely epic Huawei-level battery life salvages the iPhone 11 Pro Max from being a three-star product, and even then this is a four-star phone that is extremely expensive. There are certainly better, easier-to-use big-screen smartphones available that cost significantly less than the jaw-dropping \u00a31,149 and up Apple wants for the iPhone 11 Pro Max. But if you must have an iPhone and the wonderful 5.8in iPhone 11 Pro doesn\u2019t quite cut it, do yourself a favour and save \u00a3420 and buy the 6.1in iPhone 11. Only those that genuinely need two-day battery life should buy the iPhone 11 Pro Max, and even then I wouldn\u2019t. Pros: brilliant camera, night mode, water resistant, wireless charging, Face ID, good battery life, good performance, brilliant screen, long software support Cons: hard to hold, heavy, super expensive, no headphone socket, no fingerprint scanner, no headphones adapter in the box, low starting storage Other reviews Best smartphone 2019: iPhone, OnePlus, Samsung and Huawei compared and ranked Samsung Galaxy S10+ review: a simply stunning screen Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ review: bigger and now with a magic wand OnePlus 7 Pro review: an absolute beast in every way Huawei P30 Pro review: game-changing camera, stellar battery life Fairphone 3 review: the most ethical and repairable phone you can buy",

      "body": "<p>At family gatherings I am the de facto tech whisperer \u2013 a role bestowed on me by my father, who, bewildered by live streaming and electronic sports, summons me for guidance. For the last decade I have worked as a video game reporter, giving me unprecedented access to this growing industry, which has gone from a hobby conceived in the internet cafes of South Korea to a professional sport rivalling football.</p> \n<p>Until this summer, the huge rise in popularity of video games \u2013 played <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/sep/08/how-did-twitch-become-as-big-as-youtube-by-live-streaming-video-game-players\" title=\"\">competitively and watched by millions</a> on streaming websites such as Twitch, or seen live with thousands of others at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/30/fortnite-world-cup-esports\" title=\"\">Colosseum-like sporting arenas</a> \u2013 had bypassed many people over the age of 35. But few could escape the headlines about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/jul/28/british-boy-jaden-ashman-wolfiez-becomes-fortnite-millionaire-in-world-cup-tournament\" title=\"\">Fortnite World Cup</a> and its $3m (\u00a32.4m) winner. There were 100 finalists in the tournament in New York, many between 12 and 16 years old, whittled down from a total of about 40 million \u2013 yes, that\u2019s correct \u2013 who attempted to qualify. They battled it out for a total prize pot of $30m \u2013 the largest ever for such an event.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The number of young people participating is truly staggering. Fortnite: Battle Royale has more than 250 million players</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>These games are known collectively as esports, and the number of young people playing them is truly staggering. Fortnite: Battle Royale has more than <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-many-people-play-fortnite-2018-11?r=US&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">250 million players</a>, making it one of the most popular video games in the world, alongside the virtual football game Fifa. </p> \n<p> In addition to the players, 30% of internet users now watch live streams of people playing video games, according to the research firm GlobalWebIndex. This equates to a global audience of just over 1 billion people. And by next year, tech consultancy firm Activate suggests that<a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/ActivateInc/think-again-tech-media-outlook-2017-67604099\" title=\"\">70 million people</a> are expected watch a single esports final \u2013 higher than the total for US professional baseball, soccer and hockey finals. Not surprisingly, more than half of those watching esports tournaments are between 16 and 34. Just 10% are between 45 and 54, while over-55s make up a mere 6%.</p> \n<p>To many in an older generation, the rise of esports rings alarm bells. Reports of children spending an unhealthy amount of time and money on games have become commonplace. Even Prince Harry offered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/jun/19/mps-in-a-spin-as-games-chief-appears-to-deny-fortnite-makes-money\" title=\"\">rare public criticism</a> earlier this year. \u201cThat game [Fornite] shouldn\u2019t be allowed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s created to addict, an addiction to keep you in front of a computer for as long as possible. It\u2019s so irresponsible.\u201d</p> \n<p>And there are many stories of parents trying to curb their children\u2019s \u201cdangerous\u201d gaming habit. In an interview after his success at Fortnite, the Essex teenager Jaden Ashman, who split a prize of $2.25m with his partner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/jul/28/british-boy-jaden-ashman-wolfiez-becomes-fortnite-millionaire-in-world-cup-tournament\" title=\"\">recalled how</a> the game affected his relationship with his mother, who admitted snapping her 15-year-old son\u2019s headphones and throwing away his Xbox.</p> \n<p>Of course there will be some children and young people for whom long hours spent playing computer games does cause mental health problems.

For the last decade I have worked as a video game reporter, giving me unprecedented access to this growing industry, which has gone from a hobby conceived in the internet cafes of South Korea to a professional sport rivalling football. Until this summer, the huge rise in popularity of video games \u2013 played competitively and watched by millions on streaming websites such as Twitch, or seen live with thousands of others at Colosseum-like sporting arenas \u2013 had bypassed many people over the age of 35. But few could escape the headlines about the Fortnite World Cup and its $3m (\u00a32.4m) winner. There were 100 finalists in the tournament in New York, many between 12 and 16 years old, whittled down from a total of about 40 million \u2013 yes, that\u2019s correct \u2013 who attempted to qualify. They battled it out for a total prize pot of $30m \u2013 the largest ever for such an event. These games are known collectively as esports, and the number of young people playing them is truly staggering. Fortnite: Battle Royale has more than 250 million players, making it one of the most popular video games in the world, alongside the virtual football game Fifa. In addition to the players, 30% of internet users now watch live streams of people playing video games, according to the research firm GlobalWebIndex. This equates to a global audience of just over 1 billion people. And by next year, tech consultancy firm Activate suggests that70 million people are expected watch a single esports final \u2013 higher than the total for US professional baseball, soccer and hockey finals. Not surprisingly, more than half of those watching esports tournaments are between 16 and 34. Just 10% are between 45 and 54, while over-55s make up a mere 6%. To many in an older generation, the rise of esports rings alarm bells. Reports of children spending an unhealthy amount of time and money on games have become commonplace. Even Prince Harry offered rare public criticism earlier this year. \u201cThat game [Fornite] shouldn\u2019t be allowed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s created to addict, an addiction to keep you in front of a computer for as long as possible. It\u2019s so irresponsible.\u201d And there are many stories of parents trying to curb their children\u2019s \u201cdangerous\u201d gaming habit. In an interview after his success at Fortnite, the Essex teenager Jaden Ashman, who split a prize of $2.25m with his partner, recalled how the game affected his relationship with his mother, who admitted snapping her 15-year-old son\u2019s headphones and throwing away his Xbox. Of course there will be some children and young people for whom long hours spent playing computer games does cause mental health problems. The World Health Organization last year recognised \u201cgaming disorder\u201d as a medical condition, and the NHS is planning to open the UK\u2019s first specialist clinic to treat addicts of computer games. Yet while fears around the rise of esports abound, in bedrooms and internet cafes around the world games such as League of Legends, Dota 2 and Fortnite have become a cultural phenomenon, bringing young people from different regions and religions together and bridging divides. Slang, inside jokes and dance moves flow out of them as if they were a proto-society.

The increase in badgers\u2019 range came despite the animals being less likely to leave their setts overall in the aftermath of a cull, making them less visible to the marksmen carrying out the culls.</p> <p>The study, published in the Journal of Applied Ecology, covered 67 badgers on 20 cattle farms in areas of Cornwall both with and without culling, from 2013 to 2017.</p> <p>Lord Krebs, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/11/badger-culling-ineffective-krebs\">landmark review of the science </a>of bovine TB in the 1990s resulted in a 10-year trial of culls, said: \u201cThis research shows how important it is to find out about badger behaviour. It shows that culling badgers can cause surviving individuals in an area to move around more, and as a result they could come into contact with infected cattle and help to spread TB. The ill-thought-out plan to control TB by killing badgers could therefore backfire.\u201d</p> <p>The National Farmers\u2019 Union said the ZSL study was small and covered only one county, and that it was \u201cvital\u201d the cull should continue to be rolled out across the country.</p> <p>Stuart Roberts, the vice president of the NFU, said: \u201cCulling badgers has a proven impact on TB outbreaks among cattle \u2013 the aim must be to get rid of this awful disease. Previously published peer-reviewed research, and anecdotal evidence from farmers in these areas, indicates strongly that TB is being reduced as a result of controlling the wildlife which carry and spread the disease.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cWe do not see similar convincing outcomes from vaccination. Vaccination may have a role to play in areas where TB hasn\u2019t taken hold but it cannot cure a sick badger so, in areas where TB is endemic, culling is vital.\u201d</p> <p>Nearly 33,000 cattle were slaughtered in England last year because of bovine TB, and 3,600 farms were newly affected by the disease, according to the NFU.</p> <p>Bovine TB is the greatest threat to animal health in the UK, according to Defra. A spokesperson said the culling policy already took into account the potential increase in badger movement, by intensively culling across a given area, and that research showed it was effective. \u201cBovine TB [costs] taxpayers over \u00a3100m a year and causes devastation and distress for farmers and rural communities,\u201d they said. \u201cThere is no single measure that will provide an easy answer and we are pursuing a range of interventions to eradicate it by 2038, including tighter cattle movement controls, regular testing and vaccinations.\u201d</p> <p>Defra\u2019s research has found a 58% reduction of bovine TB in the area culled in Gloucestershire, compared with unculled areas, while there was a reduction of a fifth in Somerset, after two years.</p> <p>TB bacteria can remain viable over long periods in the environment, meaning that if infected badgers are roaming further after a cull, as ZSL found, this could create new sources of infection for months afterwards. The changes in behaviour were noted by the researchers as soon as the cull started in a given population, meaning even badgers that are subsequently killed in the cull could have spread the disease much further than if they had remained undisturbed.</p> <p>Arthur Thomas, the campaigns manager at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said: \u201cThis report raises serious concerns about the effectiveness of the badger cull policy. We believe that the evidence against the culling of badgers as a response to bovine TB is well established and overwhelming. Government must act quickly to put a stop to an ineffective and inhumane practice.\u201d</p>",

A spokesperson said the culling policy already took into account the potential increase in badger movement, by intensively culling across a given area, and that research showed it was effective. \u201cBovine TB [costs] taxpayers over \u00a3100m a year and causes devastation and distress for farmers and rural communities,\u201d they said. \u201cThere is no single measure that will provide an easy answer and we are pursuing a range of interventions to eradicate it by 2038, including tighter cattle movement controls, regular testing and vaccinations.\u201d Defra\u2019s research has found a 58% reduction of bovine TB in the area culled in Gloucestershire, compared with unculled areas, while there was a reduction of a fifth in Somerset, after two years. TB bacteria can remain viable over long periods in the environment, meaning that if infected badgers are roaming further after a cull, as ZSL found, this could create new sources of infection for months afterwards. The changes in behaviour were noted by the researchers as soon as the cull started in a given population, meaning even badgers that are subsequently killed in the cull could have spread the disease much further than if they had remained undisturbed. Arthur Thomas, the campaigns manager at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said: \u201cThis report raises serious concerns about the effectiveness of the badger cull policy. We believe that the evidence against the culling of badgers as a response to bovine TB is well established and overwhelming. Government must act quickly to put a stop to an ineffective and inhumane practice.\u201d",

Unicef\u2019s new Cryptocurrency Fund is the latest in a series of efforts by aid organisations to experiment with \u201cblockchain\u201d currencies, which have the potential to transform charitable giving and increase financial transparency. Cryptocurrencies are virtual currencies that can be cashed in for real money, and are not linked to any single country or central authority. Instead, a ledger of transactions is maintained by a decentralised network of computers. This system of decentralisation offers non-profit organisations the advantage of bypassing expensive fees and middlemen traditionally required to move large amounts of cash overseas quickly. But the virtual currencies have also been divisive.

Christopher Fabian, principal adviser at Unicef Innovation, said the initiative would prepare the organisation for the future while also maintaining safeguards built into existing donor systems. \u201cWe see this as a piece of learning that we need to go through to prepare for the next decade,\u201d he said.

Interest from philanthropic organisations in virtual currencies has seen the creation of AidCoin and Pinkcoin, tailored for the aid sector. Unicef joins a number of aid agencies that have started accepting donations in virtual coins, including the American Red Cross and the UN World Food Programme. Rhodri Davies, head of policy at the Charities Aid Foundation, said that the initial excitement about currencies using blockchain technology in the aid sector had delivered smaller windfalls than had been hoped. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot slower than people might have expected two or three years ago,\u201d he said. He said successes of the cryptocurrency donation model were largely limited to internet-based charities \u2013 to organisations such as Wikimedia or the Electronic Frontier Foundation. In 2019, Fidelity Charitable, a charity that distributes money through donor-advised funds in the US, reported receiving donations of $106m (\u00a387m) in virtual money since 2015 \u2013 though volatility in the currencies may have affected the value of the donations. The new Unicef fund will hold donations and disburse them in the same cryptocurrency \u2013 initiatives funded through it will sign contracts denominated in the same type of virtual coinage. Fabian said to reduce risks caused by the currencies\u2019 volatility, most of the initial projects funded in this way would be short-term. He said the organisation would also uphold existing donor protocols \u2013 so those making donations online would have to pass rigorous checks before they were allowed to deposit funds to Unicef.",

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s a cartoon hanging in the Queens Museum in New York \u2013 a drawing of a man with a shovel, digging through piles of paper. The papers symbolize government corruption, but they wind up in the dump. The caption explains: \u201cSenate investigating committee digs up huge mass of evidence which passes before startled eyes of indignant but apathetic public, and then slides into obscurity, making room for next investigation.\u201d From Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns to the Ukraine scandal and the impeachment inquiry, this has never felt more relevant. But the cartoon is from the 1940s, by the New York cartoonist Rube Goldberg, and it\u2019s on view as part of The Art of Rube Goldberg, a survey which opened this weekend and runs until 9 February. The pioneering 20th-century artist created more than 50,000 cartoons in a career that spanned seven decades. This is the first retrospective in 49 years to look at Goldberg\u2019s work. It also highlights his overlooked career as a Pulitzer prize-winning political satirist. \u201cPolitical cartoons were not his main output, but some of his work remains so relevant,\u201d said the museum\u2019s assistant curator, Sophia Marisa Lucas. \u201cHe was seeking to find humor in some things, as a clever opportunity for relief.\u201d A traveling exhibition organized by Art &amp; Artists the retrospective features Goldberg\u2019s views on society in the 1930s and 1940s, skewering Adolf Hitler, commenting on the inflation of the US dollar and addressing the dire effects of war. Goldberg wasn\u2019t primarily a satirist but made a significant impact with his political cartoons. He received a Pulitzer prize in 1948 for a drawing called Peace Today, showing an atomic bomb teetering towards the brink of destruction. Goldberg was born in San Francisco in 1883, moved to New York City in 1907 and got a job at the Evening Mail in 1908 with a cartoon series called Foolish Questions. It was based on the premise: \u201cAsk a stupid question, get a stupid answer.\u201d In one cartoon, a woman asks her husband, who just came in from the rain: \u201cWhy, dearie, did you get wet?\u201d He answers: \u201cOf course not \u2013 the rain is dry today.\u201d The series was so popular, readers started mailing in their own foolish questions for Goldberg to answer in the series, which ended up in a book and merchandise such as a deck of cards. \u201cThe exhibition follows progression of his hand,\u201d said Lucas. From the cartoons he did at the beginning of his career, it segues into his social commentary. \u201cGoldberg commented primarily on human nature.\u201d Throughout the 1910s, Goldberg was a standup comedian in New York, toured with a troupe of comics for a vaudeville show and used slapstick in his cartoons. A new section in this particular exhibition is devoted to vaudeville \u2013 one of his biggest influences. \u201cWhat we did differently here, for this exhibition, was pull out another section on the influence of vaudeville on his work,\u201d said Lucas. \u201cIt\u2019s history that felt buried but had a significant influence.\u201d As Goldberg\u2019s cartoons became syndicated by national newspapers in 1922, he started to earn $200,000 a year and reached an audience of millions. From 1914 to 1964, he ran a series called The Inventions of Professor Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts. Before becoming a cartoonist, Goldberg studied engineering, and here put his knowledge to work.

He showed an American taxpayer getting bonked on the head and compared vote counting to a carnival game. \u201cWhen all clerks are unconscious, the election is over,\u201d Goldberg wrote. One cartoon from the 1940s, called The Numbers Blues, shows a man standing sheepishly under rows of numbers hovering above his head \u2013 from his phone number to social security and bank account \u2013 imagining himself as a jailbird. \u201cPolitical cartoons were easier for me than the inventions because they were almost pure idea and the draftsmanship was relatively simple,\u201d Goldberg once said, \u201cI could do two political cartoons a day, but an invention sometimes required a week.\u201d His creative process might have been easier, but the world around him became complicated.

      "body": "<p>Do Americans still have a government? I do not know. What I do know is that President Trump and the upper echelons of the executive branch are at war with the legislative branch, the rule of law, the constitution, federal civil servants and the American people. It\u2019s a conflict that pulls in many directions, and if the president <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-trump-facing-impeachment-warns-of-civil-war\">threatened civil war </a>the other day as something that could happen if he doesn\u2019t get his way, we can regard the ordinary state of things as a low-intensity civil war or a slo-mo coup that\u2019s been going on from the beginning. Tuesday\u2019s White House refusal to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry only escalates their defiance and their chaos.</p> <p>The chaos takes so many forms. Innumerable stories have made it clear that even the president\u2019s own aides and cabinet members treat him like a captive bear or a person having a psychotic breakdown \u2013 like someone unstable who must be kept from harming himself and others. They have done that by heaping on the flattery, and by warping and limiting the information he receives, and often by doing their best to prevent his directives from being realized.</p> <p>The New York Times recently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/01/us/politics/trump-border-wars.html\">reported</a> on a March meeting about the border. According to aides, Trump \u201csuggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down\u201d. When he was told that wasn\u2019t allowed, he ordered that the border be closed. That set off a \u201cfrenzied week of presidential rages, round-the-clock staff panic and far more White House turmoil than was known at the time. By the end of the week, the seat-of-the-pants president had backed off his threat but had retaliated with the beginning of a purge of the aides who had tried to contain him.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Passivity and disengagement got us here; political engagement will get us out</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is the kind of story we\u2019ve become used to \u2013 outrages and viciousness and inanity and all \u2013 but it\u2019s worth reading another way, as a story about a bear lashing out at whatever\u2019s around him and gobbling up the scraps they feed him while he is still chained to the wall. When we refer to the \u201cpresident\u201d we really mean whatever ad hoc group of people with proximity is manipulating him, lying to him, or preventing him from knowing or doing something. They sometimes prevent harm or illegality. But this is only half of the administrative \u201cteam.\u201d The other half consists of those serving his personal agenda, and in this respect the federal government has become a subsidiary of Trump Incorporated.</p> <p>William Barr is supposed to be this nation\u2019s attorney general, whose job the Judiciary Act of 1789 defined as \u201cto give his advice and opinion upon questions of law when required by the president of the United States.\u201d But Barr has been bouncing all over the globe pushing the president\u2019s self-serving conspiracy theories and smears of rival candidates, a stunning violation of his role.</p> <p>Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, took an oath to \u201csupport and defend the constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic\u201d and has since become one of those enemies in service of others. He was on the July phone call in which Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Trump\u2019s potential 2020 rival Joe Biden and discredit the story of the Russian intervention in the 2016 election. The leverage for this request seems to have been the hundreds of millions of dollars of foreign aid \u2013 taxpayer dollars \u2013 withheld by President Trump at the time.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/2019/oct/01/mike-pompeo-trump-impeachment-inquiry-democrats-ukraine\">Guardian reported</a> a few days ago that Pompeo \u201cdismissed summonses from Democratic committee chairmen in the <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/house-of-representatives\">House of Representatives</a> for five current and former state department officials to testify on the president\u2019s attempts to push Ukraine to dig up dirt on his leading political rival.\u201d And Tuesday, Pompeo\u2019s State Department blocked former ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, who\u2019s implicated in the Ukrainian shakedown, from testifying to Congress, a clear and open obstruction of justice.</p> <p>The phrase \u201cparty over country\u201d has been used to describe Republicans for years, but at this point it\u2019s more or less puppet over country, because the loyalty is to Trump\u2019s corrupt, delusional, floundering endeavors to keep himself in power and out of trouble with the law. Trump\u2019s own loyalties are to himself, his profits, and his next political campaign\u2014and perhaps to Vladimir Putin, before whom he grovels regularly, and whose agenda he has served even with this undermining of our relationship with Ukraine and the search for evidence to exonerate Russia in the 2016 election.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/07/trump-tax-returns-subpoena-new-york-federal-judge\">Judge rejects Trump's 'repugnant' immunity claim in tax-return ruling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another unsurprising detail emerged in a recent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/world/europe/ukraine-mueller-manafort-missiles.html\">New York Times story</a>: \u201cIn Ukraine, where officials are wary of offending President Trump, four meandering cases that involve Mr Manafort, Mr Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, have been effectively frozen by Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor. The cases are just too sensitive for a government deeply reliant on United States financial and military aid, and keenly aware of Mr Trump\u2019s distaste for\u201d special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation \u201cinto possible collusion between Russia and his campaign.\u201d</p> <p>So at the top there\u2019s corruption. But down below there\u2019s dismantling and disarray. The Trump administration\u2019s has a habit of firing or sidelining federal employees whose work is politically inconvenient. In 2017, Joel Clement, formerly head of policy analysis at the interior department, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/im-a-scientist-the-trump-administration-reassigned-me-for-speaking-up-about-climate-change/2017/07/19/389b8dce-6b12-11e7-9c15-177740635e83_story.html\">wrote about being taken away</a> from his work on the impact of climate change on Native Alaskans and reassigned to \u201can unrelated job in the accounting office that collects royalty checks from fossil fuel companies.\u201d There are numerous stories like his, of employees doing valuable work told to move across the country to keep their jobs, a maneuver that at best burdens them or renders them ineffectual, but often drives them out of their positions. The country is hemmorhaging people who provide oversight and keep key systems working.</p> <p>The Federal Election Commission normally has six members and needs four to have a quorum; it is currently at three with no sign of a new appointment in sight. \u201cWithout the quorum,\u201d the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/29/us/fec-chairwoman-twitter-memo.html\">reports</a>, \u201cthe FEC can\u2019t investigate complaints, issue opinions, or fine violators.\u201d I didn\u2019t formerly think of myself as a big fan of rule of law, since those laws have always been applied harshly to the most vulnerable and most marginalized and were often written to embed racism, misogyny, and homophobia into law. But we now face something worse: the corruption and decay of rule of law in the service of billionaires and misogynistic white supremacists, a system in which the most powerful gain power and shed accountability.</p> <p>We are entering a period of immense danger in which this self-serving president\u2019s stupidity and ruthlessness could lead to almost anything\u2014and I wrote that sentence before the feckless decision about Syria and Turkey. Congress will have to stand strong against whatever he unleashes. The fact that we may also have to rely on a supreme court with two appointments made by this illegitimate president is also alarming.</p> <p>But we must not lose hope. In addition to the three branches of government, there is an unofficial fourth \u2013 civil society \u2013 which must exert itself. The will of the people is both what is at stake when a government becomes unaccountable and the force that can protect our embattled public interest. Passivity and disengagement got us here; political engagement will get us out.</p> <ul> <li><p>Rebecca Solnit is a columnist for the Guardian US</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Do Americans still have a government? I do not know. What I do know is that President Trump and the upper echelons of the executive branch are at war with the legislative branch, the rule of law, the constitution, federal civil servants and the American people. It\u2019s a conflict that pulls in many directions, and if the president threatened civil war the other day as something that could happen if he doesn\u2019t get his way, we can regard the ordinary state of things as a low-intensity civil war or a slo-mo coup that\u2019s been going on from the beginning. Tuesday\u2019s White House refusal to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry only escalates their defiance and their chaos. The chaos takes so many forms. Innumerable stories have made it clear that even the president\u2019s own aides and cabinet members treat him like a captive bear or a person having a psychotic breakdown \u2013 like someone unstable who must be kept from harming himself and others. They have done that by heaping on the flattery, and by warping and limiting the information he receives, and often by doing their best to prevent his directives from being realized. The New York Times recently reported on a March meeting about the border. According to aides, Trump \u201csuggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down\u201d. When he was told that wasn\u2019t allowed, he ordered that the border be closed. That set off a \u201cfrenzied week of presidential rages, round-the-clock staff panic and far more White House turmoil than was known at the time. By the end of the week, the seat-of-the-pants president had backed off his threat but had retaliated with the beginning of a purge of the aides who had tried to contain him.\u201d This is the kind of story we\u2019ve become used to \u2013 outrages and viciousness and inanity and all \u2013 but it\u2019s worth reading another way, as a story about a bear lashing out at whatever\u2019s around him and gobbling up the scraps they feed him while he is still chained to the wall. When we refer to the \u201cpresident\u201d we really mean whatever ad hoc group of people with proximity is manipulating him, lying to him, or preventing him from knowing or doing something. They sometimes prevent harm or illegality. But this is only half of the administrative \u201cteam.\u201d The other half consists of those serving his personal agenda, and in this respect the federal government has become a subsidiary of Trump Incorporated. William Barr is supposed to be this nation\u2019s attorney general, whose job the Judiciary Act of 1789 defined as \u201cto give his advice and opinion upon questions of law when required by the president of the United States.\u201d But Barr has been bouncing all over the globe pushing the president\u2019s self-serving conspiracy theories and smears of rival candidates, a stunning violation of his role. Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, took an oath to \u201csupport and defend the constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic\u201d and has since become one of those enemies in service of others. He was on the July phone call in which Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Trump\u2019s potential 2020 rival Joe Biden and discredit the story of the Russian intervention in the 2016 election. The leverage for this request seems to have been the hundreds of millions of dollars of foreign aid \u2013 taxpayer dollars \u2013 withheld by President Trump at the time. The Guardian reported a few days ago that Pompeo \u201cdismissed summonses from Democratic committee chairmen in the House of Representatives for five current and former state department officials to testify on the president\u2019s attempts to push Ukraine to dig up dirt on his leading political rival.\u201d And Tuesday, Pompeo\u2019s State Department blocked former ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, who\u2019s implicated in the Ukrainian shakedown, from testifying to Congress, a clear and open obstruction of justice. The phrase \u201cparty over country\u201d has been used to describe Republicans for years, but at this point it\u2019s more or less puppet over country, because the loyalty is to Trump\u2019s corrupt, delusional, floundering endeavors to keep himself in power and out of trouble with the law. Trump\u2019s own loyalties are to himself, his profits, and his next political campaign\u2014and perhaps to Vladimir Putin, before whom he grovels regularly, and whose agenda he has served even with this undermining of our relationship with Ukraine and the search for evidence to exonerate Russia in the 2016 election. Another unsurprising detail emerged in a recent New York Times story: \u201cIn Ukraine, where officials are wary of offending President Trump, four meandering cases that involve Mr Manafort, Mr Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, have been effectively frozen by Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor. The cases are just too sensitive for a government deeply reliant on United States financial and military aid, and keenly aware of Mr Trump\u2019s distaste for\u201d special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation \u201cinto possible collusion between Russia and his campaign.\u201d So at the top there\u2019s corruption. But down below there\u2019s dismantling and disarray. The Trump administration\u2019s has a habit of firing or sidelining federal employees whose work is politically inconvenient. In 2017, Joel Clement, formerly head of policy analysis at the interior department, wrote about being taken away from his work on the impact of climate change on Native Alaskans and reassigned to \u201can unrelated job in the accounting office that collects royalty checks from fossil fuel companies.\u201d There are numerous stories like his, of employees doing valuable work told to move across the country to keep their jobs, a maneuver that at best burdens them or renders them ineffectual, but often drives them out of their positions. The country is hemmorhaging people who provide oversight and keep key systems working. The Federal Election Commission normally has six members and needs four to have a quorum; it is currently at three with no sign of a new appointment in sight. \u201cWithout the quorum,\u201d the New York Times reports, \u201cthe FEC can\u2019t investigate complaints, issue opinions, or fine violators.\u201d I didn\u2019t formerly think of myself as a big fan of rule of law, since those laws have always been applied harshly to the most vulnerable and most marginalized and were often written to embed racism, misogyny, and homophobia into law. But we now face something worse: the corruption and decay of rule of law in the service of billionaires and misogynistic white supremacists, a system in which the most powerful gain power and shed accountability. We are entering a period of immense danger in which this self-serving president\u2019s stupidity and ruthlessness could lead to almost anything\u2014and I wrote that sentence before the feckless decision about Syria and Turkey. Congress will have to stand strong against whatever he unleashes. The fact that we may also have to rely on a supreme court with two appointments made by this illegitimate president is also alarming. But we must not lose hope. In addition to the three branches of government, there is an unofficial fourth \u2013 civil society \u2013 which must exert itself. The will of the people is both what is at stake when a government becomes unaccountable and the force that can protect our embattled public interest. Passivity and disengagement got us here; political engagement will get us out. Rebecca Solnit is a columnist for the Guardian US",

      "bodyText": "The Australian Christian Lobby has backed calls for religious businesses such as aged care providers to gain more powers of hiring and firing employees who do not conform to religious teachings. In a debate at the National Press Club on Wednesday the ACL director Martyn Iles backed calls from the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference for greater powers to fire employees who don\u2019t conform to a \u201cChristian sexual ethic\u201d but claimed Christians don\u2019t have a \u201cspecial vendetta\u201d against the LGBT community. The intervention comes as the attorney general Christian Porter considers possible amendments to the controversial religious discrimination bill exposure draft before parliament returns next week. Independent senator Jacqui Lambie has declared she sees no case for the bill but Labor has reserved its position, anticipating that the Coalition will need to make further changes to appease conservatives in its party. Porter has said he is seeking \u201can acceptable middle ground\u201d between equality advocates and employers who fear it will license bullying and discrimination on other protected grounds \u2013 such as sex, sexuality, gender diversity, race and disability \u2013 and conservative religious groups which want even greater rights for organised religion. Although hiring and firing of gay teachers and expelling gay students is the subject of a separate reference to the Australian Law Reform Commission, the bill states in section 10 that a religious body \u201cdoes not discriminate against a person under this Act\u201d by conduct which \u201cmay reasonably be regarded\u201d as in line with that religion. Submissions from Equality Australia and a group of discrimination law experts have warned that could open the door to expelling gay students or discriminating against LGBTI people, unmarried or pregnant women by claiming to discriminate based on the person\u2019s religion rather than other protected attributes. At the debate, ambassador of the National Secular Lobby, Fiona Patten, warned the ACL and Catholic church want to \u201cextend the ability to hire and fire\u201d to their commercial businesses which would be \u201cvery dangerous\u201d and \u201cextremely exclusive\u201d to staff and patients of aged care. Iles defended the prospect of hiring and firing based on the \u201cChristian sexual ethic \u2026 that sexual relations are for one man and one woman\u201d to the exclusion of others. Iles rejected the view that \u201cChristians have this special vendetta where it\u2019s the LGBTI community that\u2019s always going to be excluded\u201d. \u201cNothing could be further from the truth,\u201d he said, noting that Christianity teaches that \u201cevery single one of us is a sinner\u201d and he could be sacked for an act of infidelity. \u201cThere should be no surprises. If somebody gets a job \u2026 it should be clear what the beliefs of the organisation are, and it shouldn\u2019t be a shock.\u201d After defending the wholesale expansion of existing powers for several minutes, Iles then noted that section 41 of the bill only exempts religious speech from anti-discrimination laws, suggesting this meant the ability to hire and fire on religious beliefs \u201creally has nothing to do\u201d with the bill. The Australian Industry Group submission to the attorney general department\u2019s consultation warned that the bill bans employers from setting codes of conduct which indirectly discriminate on the grounds of religion and could come into conflict with policies designed to promote tolerance and diversity. It warned the bill could \u201climit the ability for employers to regulate, respond and manage instances of inappropriate conduct by an employee that may cause conflict with, or detriment to, co-workers notwithstanding that such conduct may occur when an employee is not performing work\u201d. \u201cThe potential for the provisions of the proposed legislation to be used to advance and protect extremist opinions or behaviour, of whatever kind, in the name of an undefined religious belief should not be underestimated.\u201d In a statement Porter acknowledged business and LGBTIQ groups\u2019 concerns and noted that some \u2013 but not all \u2013 religious groups had called for \u201ceven more minimal limits on what religious Australians can say\u201d and expanding the definition of religious organisation to grant \u201cthe broad discretion to deal with staff and customers on a faith basis\u201d. \u201cThis bill seeks to balance those views and that balancing process will continue as we consider the submissions in full,\u201d he said. At the Press Club, Patten argued the bill was inconsistent because it protects religious people\u2019s views where they may \u201creasonably be regarded as being in accordance with their religious beliefs\u201d but non-religious views only receive protection for views that \u201carise directly from their lack of religious beliefs\u201d. Patten suggested if there were concerns about what employers controlling what workers said outside the workplace \u2013 as occurred in the instance of rugby player Israel Folau \u2013 the government should inquire into amending the Fair Work Act to protect \u201call employees, not just those with a religious belief\u201d. Iles agreed that a \u201cbroader freedom of speech-type proposal \u2026 would be better\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not out here to say religious people should say things that others are not allowed to say.

The Irish government also hit back, saying it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/08/ireland-hits-back-at-uk-accusations-it-helped-sabotage-brexit-deal\">working \u201cflat out\u201d for a deal</a>.</p> \n<p>Brussels appears resigned to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/08/eu-may-offer-to-extend-deadline-for-brexit-deal-to-summer\">extension of Britain\u2019s membership stretching until next summer</a>, even though Boris Johnson has pledged to crash out of the EU if necessary in order to leave by the end of this month. The situation is moving closer to the Benn Act coming into play \u2013 it obliges Johnson by law to seek an extension of article 50 if he can\u2019t get a deal at next week\u2019s European council meeting. Most at Westminster expect Johnson to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/08/is-a-brexit-deal-impossible-and-what-happens-now\">forced into requesting the extension</a> and to then trigger a general election, which could be held in November or early December. But members of the Tory cabinet are privately concerned about persistent suggestions the PM could try to sidestep the Benn Act in pursuit of a hard Brexit.</p> \n<p>In the House of Commons, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, has accused Johnson of deliberately making proposals he knew Brussels would reject: \u201cIt will be working people who pay the price.\u201d MPs were sent home on Tuesday night as parliament is suspended for a few days before next week\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech, which Johnson will use to set out an election-friendly list of domestic priorities.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Flashpoint on Syria border \u2013 </strong>Turkey\u2019s government has claimed Donald Trump is handing it the leadership of the campaign against Isis and its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/09/turkey-trump-isis-fight-in-syria-offensive-looms\">forces will be crossing into north-eastern Syria \u201cshortly\u201d</a>. After Trump suddenly withdrew American forces, Kurdish troops who have been receiving US support to defeat Islamic State now face fighting alone against Turkey, Isis and Iranian or Russian-backed units backing Syria\u2019s ruler, Bashar al-Assad.

The 105 creamy-brick homes are designed to stringent \u201cPassivhaus\u201d environmental standards, meaning energy costs are around 70% below average. Walls are highly insulated and roofs are angled at 15 degrees so each terrace doesn\u2019t block sunlight from the homes behind.

Oliver Wainwright writes that Goldsmith Street \u201crepresents what has become a rare breed: streets of terraced homes built directly by the council, rented with secure tenancies at fixed social rents. And it\u2019s an architectural marvel, too.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Zantac alert \u2013 </strong>Several versions of the heartburn medicine Zantac are being withdrawn from sale and recalled worldwide by GlaxoSmithKline after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found \u201cunacceptable\u201d levels of a probable cancer-causing impurity called N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). Zantac is also sold generically as ranitidine. Regulators have been recalling some blood pressure and heart failure medicines since last year over similar contamination. Britain\u2019s medicines watchdog said GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/09/zantac-in-global-recall-over-unacceptable-levels-of-potential-carcinogen\">recalling four prescription-only Zantac medicines:</a> a syrup, an injection and tablets of 150mg and 300mg dosages.

But the findings also point to more work being needed to combat racial harassment, violence and hate crime. The survey was conducted by Universities UK two years after its Changing the Culture report set out a framework for improvements in tackling harassment, particularly sexual misconduct.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018Working people will pay the price\u2019 \u2013 Starmer Hello \u2013 I\u2019m Warren Murray, here to walk you through the news at a leisurely gallop. There seems little prospect of a Brexit deal before 31 October after stormy exchanges between the EU and No 10 were fuelled by a series of anonymous briefings from within Downing St portraying European leaders, in particular Ireland\u2019s Leo Varadkar and Angela Merkel of Germany, as making impossible demands. \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game,\u201d wrote Donald Tusk, the European council president. The Irish government also hit back, saying it was working \u201cflat out\u201d for a deal. Brussels appears resigned to an extension of Britain\u2019s membership stretching until next summer, even though Boris Johnson has pledged to crash out of the EU if necessary in order to leave by the end of this month. The situation is moving closer to the Benn Act coming into play \u2013 it obliges Johnson by law to seek an extension of article 50 if he can\u2019t get a deal at next week\u2019s European council meeting. Most at Westminster expect Johnson to be forced into requesting the extension and to then trigger a general election, which could be held in November or early December. But members of the Tory cabinet are privately concerned about persistent suggestions the PM could try to sidestep the Benn Act in pursuit of a hard Brexit. In the House of Commons, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, has accused Johnson of deliberately making proposals he knew Brussels would reject: \u201cIt will be working people who pay the price.\u201d MPs were sent home on Tuesday night as parliament is suspended for a few days before next week\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech, which Johnson will use to set out an election-friendly list of domestic priorities. * * * Flashpoint on Syria border \u2013 Turkey\u2019s government has claimed Donald Trump is handing it the leadership of the campaign against Isis and its forces will be crossing into north-eastern Syria \u201cshortly\u201d. After Trump suddenly withdrew American forces, Kurdish troops who have been receiving US support to defeat Islamic State now face fighting alone against Turkey, Isis and Iranian or Russian-backed units backing Syria\u2019s ruler, Bashar al-Assad. There are British and French special forces in the region and in the event of a major Turkish-Kurdish conflict the Guardian understands they would be tasked with bolstering the security of camps where captured Isis fighters are being guarded by the Kurds. \u201cWe are nervous, and very much against this Turkish offensive,\u201d a European official said. \u201cIf it is an unmitigated Turkish offensive, we are going to suffer serious consequences.\u201d * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; Police have tried to clear Extinction Rebellion (XR) protest camps from around Westminster. XR activists are now preparing for a sit-in protest at London City airport for at least three days. The veteran activist Swampy, who lived in tunnels to stop roads being built, has said the rise of XR has given him hope for environmentalism. &gt; The White House has declared it will not cooperate with impeachment hearings as Trump seeks to shield himself from scrutiny over his attempts to get Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son. Donald Trump has said he prevented the US ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, from testifying to the hearings. &gt; A humpback whale seen in the Thames has died, according to marine conservation experts. The Port of London Authority will attempt to recover for examination the body of the whale, which was estimated to be 10 metres long. &gt; The Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders is back home after being hospitalised for a heart attack and says he will adjust his campaigning. Sanders said: \u201cI must confess, I was dumb,\u201d admitting he \u201cshould have listened to those symptoms\u201d while doing \u201cthree or four rallies a day\u201d over recent months. * * * \u2018Architectural marvel\u2019 \u2013 The prize for the best new building in the UK has been awarded to one of the first new council housing projects in a generation. Goldsmith Street in Norwich is described as a \u201cmodest masterpiece\u201d by RIBA Stirling prize judges. The 105 creamy-brick homes are designed to stringent \u201cPassivhaus\u201d environmental standards, meaning energy costs are around 70% below average. Walls are highly insulated and roofs are angled at 15 degrees so each terrace doesn\u2019t block sunlight from the homes behind. Letterboxes are built into external porches rather than having door slots that allow draughts. The architects, Mikhail Riches and Cathy Hawley, won the job because they were one of the few firms to propose streets rather than slabs of apartment blocks. Oliver Wainwright writes that Goldsmith Street \u201crepresents what has become a rare breed: streets of terraced homes built directly by the council, rented with secure tenancies at fixed social rents. And it\u2019s an architectural marvel, too.\u201d * * * Zantac alert \u2013 Several versions of the heartburn medicine Zantac are being withdrawn from sale and recalled worldwide by GlaxoSmithKline after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found \u201cunacceptable\u201d levels of a probable cancer-causing impurity called N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). Zantac is also sold generically as ranitidine. Regulators have been recalling some blood pressure and heart failure medicines since last year over similar contamination. Britain\u2019s medicines watchdog said GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) was recalling four prescription-only Zantac medicines: a syrup, an injection and tablets of 150mg and 300mg dosages. Over-the-counter 75mg dosage Zantac products were made by a different company and not affected, said authorities. * * * \u2018Step up\u2019 \u2013 Universities in the UK have made progress in dealing with sexual harassment, with nearly two-thirds introducing consent training for students and some making it mandatory for freshers, according to a survey. But the findings also point to more work being needed to combat racial harassment, violence and hate crime. The survey was conducted by Universities UK two years after its Changing the Culture report set out a framework for improvements in tackling harassment, particularly sexual misconduct. Julia Buckingham, the UUK president and Brunel London vice-chancellor, said: \u201cWhile it is understandable that there has been a particular focus on addressing gender-based violence, it is time for us to step up and make sure the same priority status and resourcing is given to addressing all forms of harassment and hate.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: Shell vs Nigerian widows In 1995 the Nigerian government executed nine anti-pollution activists. Four widows are now taking the oil company to court. And: Dan Sabbagh on the ramifications of Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from the Turkish-Syrian border. Lunchtime read: Alexa \u2013 get out of my house Technology frequently inspires ambivalence: we know that Facebook and Google know too much about us, yet we continue to use their services because they\u2019re so damn convenient. \u201cVoice assistants, however, are unusually polarising,\u201d writes Dorian Lynskey. \u201cPeople who consider them sinister and invasive (myself included) regard enthusiasts as complacent, while those who find them useful and benign see the sceptics as paranoid technophobes.\u201d Voice assistants may not be the most pressing threat to privacy, but that is only because they are optional.

The only truly effective power you can wield is not to use it \u2013 but making an informed choice is compromised by misleading marketing and undermined by Amazon\u2019s efforts to embed Alexa into countless products including cars, televisions, headphones, microwaves, thermostats, clocks, new houses and hotels.

Clare Stokes, the wife of cricketer Ben Stokes, has dismissed allegations of a physical altercation between the couple at an awards ceremony. England captain Owen Farrell has not been at his most influential thus far at the Rugby World Cup but Eddie Jones and his team know that often allows George Ford to prosper. Scotland are \u201cchamping at the bit\u201d ahead of their must-win final two pool games as they bid to keep their hopes alive. The head of UK Athletics, Neil Black, is to quit at the end of this month after paying the price for his longstanding support of the banned US coach Alberto Salazar and his failure to hit his medal target at the recent World Athletics Championships. Simone Biles has won a record 21st medal at the world gymnastics championships as the United States retained their women\u2019s team all-around title. Phil Neville gave the impression that he was only feeling the searing heat of Set\u00fabal and not the pressure of his job after a scrappy Beth Mead goal salvaged a win for England against a stubborn Portugal team. And on a day when it was revealed that Andy Murray will make his grand slam singles return at the Australian Open, he came close to the best win of his comeback from hip surgery in a bad-tempered match against Fabio Fognini.

The papers \u201cWe\u2019re going round in Merkels,\u201d says the Metro\u2019s front page today of the Brexit debate, and the same could be said of the front pages, which once again lead with news of failing Brexit negotiations.

      "body": "<p>How do failing NHS trusts get back to delivering high-quality care? The answer, a new study suggests, can involve emulating Dragons\u2019 Den, the boss popping in at 3am \u2013 and staff doing less rather than more.</p> <p><a href=\"http://nhsproviders.org/providers-deliver\" title=\"\">A report from NHS Providers</a> sets out in detail how 11 trusts providing acute, ambulance and mental health care in England have used a negative rating from the Care Quality Commission as the catalyst for a turnaround in their fortunes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/03/mount-vernon-nhs-cancer-hospital-neglected-should-be-closed-report\">Neglected NHS cancer hospital is unfit for purpose, says report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The 11 trusts\u2019 approaches were all different. But the lessons learned from how they shook things up and ultimately regained a good CQC assessment for their efforts offer valuable insights into how quality and safety of care can be transformed despite underfunding and staff shortages.</p> <p>The report, called Providers Deliver, points out how 68% of trusts were rated \u201crequires improvement\u201d or \u201cinadequate\u201d by the CQC in 2014 \u2013 but now 59% are rated \u201cgood\u201d or \u201coutstanding\u201d. Similarly, over the last two years, the number of trusts deemed \u201cgood\u201d has risen from 96 to 107 \u2013 and those rated \u201coutstanding\u201d from 14 to 24.</p> <p>In all, 36 trusts have been put into \u201cspecial measures\u201d since ministers and NHS national bodies created that regime in 2013 in response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/feb/06/mid-staffs-hospital-scandal-guide\" title=\"\">Mid Staffordshire care scandal</a>. Ten remain in it, and are receiving help \u2013 from the NHS and often an outstanding trust that becomes their \u201cbuddy\u201d \u2013 to help them overcome their problems.</p> <p>But the other 26 have left special measures, on the say-so of the CQC\u2019s chief inspector of hospitals, after pushing through a combination of clinical, organisational, staffing and behavioural changes.</p> <p>So how has this widespread but largely unheralded revolution happened? How can a trust go from \u201crequires improvement\u201d to \u201coutstanding\u201d, in some cases after not much more than a year?</p> <p>Leadership, innovation and staff are the three themes that recur throughout the report. A trust\u2019s workforce emerge as the key driver of sometimes painful improvement.</p> <p>Listening to ideas for change from staff and then empowering them to implement new ways of working appears to produce results. Bob Warnock, a senior clinical professional and physiotherapist at North Tees and Hartlepool trust, sums it up. \u201cWe realised the people on the frontline are our experts.\u201d</p> <p>Eschewing the NHS\u2019s traditional \u201cthe bosses know best\u201d approach and taking genuine heed of staff members\u2019 views led to the trust establishing a frailty team to offer older people at risk of falling more help at home \u2013 and so reduce unnecessary admissions to its hospitals. It has also set up an integrated single point of access for those needing healthcare, social care or both. It\u2019s a telephone service that people can ring to speak to health professionals \u2013 who then arrange the most suitable form of support from nurses, social workers and therapists.</p> <p>The two innovations together led to a reduction in avoidable admissions \u2013 and a reduction in the delays patients experienced leaving hospital to receive social care and community rehabilitation. These delays had peaked at more than 1,000 days in October 2016, but were down to 200 days in October 2018.</p> <p>The trust went from \u201crequires improvement\u201d to \u201cgood\u201d. As did Chelsea and Westminster in London, which asked staff to put their ideas about how to improve care and services to the test in a <a href=\"https://www.chelwest.nhs.uk/about-us/news/news-archive/2017/nhs-england-hear-about-our-innovations\" title=\"\">Dragons\u2019 Den-style competition</a>. Angela Chick, a ward manager, and Ahlam Wynne, a specialist nurse, wanted to reduce the number of patients with swallowing problems who get pneumonia. They suggested introducing mouth care kits to the stroke ward \u2013 and helped the kit\u2019s manufacturers to design one that hung over the side of a patient\u2019s bed. It replaced the toothbrush or sponge that had previously helped them reduce high levels of bacteria \u2013 which can lead to pneumonia \u2013 in someone\u2019s mouth.</p> <p>Since then the amount the trust spends on antibiotics has dropped by 79%. Crucially, cases of hospital-acquired pneumonia have also dropped \u2013 down from 30 to 10 year on year \u2013 as have deaths from the infection, which are down from eight to two a year.</p> <p>Taking steps to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/15/if-we-want-nhs-staff-to-care-for-us-we-need-to-care-for-them\" title=\"\">boost </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/15/if-we-want-nhs-staff-to-care-for-us-we-need-to-care-for-them\" title=\"\">staff wellbeing</a> also emerged as a key ingredient of success. With recruitment and retention their number one problem, trusts know that making their organisation a better place to work is a must.</p> <p>Kingston trust in south London made staff welfare a key priority under new chief executive, Jo Farrar. \u201cOur absolute focus as a board was on staff and that we treat and support staff in the best way we can so they can deliver the best care,\u201d he says. That includes free sessions of yoga and pilates to help staff destress \u2013 and also free physiotherapy to help treat the painful <a href=\"https://www.nhsemployers.org/retention-and-staff-experience/health-and-wellbeing/protecting-staff-and-preventing-ill-health/taking-a-targeted-approach/musculoskeletal-health-in-the-workplace\" title=\"\">musculo</a><a href=\"https://www.nhsemployers.org/retention-and-staff-experience/health-and-wellbeing/protecting-staff-and-preventing-ill-health/taking-a-targeted-approach/musculoskeletal-health-in-the-workplace\" title=\"\">skeletal injuries</a> that are common among hospital staff.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b0d7614b37d06da86b2ffffac84563f6cd448bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b0d7614b37d06da86b2ffffac84563f6cd448bc/713_1040_5146_3088/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A yoga class for staff at Kingston hospital.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A yoga class for staff at Kingston hospital.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That, alongside listening and acting when nurses, midwives and allied health professionals warn that staffing levels in particular wards or areas of care are inadequate, has helped reduce its nurse vacancy rate to 6% \u2013 half the NHS average of 11%. And the trust went from \u201crequires improvement\u201d to an \u201coutstanding\u201d CQC rating.</p> <p>Other examples of innovation in improving quality of care include the London Ambulance Service\u2019s introduction of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/2018/10/25/hrh-prince-charles-launches-pioneering-mental-health-car-at-london-ambulance-service/\" title=\"\">mental health response cars</a>\u201d, in which vehicles containing a mental health nurse as well as a paramedic attend when the 999 call involves someone in mental health crisis. That has cut the number of such patients then taken to A&amp;E from 53% to 19%. In a similar vein, the South Western Ambulance Service has helped more people who are terminally ill to have their wish of dying at home by <a href=\"https://www.swast.nhs.uk/welcome/care-providers/end-of-life-care\" title=\"\">training paramedics to recognise when someone is in their final hours</a>. They can then arrange to keep them comfortable in their usual surroundings rather than a hospital.</p> <p>Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, says: \u201cTrusts are held accountable when they fall short. But we should also celebrate their successes, and promote understanding of approaches and ideas that could benefit patients across the NHS.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "How do failing NHS trusts get back to delivering high-quality care? The answer, a new study suggests, can involve emulating Dragons\u2019 Den, the boss popping in at 3am \u2013 and staff doing less rather than more. A report from NHS Providers sets out in detail how 11 trusts providing acute, ambulance and mental health care in England have used a negative rating from the Care Quality Commission as the catalyst for a turnaround in their fortunes. The 11 trusts\u2019 approaches were all different. But the lessons learned from how they shook things up and ultimately regained a good CQC assessment for their efforts offer valuable insights into how quality and safety of care can be transformed despite underfunding and staff shortages. The report, called Providers Deliver, points out how 68% of trusts were rated \u201crequires improvement\u201d or \u201cinadequate\u201d by the CQC in 2014 \u2013 but now 59% are rated \u201cgood\u201d or \u201coutstanding\u201d. Similarly, over the last two years, the number of trusts deemed \u201cgood\u201d has risen from 96 to 107 \u2013 and those rated \u201coutstanding\u201d from 14 to 24. In all, 36 trusts have been put into \u201cspecial measures\u201d since ministers and NHS national bodies created that regime in 2013 in response to the Mid Staffordshire care scandal. Ten remain in it, and are receiving help \u2013 from the NHS and often an outstanding trust that becomes their \u201cbuddy\u201d \u2013 to help them overcome their problems. But the other 26 have left special measures, on the say-so of the CQC\u2019s chief inspector of hospitals, after pushing through a combination of clinical, organisational, staffing and behavioural changes. So how has this widespread but largely unheralded revolution happened? How can a trust go from \u201crequires improvement\u201d to \u201coutstanding\u201d, in some cases after not much more than a year? Leadership, innovation and staff are the three themes that recur throughout the report. A trust\u2019s workforce emerge as the key driver of sometimes painful improvement. Listening to ideas for change from staff and then empowering them to implement new ways of working appears to produce results. Bob Warnock, a senior clinical professional and physiotherapist at North Tees and Hartlepool trust, sums it up. \u201cWe realised the people on the frontline are our experts.\u201d Eschewing the NHS\u2019s traditional \u201cthe bosses know best\u201d approach and taking genuine heed of staff members\u2019 views led to the trust establishing a frailty team to offer older people at risk of falling more help at home \u2013 and so reduce unnecessary admissions to its hospitals. It has also set up an integrated single point of access for those needing healthcare, social care or both. It\u2019s a telephone service that people can ring to speak to health professionals \u2013 who then arrange the most suitable form of support from nurses, social workers and therapists. The two innovations together led to a reduction in avoidable admissions \u2013 and a reduction in the delays patients experienced leaving hospital to receive social care and community rehabilitation. These delays had peaked at more than 1,000 days in October 2016, but were down to 200 days in October 2018. The trust went from \u201crequires improvement\u201d to \u201cgood\u201d. As did Chelsea and Westminster in London, which asked staff to put their ideas about how to improve care and services to the test in a Dragons\u2019 Den-style competition. Angela Chick, a ward manager, and Ahlam Wynne, a specialist nurse, wanted to reduce the number of patients with swallowing problems who get pneumonia. They suggested introducing mouth care kits to the stroke ward \u2013 and helped the kit\u2019s manufacturers to design one that hung over the side of a patient\u2019s bed. It replaced the toothbrush or sponge that had previously helped them reduce high levels of bacteria \u2013 which can lead to pneumonia \u2013 in someone\u2019s mouth. Since then the amount the trust spends on antibiotics has dropped by 79%. Crucially, cases of hospital-acquired pneumonia have also dropped \u2013 down from 30 to 10 year on year \u2013 as have deaths from the infection, which are down from eight to two a year. Taking steps to boost staff wellbeing also emerged as a key ingredient of success. With recruitment and retention their number one problem, trusts know that making their organisation a better place to work is a must. Kingston trust in south London made staff welfare a key priority under new chief executive, Jo Farrar. \u201cOur absolute focus as a board was on staff and that we treat and support staff in the best way we can so they can deliver the best care,\u201d he says. That includes free sessions of yoga and pilates to help staff destress \u2013 and also free physiotherapy to help treat the painful musculoskeletal injuries that are common among hospital staff. That, alongside listening and acting when nurses, midwives and allied health professionals warn that staffing levels in particular wards or areas of care are inadequate, has helped reduce its nurse vacancy rate to 6% \u2013 half the NHS average of 11%. And the trust went from \u201crequires improvement\u201d to an \u201coutstanding\u201d CQC rating. Other examples of innovation in improving quality of care include the London Ambulance Service\u2019s introduction of \u201cmental health response cars\u201d, in which vehicles containing a mental health nurse as well as a paramedic attend when the 999 call involves someone in mental health crisis. That has cut the number of such patients then taken to A&amp;E from 53% to 19%. In a similar vein, the South Western Ambulance Service has helped more people who are terminally ill to have their wish of dying at home by training paramedics to recognise when someone is in their final hours. They can then arrange to keep them comfortable in their usual surroundings rather than a hospital. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, says: \u201cTrusts are held accountable when they fall short. But we should also celebrate their successes, and promote understanding of approaches and ideas that could benefit patients across the NHS.\u201d",

Yet it\u2019s true, in a funny way, for Bong himself. A globally minded film-maker with big-dreaming genre nous, he has spent the last few years making a bid for mainstream Hollywood clout, only to finally make an international phenomenon from his own doorstep.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/21/parasite-review-bong-joon-ho\">Parasite review \u2013 creepy invasion of the lifestyle snatchers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bong\u2019s last two films, 2013\u2019s Snowpiercer and 2017\u2019s Okja, were his first to be made in English: they weren\u2019t exactly misfires, either critically or commercially, yet both clearly had designs on being bigger deals than they were. Adapted from a comic book, with brawny Marvel man Chris Evans in the lead, Snowpiercer was a delirious dystopian adventure that merged Bong\u2019s auteurist eccentricity with bolshy blockbuster aspirations: it raked in over $82m outside the US, double its production budget (at $40m, then a record for a Korean production).</p> <p>In the States, however, its bullet-train momentum was halted by the ignoble figure of Harvey Weinstein, as Bong joined the long line of directors to fight \u201cHarvey Scissorhands\u201d over the film\u2019s final edit. The director refused to follow Weinstein\u2019s proposed cuts and additions; the impasse delayed the film\u2019s American release for a year, prompting \u201cFree Snowpiercer\u201d protests from impatient fans. Finally, the uncut film was granted a release, albeit a limited one on the Weinsteins\u2019 lower-profile Radius-TWC label. It took just $4.5m: the film may not have been conventional popcorn fare, but it clearly had set its sights higher than that. (Meanwhile, it never even made it to UK cinemas.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14abeb8d6aa7e879b39e41185ff22f24c73a1f01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14abeb8d6aa7e879b39e41185ff22f24c73a1f01/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bong Joon Ho directing Okja\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bong Joon Ho directing Okja.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kimberly French/Jae Hyuk Lee / Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Undaunted, Bong flirted with Hollywood again in Okja, a daffy fantasy romp that meshed a South Korean setting and sensibility with an international eco-warrior conscience and lashings of multiplex-friendly spectacle. Jake Gyllenhaal and Tilda Swinton were on hand too, acting with the level of subtlety you\u2019d expect of a Jon Ronson-scripted film about a mall-trashing, genetically modified superpig escaping the slaughterhouse with the loving help of an adorable tyke: Babe on highly aggressive steroids, if you will. Bong had more sympathetic Tinseltown partners than Weinstein this time: Netflix and Brad Pitt\u2019s Plan B Entertainment boarded the project early, stumping up a $50m production budget (breaking Snowpiercer\u2019s aforementioned record).</p> <p>It premiered at Cannes, in the last year that the tradition-bound French festival permitted Netflix\u2019s film in its competition, and was well enough received: scattered boos were directed at the streaming service rather than the film itself. But by the time it popped up on the Netflix platform a month later, it felt a bit of a non-event. Critical enthusiasm was muted relative to Bong\u2019s earlier, wilder, more homegrown genre rides like Mother and The Host, and it quietly sank into Netflix\u2019s unquantifiable morass of content \u2013 it\u2019s doubtless been seen by many, but it never felt like anyone was really talking about it.</p> <p>Parasite, on the other hand, has been inspiring itchy international conversation since its premiere at Cannes, where it wowed critics and Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s jury, who unanimously handed it the Palme d\u2019Or. Many a Palme d\u2019Or winner goes quiet outside the rarefied film-festival atmosphere; Parasite, with its inky comedy driven by seething social fury, has found its public. With multiple global territories (including the US, UK and Japan) yet to weigh in, it has already grossed $91m worldwide; eager chatter about it is lighting up social media. (If you don\u2019t believe me, search the #BongHive hashtag on Twitter to see the film\u2019s Generation Z cult in action.)

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s no place like home. It\u2019s a cliche that sounds pretty cruel applied to Parasite, Bong Joon-ho\u2019s brilliant, insidious twist on the home-invasion thriller, in which a frostily modernist luxury house serves as several different things to different people \u2013 a status symbol, a shelter, a prison \u2013 but doesn\u2019t offer homely comforts to anyone, exactly. Yet it\u2019s true, in a funny way, for Bong himself. A globally minded film-maker with big-dreaming genre nous, he has spent the last few years making a bid for mainstream Hollywood clout, only to finally make an international phenomenon from his own doorstep. Bong\u2019s last two films, 2013\u2019s Snowpiercer and 2017\u2019s Okja, were his first to be made in English: they weren\u2019t exactly misfires, either critically or commercially, yet both clearly had designs on being bigger deals than they were. Adapted from a comic book, with brawny Marvel man Chris Evans in the lead, Snowpiercer was a delirious dystopian adventure that merged Bong\u2019s auteurist eccentricity with bolshy blockbuster aspirations: it raked in over $82m outside the US, double its production budget (at $40m, then a record for a Korean production). In the States, however, its bullet-train momentum was halted by the ignoble figure of Harvey Weinstein, as Bong joined the long line of directors to fight \u201cHarvey Scissorhands\u201d over the film\u2019s final edit. The director refused to follow Weinstein\u2019s proposed cuts and additions; the impasse delayed the film\u2019s American release for a year, prompting \u201cFree Snowpiercer\u201d protests from impatient fans. Finally, the uncut film was granted a release, albeit a limited one on the Weinsteins\u2019 lower-profile Radius-TWC label. It took just $4.5m: the film may not have been conventional popcorn fare, but it clearly had set its sights higher than that. (Meanwhile, it never even made it to UK cinemas.) Undaunted, Bong flirted with Hollywood again in Okja, a daffy fantasy romp that meshed a South Korean setting and sensibility with an international eco-warrior conscience and lashings of multiplex-friendly spectacle. Jake Gyllenhaal and Tilda Swinton were on hand too, acting with the level of subtlety you\u2019d expect of a Jon Ronson-scripted film about a mall-trashing, genetically modified superpig escaping the slaughterhouse with the loving help of an adorable tyke: Babe on highly aggressive steroids, if you will. Bong had more sympathetic Tinseltown partners than Weinstein this time: Netflix and Brad Pitt\u2019s Plan B Entertainment boarded the project early, stumping up a $50m production budget (breaking Snowpiercer\u2019s aforementioned record). It premiered at Cannes, in the last year that the tradition-bound French festival permitted Netflix\u2019s film in its competition, and was well enough received: scattered boos were directed at the streaming service rather than the film itself. But by the time it popped up on the Netflix platform a month later, it felt a bit of a non-event. Critical enthusiasm was muted relative to Bong\u2019s earlier, wilder, more homegrown genre rides like Mother and The Host, and it quietly sank into Netflix\u2019s unquantifiable morass of content \u2013 it\u2019s doubtless been seen by many, but it never felt like anyone was really talking about it. Parasite, on the other hand, has been inspiring itchy international conversation since its premiere at Cannes, where it wowed critics and Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s jury, who unanimously handed it the Palme d\u2019Or. Many a Palme d\u2019Or winner goes quiet outside the rarefied film-festival atmosphere; Parasite, with its inky comedy driven by seething social fury, has found its public. With multiple global territories (including the US, UK and Japan) yet to weigh in, it has already grossed $91m worldwide; eager chatter about it is lighting up social media. (If you don\u2019t believe me, search the #BongHive hashtag on Twitter to see the film\u2019s Generation Z cult in action.) Its hip US distributor Neon will be planning a lively Oscar campaign, targeting not just the foreign-language category, but a best picture nomination too. That would surely seal its status as the biggest Korean crossover phenomenon in film history: the BTS of cinema, effectively. That\u2019s a pretty remarkable trajectory for a film that, in addition to its chilly, bleak outlook and grisly violence, is entirely uncompromised in its sheer Korean-ness: no English dialogue or Hollywood stars here, while the film is so vivid in its cultural specifics that jjapaguri \u2013 a kind of local instant noodle dish \u2013 serves as a key plot point.

His compatriot Park Chan-wook befuddled audiences with his bewitchingly bonkers American debut Stoker; an indifferent commercial reception sent him back to home turf, where he made The Handmaiden and landed a global arthouse sensation. (He\u2019s since surprised us again, heading over to the BBC to direct the very chic Le Carr\u00e9 miniseries The Little Drummer Girl; so far, this back-and-forth travelling has cramped his style.) Haifaa Al-Mansour, the first Saudi woman to direct a feature with the arthouse charmer Wadjda, bombed when she headed abroad to make the literary biopic Mary Shelley; she headed back to Saudi Arabia to direct the crowd-pleasing feminist parable The Perfect Candidate, which was warmly received at Venice and Toronto last month, and has been entered by her home country as its Oscar submission. These are different journeys, of course, from that of Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, who capitalised on his vast Hollywood success to head home for his most personal project to date \u2013 though the lavish acclaim and awards heaped upon his Netflix-backed Mexican memory piece Roma nonetheless made it a career milestone.

Now it\u2019s time to take it to the Almeida in London, a bit later than planned, with a couple of previews cancelled. Lead actor Samantha Bond has had to withdraw due to injury and her replacement is Siobhan Redmond. Craig is upbeat despite these difficulties. \u201cShe\u2019s played a blinder, learned lines at the speed of light, been extraordinary!\u201d</p> <p>This isn\u2019t the first time the director has dealt with cast changes. This year, her production of The Color Purple at Leicester Curve hit the news when actor Seyi Omooba was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/21/actor-playing-gay-role-in-musical-sacked-for-homophobic-comments\">sacked for homophobic comments</a> made several years earlier on social media. Omooba had been cast in the role of Celie, a famously queer character. The role was recast and Craig\u2019s production received <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/04/the-color-purple-review-curve-leicester\">good reviews</a> (as did new lead, T\u2019Shan Williams). Omooba recently announced her intention to sue Curve theatre and her old agency for breach of contract and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2019/actor-removed-color-purple-legal-action-leicester-curve/\">religious discrimination</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t really involved in any of that decision-making either way, so it was really hard at the time,\u201d says Craig. \u201cPeople were being absolutely vile to me on Twitter. I think [they] assumed I\u2019d somehow known her position and cast her anyway, which obviously wasn\u2019t the case. But do you know what? It\u2019s fine. I feel very attached to the show. It was one of the creative joys of my life.\u201d Craig is a lifelong fan of musicals. \u201cI was scared that I would do a musical and then realise I didn\u2019t like them, and actually the opposite happened. I\u2019m like, \u2018I want to do at least one musical a year until the day that I die!\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5eb50b23e1becd6544b36670cbf99074075af57e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5eb50b23e1becd6544b36670cbf99074075af57e/0_357_5355_3213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018One of the creative joys of my life\u2019 \u2026 The Color Purple.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018One of the creative joys of my life\u2019 \u2026 The Color Purple.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vassa, Craig tells me, is \u201ca play about a mother and her grownup children. The family own a business. The patriarch is dying, and when he dies they will be able to get their inheritance and take their shares out of the business. The mother does not want them to do this because that way the business collapses, and the business is the most important thing in the world to her.\u201d</p> <p>Is Vassa a political play, then? For Craig, it is more about family and how politics can muddy the waters. \u201cOne thing Mike and I talked about a lot is that families are mostly based on a kind of socialist structure when they work. Which is to say that everyone is considered to be equal; if people are worse off for whatever reason we help them out; there\u2019s a leader but the leader is there to make sure everyone is elevated; we share. In a nice, good family all those things are in place, right? We don\u2019t have favourites, there\u2019s equity, there\u2019s equality, and we like that in families.\u201d In Vassa, however, the central family \u201chave drifted into a capitalist structure, essentially. So there are winners and there are losers, and gains and losses, and they are like \u2018Are you useful to me or not?\u2019 Which is a question in the capitalist world, [and] how capitalism fucks over loads of people. So you\u2019re looking at a family who have rejected the socialist structure. What does that do? And can you sustain it? The answer, I think, is no.\u201d</p> <p>Vassa is the first time she has tackled work that wasn\u2019t originally written in English. It was important for her and Bartlett to modernise the language and balance Gorky\u2019s intentions with their own. Craig has cast non-white actors in some roles. \u201cWhen Gorky wrote it they were white. Aside from me not being particularly interested in putting an all-white cast on stage, it felt quite important that these people didn\u2019t look or sound like each other. That they\u2019re meant to be a family and yet have no connection, and they\u2019re stuck in the house. The house has become sort of a prison. They\u2019re waiting for someone to die, they can\u2019t leave until this person dies, they don\u2019t like each other, they don\u2019t want to be there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec2abb4d051e190f026fbf271b8b00f85dc10b42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec2abb4d051e190f026fbf271b8b00f85dc10b42/0_181_5094_3057/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trauma \u2026 I Call My Brothers at the Gate, London, in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trauma \u2026 I Call My Brothers at the Gate, London, in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Raised in Brixton, south London, Craig entered the theatre world via playwriting; she was on the Royal Court\u2019s Young Writers programme at 17 years old. \u201cThat happened if you grew up in London in the 90s; I was one of those very extracurricular kids.

      "body": "<p>One day in 2017, Alexa went rogue. When Martin Josephson, who lives in London, came home from work, he heard his Amazon Echo Dot voice assistant spitting out fragmentary commands, seemingly based on his previous interactions with the device. It appeared to be regurgitating requests to book train tickets for journeys he had already taken and to record TV shows that he had already watched. Josephson had not said the wake word \u2013 \u201cAlexa\u201d \u2013 to activate it and nothing he said would stop it. It was, he says, \u201cKafkaesque\u201d.</p> <p>This was especially interesting because Josephson (not his real name) was a former Amazon employee. Three years earlier, he had volunteered to sit in a room reciting a string of apparently meaningless phrases into a microphone for an undisclosed purpose. Only when Amazon released the Echo in the US in 2014 did he realise what he had been working on. He bought a Dot, the Echo\u2019s cheaper, smaller model, after it launched in 2016, and found it useful enough until the day it went haywire. When the Dot\u2019s outburst subsided, he unplugged it and deposited it in the bin. \u201cI felt a bit foolish,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving worked at Amazon, and having seen how they used people\u2019s data, I knew I couldn\u2019t trust them.\u201d</p> <p>The Dot wasn\u2019t supposed to behave like a dadaist drill sergeant. Then again, voice assistants often do things that they are not supposed to do. Last year, an Amazon customer in Germany was mistakenly <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/12/20/678631013/amazon-customer-receives-1-700-audio-files-of-a-stranger-who-used-alexa?t=1570014709519&amp;t=1570530199090\" title=\"\">sent about 1,700 audio files</a> from someone else\u2019s Echo, providing enough information to name and locate the unfortunate user and his girlfriend. (Amazon attributed this \u201cunfortunate mishap\u201d to human error.)</p> <p>In San Francisco, Shawn Kinnear claimed that his Echo activated itself and said cheerfully: \u201cEvery time I close my eyes, all I see is people dying.\u201d In Portland, Oregon, a woman discovered that her Echo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/24/amazon-alexa-recorded-conversation\" title=\"\">had taken it upon itself to send recordings of private conversations to one of her husband\u2019s employees</a>. In a statement, Amazon said that the Echo must have misheard the wake word, misheard a request to send a message, misheard a name in its contacts list and then misheard a confirmation to send the message, all during a conversation about hardwood floors. Not great, Alexa.</p> <p>Technology frequently inspires ambivalence: we know that Facebook and Google know too much about us, yet we continue to use their services because they\u2019re so damn convenient. Voice assistants, however, are unusually polarising. People who consider them sinister and invasive (myself included) regard enthusiasts as complacent, while those who find them useful and benign see the sceptics as paranoid technophobes. There is one question freighted with bigger issues about our relationship with the tech industry: should you let Alexa into your home?</p> <p>In January, Amazon\u2019s senior vice-president of devices, David Limp, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/4/18168565/amazon-alexa-devices-how-many-sold-number-100-million-dave-limp\" title=\"\">revealed that the company had sold more than 100m Alexa-enabled devices</a>. Last year in the US, where one in five adults own a home voice assistant, Alexa had a 70% US market share, compared with the Google Assistant\u2019s 24%. It is therefore best-placed to become what Shoshana Zuboff, in her bestseller, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/02/age-of-surveillance-capitalism-shoshana-zuboff-review\" title=\"\">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a>, calls the \u201cOne Voice\u201d: the dominant ecosystem that would give its operator \u201cthe ability to anticipate and monetise all the moments of all the people during all the days\u201d. Zuboff calls the birth of Alexa \u201ca threshold event\u201d.</p> <p>Alexa, however, has grown up in an era of increasing scepticism about the power and morality of the \u201cbig five\u201d tech companies: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google/Alphabet and Microsoft. Events such as the Edward Snowden leaks and the Cambridge Analytica scandal have tarnished Silicon Valley\u2019s utopian promises. CEOs are less likely to trivialise privacy concerns. Tech journalists are more likely to be critics than cheerleaders.

Over the past six months, Bloomberg, the Guardian, Vice News and the Belgian news channel VRT have gradually revealed that all the big five have been using human contractors to analyse a small percentage of voice-assistant recordings. Although the recordings are anonymised, they often contain enough information to identify or embarrass the user \u2013 particularly if what they overhear is confidential medical information or an inadvertent sex tape. The revelations were the last straw for many Alexa sceptics. \u201cWe live in a techno-dystopia of our own making. If you still have an Alexa or any other voice assistant in your home, you were warned,\u201d wrote the Gizmodo writer Matt Novak.</p> <p>Having worked at Amazon and another big-five company, Josephson thinks this resistance to these companies is justified. \u201cThey have zero interest, in my opinion, in wondering what the impact of those products will be. To treat them as the right people to wield that power is a ludicrous situation that we wouldn\u2019t allow in any other industry. They, frankly, are not safe guardians of the data that they\u2019re collecting every day without us knowing.\u201d</p> <p>Voice control first seized the public imagination in the 60s, via HAL 9000, the sentient computer in 2001: A Space Odyssey, and the Starship Enterprise\u2019s endlessly helpful computer in Star Trek. The latter was a major reference point for the teams that developed Amazon\u2019s Echo and the Google Assistant. \u201cThe bright light, the shining light, that is still many years away, many decades away, is to recreate the Star Trek computer,\u201d Limp told a conference audience in 2017.</p> <p>In the real world, voice recognition didn\u2019t become commonplace until Apple launched its phone-based voice assistant, Siri, in 2011. Alexa goes much further by colonising the user\u2019s home. Three decades ago, the prescient computer scientist Mark Weiser called this kind of frictionless ecosystem \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ics.uci.edu/~djp3/classes/2012_09_INF241/papers/Weiser-Computer21Century-SciAm.pdf\" title=\"\">ubiquitous computing</a>\u201d. In 2015, Google\u2019s Eric Schmidt foresaw a day when the internet will be \u201cpart of your presence all the time\u201d, making your real-life behaviour as mappable as what you do on your laptop or phone. You will never be offline.</p> <p>The Gizmodo editor Adam Clark Estes was initially excited by the first major hardware innovation since Apple\u2019s iPad four years earlier. The more he learned about the technology, however, the less he liked it. His own Echo would wake up unprompted. Recordings began showing up as evidence in court cases. The FBI refused to confirm or deny that it was using Alexa for surveillance purposes. \u201cIt became increasingly clear to me that the privacy watchdogs were right,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is, at base, a wiretapping device.\u201d</p> <p>Voice assistants epitomise the tension between efficiency and privacy. The technology is still deeply imperfect; in more than one out of 10 transcripts analysed by one of Bloomberg\u2019s sources, Alexa woke up accidentally. Accurately interpreting voice commands by taking account of different languages, accents, tones, contexts and degrees of ambient clutter requires far more computational power than a single device can contain. Therefore, most of the work is performed in the cloud, which is how human monitors are able to collect and analyse voice recordings. \u201cYou are building an infrastructure that can be later co-opted in undesirable ways by large multinationals and state surveillance apparatus, and compromised by malicious hackers,\u201d says Dr Michael Veale, a lecturer in digital rights and regulation at UCL Faculty of Laws at University College London.</p> <p>Not all voice assistants are equal. Apple, whose profits don\u2019t rely primarily on data collection, uses more in-device computation and encryption at both ends. \u201cApple is the best at privacy,\u201d says Estes. \u201cAt the same time, I think everyone agrees that Siri sucks.\u201d Amazon Echo and Google Assistant are much more reliable because these companies\u2019 business models depend on knowing so much more about you in order to microtarget advertising. They like to frame data collection as a means to improve services while playing down the immense commercial benefits.</p> <p>Google and Amazon could, of course, choose to improve the technology by paying people to test it \u2013 the kind of work Josephson performed in 2012 \u2013 instead of treating their customers as a free research-and-development database. Or they could advertise the fact that humans may be studying the recordings. \u201cIt should be on the box,\u201d says Dr Jeremy Gillula, the project director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a group that campaigns against the misuse of technology. The generous interpretation of tech companies\u2019 motives is a heedless utopianism, but Gillula argues that if they were truly naive about the implications of their technology, then they wouldn\u2019t go to such lengths to conceal them. \u201cI doubt they thought no one would care. I think they were trying to keep it quiet because if users knew what was going on they might stop buying the devices. It was a calculated business decision.\u201d</p> <p>In response, a spokeswoman for Amazon says: \u201cCustomer trust is at the centre of everything we do and we take customer privacy very seriously. We continuously review our practices and procedures to ensure we\u2019re providing customers with the best experiences and privacy choices. We provide customers with several privacy controls, including the ability to review and delete their voice recordings. To help improve Alexa, we manually review an extremely small sample of Alexa requests to confirm Alexa understood and responded correctly. Customers can opt out of having their voice recordings included in that review process.\u201d</p> <p>Yet it has been demonstrated time and time again that, in their advertising and shrewdly worded privacy policies, tech companies routinely obscure the extent and nature of their data harvesting. \u201cGoogle and Amazon have shown us that they\u2019re inclined to take as much as they can until someone catches them with their hand in the cookie jar,\u201d says Estes. \u201cI hate to be dramatic, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever going to feel safe from their data-collection practices. Government regulation is the only thing that is going to halt more damage.\u201d</p> <p>The US government has been reluctant to act. In July 2015, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (Epic), a long-established nonprofit organisation dedicated to \u201cdemocratic values in the information age\u201d, called for an investigation into \u201calways on\u201d devices, including voice assistants. They have yet to receive a response. \u201cMarket-based solutions don\u2019t work in this area because companies have been allowed to conceal the defects of their own products,\u201d says Marc Rotenberg, Epic\u2019s executive director. He adds: \u201cIf you or I were to place a device in someone else\u2019s home with the ability to capture their private communications, we would be in violation of the Federal Wiretap Act.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you\u2019re an authoritarian country, why not just run the audio stream straight to a government surveillance agency?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In July, a Democratic congressman, Seth Moulton, introduced the Automatic Listening Exploitation Act, which would penalise companies whose voice assistants and smart doorbells (such as Amazon\u2019s Ring) record conversations without permission, but Gillula considers it \u201cpretty weak legislation\u201d. In Europe, which has bitter first-hand experience of mass surveillance under totalitarian regimes, the regulators have sharper teeth. Recently, Johannes Caspar, Hamburg\u2019s formidable commissioner for data protection, forced Google to suspend the transcription of voice recordings throughout the EU, while Apple and Facebook simultaneously halted transcription everywhere in the world. (Amazon merely allowed users to opt out of human monitoring.) The UK Information Commissioner\u2019s Office is investigating whether human oversight breaches the General Data Protection Regulation. \u201cWe have significant regulation in this area already, but the key is enforcement,\u201d says Veale. \u201cLike all European data-protection authorities, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office is underfunded and overstretched, and needs significant investment and support to protect citizens\u2019 fundamental rights.\u201d</p> <p>Without effective regulation, there is no defence against more invasive exploitation of voice assistants. By definition always on, even when they are not awake, the devices are constantly listening, although not always transmitting. Gillula says that there are no technical obstacles to enabling dormant devices to, for example, track users\u2019 television viewing by responding to high-pitched signals embedded in shows and advertisements, or identify who is in the house at any given time. \u201cThat essentially becomes constant surveillance,\u201d Gillula says. \u201cI am hopeful that the companies would never go down this dystopian path, but I could see them saying: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a feature: know when your kids are home!\u2019 An appealing feature is how most of these things start.\u201d</p> <p>Where they end up has galvanised not just privacy watchdogs but writers. The dystopian implications of voice assistants are appearing in science fiction, including the Spike Jonze movie Her, Black Mirror and Years and Years. Behind them all looms the \u201cnever-sleeping ear\u201d of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/22/the-ministry-of-truth-by-dorian-lynskey-review-a-biography-of-george-orwells-1984\" title=\"\">George Orwell\u2019s telescreen in Nineteen Eighty-Four</a>: \u201cYou had to live \u2013 did live, from habit that became instinct \u2013 in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard.\u201d The Echo Show, a smart assistant with a screen and camera, was widely compared to the telescreen when it was introduced two years ago. \u201cAlexa, show me the dystopia,\u201d quipped Vice. In Joanna Kavenna\u2019s satirical novel Zed, the writer explores the \u201cweird dysfunctional-servant aspect\u201d of real-life voice assistants (which all have female voices as their default setting) and the sociopolitical consequences of the One Voice: in Zed, the tech monopoly, Beetle, is omnipresent and unaccountable. \u201cThe democratic idea is that we\u2019re meant to have transparent corporations and governments, while people have privacy,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have the inverse. People are uneasy because it\u2019s not being debated at a mature, democratic level.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4236c4f32b09b64644cea795cb4cc35d2af7995\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4236c4f32b09b64644cea795cb4cc35d2af7995/75_0_2250_1350/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joaquin Phoenix in Spike Jonze\u2019s Her.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joaquin Phoenix in Spike Jonze\u2019s Her.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kavenna worries that, far from legislating to protect user privacy, US states will seek to access voice-assistant recordings in the name of crime prevention and national security. Last year, a judge in New Hampshire made headlines by ordering Amazon to submit Echo recordings of a double murder to investigators. \u201cIt puts them in a very complicated position between their customers and the government,\u201d Kavenna says. \u201cWe\u2019re very dependent on the political regime.\u201d</p> <p>Rotenberg agrees: \u201cIf you\u2019re an authoritarian country, why not just run the audio stream straight to a government surveillance agency and argue that it\u2019s to reduce crime in the home? It\u2019s scary to contemplate, but conceivable.\u201d</p> <p>Today, voice assistants are not the most pressing threat to privacy only because they are optional. A facial recognition scanner can spy on you in a public space, but Alexa, like a vampire, must be invited into your home. The only truly effective power you can wield over this technology is not to use it. But making an informed choice is compromised by misleading marketing and undermined by Amazon\u2019s efforts to embed Alexa into countless products, including cars, televisions, headphones, microwaves, thermostats and clocks, while signing deals with housebuilding companies and hotel chains, all with an eye to becoming the One Voice. \u201cVoice control is being forced down consumers\u2019 throats whether they like it or not,\u201d says Estes.</p> <p>We are not there yet. Tech companies rely on the myth of technological inevitability to occlude the business decisions they have made and the possibility of other models. To challenge them is to fight the future. Nonsense, says Kavenna. \u201cIs it an inevitable consequence of tech? No, it\u2019s an ideological application of tech. If you build a building, you don\u2019t have to build a panopticon. It doesn\u2019t have to be what we have now. They\u2019ll often claim that if you\u2019re opposed to this, you\u2019re a neo-luddite. That myth has allowed a lot of people to become incredibly rich.\u201d</p> <p>None of the people I spoke to owns a home voice assistant, nor would they advise anyone to get one, but they all agree that it would be possible to develop a device that delivers the most popular services while respecting the user\u2019s privacy. If the entire industry were to follow Apple\u2019s lead in making human monitoring opt-in rather than opt-out, that would be a strong start. Then, as processing power increases, more tasks could be performed inside the device. But, of course, that would mean forfeiting that juicy, monetisable data. \u201cA lot of stuff that you really want to do shouldn\u2019t require the internet, and once you cut off access to the cloud, then the privacy concerns fade away,\u201d says Estes. \u201cThere\u2019s always the potential for things to get better \u2013 and there\u2019s always going to be a fight to get to that point.\u201d</p> <p>Jeremy Gillula is so convinced that a safe, fully user-controlled voice assistant is possible that he is designing his own, using open-source software.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m getting there,\u201d he says cheerfully. \u201cI\u2019m not 100% satisfied yet, but it will turn the lights on and off.\u201d</p>",

They like to frame data collection as a means to improve services while playing down the immense commercial benefits. Google and Amazon could, of course, choose to improve the technology by paying people to test it \u2013 the kind of work Josephson performed in 2012 \u2013 instead of treating their customers as a free research-and-development database. Or they could advertise the fact that humans may be studying the recordings. \u201cIt should be on the box,\u201d says Dr Jeremy Gillula, the project director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a group that campaigns against the misuse of technology. The generous interpretation of tech companies\u2019 motives is a heedless utopianism, but Gillula argues that if they were truly naive about the implications of their technology, then they wouldn\u2019t go to such lengths to conceal them. \u201cI doubt they thought no one would care. I think they were trying to keep it quiet because if users knew what was going on they might stop buying the devices. It was a calculated business decision.\u201d In response, a spokeswoman for Amazon says: \u201cCustomer trust is at the centre of everything we do and we take customer privacy very seriously. We continuously review our practices and procedures to ensure we\u2019re providing customers with the best experiences and privacy choices. We provide customers with several privacy controls, including the ability to review and delete their voice recordings. To help improve Alexa, we manually review an extremely small sample of Alexa requests to confirm Alexa understood and responded correctly. Customers can opt out of having their voice recordings included in that review process.\u201d Yet it has been demonstrated time and time again that, in their advertising and shrewdly worded privacy policies, tech companies routinely obscure the extent and nature of their data harvesting. \u201cGoogle and Amazon have shown us that they\u2019re inclined to take as much as they can until someone catches them with their hand in the cookie jar,\u201d says Estes. \u201cI hate to be dramatic, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever going to feel safe from their data-collection practices. Government regulation is the only thing that is going to halt more damage.\u201d The US government has been reluctant to act. In July 2015, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (Epic), a long-established nonprofit organisation dedicated to \u201cdemocratic values in the information age\u201d, called for an investigation into \u201calways on\u201d devices, including voice assistants. They have yet to receive a response. \u201cMarket-based solutions don\u2019t work in this area because companies have been allowed to conceal the defects of their own products,\u201d says Marc Rotenberg, Epic\u2019s executive director. He adds: \u201cIf you or I were to place a device in someone else\u2019s home with the ability to capture their private communications, we would be in violation of the Federal Wiretap Act.\u201d In July, a Democratic congressman, Seth Moulton, introduced the Automatic Listening Exploitation Act, which would penalise companies whose voice assistants and smart doorbells (such as Amazon\u2019s Ring) record conversations without permission, but Gillula considers it \u201cpretty weak legislation\u201d. In Europe, which has bitter first-hand experience of mass surveillance under totalitarian regimes, the regulators have sharper teeth. Recently, Johannes Caspar, Hamburg\u2019s formidable commissioner for data protection, forced Google to suspend the transcription of voice recordings throughout the EU, while Apple and Facebook simultaneously halted transcription everywhere in the world. (Amazon merely allowed users to opt out of human monitoring.) The UK Information Commissioner\u2019s Office is investigating whether human oversight breaches the General Data Protection Regulation. \u201cWe have significant regulation in this area already, but the key is enforcement,\u201d says Veale. \u201cLike all European data-protection authorities, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office is underfunded and overstretched, and needs significant investment and support to protect citizens\u2019 fundamental rights.\u201d Without effective regulation, there is no defence against more invasive exploitation of voice assistants. By definition always on, even when they are not awake, the devices are constantly listening, although not always transmitting. Gillula says that there are no technical obstacles to enabling dormant devices to, for example, track users\u2019 television viewing by responding to high-pitched signals embedded in shows and advertisements, or identify who is in the house at any given time. \u201cThat essentially becomes constant surveillance,\u201d Gillula says. \u201cI am hopeful that the companies would never go down this dystopian path, but I could see them saying: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a feature: know when your kids are home!\u2019 An appealing feature is how most of these things start.\u201d Where they end up has galvanised not just privacy watchdogs but writers. The dystopian implications of voice assistants are appearing in science fiction, including the Spike Jonze movie Her, Black Mirror and Years and Years. Behind them all looms the \u201cnever-sleeping ear\u201d of George Orwell\u2019s telescreen in Nineteen Eighty-Four: \u201cYou had to live \u2013 did live, from habit that became instinct \u2013 in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard.\u201d The Echo Show, a smart assistant with a screen and camera, was widely compared to the telescreen when it was introduced two years ago. \u201cAlexa, show me the dystopia,\u201d quipped Vice. In Joanna Kavenna\u2019s satirical novel Zed, the writer explores the \u201cweird dysfunctional-servant aspect\u201d of real-life voice assistants (which all have female voices as their default setting) and the sociopolitical consequences of the One Voice: in Zed, the tech monopoly, Beetle, is omnipresent and unaccountable. \u201cThe democratic idea is that we\u2019re meant to have transparent corporations and governments, while people have privacy,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have the inverse. People are uneasy because it\u2019s not being debated at a mature, democratic level.\u201d Kavenna worries that, far from legislating to protect user privacy, US states will seek to access voice-assistant recordings in the name of crime prevention and national security. Last year, a judge in New Hampshire made headlines by ordering Amazon to submit Echo recordings of a double murder to investigators. \u201cIt puts them in a very complicated position between their customers and the government,\u201d Kavenna says. \u201cWe\u2019re very dependent on the political regime.\u201d Rotenberg agrees: \u201cIf you\u2019re an authoritarian country, why not just run the audio stream straight to a government surveillance agency and argue that it\u2019s to reduce crime in the home? It\u2019s scary to contemplate, but conceivable.\u201d Today, voice assistants are not the most pressing threat to privacy only because they are optional. A facial recognition scanner can spy on you in a public space, but Alexa, like a vampire, must be invited into your home. The only truly effective power you can wield over this technology is not to use it. But making an informed choice is compromised by misleading marketing and undermined by Amazon\u2019s efforts to embed Alexa into countless products, including cars, televisions, headphones, microwaves, thermostats and clocks, while signing deals with housebuilding companies and hotel chains, all with an eye to becoming the One Voice. \u201cVoice control is being forced down consumers\u2019 throats whether they like it or not,\u201d says Estes. We are not there yet. Tech companies rely on the myth of technological inevitability to occlude the business decisions they have made and the possibility of other models. To challenge them is to fight the future. Nonsense, says Kavenna. \u201cIs it an inevitable consequence of tech? No, it\u2019s an ideological application of tech. If you build a building, you don\u2019t have to build a panopticon. It doesn\u2019t have to be what we have now. They\u2019ll often claim that if you\u2019re opposed to this, you\u2019re a neo-luddite. That myth has allowed a lot of people to become incredibly rich.\u201d None of the people I spoke to owns a home voice assistant, nor would they advise anyone to get one, but they all agree that it would be possible to develop a device that delivers the most popular services while respecting the user\u2019s privacy. If the entire industry were to follow Apple\u2019s lead in making human monitoring opt-in rather than opt-out, that would be a strong start. Then, as processing power increases, more tasks could be performed inside the device. But, of course, that would mean forfeiting that juicy, monetisable data. \u201cA lot of stuff that you really want to do shouldn\u2019t require the internet, and once you cut off access to the cloud, then the privacy concerns fade away,\u201d says Estes. \u201cThere\u2019s always the potential for things to get better \u2013 and there\u2019s always going to be a fight to get to that point.\u201d Jeremy Gillula is so convinced that a safe, fully user-controlled voice assistant is possible that he is designing his own, using open-source software. \u201cI\u2019m getting there,\u201d he says cheerfully. \u201cI\u2019m not 100% satisfied yet, but it will turn the lights on and off.\u201d",

He was killed as a result, just after Rolando\u2019s birth, and his mother died soon after \u201cfrom the trauma\u201d, he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/27/honduras-central-america-asylum-seekers-us-guatemala-el-salvador\">Trump's plan for those seeking safe haven: a ticket to the violent heart of Central America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He was an orphan at age one: \u201cMy brothers and sisters couldn\u2019t take care of me \u2026 and they gave me to neighbors.\u201d</p> <p>Rolando became homeless and later a frequent target of violence by the people who he believes killed his father. Police tortured him when he sought help. According to his asylum application, that included placing nails in his hand and foot and burning his arms with hot knives.</p> <p>In 2016, while at a soccer game, assailants shot Rolando in the head and left him with a written death threat that referenced his father\u2019s murder. He survived, was forced into hiding and was unable to get medical attention. He said he had to remove the bullet himself. Police later refused to help and assaulted him, according to his file.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anyone left,\u201d he said, adding that fleeing to the US was his only option: \u201cGiving me an opportunity to be here is giving me an opportunity to stay alive.\u201d</p> <p>He escaped to Mexico and joined a caravan last year, eventually making it to Tijuana. Then the waiting began.</p> <p>As part of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/27/trump-refugee-cap-asylum-program\">vast crackdown</a> on migration, the border patrol under Trump has instituted a policy known as \u201cmetering\u201d, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/08/central-american-migrant-caravan-tijuana\">limits the number of people who can apply</a> for asylum each day. In Tijuana, this has led to a waitlist that has more than 10,000 people, with a few dozen allowed to cross daily, creating a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/18/us/mexico-immigration-asylum.html\">wait time of roughly six to nine months</a>, lawyers estimate.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy has also resulted in nearly <a href=\"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/border-baja-california/story/2019-10-01/backlog-of-mexican-asylum-seekers-swells-amid-new-trump-administration-border-policies\">50,000 migrants</a> from Central America being returned to Mexico while their cases move forward. That has translated to overcrowded shelters, tent encampments and a struggle to access medical and legal services.</p> <p>It also leaves migrants like Rolando vulnerable to the same violence they were escaping in their home countries. Rolando said he was beaten in Tijuana, suffering injuries to both his arms and forcing him to wear a cast.</p> <p>In February, he was finally able to enter the US through the San Ysidro port of entry. In his initial processing, authorities took his injured arms \u2013 and placed him in handcuffs.</p> <h2><strong>In detention, in agony and </strong><strong>without treatment</strong></h2> <p>Once he was in custody, Rolando\u2019s health problems worsened. More than 150 pages of Ice\u2019s medical records paint a picture of repeated health crises and his persistent struggle to get help.</p> <p>Rolando regularly was bleeding from his eyes, ears and nose \u2013 the cause of which was unclear to doctors but might have been related to his gunshot wound. Rolando said he was bleeding soon after he was taken into custody and that as a result, he was placed in isolation: \u201cThey said, \u2018We don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s unclear how many days he spent in solitary, but he said he had difficulty getting any treatment while isolated, and that he would spend all day in a small cell with no window to the outside. Staff would pass him meals through a small slat.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know what was night and what was day,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI was sick already, but I was starting to get worse \u2026 Nobody was coming to see me.\u201d</p> <p>Once in the general population of Otay Mesa, Rolando continued to suffer periodic bleeding, and at times his head pain was so severe, he would lose consciousness, or he would lie on the ground so that he would not injure himself if he passed out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5e801b3827c280d7f51cf0e9226717ee42ef5a62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e801b3827c280d7f51cf0e9226717ee42ef5a62/0_0_3128_2500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rolando made bracelets and sold them to other detainees so he could buy instant soup, he recalled.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"799\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rolando made bracelets and sold them to other detainees so he could buy instant soup, he recalled.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Francis Peters/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rolando would frequently sign up for \u201csick call\u201d to visit medical staff, but he said the appointments did little to help. Records show that on one visit, a nurse told him to drink more water and \u201cwash hair/head thoroughly\u201d.</p> <p>Eating the facility\u2019s meats also started to make him sick, but he often struggled to get alternative food options, even though the medical staff said he needed to change his diet. Sometimes he made bracelets and sold them to other detainees so he could buy instant soup, he recalled.</p> <p>The records show that the main form of treatment Rolando received was prescriptions for ibuprofen \u2013 in increasingly high doses as his pain worsened. Sometimes, he said, he ran out of ibuprofen and had difficulty getting a refill. He also received an ointment for his eyes.</p> <p>Anne Rios, his attorney with Al Otro Lado, said she was stunned when she was finally able to get a copy of his medical records: \u201cIt seems unbelievable, almost too absurd to be true, but it\u2019s not only documented, it\u2019s the government\u2019s own records.\u201d</p> <p>By August, Ice had twice refused to release him while his asylum case was pending even after dozens of medical visits, including multiple to the emergency room. One ER doctor had written that he was a \u201cserious patient that presents with significant complexity of risk\u201d, adding that he might have some kind of brain hemorrhage.</p> <p>He had no criminal history or immigration violations.</p> <p>Rolando grew increasingly desperate. At one point, he considered giving up and deporting himself back to Guatemala \u2013 a certain death, Rios said, recalling him telling her on one visit: \u201c\u2018I\u2019m gonna die here or in Guatemala, so I would at least rather go to my home country \u2026 I just can\u2019t take it any more.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>After a third request by Rolando\u2019s attorneys, an Ice officer ruled that he could be released \u2013 but only if he paid a $5,000 bond.</p> <p>\u201cFor many, $5,000 might as well be $5m,\u201d said Rios. \u201cThey come here with nothing, no resources, no family members, absolutely no way to pay for that.\u201d</p> <p>Rolando was only able to get out when Al Otro Lado found a way to cover the amount through its <a href=\"https://alotrolado.networkforgood.com/\">bond fund</a>.</p> <p>Ice declined to comment on Rolando\u2019s case, citing his privacy. A spokeswoman said: \u201ceveryone in our custody receives timely access to medical services and treatment\u201d, including a full health assessment with two weeks of custody, daily sick calls and 24-hour emergency care. A dietician ensures detainees\u2019 \u201cunique health (included allergies), dietary, and religious needs are met\u201d for each meal, and all food \u201cmust be visually appealing, palatable, and taste good\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>A final plea: \u2018I followed the rules and I am telling the truth\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Rolando struggles to understand why the US has treated him like a criminal: \u201cI followed all the rules and I asked for admission.\u201d</p> <p>Trump, however, is working to make the asylum process much more restrictive than what Rolando has experienced. His administration passed a policy in July banning migrants from seeking asylum at the US-Mexico border if they came from another country, saying they must first seek protections elsewhere.</p> <p>The supreme court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/16/us-mexico-border-asylum-ruling-reject\">ruled</a> last month that Trump\u2019s ban could go into effect while legal challenges continued.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bf6637f847b2d9d3685f872b7a1fa5ee8439e49d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf6637f847b2d9d3685f872b7a1fa5ee8439e49d/0_118_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump visits a section of the US-Mexico border wall in Otay Mesa on 18 September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump visits a section of the US-Mexico border wall in Otay Mesa on 18 September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Brenner/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rolando was released in September and is awaiting an asylum hearing scheduled for<strong> </strong>next week.

He was an orphan at age one: \u201cMy brothers and sisters couldn\u2019t take care of me \u2026 and they gave me to neighbors.\u201d Rolando became homeless and later a frequent target of violence by the people who he believes killed his father. Police tortured him when he sought help. According to his asylum application, that included placing nails in his hand and foot and burning his arms with hot knives. In 2016, while at a soccer game, assailants shot Rolando in the head and left him with a written death threat that referenced his father\u2019s murder. He survived, was forced into hiding and was unable to get medical attention. He said he had to remove the bullet himself. Police later refused to help and assaulted him, according to his file. \u201cI don\u2019t have anyone left,\u201d he said, adding that fleeing to the US was his only option: \u201cGiving me an opportunity to be here is giving me an opportunity to stay alive.\u201d He escaped to Mexico and joined a caravan last year, eventually making it to Tijuana. Then the waiting began. As part of a vast crackdown on migration, the border patrol under Trump has instituted a policy known as \u201cmetering\u201d, which limits the number of people who can apply for asylum each day. In Tijuana, this has led to a waitlist that has more than 10,000 people, with a few dozen allowed to cross daily, creating a wait time of roughly six to nine months, lawyers estimate. Trump\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy has also resulted in nearly 50,000 migrants from Central America being returned to Mexico while their cases move forward. That has translated to overcrowded shelters, tent encampments and a struggle to access medical and legal services. It also leaves migrants like Rolando vulnerable to the same violence they were escaping in their home countries. Rolando said he was beaten in Tijuana, suffering injuries to both his arms and forcing him to wear a cast. In February, he was finally able to enter the US through the San Ysidro port of entry. In his initial processing, authorities took his injured arms \u2013 and placed him in handcuffs. In detention, in agony and without treatment Once he was in custody, Rolando\u2019s health problems worsened. More than 150 pages of Ice\u2019s medical records paint a picture of repeated health crises and his persistent struggle to get help. Rolando regularly was bleeding from his eyes, ears and nose \u2013 the cause of which was unclear to doctors but might have been related to his gunshot wound. Rolando said he was bleeding soon after he was taken into custody and that as a result, he was placed in isolation: \u201cThey said, \u2018We don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with you.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s unclear how many days he spent in solitary, but he said he had difficulty getting any treatment while isolated, and that he would spend all day in a small cell with no window to the outside. Staff would pass him meals through a small slat. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know what was night and what was day,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI was sick already, but I was starting to get worse \u2026 Nobody was coming to see me.\u201d Once in the general population of Otay Mesa, Rolando continued to suffer periodic bleeding, and at times his head pain was so severe, he would lose consciousness, or he would lie on the ground so that he would not injure himself if he passed out. Rolando would frequently sign up for \u201csick call\u201d to visit medical staff, but he said the appointments did little to help. Records show that on one visit, a nurse told him to drink more water and \u201cwash hair/head thoroughly\u201d. Eating the facility\u2019s meats also started to make him sick, but he often struggled to get alternative food options, even though the medical staff said he needed to change his diet. Sometimes he made bracelets and sold them to other detainees so he could buy instant soup, he recalled. The records show that the main form of treatment Rolando received was prescriptions for ibuprofen \u2013 in increasingly high doses as his pain worsened. Sometimes, he said, he ran out of ibuprofen and had difficulty getting a refill. He also received an ointment for his eyes. Anne Rios, his attorney with Al Otro Lado, said she was stunned when she was finally able to get a copy of his medical records: \u201cIt seems unbelievable, almost too absurd to be true, but it\u2019s not only documented, it\u2019s the government\u2019s own records.\u201d By August, Ice had twice refused to release him while his asylum case was pending even after dozens of medical visits, including multiple to the emergency room. One ER doctor had written that he was a \u201cserious patient that presents with significant complexity of risk\u201d, adding that he might have some kind of brain hemorrhage. He had no criminal history or immigration violations. Rolando grew increasingly desperate. At one point, he considered giving up and deporting himself back to Guatemala \u2013 a certain death, Rios said, recalling him telling her on one visit: \u201c\u2018I\u2019m gonna die here or in Guatemala, so I would at least rather go to my home country \u2026 I just can\u2019t take it any more.\u2019\u201d After a third request by Rolando\u2019s attorneys, an Ice officer ruled that he could be released \u2013 but only if he paid a $5,000 bond. \u201cFor many, $5,000 might as well be $5m,\u201d said Rios. \u201cThey come here with nothing, no resources, no family members, absolutely no way to pay for that.\u201d Rolando was only able to get out when Al Otro Lado found a way to cover the amount through its bond fund. Ice declined to comment on Rolando\u2019s case, citing his privacy. A spokeswoman said: \u201ceveryone in our custody receives timely access to medical services and treatment\u201d, including a full health assessment with two weeks of custody, daily sick calls and 24-hour emergency care. A dietician ensures detainees\u2019 \u201cunique health (included allergies), dietary, and religious needs are met\u201d for each meal, and all food \u201cmust be visually appealing, palatable, and taste good\u201d. A final plea: \u2018I followed the rules and I am telling the truth\u2019 Rolando struggles to understand why the US has treated him like a criminal: \u201cI followed all the rules and I asked for admission.\u201d Trump, however, is working to make the asylum process much more restrictive than what Rolando has experienced. His administration passed a policy in July banning migrants from seeking asylum at the US-Mexico border if they came from another country, saying they must first seek protections elsewhere. The supreme court ruled last month that Trump\u2019s ban could go into effect while legal challenges continued. Rolando was released in September and is awaiting an asylum hearing scheduled for next week. He said he wanted to speak out because he was particularly upset about the treatment he saw other detainees face at Otay Mesa. Some were disabled and unable to walk to the cafeteria to get food, he said, noting that he got reprimanded when he tried to bring them food. \u201cThey abuse their power with us,\u201d he said. Otay Mesa has repeatedly faced accusations of severe medical neglect. Last week, a detainee died in custody. Rolando said he wanted the government to understand that people seek asylum because they have no other option \u2013 and that officials should believe him: \u201cWhen you\u2019re asking for asylum, you\u2019re swearing to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I am telling the truth.\u201d",

None of them, needless to say, support a no-deal Brexit. Yet the Conservative party, which favoured European union for economic reasons over many decades, has become not only Eurosceptic \u2013 it is set on a course regarded by every reputable capitalist state and the great majority of capitalist enterprises as deeply foolish.</p> <p>If any prime minister in the past had shown such a determined ignorance of the dynamics of global capitalism, the massed ranks of British capital would have stepped in to force a change of direction. Yet today, while the CBI and the Financial Times call for the softest possible Brexit, the Tory party is no longer listening.</p> <p>Why not? One answer is that the Tories now represent the interests of a small section of capitalists who actually fund the party. An extreme version of this argument was floated by the prime minister\u2019s sister, Rachel, and the former chancellor Philip Hammond \u2013 both of whom suggested that hard Brexit is being driven by a corrupt relationship between the prime minister and his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/28/philip-hammond-radical-tory-advisers-want-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">hedge-fund donors</a>, who have shorted the pound and the whole economy. This is very unlikely to be correct, but it may point to a more disconcerting truth.</p> <p>The fact is that the capitalists who do support Brexit tend to be very loosely tied to the British economy. This is true of hedge funds, of course \u2013 but also true for manufacturers such as Sir James Dyson, who no longer produces in the UK. The owners of several Brexiter newspapers are foreign, or tax resident abroad \u2013 as is the pro-Brexit billionaire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/17/brexiter-jim-ratcliffe-uk-richest-man-plans-save-4bn-pounds-tax-monaco-move\" title=\"\">Sir James Ratcliffe of Ineos</a>.</p> <p>But the real story is something much bigger. What is interesting is not so much the connections between capital and the Tory party but their increasing disconnection. Today much of the capital in Britain is not British and not linked to the Conservative party \u2013 where for most of the 20th century things looked very different. Once, great capitalists with national, imperial and global interests sat in the Commons and the Lords as Liberals or Conservatives. Between the wars, the Conservatives emerged as the one party of capital, led by great British manufacturers such as Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain. The Commons and the Lords were soon fuller than ever of Tory businessmen, from the owner of Meccano toys to that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/02/legacy-one-family-cup-of-tea-company-that-took-on-world-by-thomas-harding-review\" title=\"\">Lyons Corner Houses</a>.</p> <p>After the second world war, such captains of industry avoided the Commons, but the Conservative party was without question the party of capital and property, one which stood against the party of organised labour. Furthermore, the Tories represented an increasingly national capitalism, protected by import controls, and closely tied to an interventionist and technocratic state that wanted to increase exports of British designed and made goods. A company like Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) saw itself, and indeed was, a national champion. British industry, public and private, was a national enterprise.</p> <p>Since the 1970s things have changed radically. Today there is no such thing as British national capitalism. London is a place where world capitalism does business \u2013 no longer one where British capitalism does the world\u2019s business. Everywhere in the UK there are foreign-owned enterprises, many of them nationalised industries, building nuclear reactors and running train services from overseas. When the car industry speaks, it is not as British industry but as foreign enterprise in the UK. The same is true of many of the major manufacturing sectors \u2013 from civil aircraft to electrical engineering \u2013 and of infrastructure. Whatever the interests of foreign capital, they are not expressed through a national political party. Most of these foreign-owned businesses, not surprisingly, are hostile to Brexit.</p> <p>Brexit is the political project of the hard right within the Conservative party, and not its capitalist backers. In fact, these forces were able to take over the party in part because it was no longer stabilised by a powerful organic connection to capital, either nationally or locally.</p> <p>Brexit also speaks to the weakness of the state, which was itself once tied to the governing party \u2013 and particularly the Conservatives.

      "bodyText": "Who backs Brexit? Agriculture is against it; industry is against it; services are against it. None of them, needless to say, support a no-deal Brexit. Yet the Conservative party, which favoured European union for economic reasons over many decades, has become not only Eurosceptic \u2013 it is set on a course regarded by every reputable capitalist state and the great majority of capitalist enterprises as deeply foolish. If any prime minister in the past had shown such a determined ignorance of the dynamics of global capitalism, the massed ranks of British capital would have stepped in to force a change of direction. Yet today, while the CBI and the Financial Times call for the softest possible Brexit, the Tory party is no longer listening. Why not? One answer is that the Tories now represent the interests of a small section of capitalists who actually fund the party. An extreme version of this argument was floated by the prime minister\u2019s sister, Rachel, and the former chancellor Philip Hammond \u2013 both of whom suggested that hard Brexit is being driven by a corrupt relationship between the prime minister and his hedge-fund donors, who have shorted the pound and the whole economy. This is very unlikely to be correct, but it may point to a more disconcerting truth. The fact is that the capitalists who do support Brexit tend to be very loosely tied to the British economy. This is true of hedge funds, of course \u2013 but also true for manufacturers such as Sir James Dyson, who no longer produces in the UK. The owners of several Brexiter newspapers are foreign, or tax resident abroad \u2013 as is the pro-Brexit billionaire Sir James Ratcliffe of Ineos. But the real story is something much bigger. What is interesting is not so much the connections between capital and the Tory party but their increasing disconnection. Today much of the capital in Britain is not British and not linked to the Conservative party \u2013 where for most of the 20th century things looked very different. Once, great capitalists with national, imperial and global interests sat in the Commons and the Lords as Liberals or Conservatives. Between the wars, the Conservatives emerged as the one party of capital, led by great British manufacturers such as Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain. The Commons and the Lords were soon fuller than ever of Tory businessmen, from the owner of Meccano toys to that of Lyons Corner Houses. After the second world war, such captains of industry avoided the Commons, but the Conservative party was without question the party of capital and property, one which stood against the party of organised labour. Furthermore, the Tories represented an increasingly national capitalism, protected by import controls, and closely tied to an interventionist and technocratic state that wanted to increase exports of British designed and made goods. A company like Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) saw itself, and indeed was, a national champion. British industry, public and private, was a national enterprise. Since the 1970s things have changed radically. Today there is no such thing as British national capitalism. London is a place where world capitalism does business \u2013 no longer one where British capitalism does the world\u2019s business. Everywhere in the UK there are foreign-owned enterprises, many of them nationalised industries, building nuclear reactors and running train services from overseas. When the car industry speaks, it is not as British industry but as foreign enterprise in the UK. The same is true of many of the major manufacturing sectors \u2013 from civil aircraft to electrical engineering \u2013 and of infrastructure. Whatever the interests of foreign capital, they are not expressed through a national political party. Most of these foreign-owned businesses, not surprisingly, are hostile to Brexit. Brexit is the political project of the hard right within the Conservative party, and not its capitalist backers. In fact, these forces were able to take over the party in part because it was no longer stabilised by a powerful organic connection to capital, either nationally or locally. Brexit also speaks to the weakness of the state, which was itself once tied to the governing party \u2013 and particularly the Conservatives. The British state once had the capacity to change the United Kingdom and its relations to the rest of the world radically and quickly, as happened in the second world war, and indeed on accession to the common market. Today the process from referendum to implementation will take, if it happens, nearly as long as the whole second world war. The modern British state has distanced itself from the productive economy and is barely able to take an expert view of the complexities of modern capitalism. This was painfully clear in the Brexit impact sectoral reports the government was forced to publish \u2013 they were internet cut-and-paste jobs. The state can no longer undertake the radical planning and intervention that might make Brexit work. That would require not only an expert state, but one closely aligned with business. The preparations would by now be very visible at both technical and political levels. But we have none of that. Instead we have the suggestion that nothing much will happen on no deal, that mini-deals will appear. The real hope of the Brexiters is surely that the EU will cave and carry on trading with the UK as if nothing had changed. Brexit is a promise without a plan. But in the real world Brexit does mean Brexit, and no deal means no deal. Brexit is a necessary crisis, and has provided a long overdue audit of British realities.

It brings to light, in stunning clarity, Brexiters\u2019 deluded political understanding of the UK\u2019s place in the world.

      "bodyText": "Chinese billionaire Huang Xiangmo gave a wine box full of $35,000 cash to then New South Wales Labor boss Jamie Clements to help him cover legal bills to fight allegations of sexual harassment, an inquiry has heard. The explosive revelations were made during Clements\u2019 evidence to the independent commission against corruption, which is investigating whether Huang, a banned donor, gave $100,000 cash to the Labor party. In 2015, Clements was facing allegations he tried to kiss a 27-year-old Labor staffer in a parliament house office. The inquiry heard that Huang, then chairman of a group linked to the Chinese Communist Party, invited Clements to his home in Mosman in August 2015. He took him upstairs to a room he had not previously been in. He then gave Clements $35,000 in cash to help pay his legal bills for an apprehended violence order sought by the complainant in the sexual harassment matter, the inquiry heard. The cash was in a wine box, stacked full of $100 notes. \u201cHe had a wine box and he opened it, there was cash in it and he had a piece of paper hand written in English that said \u2018for your legal fees\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cHe closed the box, screwed the piece of paper up and we walked down and had a cup of tea.\u201d Asked whether he was surprised at being given the money, Clements responded: \u201cWell he paid Sam [Dastyari\u2019s] legal fees, so I suppose I wasn\u2019t.\u201d Dastyari\u2019s acceptance of money from Huang prompted a significant scandal, and his interactions with Huang eventually led to his political downfall. Icac has now spent almost seven weeks investigating whether Huang gave Labor $100,000 cash in an Aldi shopping bag in 2015. It has been alleged Huang\u2019s donation was masked using a series of straw donors who falsely claimed to have given money during a 2015 state election fundraising dinner attended by then federal Labor leader, Bill Shorten, and his NSW counterpart, Luke Foley. Clements told Icac that the first he heard about the $100,000 donation was in 2017. He said Ernest Wong, a Labor upper house member who helped organise the dinner, contacted him via WhatsApp in July 2017, arranging to meet at a Starbucks in Sydney. \u201cHe said \u2018there\u2019s an electoral commission investigation going on into a Chinese Friends of Labor dinner from 2015\u2019 and I remember thinking \u2018oh yeah, so?\u2019\u201d Clements recalled. \u201cI must have shrugged my shoulders.\u201d The inquiry heard that Wong informed Clements that his name had come up in the investigation, telling him Labor official Kenrick Cheah had alleged that Clements had received a bag full of cash from Huang and asked him to count it. Clements recalled his response upon hearing the news was: \u201cWhy the fuck would Kenrick say that?\u201d \u201cI was just blown away. I\u2019m sitting there thinking could this have happened and I\u2019ve forgotten about it?\u201d Earlier, Clements told the commission he had delegated much of the responsibility for state campaign fundraising to his then assistant general secretary, Kaila Murnain. The inquiry heard the pair had an acrimonious relationship. \u201cShe hates my guts, I don\u2019t know if I hate her,\u201d Clements said. Despite that, Clements said, Murnain was \u201chighly capable\u201d and he trusted her to handle fundraising without him micromanaging her or interfering unless a specific problem arose. \u201cI had the faith in her to get it done,\u201d he said. That prompted allegations from counsel assisting the inquiry, Scott Robertson, that Clements was minimising his role in fundraising because he knew it was the subject of the Icac investigation. \u201cYou are deliberately seeking to distance yourself from fundraising matters because you know they are of interest to this commission,\u201d Robertson said. Clements replied: \u201cNo, I am answering questions honestly.\u201d On Tuesday, the commission heard evidence that Clements had worked for Huang after resigning from the NSW Labor party in 2016. A former employee of Huang, Tim Xu, said Clements had been paid a retainer of about $200,000 to \u201coffer him advice on building relationship with government or politicians\u201d. The retainer was paid in roughly $10,000 monthly instalments, Xu said. \u201cTo my memory Mr Clements expressed his needs and Mr Huang agreed to, to help him out financially and, and take his service.\u201d At the hearing on Wednesday, Clements put the amount at $4,000 a week. He said he helped Huang with tasks as they arose. Clements said he helped Huang settle a strike at a Gold Coast property development, for example. He said he also helped him strategise to deal with bad press. Clements told the inquiry that the arrangement eventually ceased when Huang had his permanent residency denied in 2019. \u201cHe was worried that Asio or whoever it was that was cracking down, were going to target Yuhu,\u201d Clements said. The commission heard that Clements used a suite belonging to Huang to run the consultancy, and paid no rent to Huang. The office was also on the same floor as the Australian Council for the Promotion of the Peaceful Reunification of China, which Icac heard was a front organisation for the Chinese Communist party. Huang has denied making the $100,00 donation but has refused to appear at Icac, despite repeated invitations. Huang, one of Australia\u2019s biggest political donors, was blocked from re-entering Australia earlier this year. He was previously a chairman of the reunification council. The inquiry has already claimed the scalp of Murnain, who succeeded Clements as general secretary in 2016. Murnain resigned in August after conceding she had become aware of Huang\u2019s donation in 2016, but repeatedly failed to act. Murnain said she had sought advice from the party\u2019s lawyer, who allegedly told her to keep quiet about the donation. The inquiry continues before chief commissioner Peter Hall. At the cessation of Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Clements handed over a series of text messages, including an exchange between him and a senior member of Shorten\u2019s staff.",

      "bodyText": "The Queensland government has announced it will rush consultation on controversial proposed laws to crack down on acts of civil disobedience by climate change protesters. The announcement comes amid rolling acts of disruption in Brisbane by members of Extinction Rebellion and has been met with concern from legal and environmental groups, who say the proposals infringe on people\u2019s basic civil liberties. The proposed laws give police search and seizure powers where they reasonably suspect people are carrying locking devices, which are designed to prevent or delay the removal of protesters from public spaces. They also introduce new fines for the use of such devices. When the laws were announced in August, the state government made claims \u2013 but has offered no evidence to support them \u2013 that activists were using devices \u201claced with booby traps\u201d and \u201cdesigned to harm\u201d. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, and the police minister, Mark Ryan, on Wednesday cited two recent actions by Extinction Rebellion protesters they believed were dangerous and put people in harm\u2019s way. The include a man who chained himself to a railway on Wednesday morning and a man who dangled for several hours from the Story Bridge over the Brisbane River on Tuesday. The man who hung suspended from the bridge reportedly said afterwards that it would be \u201cdangerous for the police to come and rescue me\u201d. Ryan could not tell reporters whether the unique apparatus used by the protesters in each case would be covered by the new laws. Palaszczuk said the state was seeing \u201cmajor disruption\u201d from the civil disobedience of climate activists. \u201cThe use of these dangerous devices is not acceptable,\u201d she said. \u201cMy government will be asking (for) the hearings on these laws to take place as soon as possible.

The state\u2019s approach is under heavy scrutiny because of its position on new thermal coal mines and its pivot in support of the coal industry after the federal election. Public submissions to the state parliament\u2019s legal affairs committee on the new laws closed at midday on Tuesday and hearings had been scheduled for later this month. It is likely the hearings will now take place quickly next week, alongside a sitting of parliament, and passed before 24 October. The committee has not yet published public submissions, but several groups have released theirs. The Caxton Legal Centre said the state had not properly explained why the laws were needed. \u201cUntil clear and compelling evidence of the justification for these new laws is made public we believe that the proposed amendments should not proceed,\u201d said Bridget Burton, the director of the Caxton Legal Centre\u2019s human rights and civil law practice. \u201cThe proposed laws will extend police search powers and increase the penalties for breaches of the peace to up to two years imprisonment if introduced. \u201cBy privileging powerful institutional interests over the human rights of individuals (the proposal does not achieve) the right balance in a society ostensibly based on freedom, democracy and respect for the dignity of all people.\u201d The Human Rights Law Centre said the laws infringe on Queenslanders\u2019 human rights. Alice Drury, a lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre, said criminal laws must be based on evidence. \u201cThe public is entitled to have all the facts when a government proposes a new law that undermines their democratic rights,\u201d Drury said. \u201cPoliticians should resist the knee-jerk response of criminalising conduct because it\u2019s frustrating, and recommit to facilitating peaceful protest for the health of our democracy.\u201d The Queensland Greens MP, Michael Berkman, said the short-cutting of the committee process was a \u201cdisgusting betrayal of our democracy\u201d. \u201c(Major political parties) keep taking massive donations from big fossil fuel.

Fitzgibbon, who suffered a significant swing against him in his coalmining seat in the Hunter Valley in the May election, used a speech on Wednesday to argue the ALP should offer \u201ca political and policy settlement\u201d on climate policy \u201cto make 28% the target by 2030\u201d. The Morrison government\u2019s 2030 target is a 26%-28% reduction on 2005 levels by 2030. Labor at the last election proposed an emissions reduction target of 45%. Fitzgibbon told the Sydney Institute Labor had suffered too much political damage attempting to be ambitious on climate policy. \u201cLabor needs to reach a sensible settlement on climate change,\u201d the shadow resources minister said. \u201cHow many times are we going to let it kill us? Indeed, how many leaders do we want to lose to it?\u201d But Butler told Guardian Australia Labor would not adopt Fitzgibbon\u2019s proposal. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said a number of times since the election, we remain committed to implementing the principles of the Paris agreement, which are to keep global warming well below 2C and pursue efforts around 1.5C,\u201d the shadow climate change minister said. \u201cWe will have a mid-century target of zero emissions and medium-term targets which are consistent with the agreement \u2013 and the government\u2019s target, which was developed by Tony Abbott with no expert advice, is fundamentally inconsistent with the Paris agreement. \u201cIt would lead to global warming of more than 3C and, for that reason, Labor cannot support that target. \u201cThat has been a consistent position of ours since we first took advice about what Tony Abbott\u2019s target would mean for climate change.\u201d Butler has argued that all of Labor\u2019s policies need to be up for review after the election defeat in May, including the climate policies he developed over the last parliamentary term. At a recent event in Canberra, Butler declared that after a federal election where Labor had its \u201cbackside handed to [it] by Fozzie Bear and Kermit the Frog \u2013 it\u2019s time for some serious reflection\u201d. But on Wednesday he said Labor needed to continue championing climate policies that were consistent with the scientific advice. \u201cWe will support medium-term targets that are consistent with the Paris agreement and based on the best available advice we can get,\u201d Butler said. \u201cLabor\u2019s position [prior to the election] was based on advice from the Climate Change Authority, the body set up by the parliament to advise on these things. The government\u2019s target was dreamed up by Tony Abbott.\u201d Senior Labor players are jostling for position ahead of a review spearheaded by Jay Weatherill and Craig Emerson to establish what went wrong during the election and in the lead-up to the contest. This week, the former Labor leader Bill Shorten accepted a \u201ccollective\u201d responsibility for the defeat and pointed to Labor\u2019s franking credits policy as a particular problem. Despite Butler\u2019s efforts to hold the line, there is a view within the New South Wales right, the faction of which Fitzgibbon is a member, that Labor needs to seek a position of bipartisanship with the government to build support in regional NSW and Queensland, which swung to the Coalition in May.

But while campaign groups have come and gone, it\u2019s business as usual for Daniel Hooper, the veteran eco-warrior known as Swampy who says the latest protests give him \u201chope\u201d. Hooper became a national figure after living underground for a week in a tunnel protesting against the rerouting of the A30 in Devon in the 1990s. Hooper, who now lives in West Wales, was also involved in a series of high-profile environmental campaigns, also targeting the M11 Newbury bypass and Manchester airport. But after being out of the headlines for years he was in court on Tuesday charged with obstructing traffic in a blockade of an oil refinery in Wales. He told ITV News: \u201cMy beliefs are the same as they always were and I did have a quiet 10 years, almost to the point where you have apathy towards how we can change things, then Extinction Rebellion started happening. \u201cYou think there is hope and I believe there is hope and now everyone needs to think about what we are doing, governments needs to change, companies need to change. \u201cWe need people\u2019s assembly to decide what to do, this is a state of emergency.\u201d Hooper, who is 46, had earlier been fined \u00a340 and ordered to pay \u00a385 costs and a \u00a332 surcharge after appearing before magistrates in Haverfordwest. He pleaded guilty to wilful obstruction of a highway after blocking a road to the Valero Pembroke refinery during a protest last month. Hooper was one of many of a new generation of environmental protesters to emerge in the 90s. Rather than the climate crisis focus of the current generation, their campaigns targeted what they saw as unnecessary development, especially of roads. Hooper rose to to prominence during the A30 protests but the clashes between activists and police over the building of the Newbury bypass in 1996, which required the destruction of 10,000 mature trees, ensured that their concerns cemented the place of environmental issues on the national political agenda.",

Many protestors who challenged their bail conditions in court had them removed. \u201cIt\u2019s not only unusual, but it is very clearly politically motivated,\u201d he said. An arrested protester, Lily Campbell, said she was held for 27 hours, and refused food for 17 hours, as the police tried to convince her to sign the bail conditions. She also alleged wardens made veiled threats of violence. \u201cThe warden in the jail that I was sent to called us \u2018fuckwits\u2019 and said that if his children did this, he would beat them.\u201d \u201cThe magistrate has now released me with no bail conditions whatsoever, because I have been arrested and charged with a minor charge of refusing to comply with a police instruction.\u201d In arrest documents, NSW police determined that protesters \u201cif released from custody, will endanger the safety of victims, individuals or the community [and] interfere with witnesses or evidence\u201d. On Wednesday, Ludlam told Guardian Australia that if the government wanted to stop climate protesters, they should take action on policy. \u201cThe people [arrested] are very well aware that if you are disrupting traffic that will invoke a police response. People are not surprised to hear these are arrestable offences. \u201cThe question really is, if the government wants us to stop \u2013 whether that is the school kids or people doing banner drops \u2013 they have a very simple and clear path to do that. \u201cNobody is doing this for fun. We are doing it for a purpose, and that is for the government to snap out of it.\u201d Ludlam said he had applied to have two of his bail conditions struck out, which would be heard by a judge tomorrow. Also on Wednesday on Channel 10\u2019s Studio 10 program, TV host Kerri-Anne Kennerley called for Extinction Rebellion protesters to be \u201cused as speed bumps\u201d. \u201cThe guy hanging from the Story Bridge [in Brisbane]. Why send emergency services?\u201d she said. \u201cNobody should do anything, and you just put little witches\u2019 hats around them, or use them as a speed bump. \u201cPut them in jail, forget to feed them.\u201d She later said she was joking. In July, Queensland police were criticised for bail conditions they gave to four French journalists, which banned them from going within 20km of the Adani Carmichael coalmine. Last week, the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said disruptive Extinction Rebellion protesters should have their welfare cut, face mandatory jail sentences and that \u201cpeople should take these names, and the photos of these people, and distribute them as far and wide as we can so that we shame these people\u201d. Wright said this had influenced the harsh treatment of protesters. \u201cI think NSW police have drunk the government Kool-Aid in that rhetoric,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere there is a legitimate political issue such as seeking action on climate change, protesters shouldn\u2019t be seen to be forfeiting their democratic rights including freedom of association, freedom of movement and the implied right to freedom of political expression.\u201d In 2017, Tasmania lost a high court case that found some environmental protests are protected under the constitutional implied freedom of political communication. In that case, Greens founder Bob Brown had been arrested while filming an anti-logging video, and the court found the state\u2019s anti-protest laws went too far. NSW police told Guardian Australia: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on individual bail conditions.\u201d",

<p>Good morning, live blog readers!</p> \n  <p>House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry is firing at all cylinders, despite the <strong>Trump administration</strong>\u2019s many efforts to slow it down. Most recently, the White House has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/us/politics/sondland-trump-ukraine-impeach.html\">blocked</a> <strong>Gordon Sondland</strong>, the US ambassador to the EU and a key witness in the Ukraine controversy, from appearing for a deposition.</p> \n  <p>The decision to block Sondland\u2019s testimony could carry grave consequences for <strong>Donald Trump, </strong>given the House committees\u2019 repeated warnings in letters subpoenaing senior officials that any failure to produce requested documents \u201cshall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry\u201d.</p> \n  <p>But the White House\u2019s efforts to block the inquiry cannot stem the shifting tide of public opinion. According to a new Washington Post-Schar School <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/poll-majority-of-americans-say-they-endorse-opening-of-house-impeachment-inquiry-of-trump/2019/10/07/be9e0af6-e936-11e9-85c0-85a098e47b37_story.html\">poll</a>, 58% of Americans support House Democrats\u2019 decision to launch a formal impeachment inquiry. Nearly half of Americans \u2013 49% \u2013 back the more severe step of removing Trump from office.</p> \n  <p>The president is, as usual, taking all of this very much in stride by tweeting out a blustery defense of his widely criticized decision to clear the way for a Turkish military operation against America\u2019s Kurdish allies. But his defensive tweet underscores the deep trouble Trump is in as he faces potentially career-ending controversies on every front.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1181547333990916097\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.....good health, at my request, Pastor Brunson, who had many years of a long prison term remaining.

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues on Wednesday\u2019s blog: Here\u2019s a recap of today: The White House will not comply with the House democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. In a letter to House leaders, the White House called the impeachment investigation a partisan effort \u201cto overturn the results of the 2016 election\u201d. The letter, signed by White House counsel Pat Cipollone echoed Trump talking points accusing House intelligence committee chair Adam Schiff of colluding with the whistleblower against the president. House Democrats have subpoenaed Gordon Sondland after the Trump administration blocked the US ambassador to the EU from testifying for the impeachment inquiry. \u201cIn light of Secretary Pompeo\u2019s direct intervention to block your appearance before our Committees, we are left with no choice but to compel your appearance at a deposition,\u201d the House democrats\u2019 subpoena reads. A White House official who listened to Trump\u2019s July call with the Ukrainian president described it as \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cfrightening,\u201d the whistleblower memo. Two new polls show that a majority of Americans now support the impeachment inquiry. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo has announced visa restrictions on Chinese officials suspected of being involved in \u201ca highly repressive campaign against Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other members of Muslim minority groups in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang).\u201d Earlier today, the US commerce department issued a list of 28 state security bureaus and tech companies in China that it said are being used to suppress muslims and other ethnic minorities. Pompeo\u2019s statement condemns \u201cmass detentions in internment camps; pervasive, high-tech surveillance; draconian controls on expressions of cultural and religious identities\u201d in China. These actions come days before the US and China are scheduled to resume trade negotiations in Washington. The White House letter also says that \u201cChairman Schiff\u2019s office, and perhaps others \u2014 despite initial denials \u2014 were involved in advising the whistleblower before the complaint was filed\u201d. This is highly misleading. The New York Times first reported that Schiff had learned about the whistleblower complaint before it was filed -- after the CIA officer who made the complaint approached a House Intelligence committee aide for advice on how to proceed with concerns over Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukranian president Zelenskiy. The Washington Post confirmed the Times\u2019 reporting. When asked by MSNBC in September whether he had spoken to the whistleblower, Schiff said: \u201cWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower.\u201d While one can debate the meaning and significance of the word \u201cdirectly\u201d it\u2019s fair to criticize Schiff for mischaracterizing the situation. But that doesn\u2019t mean that Schiff or any other House democrat helped shape the complaint, as Trump and his allies have claimed. Politifact explains: Schiff did receive some information about the whistleblower complaint before it was formally presented to Congress. But both the House Intelligence Committee and a lawyer representing the whistleblower told us the complaint was drafted independently of Schiff\u2019s input, and we could find no evidence to the contrary. At the same time, Trump and Republicans have produced no evidence to suggest Schiff had helped draft or shape the complaint. The White House letter in response to the impeachment inquiry, which almost verbatim repeated Trump talking points, contains several inaccuracies. More than once, the letter claims that Trump\u2019s call with Ukranian president Zelenskiy was \u201ccompletely appropriate\u201d and that representative Adam Schiff of created \u201ca false version of the call and read it to the American people\u201d. \u201cAfter the actual record of the call was released, Chairman Schiff chose to concoct a false version of the call and to read his made-up transcript to the American people at a public hearing,\u201d it reads. Fact check: During a House Intelligence Committee hearing, Schiff said he would outline \u201cthe essence of what the president communicates\u201d not an \u201cexact transcribed version of the call\u201d. In any case, the rough transcript released by the White House detailing the phone call cautions explicitly that it is \u201cnot a verbatim transcript\u201d. Bernie Sanders\u2019 daughter-in-law has died Raine Riggs, a neuropsychologist who was married to Levi Sanders, died Saturday, shortly after Bernie Sanders returned to Vermont after suffering a heart attack. Riggs, 46, had recently been diagnosed with cancer, according to her obituary. She was the director of behavioral medicine at Dartmouth Medical School and she started the Palliative Care Department for Dartmouth Medical Center. After Donald Trump said he prevented the US ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, from testifying before congress, House democrats have issued a subpoena. \u201cIn light of Secretary Pompeo\u2019s direct intervention to block your appearance before our Committees, we are left with no choice but to compel your appearance at a deposition,\u201d the House democrats\u2019 subpoena reads. They are also subpoenaed Sondland for documents that are relevant to the Ukraine controversy. It\u2019s unclear what, if anything, could convince the White House to cooperate with the House democrats\u2019 investigations. \u201cThe President has done nothing wrong, and the Democrats know it,\u201d the White House press secretary said in a statement, echoing the White House counsel\u2019s letter to House democrats. The impeachment inquiry \u201cviolates the Constitution, the rule of law, and every past precedent\u201d, the statement reads. The constitution permits Congress to impeach a president if enough lawmakers vote to say that the president has committed \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d The White House has sent an eight-page letter to speaker Nancy Pelosi and the House democrats pursuing an impeachment inquiry. \u201cAs you know, you have designed and implemented your inquiry in a manner that violates fundamental fairness and constitutionally mandated due process,\u201d the letter reads, addressing Pelosi, Adam Schiff, Eliot Engel and Elijah Cummings \u2014 the democratic representatives leading the impeachment investigation. Signed by White House counsel Pat Cipollone, the letter accuses democrats of seeking to \u201coverturn the results of the 2016 election and deprive the American people of the president they have freely chosen\u201d. The letter stopped short of demanding that Pelosi call a vote on the impeachment inquiry, instead calling on House democrats to \u201cabandon the current invalid efforts to pursue an impeachment inquiry\u201d. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: House Democrats intend to subpoena Gordon Sondland after the Trump administration blocked the US ambassador to the EU from testifying for the impeachment inquiry. A White House official who listened to the call between Trump and the Ukrainian president described it as \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cfrightening,\u201d according to a memo reportedly written by the whistleblower. The Senate judiciary committee has invited Rudy Giuliani to come speak before the panel, but the president\u2019s personal lawyer said he did not intend to comply with a subpoena from the House intelligence committee. Two newly released polls showed that a majority of Americans support the impeachment inquiry, with one poll putting the figure at 58 percent and another at 53 percent. The Senate intelligence committee released its bipartisan report on Russian operatives\u2019 use of social media to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. Like the intelligence community, the committee concluded that the Kremlin meddled in the race to benefit Trump and hinder Hillary Clinton\u2019s bid. Maanvi will have more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. The White House is expected to issue a letter today effectively declaring war on House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, per a New York Times reporter. Rudy Giuliani alluded to such a letter earlier today when he said he would not comply with a subpoena from House Democrats. The president\u2019s personal lawyer told the Washington Post that he expected the White House to soon issue a letter arguing the committees are illegitimate. The Quinnipiac poll also found that Elizabeth Warren is slightly ahead of Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential primary. According to Quinnipiac, Warren attracts the support of 29 percent of Democratic voters across the country, compared to Biden\u2019s 26 percent. Bernie Sanders is the only other candidate with a double-digit level of support, receiving the backing of 16 percent of Democrats. With the latest results, Warren is just barely ahead of Biden in the RealClearPolitics national polling average of the race. The Quinnipiac poll on impeachment shows Republicans are clearly opposed to the impeachment inquiry against Trump, contradicting the results of the Washington Post-Schar School poll released earlier today. According to Quinnipiac, 88 percent of Republicans consider House Democrats\u2019 inquiry to be a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d compared to just 8 percent who view it as a legitimate investigation. In comparison, the Post poll found that almost 3 in 10 Republicans supported the impeachment inquiry, with almost a fifth of Republicans saying they would back removing Trump from office. The whistleblower who raised concerns about Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president wrote in a memo that a White House official described the conversation as \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cfrightening.\u201d ABC News reports: ABC News has learned that the two-page memo, written by the whistleblower a day after Trump\u2019s call, suggests that at least one close aide to the president feared that Trump\u2019s own words in the call were damning. ... The notes were based on a brief conversation between the whistleblower and the White House official and described \u2018highlights\u2019 from the president\u2019s call. The document was later provided to the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, who reviewed the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. Tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang has now qualified for the November debate thanks to a national Quinnipiac poll showing him attracting the support of 3 percent of Democratic voters. Yang is the eighth Democratic candidate to qualify for the November debate \u2013 joining Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Tom Steyer. But what\u2019s perhaps even more notable about the poll is that it shows Yang either tied with or pulling ahead of more establishment candidates like Harris, Booker and Beto O\u2019Rourke. Hillary Clinton responded to Trump\u2019s attempt to resurrect the issue of her private email server by joking that he should not \u201ctempt\u201d her to run for president again. The former secretary of state and presidential candidate has already voiced support for House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry and has previously mocked Trump as a \u201ccorrupt human tornado.\u201d The White House is reaching out to external lawyers to discuss helping with the impeachment response, CNN reports. According to CNN, one of the lawyers the White House has contacted is Trey Gowdy, the former Republican congressman who gained nationwide attention for his investigation into the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya. It was that investigation that first uncovered evidence of Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server, which Trump used to repeatedly attack the former secretary of state during the 2016 presidential campaign. The Supreme Court heard arguments today in a case meant to determine whether the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects LGBT people from discrimination in employment based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. The AP reports: With the court\u2019s four liberal justices likely to side with workers who were fired because of their sexual orientation or transgender status, the question in two highly anticipated cases that filled the courtroom was whether one of the court\u2019s conservatives might join them. Justice Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump\u2019s first Supreme Court appointee, said there are strong arguments favoring the LGBT workers. But he wondered whether the justices should take into account \u2018the massive social upheaval\u2019 that might follow a ruling in their favor. Two other conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh did not squarely indicate their views, although Roberts also questioned how employers with religious objections to hiring LGBT people might be affected by the outcome. Bernie Sanders addressed his recent heart attack, telling reporters in Vermont that he was \u201cdumb\u201d to ignore symptoms over the past two months as he campaigned for the Democratic presidential nomination. The heart attack, which Sanders did not disclose for almost three days, has raised questions about whether the Vermont senator will continue with his presidential bid. But so far, Sanders has shown no sign of calling it quits, telling staffers in a phone call he would use the experience to emphasize the principles of his candidacy. Almost immediately after Trump concluded his call with the Ukrainian president, White House aides rushed to contain the potential damage of his comments, according to CNN. CNN reports: The scramble and fallout from the call, described by six people familiar with it, parallels and expands upon details described in the whistleblower complaint. The anxiety and internal concern reflect a phone conversation that deeply troubled national security professionals, even as Trump now insists there was nothing wrong with how he conducted himself. And it shows an ultimately unsuccessful effort to contain the tumult by the administration\u2019s lawyers. At least one National Security Council official alerted the White House\u2019s national security lawyers about the concerns, three sources familiar with the matter said, a detail that had not been previously disclosed. Those same lawyers would later order the transcript of the call moved to a highly classified server typically reserved for code-word classified material. Rudy Giuliani said that he would not comply with a subpoena from the House intelligence committee. The president\u2019s personal lawyer added that he \u201ccan\u2019t imagine\u201d other Trump administration officials would do so either. \u201cThe position I\u2019m stating is now the position of the administration,\u201d Giuliani told the Washington Post, claiming that the White House has written a letter asserting the congressional committee is illegitimate. Giuliani said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t testify in front of that committee until there is a vote of Congress and [chairman Adam Schiff] is removed. ... \u201cLet them hold me in contempt. We\u2019ll go to court. We\u2019ll challenge the contempt.\u201d Giuliani was initially given until Oct. 15 to hand over materials relevant to the impeachment inquiry. If he does not comply, Democrats will likely argue that it is further evidence of obstruction by the Trump White House. Representative Mark Pocan, a Democrat of Wisconsin and a co-chair of the progressive caucus, is now suggesting that whoever decided to block the testimony of Gordon Sondland should have their salary suspended. Sondland said that the State Department had \u201cdirected\u201d him not to appear before Congress, but Trump appeared to take responsibility for the decision in a morning tweet. Of course, Trump has donated his government salary every quarter since taking office, so Pocan\u2019s suggestion may not carry the same weight with him. The Senate intelligence committee also interestingly concluded that African Americans were targeted by Russian trolls more than any other demographic in the 2016 election. The panel\u2019s bipartisan report reads: \u201cThe Committee found that no single group of Americans was targeted by IRA information operatives more than African-Americans. By far, race and related issues were the preferred target of the information warfare campaign designed to divide the country in 2016.\u201d And the committee noted that the Kremlin actually escalated its disinformation campaign after the 2016 election concluded. The report says: \u201cThe data reveal increases in IRA activity across multiple social media platforms, post-Election Day 2016: Instagram activity increased 238 percent, Facebook increased 59 percent, Twitter increased 52 percent, and YouTube citations went up by 84 percent.\u201d The Senate intelligence committee has released its bipartisan report on Russia\u2019s use of social media to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, which concludes that the Kremlin sought to help Trump\u2019s campaign by spreading disinformation. The report reads: \u201cThe Committee found, that the IRA sought to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election by harming Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances of success and supporting Donald Trump at the direction of the Kremlin.\u201d The committee also concluded that Russian operatives similarly targeted Republican presidential candidates, including Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush. The lawmakers recommended that \u201csocial media companies work to facilitate greater information sharing between the public and private sector\u201d and specifically called on the Executive Branch to \u201creinforce with the public the danger of attempted foreign interference in the 2020 election.\u201d That last point implicitly criticizes the president, who has repeatedly cast doubt on the intelligence community\u2019s finding that Russia meddled in the 2016 election to Trump\u2019s benefit. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The White House has blocked Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, from testifying before three House committees leading the impeachment inquiry. House Democratic leaders have now said they will subpoena Sondland for his testimony and documents that are relevant to the Ukraine controversy. The Senate judiciary committee has invited Rudy Giuliani to appear before the panel, but it\u2019s unclear whether the president\u2019s personal lawyer will accept the offer. A new poll found that nearly 6 in 10 Americans now support House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, and almost half of the country backs removing Trump from office. The blog will have more of the latest impeachment news, so stay tuned. Meanwhile, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang hopes he will get his fourth qualifying poll today to participate in the November debate. Seven Democratic presidential candidates have qualified for the debate so far: Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Tom Steyer. No other candidate is close to qualifying, with Beto O\u2019Rourke and Amy Klobuchar both still needing three more polls to make the cut. It\u2019s quite possible the November event will feature a significantly smaller field of candidates than the October debate, which is taking place in Ohio next week. Twelve candidates have qualified for that face-off. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate judiciary committee, voiced support for Lindsey Graham\u2019s proposal to have Rudy Giuliani appear before the panel. The California Democrat said in a statement: \u201cI welcome the opportunity to question Rudy Giuliani under oath about his role in seeking the Ukrainian government\u2019s assistance to investigate one of the president\u2019s political rivals. \u201cDemocratic members have plenty of questions for Mr Giuliani and this would give us an opportunity to help separate fact from fiction for the American people.\u201d But Graham\u2019s statement inviting Giuliani raised concerns that the appearance would be used as an opportunity for Republicans to amplify baseless corruption claims against Joe Biden. Trump has reacted to the latest subpoena of one of his administration officials by attacking the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee. Gordon Sondland said in a statement earlier today that he was \u201cprofoundly disappointed\u201d he could not appear before Congress, so it will likely be much harder for Trump to prevent him from testifying now that he has been subpoenaed. The Democratic committee chairmen noted in their statement about the subpoena of Gordon Sondland that the US ambassador to the EU was directed by the state department late last night not to testify before Congress. According to the senior House Democrats, Sondland received a voicemail at 12.30am informing him that the Trump administration would not allow him to appear before the committees. That voicemail will likely be included in the Democrats\u2019 subpoena of Sondland. The three Democratic chairmen \u2013 Adam Schiff of the House intelligence committee, Eliot Engel of the House foreign affairs committee and Elijah Cummings of the House oversight committee \u2013 are requesting testimony and documents from Gordon Sondland. Schiff told reporters today that the US ambassador to the EU has texts and emails relevant to the inquiry stored on personal devices. The California Democrat accused the state department of withholding that pertinent information from the House committees. The chairmen also blasted the White House\u2019s interference with Sondland\u2019s scheduled testimony. They said in their statement about the subpoena: \u201cWe consider this interference to be obstruction of the impeachment inquiry.\u201d The Democratic chairmen of three House committees leading the impeachment inquiry said they would subpoena Gordon Sondland after the US ambassador to the EU failed to appear for his deposition. Rudy Giuliani expressed openness to appearing before the Senate judiciary committee after the panel\u2019s Republican chairman, Lindsey Graham, invited the president\u2019s personal lawyer to discuss \u201ccorruption in Ukraine.\u201d The former New York mayor told CNN: \u201cLove Lindsey, but I am still a lawyer and I will have to deal with privilege.\u201d But Giuliani added: \u201cGiven the nature of his invitation about my concerns I might be able to do it without discussing privileged information.\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris is eager to question Rudy Giuliani if the president\u2019s personal lawyer accepts Lindsey Graham\u2019s invitation to appear before the Senate judiciary committee. A CNN reporter noted that three Democratic presidential contenders sit on the Senate panel, potentially throwing an even brighter spotlight on what would already be a very high-profile appearance. Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, announced that apprehensions at the southern border reached nearly 1 million during the 2019 fiscal year \u2013 marking a 12-year high. The Washington Post has more on the numbers: [Morgan] told reporters at a White House briefing that just more than 52,000 migrants were taken into custody \u2014 including those deemed inadmissible to the country \u2014 in September at U.S. ports of entry and between them. It was a decline of 18 percent from August. Overall, U.S. border authorities made more than 975,000 arrests during the 2019 fiscal year, according to the latest data. Morgan said arrests increased 88 percent during the 2019 fiscal year, calling it a \u2018staggering\u2019 increase. \u2018These are numbers no immigration system in the world is designed to handle,\u2019 he said. At least one Democratic congressman is calling for the resignation of Gordon Sondland after the US ambassador to the EU did not show up for his deposition with the House committees leading the impeachment inquiry. Sondland expressed disappointment that he was \u201cdirected\u201d by the State Department not to appear, but representative Anthony Brown said the diplomat should step down if that is what it would take to comply with the panels\u2019 request. On the 2020 campaign trail, Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg has released a new digital ad called \u201cLight the Way.\u201d The 30-second ad \u2013 which will run on social media platforms and other sites in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada \u2013 includes footage from Buttigieg\u2019s recent rally in Sparks, Nevada. The audience there enabled the Indiana mayor to finish his remarks after the power went out by using the flashlights on their cell phones. The text in the ad reads: \u201cTogether, we can light the way to a better future.\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, another congressional ally of Trump\u2019s, said he would allow Rudy Giuliani to testify before the Senate judiciary committee about \u201ccorruption in Ukraine.\u201d Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, reportedly played a key role in pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son. The former New York mayor has already been subpoenaed by House Democrats. A Politico reporter noted that Graham\u2019s invitation could indicate Republican lawmakers are open to exploring an investigation of the baseless corruption claims against Biden, as Trump has pushed for. And Trump is somehow still talking about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, even as his own White House blocks a senior official from testifying for House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. Despite Trump\u2019s many efforts to direct attention away from the impeachment inquiry, support for the investigation continues to climb among the American public. A new Washington Post-Schar School poll out today found that 58 percent of Americans back the inquiry, marking an increase of 21 points since just July. Meanwhile, just in case Trump momentarily forgot about the impeachment inquiry against him, a protester with a sense of humor is providing a very noisy reminder of it just outside the president\u2019s window in Washington. Trump\u2019s congressional allies echoed the president\u2019s talking points slamming House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry as a \u201ckangaroo court.\u201d Representative Mark Meadows, a Republican of North Carolina, said Gordon Sondland should only testify when it can be assured that a \u201cfair process\u201d will be followed. \u201cThis is not a fair process,\u201d Meadows said. One of Meadows\u2019 colleagues, Jim Jordan of Ohio, said he was not concerned about Trump\u2019s Ukraine call because he was \u201cdoing his duty\u201d to look into corruption abroad. But the memo that the White House released on the phone call shows that Trump specifically referenced baseless allegations against Joe Biden and his son. The Republican lawmakers added that they want to see the transcript of the congressional testimony from Kurt Volker, the former US ambassador to NATO, released before the inquiry proceeds. Representative Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, slammed the White House\u2019s decision to block the congressional testimony of Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU. The California Democrat said the State Department was also withholding text messages and emails from Sondland that were stored on a personal device and were \u201cdeeply relevant\u201d to the impeachment inquiry. \u201cIt is hard to overstate\u201d the significance of Sondland\u2019s testimony, Schiff said. He warned that the decision to block his appearance presented \u201cyet additional strong evidence of obstruction.\u201d The president has weighed in on the White House\u2019s decision to block the congressional testimony of Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU. Trump said that he would \u201clove\u201d to have the State Department official testify but that it has been made impossible because the impeachment inquiry has devolved into a \u201ckangaroo court.\u201d But the New York Times has reported that Sondland\u2019s text (not a tweet) denying any quid pro quo only came after he spoke with Trump. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris offered the president a warning about impeachment after the White House blocked the congressional testimony of Gordon Sondland. The California senator has repeatedly promised on the campaign trail to \u201cprosecute the case\u201d against Trump. Representative Adam Kinzinger, a Republican of Illinois, told CNN this morning that he considered Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president to be \u201cinappropriate\u201d but not necessarily \u201cimpeachable.\u201d Those comments seem to water down Kinzinger\u2019s initial criticism of the conversation. \u201cNo president should ever utilize or use American power in any way like to affect an election,\u201d the Republican lawmaker said late last month. \u201cSo, if that happened, that would be a problem.\u201d Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU who was supposed to testify before House Democrats today, said in a statement that he was \u201cprofoundly disappointed\u201d he could not appear today. The senior official added that the State Department \u201cdirected\u201d him not to testify before the panels leading the impeachment inquiry against Trump. Good morning, live blog readers! House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry is firing at all cylinders, despite the Trump administration\u2019s many efforts to slow it down. Most recently, the White House has blocked Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU and a key witness in the Ukraine controversy, from appearing for a deposition. The decision to block Sondland\u2019s testimony could carry grave consequences for Donald Trump, given the House committees\u2019 repeated warnings in letters subpoenaing senior officials that any failure to produce requested documents \u201cshall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry\u201d. But the White House\u2019s efforts to block the inquiry cannot stem the shifting tide of public opinion. According to a new Washington Post-Schar School poll, 58% of Americans support House Democrats\u2019 decision to launch a formal impeachment inquiry. Nearly half of Americans \u2013 49% \u2013 back the more severe step of removing Trump from office. The president is, as usual, taking all of this very much in stride by tweeting out a blustery defense of his widely criticized decision to clear the way for a Turkish military operation against America\u2019s Kurdish allies. But his defensive tweet underscores the deep trouble Trump is in as he faces potentially career-ending controversies on every front. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will have lunch with the vice-president and award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to former attorney general Edwin Meese. The Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, Adam Schiff, will speak to reporters about Sondland\u2019s blocked testimony at 9.30am ET. Nancy Pelosi will participate in a conversation on drug pricing in Seattle at 11.30am ET. That\u2019s all still coming up, so stay tuned.",
