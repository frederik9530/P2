We are fortunate that James was available to commence immediately.\u201d Stokes was loyal to Worner throughout the turmoil of his highly-publicised affair with former Seven staffer Amber Harrison, which led to a lengthy legal battle. \u201cIt\u2019s with mixed emotion that I tender my resignation; however Seven \u2013 a company I love \u2013 is a very different company now from the one I joined 25 years ago,\u201d Worner said. \u201cIt\u2019s changed faster than ever in these last few years and that\u2019s down to the hard work of the best team in the business. I sincerely thank the team and I wish them absolutely nothing but continued success.\u201d",

The administration had contended that detained immigrant children, who are required to be provided with \u201csafe and sanitary\u201d conditions, didn\u2019t need basic hygiene products. The ninth circuit court of appeals in San Francisco tossed out the government\u2019s challenge to a lower court\u2019s findings that authorities had failed to provide safe and sanitary conditions for the children in line with a 1997 agreement widely known as the Flores settlement. The government argued that authorities weren\u2019t required to provide specific accommodations under the settlement, such as soap, and asked the panel to weigh in. A Trump administration lawyer tried to argue the point in June, saying the agreement was vague and might not require that a toothbrush and soap be provided to children during brief stays in custody. The appellate judges disagreed, writing: \u201cAssuring that children eat enough edible food, drink clean water, are housed in hygienic facilities with sanitary bathrooms, have soap and toothpaste, and are not sleep deprived are without doubt essential to the children\u2019s safety.\u201d Leecia Welch, senior director of legal advocacy and child welfare at the National Center for Youth Law, said the panel\u2019s ruling wasn\u2019t surprising. \u201cIt should shock the conscience of all Americans to know that our government argued children do not need these bare essentials,\u201d she said. A message seeking comment was sent to the Department of Justice. The US district court judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles ruled in 2017 that authorities had breached the agreement after young immigrants caught on the border said they had to sleep in cold, overcrowded cells and were given inadequate food and dirty water. Since then, problems in the facilities have persisted. Gee has appointed an independent monitor to evaluate conditions. The issues date back years. They have drawn increased attention amid a rise in the number of children and families, mostly from Central America, arriving on the south-west border. But the issue has intensified in recent months as the Trump administration has faced fierce criticism over the state of detention facilities where immigrants are being held. In August, a human rights attorney described \u201cinhuman\u201d conditions while visiting a Texas detention center that amounted to an \u201cemergency public health crisis\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Fifty years after a young David Bowie performed from a south London bandstand in front of a tiny crowd at a summer festival he organised, the historic iron structure that served as his modest stage has been Grade II-listed. Known to fans as the \u201cBowie bandstand\u201d, and thought to be the only surviving example from the Glasgow-based McCallum and Hope iron foundry in the UK, it was the centrepiece of the Growth summer festival, held by Bowie and friends on 16 August 1969 in Beckenham. The one-day event attracted only a couple of hundred people. Bowie, then living with landlady Mary Finnigan in Beckenham, had just released his first hit single, Space Oddity. The hope was that the festival, in the Croydon Road recreation ground where the bandstand has stood since 1905, would raise money for a permanent base for his and Finnigan\u2019s Beckenham Arts Lab project, based in the nearby Three Tuns pub. The festival inspired Bowie to write Memory of a Free Festival for his second album released later that same year, and it has been suggested that he penned the lyrics to Life on Mars from the bandstand\u2019s steps. After that August day when, Bowie\u2019s lyrics record, \u201cThe children of the summer\u2019s end gathered in the dampened grass\u201d, the bandstand fell into disrepair. It is now being renovated, with the costs being met partly through the local council and through fundraising at an annual festival. Held over several years in the same park and now known as Bowie\u2019s Beckenham Oddity festival, it celebrates the life and legacy of the star, who died of cancer in January 2016, aged 69. On Saturday, to mark the 50th anniversary of the event, some of the original lineup are returning, Singer-songwriter and acoustic guitarist, Keith Christmas, 72, who performed then, recalled: \u201cI was 21, and David Bowie was around the same age, and it was a very idealistic time.

Would-be supporters would need to be quick off the mark, however, as Sweet Promises\u2019s race is due off at 4.50 \u2013 only five minutes after Ojooba\u2019s.",

Their first home match could be an attacking extravaganza if, unlike at Newcastle, Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 and Alexandre Lacazette start with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. But their defence will also be worth watching, especially if David Luiz makes his debut. He would probably prefer if it were not against Ashley Barnes. The forward riled the Brazilian to distraction <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/22/chelsea-burnley-premier-league-match-report\">when Burnley drew 2-2 at Chelsea in April</a>. Barnes is one of the slyest pests in the Premier League and he continually lures David Luiz into fouling him. David Luiz got so frustrated with the way Barnes and Chris Wood wound him up that he perpetrated an embarrassing dive, which did not stop him from complaining afterwards about Burnley\u2019s \u201canti-football\u201d. Barnes, you fancy, will be hoping Unai Emery picks his new signing. <strong>PD</strong></p> <h2>2) A first sighting of City new boy Cancelo?</h2> <p>Manchester City will have revenge for last season\u2019s Champions League quarter-final defeat on their minds when they entertain Tottenham. Signed from Juventus during the summer but yet to play a competitive match for City, Jo\u00e3o Cancelo could feature. Nominally a right-back, City fans are unlikely to see much of him in that particular area of the pitch if the smoke blown up the Portuguese 25-year-old\u2019s nether regions this week is anything to go by. \u201cCancelo is perfect for City,\u201d said Gary Neville, who managed the player during his ill-fated spell in charge of Valencia. \u201cHe\u2019s a winger, a goalscorer, assist maker, he\u2019s a right-back! You\u2019re going to lose a bit defensively in terms of a back four because he\u2019ll never be there, I promise you that.\u201d Should he get selected, an already mouthwatering match-up will be that little bit more exciting. <strong>BG</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/jun/04/football-transfer-window-2019-every-summer-deal-from-europe-top-five-leagues\">Transfer window 2019 \u2013 every summer deal from Europe's top five leagues</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>3) Yoshida keeping generosity off the field</h2> <p>Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl has let Che Adams loose and must be tempted to unleash Moussa Djenepo, but if Southampton are to prosper they need to hope Kevin Danso helps shore up a leaky defence. The 20-year-old, who started his career at MK Dons, has joined on loan from Augsburg and will bolster Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s options, with Jack Stephens, Jan Vestergaard and Jan Bednarek unconvincing as a back three against Burnley. Danso only trained with his new teammates for the first time on Tuesday. Maya Yoshida, the longest-serving player at the club after James Ward-Prowse, could return against Liverpool. This week the Japan captain pledged 1% of his salary to Saints Foundation, the club\u2019s charity partner. \u201cI have been here for seven years now and I have got a lot from the club and from the city,\u201d Yoshida said. \u201cIt is time for me to give something back to them.\u201d Supporters will hope the defender is not so generous when Liverpool come to town. <strong>BF</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c25b5bb39e7c125766545550a1b7d7e3df4f2641\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c25b5bb39e7c125766545550a1b7d7e3df4f2641/0_186_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maya Yoshida could return for Southampton\u2019s clash with Liverpool.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maya Yoshida could return for Southampton\u2019s clash with Liverpool.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Super/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4) West Ham to stay on front foot against Brighton</h2> <p>West Ham\u2019s failings against Manchester City were predictable. Their full-backs were exposed, their midfield was too lightweight and although it might seem harsh to be critical after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/10/west-ham-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">a defeat by Pep Guardiola\u2019s side</a>, the problem for Manuel Pellegrini is that other teams will think that they can hurt West Ham in similar ways. For all their attacking flair they remain too easy to beat and Pellegrini needs his forwards to work harder. City\u2019s opening goal stemmed from Michail Antonio failing to protect Aaron Cresswell at left-back, while there is a feeling within the club that playing Manuel Lanzini and Jack Wilshere in the same midfield gives Declan Rice too much to do in front of the back four. Yet Pellegrini is determined to play on the front foot and it would be out of character for him to shut up shop at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/10/watford-brighton-premier-league-match-report\">Brighton, who began the Graham Potter era with a 3-0 win over Watford</a>. Ultimately Pellegrini does not have many ways to tighten his midfield \u2013 he is one injury away from having to start Carlos S\u00e1nchez \u2013 so it could be a case of West Ham trying to emulate the Ossie Ardiles approach. <strong>JS</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/12/var-premier-league-football\">VAR\u2019s Premier League bow provides cocktail of contrived and serious | Paul MacInnes</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>5) Mings to prove his worth against his old club?</h2> <p>Much was made of the fee Aston Villa paid Bournemouth for Tyrone Mings this summer \u2013 Dean Smith\u2019s side could end up coughing up \u00a326.5m including performance-related clauses \u2013 but the defender has a chance to show what his former club are missing. The challenge of shackling ex-teammates Joshua King and Callum Wilson, strikers blessed with searing pace, is arguably as tough as any he will face this season. Mings was desperate to return, turning up at Bournemouth station in full kit the day after the play-off final victory over Derby and he made an impressive start at Tottenham and is determined to prove he is capable of excelling in the top flight alongside fellow summer signing Bjorn Engels, who Smith previously tried to sign at Brentford. \u201cI had a click with Tyrone from the first moment we played together,\u201d Engels said. <strong>BF</strong></p> <h2>6) An attacking selection dilemma for Lampard</h2> <p>The games are coming thick and fast for Frank Lampard, who has yet to register a win as Chelsea manager but can take encouragement from his side\u2019s performances in varying degrees of defeat at the hands of Manchester United and Liverpool. While he could do with an easier game to get a win, Leicester should prove very tricky opposition. In Brendan Rodgers, they are managed by a man who would have been ideally suited to the Chelsea job had he not been in such a rush to leave Celtic. While it is far too soon to write off Tammy Abraham\u2019s chances of hacking it at the highest level, the very early omens are not great. His failure to convert an excellent chance at Manchester United, followed by that missed penalty in the shoot-out against Liverpool will only ramp up the pressure on the striker. He deserves a run in the team to prove his worth, but will his manager\u2019s need for a win and the proven goalscorer prompt Lampard to give Olivier Giroud the nod? <strong>BG</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/aug/15/frank-lampard-chelsea-liverpool-super-cup\">Frank Lampard\u2019s youth policy at Chelsea should be tempered with realism | Eni Aluko</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>7) A better barometer of Norwich\u2019s prospects</h2> <p>How much credit should Norwich really take from a 4-1 defeat? There were glimmers of encouragement against Liverpool; from the four academy graduates who started to the manner in which they carved open the best defence in the Premier League last season on several occasions. Teemu Pukki proved he can cause problems \u2013 and find the net \u2013 but a naivety in defence ultimately rendered any green shoots worthless at Anfield. A return to Carrow Road against a Newcastle side in transition should act as a better barometer of the kind of season in store. \u201cWe know it is Everest again without the tools but let\u2019s see the outcome,\u201d said Daniel Farke. \u201cWe know in every game we are the underdog.

Following his dismissal during Everton\u2019s draw against Crystal Palace, Morgan Schneiderlin will miss this game, while his fellow midfielder Andr\u00e9 Gomes could miss out through injury. While he returned to training this week following a groin injury, there will be obvious concerns over Fabian Delph\u2019s fitness. In the absence of this trio, Jean-Philippe Gbamin and Tom Davies are Everton\u2019s only fit central midfielders. A \u00a325m signing from Mainz, Gbamin could make his full debut. A tough-tackling defensive midfielder brought in to replace Idrissa Gueye, by his own account Gbamin likes \u201cto go in the duels, run a lot and tackle\u201d. While he may have to be thrown into the starting lineup sooner than his manager, Marco Silva, might like, Everton fans could get a decent look at their latest acquisition . <strong>BG</strong></p> <h2>9) Morrison may add cutting edge for Blades</h2> <p>Phil Jagielka started Sheffield United\u2019s last Premier League home game, in May 2007, but will likely remain among the substitutes against Crystal Palace. Chris Wilder is reluctant to take a wrecking ball to his team and, despite making 10 summer signings, he has no intentions of rocking the boat, with only Callum Robinson making his full debut on the opening day. There is, however, a chance that more newbies could feature this weekend, with Ravel Morrison\u2019s artistry set to grace Bramall Lane. \u201cHis attitude has been spot on,\u201d Wilder said. \u201cHe\u2019s given us something a little bit different. We just wanted to go with another midfield player in the 18 [against Bournemouth] but he\u2019s got a big part to play as well.\u201d <strong>BF</strong></p> <h2>10) Molineux match will show if United have improved</h2> <p>Manchester United\u2019s big win over Chelsea was a little misleading, insofar as Frank Lampard\u2019s side ultimately played to United\u2019s counter-attacking strengths. Wolves will not. They beat United twice at Molineux earlier this year and are slick enough to do so again. The visitors showed signs of getting to grips with Wolves in the second of those matches: after being outplayed in the first, Ole Gunnar Solskj<em>\u00e6</em>r changed to a back-three formation and United began with great energy, dominating in midfield and out wide. But once Wolves fought back, United crumbled. Do they have more midfield mettle now? We shall see. At least they should be stronger in central defence: Raul Jim\u00e9nez bullied and outwitted United\u2019s defenders last season; Harry Maguire will be asked to do something about that. <strong>PD</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has said the radio presenter Alan Jones was \u201cway out of line\u201d for saying the Australian prime minister should \u201cshove a sock down the throat\u201d of his New Zealand counterpart, Jacinda Ardern. Speaking after a 12-hour meeting with other leaders of Pacific countries in Tuvalu on Thursday, Morrison said: \u201cThe comment has been relayed to me; on what\u2019s been reported to me, I find that very disappointing and of course that\u2019s way out of line. \u201cI have two daughters, so you can expect that\u2019s how I would feel personally about it. I\u2019ll leave others to explain what they\u2019ve said and how they\u2019ve said it,\u201d said Morrison. The radio host \u2013 who previously said Julia Gillard should be put in a \u201cchaff bag\u201d and thrown in the sea \u2013 said Ardern was \u201ca complete clown\u201d and \u201ca joke\u201d and too outspoken about the climate crisis. Jones later sought to back away from the comments, saying critics had \u201cwilfully misinterpreted\u201d him and he actually meant Ardern should shove her own sock down her own throat. Morrison and Ardern are among the leaders at the Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu, where nations have urged Australia to commit to reducing emissions. Ardern said on Wednesday that Australia \u201chas to answer to the Pacific\u201d and said New Zealand would \u201cdo our bit\u201d. Morrison thanked Ardern for her work in discussions with Pacific leaders and said that while people don\u2019t always have to agree, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to learn to disagree better and show respect to one another\u201d. \u201cHere she is preaching on global warming and saying that we\u2019ve got to do something about climate change,\u201d Jones said on radio station 2GB. \u201cI just wonder whether Scott Morrison is going to be fully briefed to shove a sock down her throat.\u201d Both Australia\u2019s former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and Fiji\u2019s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, who is in Tuvalu for the forum and a leading global figure on climate change, condemned Jones\u2019s comments. \u201cEasy to tell someone to shove a sock down a throat when you\u2019re sitting in the comfort of a studio,\u201d he tweeted, adding: \u201cThe people of the Pacific, forced to abandon their homes due to climate change, don\u2019t have that luxury.\u201d Turnbull joined Bainimarama, calling for Jones to apologise to Ardern \u201cfor his latest misogynistic rant\u201d. \u201cWhen I announced Australia\u2019s Pacific Step Up in 2016 climate action was a key priority. It may be political to some, but it\u2019s existential in the Pacific,\u201d he said. The CEO of anti-domestic violence body Our Watch, Patty Kinnersly, said the \u201cverbal threat of violence\u201d was very concerning. \u201cResearch shows disrespect for women, including sexist comments, is one of the drivers of violence against them. \u201cJournalists and commentators are very influential: their words have impact and we encourage responsible reporting. Ultimately, we want everyone to understand the power of words and that disrespect or threats create an environment where violence against women is seen as acceptable or can be justified.\u201d \u201cYou can disagree with someone without wanting to silence them,\u201d Kinnersly said. Speaking to the New Daily on Thursday evening, Jones accused his detractors of \u201cwilful misinterpretation\u201d. \u201cOf course what I meant to say was that Scott Morrison should tell Ms Ardern to \u2018put a sock in it\u2019,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere are many people who would relish the opportunity to misinterpret things that I have said as we have seen online this afternoon. Of course I would not wish any harm to Jacinda Ardern.\u201d He did not apologise. In his morning original comments, Jones claimed that New Zealand\u2019s per capita carbon dioxide emissions had grown more than Australia\u2019s \u2013 but also told listeners there was \u201cnothing wrong with\u201d carbon dioxide. \u201cIf you want to talk about carbon dioxide, which I don\u2019t \u2013 nothing wrong with it \u2013 the fact is New Zealand\u2019s carbon dioxide has grown by 10.8% per capita since 1990. Ours has grown by 1.8%.\u201d In his later attempt to excuse his comments, Jones maintained his stance. \u201cThis wilful misinterpretation distracts from my point that she was wrong about climate change and wrong about Australia\u2019s contribution to carbon dioxide levels,\u201d he said. Nearly all the data Jones had cited is incorrect or misleading. New Zealand generated 82% of its electricity from renewable sources, mainly geothermal and hydro, in 2017. Australia is responsible for about 1.3% of global emissions, New Zealand 0.17%. According to data lodged with the United Nations, Australia\u2019s annual emissions fell 9.3% between 1990 and 2015 if land-clearing is counted, reflecting that 1990 was a big year for land-clearing in Queensland. If land use is excluded, Australia\u2019s emissions rose 27.3% over that time. New Zealand\u2019s emissions rose 63.6% over that timeframe if land use is included, in part because it has increased harvesting of forest plantations. Take out land use and its emissions are up 24.1%. Tim Baxter, a senior researcher with the Climate Council, said New Zealand\u2019s emissions had levelled off in recent years and Ardern had introduced legislation setting a target of net zero emissions by 2050. Australia\u2019s emissions have increased for five years straight and it has no long-term emissions goal. Baxter said Jones\u2019s claims were \u201cvery misguided\u201d. On Thursday afternoon, the broadcasting regulator Acma said it had not yet received any complaints about Jones\u2019s comments. In 2012, the broadcaster was roundly criticised for saying that then-prime minister Julia Gillard should be \u201cshoved in a chaff bag\u201d. \u201cThe woman\u2019s off her tree and quite frankly they should shove her and Bob Brown in a chaff bag and take them as far out to sea as they can and tell them to swim home,\u201d he said at the time. He later apologised, saying it was \u201cbetter left unsaid\u201d and \u201ctoo clever by half\u201d. In the same year he said Gillard\u2019s father had died \u201cof shame\u201d because she \u201ctold lies every time she stood for parliament\u201d. Acma found then that Jones had not breached guidelines, and had not incited violence or hatred based on gender. Jones has also said the same of other politicians such as the Sydney mayor Clover Moore, Kevin Rudd, Wayne Swan and Barack Obama. In 2018 Acma found Jones had breached \u201cgenerally accepted standards of decency\u201d for using a racist term in relation to the government minister Mathias Cormann. And in 2007, the watchdog found he encouraged violence and vilified people of Lebanese and Middle Eastern backgrounds in comments made before the Cronulla riots in 2005.",

      "body": "<p>Not even the dreaded Wembleyitis, it seems, can stop this all-conquering St Helens side in their pursuit of greatness. The interim period between the Challenge Cup semi-finals and the Wembley showpiece is often a breeding ground for a drop-off in form but this wonderful team are simply too good to be bothered by any of that kind of nonsense right now.</p> <p>The league table can frequently be misleading but, when it comes to Justin Holbrook\u2019s team of all talents, it tells you everything. The size of the task awaiting Warrington next week at Wembley when they face the Saints is underlined by the fact that everyone \u2013 even the second-placed Wolves \u2013 are now closer to the bottom of the table than they are to the runaway Super League leaders.</p> <p>Their remarkable 16-point lead is now almost certainly set to be the greatest in Super League history too \u2013 with Castleford\u2019s 10-point margin at the top two years ago the benchmark.</p> <p>This was far from a serene warm-up for St Helens. The Saints, facing a Leeds side who have scored 92 points in back-to-back victories to ease their relegation fears, came across the Pennines without seven first-teamers who should all return for Wembley.</p> <p>With half-time approaching, they were in a real battle, trailing 10-6 on merit \u2013 but thereafter it was a familiar story for anyone who has had the privilege of seeing this side first-hand in 2019. Thirty unanswered points, five brilliant tries and a dominant second-half display later, the Rhinos had been comprehensively dispatched, albeit despite a late comeback from them to add a semblance of respectability to the scoreline.</p> <p>Leeds afforded the Super League leaders a guard of honour pre-match after recently securing a second successive League Leader\u2019s Shield. However, there was very little in the way of sentiment from the hosts when the game got underway. The Rhinos were much the stronger side in the opening quarter \u2013 but they were unable to convert any of their sustained pressure.</p> <p>And having turned possession over in prime attacking opportunities on numerous occasions, the Saints made them pay. Following a half-break from Mark Percival, the league leaders kept the ball alive long enough for Jack Welsby to turn the ball on for Regan Grace, the Welsh wing finishing in the corner to break the deadlock.</p> <p>That, however, seemed to rid Leeds of their attacking profligacy. Eight minutes after falling behind, they were level when a wonderful solo effort from their scrum-half, Richie Myler, made it 6-6. Then, with five minutes until the break, the hosts went ahead when Konrad Hurrell\u2019s fine offload sent Ash Handley over in the corner for his 20th try of the season.</p> <p>Rhyse Martin missed the conversion, but just as it looked as though the Rhinos would take a four-point lead into half-time, the Saints hit back with the try of the half. Despite their absent first-teamers, the fluidity in the build-up play which led to Kevin Naiqama\u2019s try that levelled the scores was sensational, with the Fijian finishing in the corner to make it 10-10.</p> <p>How crucial that try proved to be, too. The Saints went almost immediately on the attack after half-time, and by the time Leeds had restored any sort of order, the visitors were out of sight. An error from Luke Briscoe allowed Zeb Taia to touch down a Theo Fages kick, before the second-row claimed his second soon after following marvellous work from Grace.</p> <p>Then on the hour mark, back-to-back tries came from Naiqama to complete his hat-trick and put the result beyond doubt. A Percival penalty made it 24-10, before Naiqama raced on to two excellent passes from the teenage full-back, Jack Welsby in the space of four minutes.

      "bodyText": "Not even the dreaded Wembleyitis, it seems, can stop this all-conquering St Helens side in their pursuit of greatness. The interim period between the Challenge Cup semi-finals and the Wembley showpiece is often a breeding ground for a drop-off in form but this wonderful team are simply too good to be bothered by any of that kind of nonsense right now. The league table can frequently be misleading but, when it comes to Justin Holbrook\u2019s team of all talents, it tells you everything. The size of the task awaiting Warrington next week at Wembley when they face the Saints is underlined by the fact that everyone \u2013 even the second-placed Wolves \u2013 are now closer to the bottom of the table than they are to the runaway Super League leaders. Their remarkable 16-point lead is now almost certainly set to be the greatest in Super League history too \u2013 with Castleford\u2019s 10-point margin at the top two years ago the benchmark. This was far from a serene warm-up for St Helens. The Saints, facing a Leeds side who have scored 92 points in back-to-back victories to ease their relegation fears, came across the Pennines without seven first-teamers who should all return for Wembley. With half-time approaching, they were in a real battle, trailing 10-6 on merit \u2013 but thereafter it was a familiar story for anyone who has had the privilege of seeing this side first-hand in 2019. Thirty unanswered points, five brilliant tries and a dominant second-half display later, the Rhinos had been comprehensively dispatched, albeit despite a late comeback from them to add a semblance of respectability to the scoreline. Leeds afforded the Super League leaders a guard of honour pre-match after recently securing a second successive League Leader\u2019s Shield. However, there was very little in the way of sentiment from the hosts when the game got underway. The Rhinos were much the stronger side in the opening quarter \u2013 but they were unable to convert any of their sustained pressure. And having turned possession over in prime attacking opportunities on numerous occasions, the Saints made them pay. Following a half-break from Mark Percival, the league leaders kept the ball alive long enough for Jack Welsby to turn the ball on for Regan Grace, the Welsh wing finishing in the corner to break the deadlock. That, however, seemed to rid Leeds of their attacking profligacy. Eight minutes after falling behind, they were level when a wonderful solo effort from their scrum-half, Richie Myler, made it 6-6. Then, with five minutes until the break, the hosts went ahead when Konrad Hurrell\u2019s fine offload sent Ash Handley over in the corner for his 20th try of the season. Rhyse Martin missed the conversion, but just as it looked as though the Rhinos would take a four-point lead into half-time, the Saints hit back with the try of the half. Despite their absent first-teamers, the fluidity in the build-up play which led to Kevin Naiqama\u2019s try that levelled the scores was sensational, with the Fijian finishing in the corner to make it 10-10. How crucial that try proved to be, too. The Saints went almost immediately on the attack after half-time, and by the time Leeds had restored any sort of order, the visitors were out of sight. An error from Luke Briscoe allowed Zeb Taia to touch down a Theo Fages kick, before the second-row claimed his second soon after following marvellous work from Grace. Then on the hour mark, back-to-back tries came from Naiqama to complete his hat-trick and put the result beyond doubt. A Percival penalty made it 24-10, before Naiqama raced on to two excellent passes from the teenage full-back, Jack Welsby in the space of four minutes. Percival converted both, and even the most ardent Leeds supporters inside Headingley will have been appreciative of what they were witnessing by this stage. To the Rhinos\u2019 credit \u2013 who are still almost certainly too good to go down on the evidence of recent displays \u2013 they finished with two well-worked tries of their own. Handley claimed his 21st try of the season, before Briscoe\u2019s ball back inside sent Harry Newman over in the closing seconds. By then though, the result had long since been decided.

Women producing jeans for US brands including Levi Strauss, Wrangler and Lee have been forced to sleep with their managers to keep their jobs or gain promotion, an investigation into sexual harassment and coercion at garment factories in Lesotho has found. Opinion and analysis Australia\u2019s gender pay gap is harming older women, with many women in their 50s and 60s unable to support themselves after a lifetime of toil and labour. . Figures released on Thursday show also the national gender pay gap remains stable at 14% and the gap between full-time average weekly earnings for men and women is $241.50 a week. \u201cI\u2019ve only been earning super in the last 10 years,\u201d Janine Saligari said. \u201cI\u2019ve been working since I was 14. And I\u2019ve got nothing to show for it. I\u2019d be lucky to have $30,000 in super.\u201d Strange things were happening with Brigid Delaney\u2019s fridge. But watching YouTube tutorials to learn how to repair it herself didn\u2019t help. \u201cWatching six of these videos in a row made me feel strangely ill. I knew that if I attempted to mess with the wiring \u2026 I would die and my corpse would be discovered later, curled behind the fridge.\u201d Sport Day two of the second Ashes Test has left England at 258, to Australia\u2019s 30-1. Australia scrapped and scraped in a manner that suggested there is still plenty of time for there to be a result, and England\u2019s Stuart Broad bowled David Warner in the most beautiful play of the match. On Saturday the Gabba hosts its most significant football game in a decade. A Brisbane side that has lit up an otherwise ho-hum season faces its biggest test. Their coach, a grandfather who never played at the highest level, squares off against Scott, the archetype Lion of yore. The Wallabies coach, Michael Cheika, has vowed to resign if Australia does not win the World Cup this year. But what if his side regain the Bledisloe Cup at Eden Park in Auckland on Saturday night? Would that be sufficient for Rugby Australia to offer a contract extension? Thinking time: Listening to 38 discs of Woodstock \u2013 still groovy? It was a blueprint for Live Aid and every mega-festival since. Woodstock\u2019s cultural weight has risen and fallen over the decades \u2013 depending on who you talk to, it was either the pinnacle of 1960s counterculture or the rain-sodden end of a dream. Bob Stanley, who was four at the time, surveys a new archive box set \u2013 in full \u2013 to uncover the real story of these \u201cthree days of peace and music\u201d. \u201cThe soundtrack album would be in friends\u2019 houses in the 70s, and the movie seemed to be on TV every year, so I\u2019m part of a generation that thinks it knows Woodstock without having been there. But the movie is incomplete and out of sequence \u2013 some of the story is as fictionalised as Bohemian Rhapsody.\u201d \u201cBy mid-afternoon, insulin and asthma medicine are the main concerns of the MC. And lost car keys. The Lovin\u2019 Spoonful\u2019s John Sebastian walks on stage, slack-jawed. \u2018I don\u2019t know if you can tell how amazing you look. You\u2019re a whole city. You\u2019re something an awful lot of us talked about 10 years ago.\u2019\u201d Media roundup The ABC talks to women in the Pacific whose quality of life is improving due to better underwear. The cost of a bra is equivalent to a day\u2019s wages, and many women go without, to the detriment of their spine health. A Chinese drone company that has caught the attention of US and Australian security agencies has set up an Australian branch with the assistance of the LNP whip Rob Molhoek, the Australian reports. And a planned $300m spend by US marines on infrastructure in the Northern Territory is a golden opportunity for local businesses, the NT News reports.

He has been training exceptionally well. He has been an important mainstay for us for a number of years and I am sure he will continue to be that. He will get some game time.\u201d</p> <p>Before the Six Nations match against England last February Gatland singled out the prop Kyle Sinckler for attention, questioning the length of his fuse.

      "bodyText": "Warren Gatland expects his grand slam champions to show more urgency against England in Cardiff on Saturday after Sunday\u2019s defeat at Twickenham, warning his players about the consequences of another lacklustre display five weeks before their opening match in the World Cup. The reverse at Twickenham ended a run of 14 consecutive victories and, while Gatland, Wales\u2019s head coach since the end of 2007, said he did not place a premium on results in warm-ups, likening them to pre-season friendlies at club level, he anticipates a response. \u201cWe will be a lot better,\u201d said Gatland, who has made three changes from Sunday with Dan Biggar starting at fly-half instead of Gareth Anscombe, who suffered a knee injury at Twickenham that will keep him out of action for most of the season. The back-five forwards Adam Beard and Justin Tipuric sustained minor knocks against England and have been replaced by Jake Ball and James Davies, who will start a Test match alongside his brother, Jonathan, for the first time. \u201cWe were pretty relaxed on Sunday. We play our best when we are on edge mentally and, apart from the injuries, we have chosen the guys again for this weekend. If some of them do not front up and perform, they will open the door for someone else. We have made the players aware that they are under pressure.\u201d Gatland was not tempted to rest Biggar following Anscombe\u2019s injury with his other two options at fly-half, Rhys Patchell and Jarrod Evans, both having limited international experience. Anscombe played on for a few minutes after suffering knee ligament damage last weekend but the damage had already been done. \u201cWe felt it was important Dan started the game because he came off the bench a lot for us in the Six Nations,\u201d said Gatland. \u201cJarrod will get some time from the bench this weekend and we will try and involve Rhys as we have a game against Ireland before we select the squad for Japan.\u201d It is two years since Biggar, who has won 70 caps, was Wales\u2019s first-choice No 10. He gave way first to Patchell and then to Anscombe as Wales looked to widen their game and inject continuity. For all their set-piece woes at Twickenham they stretched England\u2019s defence and blew three tries through mistimed passes. \u201cWe can play different ways tactically, as we showed against England in the Six Nations,\u201d said Gatland. \u201cWe went out to play more attacking rugby at Twickenham and made a number of line breaks. There was some good stuff but, unfortunately, our error rate was high. The issue was execution not decision-making.\u201d Wales will again be without their Lions\u2019 full-back Leigh Halfpenny who has not played international rugby since being concussed during the victory over Australia last November. Anscombe\u2019s absence only adds to his value as a goal-kicker. \u201cWe know about Leigh and have to find out about some other players,\u201d said Gatland. \u201cWe have another opportunity to look at the same back three and he may not play in the next game. He has been training exceptionally well. He has been an important mainstay for us for a number of years and I am sure he will continue to be that. He will get some game time.\u201d Before the Six Nations match against England last February Gatland singled out the prop Kyle Sinckler for attention, questioning the length of his fuse. Not this time with the Harlequin, who was replaced after 56 minutes after conceding two penalties in as many minutes for indiscipline, named on the bench. \u201cI shook hands with Kyle on Sunday,\u201d said Gatland, who took Sinckler to New Zealand with the 2017 Lions. \u201cHe played exceptionally well for most of the time in that game in the Six Nations. Players have to be careful of their mindset on the pitch and, as he gets older, he will continue to get better. \u201cSometimes you make comments about players and they can be effective: the aim with Kyle was to impact on others so that they were constantly watching out for him. On other occasions you make remarks and get your pants pulled down, which happened over Dylan Hartley a few years ago. He won man of the match and made me look an idiot.\u201d",

Rory Burns, Joe Denly and Chris Woakes were among those struck by short-pitched deliveries from Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins, as the impressive fast bowling pair took three wickets apiece. But Burns, caught at short-leg by a ball from Cummins aimed at his ribs, believes the inclusion of Archer means the hosts now possess the tools with which to return fire. Burns, who followed his maiden Test hundred at Edgbaston by top-scoring with 53, said: \u201cIt\u2019s nice to get in a scrap. It\u2019s just getting in amongst it and trying to tough it out. I\u2019ve batted a few balls in this series and they are looking at different ways of getting me out. Nathan Lyon ran past me this morning and mentioned [bouncers] after about three balls, so I was well prepared.\u201d Asked about the similar treatment that was handed out to the lower order, Burns replied: \u201cIt\u2019s quite an obvious tactic and the boys are preparing for it. Luckily we can dish out some of our own in this game. It should be pretty interesting. [Archer] copped a fair few and so he\u2019s looking forward to getting his own back.\u201d England will need such spirit if they are to prevent Australia taking control on day three. Stuart Broad\u2019s late removal of David Warner for the third time in three innings \u2013 bowled through the gate by a ball that seamed \u2013 lifted the crowd during a testing final hour for Australia, with Archer denied the opener\u2019s wicket in the previous over after England failed to hear a nick behind. Archer was clocked at 92mph in his first outing \u2013 the fastest ball of the day \u2013 and the spinner Lyon, asked if he was looking forward to facing him, replied: \u201cMate, I can\u2019t bat, what do you reckon? I\u2019m No 10, they have a world-class bowling attack and Jofra is world class \u2013 the whole world knows that. But I want to challenge myself against the best in the world, so I\u2019ll give it a go.\u201d There was a milestone for Lyon earlier in the day, with the off-spinner taking three wickets to draw level with Dennis Lillee\u2019s haul of 355. Only Glenn McGrath (563) and Shane Warne (708) sit higher on Australia\u2019s all-time list. Lyon said: \u201cI really struggle to see myself up with the likes of Warne and McGrath. It doesn\u2019t sit well with me. Those guys are legends. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had the best day to be honest. Hazlewood was exceptional and the spell from Cummins after tea really set the tone. But for the standards we set, we weren\u2019t good enough.\u201d Beyond the action day two at Lord\u2019s was also a huge success for the Ruth Strauss Foundation. The charity was set up in the memory of the wife of Andrew Strauss, England\u2019s former Test captain, and looks to generate funds for research into rare forms of lung cancer. After asking spectators to wear red and donate, the total raised reached \u00a3382,462 by the close.",

An uncharacteristically loose first over got tapped for three boundaries, then he settled in. Down the slope the ball moved into the right-handed Joe Denly and across the left-handed Burns. Other times it held its line off the seam as they expected it to move.</p> <p>Denly inside-edged through the legs of Cameron Bancroft at bat-pad, then drove a boundary. Siddle was not fussed: his next over to Burns was a maiden and the last ball drew an edge to gully. Usman Khawaja dropped it.</p> <p>Denly nicked past the slip cordon and Siddle\u2019s five-over spell came to an end. Lunch came around, then eight more overs before his captain, Tim Paine, gave him the ball again. First ball back, another perfect seaming line, had Burns edging behind.

His previous ball had been to Jos Buttler, pitched up enough to entice a drive through the covers. Within three balls of coming back, Siddle bowled to Buttler again and held the length back. The ball straightened, drawing a grazed edge from one of England\u2019s most dangerous.</p> <p>It was another unheralded day for a typically unheralded bowler, who again had read the conditions and provided support for teammates more likely to draw the eye. It was just as in the first Test at Edgbaston, where his squeeze at 1.93 runs per over was vital in the first innings, along with picking up Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow along the way.</p> <p>Or again in the second innings, where he bowled one of the best none-fors you\u2019ll see: catches dropped, reviews overturned, edges galore and likewise never topped two per over until one last streaky boundary at the end.

The pace, the intimidation, the reputation but they also need balance. Siddle is the discipline, the fibre, the steamed brown rice you serve to balance the richer elements of the meal.</p> <p>In Lehmann\u2019s time Australian cricket thought it could drink a pot of molten cheese with Maltesers stirred through it.

      "bodyText": "If you were writing an Australia-focused article about the second day at Lord\u2019s, you would probably make your subject Josh Hazlewood: coming back into the Test side, taking the first three wickets, swinging Australia towards an excellent day. Failing that you would write about Patrick Cummins, his pace and bounce and aggression that likewise netted him three wickets in a bookend performance, stamping his dominance over fragile English batting. Or if not, you would write about Nathan Lyon, with his three wickets to equal the great Dennis Lillee on 355: a tale of the humble off-spinner who for Australia trails only the distant titans of Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne. What you would not do is write about Peter Siddle, with his consistent pitch and his 13 overs and his figures of one for 48 because an intrinsic part of covering Australian cricket is not writing about Siddle. He is always given the least attention, the least regard. Even as he began his first spell Geoffrey Boycott was firing popcorks on Test Match Special. \u201cYou can\u2019t take wickets at 80 mile an hour,\u201d was the general contention, which rather skirted around the work of Tim Murtagh for Ireland at the same ground three weeks ago or Mohammad Abbas for Pakistan in England last year. There was also some forgetfulness in arguing that Mitchell Starc should have been picked instead because he bowls faster, given that this exact arrangement had proved spectacularly unsuccessful when the coach, Darren Lehmann, insisted on it during Australia\u2019s previous tour. Siddle was not fashionable then nor is he fashionable now. He bowls seam on a length, over and over. He does not have rocket-speed or booming swing. During every match he plays for Australia you will find people questioning his presence, Australia supporters well represented among them. And during every match you will find Siddle striving to do what needs to be done. At Lord\u2019s he bowled behind Cummins and Hazlewood as per the natural order, from the Pavilion End with the slope running downhill from off stump to leg for the right-hander. An uncharacteristically loose first over got tapped for three boundaries, then he settled in. Down the slope the ball moved into the right-handed Joe Denly and across the left-handed Burns. Other times it held its line off the seam as they expected it to move. Denly inside-edged through the legs of Cameron Bancroft at bat-pad, then drove a boundary. Siddle was not fussed: his next over to Burns was a maiden and the last ball drew an edge to gully. Usman Khawaja dropped it. Denly nicked past the slip cordon and Siddle\u2019s five-over spell came to an end. Lunch came around, then eight more overs before his captain, Tim Paine, gave him the ball again. First ball back, another perfect seaming line, had Burns edging behind. This time Paine spilled the chance, then ended his bowler\u2019s spell after two overs when Cummins picked up Burns instead. Siddle came back a few overs later. His previous ball had been to Jos Buttler, pitched up enough to entice a drive through the covers. Within three balls of coming back, Siddle bowled to Buttler again and held the length back. The ball straightened, drawing a grazed edge from one of England\u2019s most dangerous. It was another unheralded day for a typically unheralded bowler, who again had read the conditions and provided support for teammates more likely to draw the eye. It was just as in the first Test at Edgbaston, where his squeeze at 1.93 runs per over was vital in the first innings, along with picking up Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow along the way. Or again in the second innings, where he bowled one of the best none-fors you\u2019ll see: catches dropped, reviews overturned, edges galore and likewise never topped two per over until one last streaky boundary at the end. Neither of these efforts will yield the credit they should. If Australia are to win in England at last, of course they need the big players. The pace, the intimidation, the reputation but they also need balance. Siddle is the discipline, the fibre, the steamed brown rice you serve to balance the richer elements of the meal. In Lehmann\u2019s time Australian cricket thought it could drink a pot of molten cheese with Maltesers stirred through it. That is not a viable diet any more.",

Five, if you include Jason Roy, who bats lower down in the county championship for Surrey.</p> <p>Surrey\u2019s director of cricket, Alec Stewart, keeps saying Roy ought be in the Test team too, but there is not much room left down there.

The Championship club\u2019s youth side were withdrawn by their coach, Paul Furlong, last week after players complained they had been subjected to monkey noises and racist abuse from their Seville-based opponents. It is understood QPR\u2019s players informed the referee during the game of three separate incidents of alleged racism during the second half and, once the official had failed to take appropriate action, were instructed to leave the playing area by their coaching staff. The official was an independent referee. They have been in dialogue with the Football Association since returning from Spain, with QPR having now contacted Fifa to make them aware of the incident. The Andalusian football federation has opened its own investigation into the allegations.

Maturity is when the government repays the debt at the end of the term. When more investors are buying government bonds prices go up, and yields drop.</p>\n    <p>Companies can also issue bonds.</p>\n    <p><b>What happens when the yield curve inverts?</b></p>\n    <p>This is when the yield on short-term bonds is higher than on long-term bonds. It means that traders are accepting a lower interest rate to hold longer-dated bonds than the shorter-dated alternative.</p>\n    <p>It\u2019s relatively rare \u2013 investors typically get higher returns for lending over the long term, as this is seen as riskier than short-term lending. They also expect to be compensated for the impact of inflation, which will eat into investments over time.</p>\n    <p><b>What does it mean?</b></p>\n    <p>An inverted yield curve is a classic signal of a looming recession \u2013 in the US, the curve has inverted ahead of every recession over the past 50 years. It falsely signalled a recession just once, at the time of the 1998 Russian financial crisis.</p>\n    <p>For other countries the signal is less clear. Several have experienced long periods of inverted yield curves without a subsequent recession, notably the UK in the 1990s.</p>\n    <p><b>Why is it happening now?</b></p>\n    <p>The yield curve for two- to 10-year US government bonds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/aug/14/germany-economy-shrinks-gdp-recession-uk-inflation-stock-markets-business-live\">has inverted for the first time since 2007</a>, just before the start of the global financial crisis. This indicates that investors are seriously worried about an economic downturn, which would keep inflation low. They are worried about the impact on the already-weak global economy of the prolonged trade war between the US and China, along with Brexit.</p>\n    <p><b>Is recession inevitable?</b></p>\n    <p>No, but it is highly likely. And an inverted yield curve driven by recession fears risks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy, knocking confidence and causing businesses to cut back on investment.</p>\n    <p><b>How soon does recession tend to follow yield curve inversion?</b></p>\n    <p>Previous downturns show that yields have typically inverted 18 months, on average, before a recession began. <b>Julia Kollewe</b></p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A dash to safety meant the US bond yield curve inverted for the second day running.

Eighteen leaders including Australia\u2019s Scott Morrison, New Zealand\u2019s Jacinda Ardern and Fiji\u2019s Frank Bainimarama met for almost 12 hours at the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), and its chair, Enele Sopoaga, the Tuvaluan prime minister, described the talks as \u201ca very, very tough, difficult struggle\u201d. Some attending nations had hoped all 18 members would commit to policies to limit temperature rises to no more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, but the leaders agreed to an opt-out from specific measures they opposed. A communique was passed with a qualification saying not all countries supported a strong statement issued by a group of small island Pacific states earlier in the week, which had called for an immediate global ban on the construction of new coal-fired power plants and coalmines and for all countries to rapidly phase out use of coal in the power sector. Asked after the session if the qualification had come from a country starting with the letter A, Sopoaga laughed and said: \u201cYeah, absolutely.\u201d Australia is the only such nation in the 18. Morrison refused to be drawn about whether Australia was responsible for the qualification. \u201cIt\u2019s not incumbent on any member state to endorse that statement, it\u2019s a statement of the small Pacific states,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "Bull on Burns ... Lemon on Siddle ... That\u2019s it for today\u2019s blog. I\u2019ll leave you with a match report from Lord\u2019s. Goodnight! That\u2019s an excellent day\u2019s work for Australia. Tim Paine took a risk by choosing to field, but his bowlers delivered again to dismiss England for an under-par 258. And although Stuart Broad dismissed David Warner cheaply during a fiery opening spell, Australia will be happy enough to finish on 30 for 1. They have a great chance to bat England out of the match - and perhaps the series - tomorrow. England will hope the forecast for a gloomy day is correct, and that they get a few hours in helpful conditions before it pours down. 13th over: Australia 30-1 (Bancroft 5, Khawaja 18) Khawaja flicks Archer breezily through midwicket for an all-run four. He has played him comfortable so far, and it\u2019s a bit of a surprise that Archer hasn\u2019t tried from over the wicket. Bancroft, meanwhile, gets solidly in line to the last ball of the day. He had a difficult hour but the sun will come up tomorrow and he\u2019ll be not out. 12th over: Australia 23-1 (Bancroft 5, Khawaja 11) A lucky escape for Khawaja, who tries to pull Woakes and contrives to toe-end the ball towards the slips. It bounces short and squirts through for a single, which is a blessing for England as it gives Woakes four balls at Bancroft. He edges the third on the bounce to third slip - but he survives another over, and you have to admire his determination to get through such a torrid spell. He has 5 from 34 balls. 11th over: Australia 22-1 (Bancroft 5, Khawaja 10) Archer replaces Broad, who bowled a cracking spell of 5-0-13-1. This is the end from which Archer prefers to bowl at Lord\u2019s, and he shows why with a majestic, scrambled-seam delivery that beats Bancroft all ends up. Another maiden from Archer, who has slightly flattering figures of 5-3-3-0. \u201cI like how Root has spoken in the media the past couple of weeks but his management of his bowlers here is awful, and may cost England the Ashes (yes!),\u201d says Andrew Hurley. \u201cThis hour could have yielded 4 wickets with Broad and Woakes... he\u2019s like a Sun reader believing the hype. Archer has big potential at this level, but that\u2019s it for now, and to chuck him in with the new ball and waste this hour is criminal.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t go that far but I know what you mean. I would definitely have started with Woakes. I suspect it was something they decided before the lights went on, and Root didn\u2019t have the nerve to change plan. 10th over: Australia 22-1 (Bancroft 5, Khawaja 10) Woakes replaces Archer. After a few looseners, he produced a lovely nipbacker that hits Khawaja high on the leg. It was too high for an LBW appeal but it was superbly bowled. 9th over: Australia 20-1 (Bancroft 5, Khawaja 8) Bancroft, who looks in terrible form, is fighting so hard to get through to the close. Batting looks a lot more serene for Khawaja, who works Broad for a couple of singles in that over. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cEngland\u2019s World Cup win seems to have taken a lot out of David Warner.\u201d 8th over: Australia 17-1 (Bancroft 4, Khawaja 6) Archer continues, which for my money is a mistake; 180s for show, doubles for dough and all that. He\u2019s still bowling some cracking deliveries, because he is a magnificent bowler, and Bancroft struggles through another maiden that includes a big inside edge and a play-and-miss outside off stump. 7th over: Australia 17-1 (Bancroft 4, Khawaja 6) Broad is bowling masterfully to the left-handers from round the wicket. Khawaja pushes a full-length delivery that snaps off the seam to beat the outside edge. The next ball turns him round and thumps into the back leg, but the height negates Broad\u2019s enthusiastic LBW appeal. When Broad goes a bit too straight, Khawaja puts him away through square leg with the minimum of fuss. Gorgeous shot. 6th over: Australia 13-1 (Bancroft 4, Khawaja 2) These are very tough batting conditions, with the lights on and the ball nipping around. Bancroft is beaten by another fine delivery from Archer, who bowled his first maiden in Test cricket. He has produced some beauties in this spell, but he has also been a bit too wide at times. Bancroft only had to play at two of the six deliveries in that over. I\u2019d get Woakes on at this end for the last half hour. The conditions are perfect, and he has a bowling average of 9.75 on this ground. I\u2019d fancy him to take care of Bancroft tonight. 5th over: Australia 13-1 (Bancroft 4, Khawaja 2) This is the first time since 2013 that Warner has been out in single figures in three consecutive innings. England will be encouraged not just by his scores but the way he is batting. I can\u2019t remember him looking so obviously out of nick at any point in his career. He\u2019s gone now! Warner gets his third single-figure score of this series, and Broad had dismissed him every time. It was a beautiful delivery from Broad, which roared back through the gate to thump into the bails. Brilliant bowling. 4th over: Australia 10-0 (Bancroft 3, Warner 3) Warner is beaten twice outside off stump by Archer. The first was a beauty, which straightened from round the wicket; the second was a short one that Warner tried to uppercut. Hang on, the Ultra-Edge technology suggests Warner edged that first delivery from Archer! There was no appeal from England, not even an enquiry. 3rd over: Australia 9-0 (Bancroft 2, Warner 3) Warner edges a fine delivery from Broad a fraction short of Roy in the slips. He doesn\u2019t look in great touch, with his head falling over to the off side, and England need to make him play as much as possible tonight. 2nd over: Australia 7-0 (Bancroft 2, Warner 1) It\u2019s gloomy and the lights are on; perfect bowling conditions for Chris Woakes, really. But Archer\u2019s charisma is irresistible. His second ball is a big nipbacker that goes through the gate of Bancroft and flies to the left of Bairstow for four. I\u2019m pretty sure there was a thin inside-edge but it was given as byes. That aside it was no more than a reasonable over, as the batsmen only had to play at three of the six deliveries. \u201cNot only has Dale Steyn been a terrific fast bowler and a great bloke,\u201d says Rod Lyall, \u201che proved in Amsterdam in 2013 that he\u2019s a world-class barman as well.\u201d Did he make a cocktail called Stumpbuster? Jofra Archer, not Chris Woakes, will share the new ball. That decision impresses the crowd much. 1st over: Australia 1-0 (Bancroft 1, Warner 0) Stuart Broad\u2019s first over is an uneventful affair. Warner, who struggled against Broad at Edgbaston, offers no stroke to the wide balls and defends the straight ones. There are 18 overs remaining tonight, though we won\u2019t get them all as play is scheduled to finish at 7pm. KP had a point (part 1 in an ongoing series) Bairstow sacrifices himself for the team. He tried to slog-sweep Lyon for six but top-edged it high towards deep midwicket, where Khawaja took a comfortable catch. It was a fine innings though, his best in Test cricket for a while. 77th over: England 258-9 (Bairstow 52, Leach 6) Bairstow gives Leach two balls from Cummins to survive. He does that and more, jumping across his stumps to work a short ball to the fine-leg boundary. \u201c\u00c0propos of nothing, a little mention for the greatest bowler of my lifetime, Dale Steyn, who is retiring from Tests this week,\u201d says Andrew Hurley. \u201cWhen you look at his average, it\u2019s obscene, as he played mostly in an era with greater batsmen/greater application than today. An absolute animal (you\u2019ll know what I mean!), and the harder the challenge, the better he was. I still feel he\u2019s a little underappreciated outside the purists but a true great of the game (and that is applying that word strictly).\u201d I agree. He was an awesome bowler in all conditions, and his record in Asia is exhibit A in the case for his all-time greatness. A brilliant bloke, too. I\u2019ll always remember the only time I met him, when I was allowed my yearly trip out of the OBO dungeon to do a South African press day at Canterbury in 2012. There were a few rubbish round-table interviews, but Steyn\u2019s was a great advert for doing absolutely no media training. 76th over: England 253-9 (Bairstow 51, Leach 2) 75th over: England 251-9 (Bairstow 51, Leach 0) A maiden from Cummins to Bairstow, who survives a big LBW appeal off the last delivery. It was missing leg. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine England would be too upset with their work today,\u201d says James Lane. \u201cThey were sent in and were six down for not many, yet they\u2019re only 60-odd short of the average Lord\u2019s first innings score of 312. Plus they don\u2019t have to face Lyon in the last innings.\u201d Well, you say that... 74th over: England 251-9 (Bairstow 51, Leach 0) \u201cAfternoon, Rob,\u201d says Phil Sawyer. \u201cJohn Starbuck (66th over) informs us that one of the questions in the concussion test is \u2018Who\u2019s on the throne?\u2019 The answer, presumably, is whichever bat is next in to face Hazlewood and Cummins.\u201d Nathan Lyon, left-hander; you know the rest. Broad inside-edges a quicker delivery onto the leg bail to end a jaunty innings of 11 from 15 balls, and Australia are one wicket away from wrapping things up. 73rd over: England 246-8 (Bairstow 50, Broad 7) Jonny Bairstow pushes Cummins for a single to reach a commendable half-century, his 21st in Tests, and then Broad is dropped by Warner! He top-edged a heave at Cummins that flew high over the slips. Warner ran back, dived forward ... and palmed the ball to the boundary for four runs. The next ball, a short one down the leg side, runs away for four byes. Every little helps, especially when you\u2019re trying to recover from 138 for six. 72nd over: England 235-8 (Bairstow 49, Broad 1) Lyon tosses up a series of deliveries outside off stump to Broad, who manages to resist the considerable temptation to plonk his front knee and slog across the line for Queen and country. A maiden. 71st over: England 235-8 (Bairstow 49, Broad 1) The new batsman is Stuart Broad, which means Jack Leach - who made 92 on this ground in his last Test innings- is demoted to No11 after making 92 in his previous Test innings. Cummins immediately sticks one under his armpit, and Broad does really well to drop it down in front of short leg. This is nasty stuff from Cummins, which I\u2019m sure will be reciprocated by Jofra Archer when Australia\u2019s lower order come to bat. Broad takes a single to get off strike, and then Bairstow plays a superb pull stroke behind square for four. He\u2019s batted really admirably today. Cummins has bounced out another one. Archer, trying to flick a well-well-directed short ball to leg, got a leading edge that looped over gully and was nicely taken on the run by Khawaja. 70th over: England 229-7 (Bairstow 44, Archer 12) Lyon replaces Hazlewood, presumably with the intention of making Archer an offer he can\u2019t refuse. Not in that over, which is played sensibly by both batsmen. 69th over: England 225-7 (Bairstow 41, Archer 11) Archer ducks under yet another bouncer from Cummins, who is now being lightly booed every time he bowls a short ball. The next delivery is very full - but it\u2019s also too straight, and Archer flicks it off his pads for four. Another wristy, this time from a short ball, loops up before landing safely wide of square leg. \u201cTotally agree re: Bairstow maybe not knowing how good he could be,\u201d says Simon Yates. \u201cAnd how good could he be if he didn\u2019t keep? Might we end up with a Stewart/Sangakkara situation where loads more runs come without the gloves? If you\u2019re Gilchrist coming in behind that Aussie top order then you don\u2019t care about that potential loss as you\u2019ve got plenty of runs anyway. Likewise if playing your best keeper would mean promoting Andy Caddick to No7 and Alan Mullally to No8 then other priorities are in play. But where none of your middle order is making enough runs and you\u2019ve got a better keeper in the wings who is a very decent bat, why not give it a go even though we know YJB values the gloves maybe too much?\u201d One thing that\u2019s interesting about Sangakkara, who averaged 40 as a wicketkeeper and 67 when he played solely as a batsman, was that he didn\u2019t want to give up the gloves either. 68th over: England 220-7 (Bairstow 41, Archer 6) Archer is beaten, wafting loosely outside off stump at Hazlewood. But he gets his first boundary with a flashing back cut off the next ball. Excellent shot. \u201cDear Rob,\u201d says Boris Starling. \u201cRe concussion tests, I don\u2019t know about cricket, but I ghosted a recently-retired rugby player\u2019s autobiography earlier this year and learned that the rugby one is pretty stringent. Among other things they make the player: repeat strings of words and numbers (sometimes backwards) perform a tandem gait test (walk heel to toe over a predetermined distance) and answer questions about the match in progress (who\u2019s playing, where they are, what the score is, who scored last, and so on.)\u201d In that case, I\u2019ve played cricket with people who were confused before a ball was bowled. 67th over: England 215-7 (Bairstow 41, Archer 1) He\u2019s yet to show it in international cricket, where he averages 3.25, but Archer is a useful lower-order batsman. He has a first-class average of 31, including six fifties. But he won\u2019t have faced many bowlers like Pat Cummins. The first ball Archer receives is a beautiful bouncer that whistles past his helmet, and the next time zip over his shoulder. Cummins has clearly decided to bomb England\u2019s lower order, an approach that worked so well for Australia in the Ashes series of 2013-14 and 2017-18. Archer fences another short ball that just evades Bancroft at short leg and runs away for a single. 66th over: England 214-7 (Bairstow 41, Archer 0) Bairstow toe-ends Hazlewood through the slips for four. England need plenty more boundaries where that came from. \u201cTraditionally, concussion tests start by asking, \u2018How many fingers am I holding up?\u2019\u201d says John Starbuck. \u2018Are you feeling sick?\u2019 Then things like, \u2018Who is on the throne?\u2019 \u2018Who are your opponents today?\u2019 \u2018What did you have for lunch?\u2019 The question, \u2018Who is the prime minister?\u2019 is no longer asked for fear of provoking a relapse.\u201d 65th over: England 210-7 (Bairstow 37, Archer 0) Jofra Archer is the new batsman. He\u2019s out! Cummins\u2019 short ball shaved the glove of Woakes and was taken down the leg side by Paine. That\u2019s brilliant bowling from Cummins, who gave Woakes a ferocious working-over with the short ball. He is so good at roughing people up. Woakes is given out caught behind - but he has reviewed! Australia seemed convinced, but then so did Woakes. My instinct is that it\u2019s out. 64.4 overs: England 210-6 (Bairstow 37, Woakes 32) Woakes misses a hook at a bouncer from Cummins. \u201cHe\u2019s a little bit of a happy hooker,\u201d says Nasser on Sky - and Woakes proves the point by top-edging the next ball over fine leg for six! He had no control over the stroke, which should give Cummins sufficient encouragement to persist with this line - or rather, length - of attack. That\u2019s precisely what he does, and two balls later Woakes ducks into a short delivery that keeps a bit low and slams into the back of his helmet. The Australian players are straight over to see if he\u2019s okay. He seems to be, though there will be a break in play while he has a concussion test. Does anyone know what those tests actually entail? 64th over: England 203-6 (Bairstow 37, Woakes 26) England have started watchfully after tea, as much as anything because of the quality of the Australian bowling. They give you so little. The Ruth Strauss Foundation Day has been a triumph. Not that it was ever going to be anything else, but there have been some lovely touches, like her sons Samuel and Luca ringing the five-minute bell at the start of play. 63rd over: England 202-6 (Bairstow 37, Woakes 25) Australia are 9/4 to win this match, which is mildly discombobulating. I would make them strongish favourites at this stage. Cummins starts from the other end to Bairstow, who is content to play out a maiden. It\u2019s so good to see him playing with such focus and determination. I\u2019m not sure he realises how good a Test-match batsman he can be. 62nd over: England 202-6 (Bairstow 37, Woakes 25) Josh Hazlewood will start after tea to Jonny Bairstow. He, like Woakes, has played some of his best Test innings on this ground, including that immense, heartbreaking 95 against South Africa in 2012. Man, that feels a long time ago. It\u2019s a quiet over to start the session. Bairstow shovels Hazlewood off the hip for a single, and that\u2019s your lot. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to make my debut as an OBOer smugly messaging from an exotic location, sitting as I am by Lake Titicaca,\u201d says David Hopkins. \u201cSounds as if that location also ends with a neat description of where England\u2019s top order have left the team, right in the caca.\u201d The players are back out on the field. This will be a long evening session; there are still 37 overs remaining, and two and a half hours in which to bowl them. 61st over: England 201-6 (Bairstow 36, Woakes 25) That\u2019s tea. England recovered quite well after a desperate start to the afternoon session, when they slipped from 92-2 to 138-6. After a nervous start, Jonny Bairstow started to look like himself for the first time in this summer\u2019s Tests, while Chris Woakes played with his usual shrewdness. Australia were excellent, especially Josh Hazlewood. See you in 20 minutes for the evening session. 60th over: England 198-6 (Bairstow 34, Woakes 24) Smith produces a superb legbreak to Woakes, who edges it just wide of the man at slip. That\u2019s why Smith is a threat, because there are usually jaffas amid the filth. 59th over: England 193-6 (Bairstow 32, Woakes 21) Woakes, who has again batted admirably, works Lyon into the leg side for a single. He really does love playing here. 58th over: England 191-6 (Bairstow 31, Woakes 20) \u201cGiven that keeping (in its good or bad forms) can have such an impact on a result, why do we put runs pressure on a specialist skill anyway?\u201d says Matt Wyatt. \u201c(Did Broad get dropped for a five-year dip in form with the bat?) How many runs/wickets are saved/snaffled by having the best (Foakes) in the job versus how well they fit into into a misfiring middle order? How many wickets did James Foster contribute to at Essex just by the batter knowing who was standing behind him? In keeping terms YJB and Jos are a bit tat, aren\u2019t they. Sarah Taylor is miles better but we\u2019re probably a generation away from that conversation. Plus Foakes\u2019 contained batting style might just be the ticket here. Damn the heck Gilchrist, you ruined everything.\u201d It was happening even before Gilchrist, though he took it to another level. It\u2019s just the established culture; doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right or wrong. I suspect it might change slightly when wicketkeeping data becomes widespread. Yes, Bairstow survives. It was missing off stump by a distance. That was a poor decision from Australia, who have no reviews remaining. AUSTRALIA REVIEW FOR LBW AGAINST BAIRSTOW! Steve Smith is the bowler, as well. I think it\u2019s missing off stump. 57th over: England 190-6 (Bairstow 31, Woakes 19) Bairstow brings up the fifty partnership with consecutive boundaries off Lyon. The first was a drive through the covers, the second a frisky reverse sweep. These are encouraging signs for England, who are a much better side when Bairstow is in punishing form with the bat. 56th over: England 179-6 (Bairstow 21, Woakes 19) A sensational maiden from Hazlewood, an homage to the Lord\u2019s bogeyman. He rips a leg-cutter past the outside edge of Woakes, who edges the next ball a fraction short of Warner. That\u2019s the second time an edge has fallen short of Warner in this Hazlewood spell, and the chaps on Sky think he\u2019s too deep. The over ends with another one beating Woakes\u2019 outside edge. 55th over: England 179-6 (Bairstow 21, Woakes 19) Lyon changes ends to replace Siddle, and Bairstow drags consecutive sweeps for two and then four. He looks much more focussed today than he did in the first two Tests of the summer, and has played his part in a useful partnership of 42 from 9.4 overs. \u201cSome possible companions for Kim Thonger\u2019s team,\u201d begins Brian Withington. \u201cJason RoyoftheArgonauts, James Anderson-Shelter, Stuart Broadsword, Jonathan Barsteward, Josiah Gentleman\u2019sGentleman. I can\u2019t go on.\u201d 54th over: England 172-6 (Bairstow 14, Woakes 18) Things always feel a little calmer when Chris Woakes is at the crease. It\u2019s not that he gets hundreds of runs, but there\u2019s an order and commonsense to his batting. And, occasionally, a flamboyant flick-pull throughy midwicket for four off Josh Hazlewood. Shot! \u201cIt\u2019s a paradox (at least I think it is) that England\u2019s World Cup heroes have played both too little and too much cricket,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cBetween 30 May and 14 July, they played a maximum of 11 days cricket, which shouldn\u2019t tax a professional sportsman... except mentally, the burden of being hosts and favourites not to be underestimated. That\u2019s left Jason Roy, Joe Root, Jos Buttler, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow and Moeen Ali both undercooked and exhausted. They don\u2019t look like they have a century amongst them - or even between them - and there\u2019s no time to work through the horrendous technical issues they\u2019re exhibiting, most obviously in the complete lack of balance, forward or back and across the crease. 1989 might look like a picnic before this series is out.\u201d England could lose this five-Test series 12-0, and it still wouldn\u2019t be as big a shambles as 1989. 53rd over: England 167-6 (Bairstow 13, Woakes 14) One thing that will irritate England is that, with the exception of Jason Roy, every batsman has faced at least 20 balls. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve batted terribly. It\u2019s been a combination of relentless bowling and some iffy shot selection. \u201cThe thing about the middle order,\u201d says Pete Salmon, \u201cis that each one of them, Stokes down to Woakes, is a really terrific number 7, who you would expect to average about what they do, and score centuries about as often. But having them bat 5-9 or 3-8 or whatever doesn\u2019t work. Especially coming in at 3 or 4 for not many. With a functioning top order, Stokes at 6 and Bairstow (or Foakes or Butter) at 7 seems right. So can this stupid experiment end and we pick five batsmen, then the middle order mob? And then revisit the idea of Total Crickball with 11 allrounders in about 2032?\u201d I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve dropped Butter. 52nd over: England 165-6 (Bairstow 12, Woakes 13) Bairstow edges the new bowler Hazlewood just short of Lyon at first slip - and then Woakes thick-edges an attempted yorker for three. That almost cleaned him up. Hazlewood has been quite majestic today. \u201cSo why is it that the World Cup appears to have shattered England\u2019s Test team, but Australia appear fresh as daisies?\u201d says Mike Jakeman. \u201cWas it the final? The effect of winning the thing or the pressure of having it on your own doorstep? There are similar numbers of WC players in each team...\u201d As a former elite tiddlywinker, I can confirm it takes a lot more out of you when you win a World Cup \u2013 especially if it\u2019s at home and/or feels like the holy grail. That said, I don\u2019t think it has been a huge factor. Buttler looks shattered mentally, Bairstow did in the first two Tests but looks more focussed today. Stokes and Woakes seem fine. 51st over: England 161-6 (Bairstow 11, Woakes 10) \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Kim Thonger. \u201cI\u2019m becoming a bit obsessed with some of the earliest England Test cricketers. Wonderful names. Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley. Billy Midwinter. Mordecai Sherwin. Perhaps some of our current team should change their names by deed poll to something more exotic? Rory Burnsnight? Joseph Rootvegetable? I could go on.\u201d I\u2019ve always liked Sandford Schultz, who could have been a dastardly swine in an Agatha Christie novel. 50th over: England 160-6 (Bairstow 10, Woakes 10) This is a really entertaining little spell; every over seems to contain a boundary and a near miss. Lyon has an unsuccessful LBW shout against Woakes \u2013 it turned too much \u2013 before Woakes dances down the track to drive through extra cover for four. \u201cIf England can make 200+ today they\u2019ll think they\u2019ve done well,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cAbout two-thirds less than they should, but circumstances change expectations.\u201d 49th over: England 156-6 (Bairstow 10, Woakes 6) Bairstow survives an optimistic LBW appeal from Siddle; it was missing leg. Four leg byes take extras onto a dogged 18 not out. \u201cSo,\u201d says Geoff Wignall, \u201cdo you think Foakes is unable to get into the team because of his 40+ batting average or because he\u2019s the best male keeper in the country by a wide margin (probably best on the planet).\u201d 48th over: England 151-6 (Bairstow 10, Woakes 5) Good batting from Woakes, who dances down the track to clip Lyon through midwicket for four. Woakes averages 70 with the bat on this ground, which doubtless means he\u2019s due a failure. \u201cWas the World Cup win worth it for this?\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cThis note comes to you from rhetorical.questions.com.\u201d 47th over: England 146-6 (Bairstow 10, Woakes 0) Bairstow thumps Siddle wide of mid-on for his first boundary, an excellent stroke which he repeats through mid-off later in the over. It looks like he\u2019s going to counter-attack. England were 131 for five when Bairstow and Woakes came together against India on this ground a year ago; they added 189. England would take half that partnership now, even if it would leave them on the slightly unusual score of 232.5 for seven. \u201cOh god, I hope you\u2019re wrong about 1989 Rob, but it\u2019s a pretty good shout,\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cThe Oval Test in that series was my first live international and Ashes experience. What a day that wasn\u2019t. Yes, the glory of Test cricket, but a dead rubber, a Dean Jones ton and watching Gooch lbw to Alderman third ball just before the close. Finished off by David Boon telling 14-year old me to bugger off when I asked for his autograph after play. Halcyon days.\u201d 46th over: England 138-6 (Bairstow 2, Woakes 0) This isn\u2019t good, you know. If you\u2019re an England fan, that is. If you\u2019re an Australian fan, the prospect of a first series win in England for 18 years is growing by the minute. \u201cOn the plus side, England are still two wickets better off than Australia were in the first Test,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cOn the downside, they\u2019re exactly one Steve Smith worse off.\u201d Uh-oh. Stokes tries to sweep Lyon round the corner, misses and is plumb LBW. Lyon adds another to his collection of left-handers; he\u2019s dismissed 132 in his Test career. 45th over: England 138-5 (Stokes 13, Bairstow 2) Now Bairstow is beaten, pushing at a textbook delivery from Siddle that straightens sharply off the seam. A maiden. This is a seriously good bowling attack, you know. 44th over: England 138-5 (Stokes 13, Bairstow 2) Stokes is beaten, groping hopefully at a delicious offbreak from Lyon, who beats the outside edge again with a quicker one later in the over. That was a beautiful over. He is in his element bowling to left-handers, no matter how good they are. 43rd over: England 137-5 (Stokes 13, Bairstow 1) Bairstow offers no stroke to his first ball, which whistles this far past the off bail, and then gets a last-gasp inside edge to negate what would have been a very good LBW appeal. \u201cIf I have had a pound for every pundit that said England\u2019s strength was the middle order...\u201d says Simon Yates. \u201cNobody batting from 4-8 in this side has an average over 35. We\u2019re distracted by their destructive potential (and ODI form), and by their all being handy No7s, but the stats say we\u2019re wrong. Not one of them has an average that demands selection in a Test match. (Not that alternatives are obvious!)\u201d This is an excellent point. I\u2019d argue the lower middle order was England\u2019s strength, certainly in the summers of 2016 and 2017, but they have struggled since then for various reasons. As you say, they are all so good to watch when playing well \u2013 like Stokes at the moment \u2013 that it feels like they score more runs than is actually the case. (Gary Ballance had the opposite problem.) In fact, since the end of the 2017 season, England have only one batsman averaging over 40 in any position, and he can\u2019t get in the team. Thanks Adam, hello everyone. Tonight, Australia are gonna party like it\u2019s 1989. This Ashes is starting to bear a strong resemblance to that never-to-be-forgotten shellacking, and if England don\u2019t get their act together very quickly they could be facing a similar scoreline. They are really struggling. Buttler brought forward by Siddle, his tiny edge landing safely in the gloves of Paine. He really earned that, two earlier chances off his bowling going down behind the wicket. Another unconvincing innings from the England bruiser. They\u2019re in some strife now. With that, it is drinks. Over to Rob Smyth. Thanks for your company! 42nd over: England 136-4 (Buttler 12, Stokes 13) Lyon to Stokes is the match-up that Australia want and it so nearly gets them the wicket they know they will need early, an edge not far away from Smith\u2019s diving left hand. Stokes was cutting rather than pushing, getting four for it. Gosh, there\u2019s nothing wrong with the shot to end the over though, getting down low to hammer the spinner in front of the square leg umpire for four. Have that. 41st over: England 128-4 (Buttler 12, Stokes 5) Cummins to Buttler, who gets one behind square; Stokes giving him the strike right back with a single to cover. Buttler deals better with the bouncer this time around, then defending another short ball deep in the crease. \u201cNow that CrickViz have real data on every ball, can they tell us if there really is a significant effect of the ball deviating down the slope?\u201d asks Stephen Barnes. \u201cYup, I\u2019m a data nut.\u201d Good shout. I\u2019ll ask them at the tea break. \u201cSo on the plus side Joe Denly managed to improve his average today,\u201d notes Geoff Wignall. \u201cRather less encouragingly, he now has one half century in 9 innings - exactly the same as Jack Leach at a near identical average (and well below Chris Woakes\u2019s: 22 compared with 30). Time for Sibley and Roy at number four?\u201d I thought Denly was better today? Undone by some excellent fast bowling. But at his age, he will need bulk runs and soon. 40th over: England 126-4 (Buttler 11, Stokes 4) Lyon is back for Siddle, whipped by Butter to wide long-on for one to begin. Stokes, who fell twice to the tweaker at Edgbaston, plays the rest defensively off the front foot. Lyon slips one straight ball past the left-hander\u2019s inside edge but it was going well down the legside. 39th over: England 125-4 (Buttler 10, Stokes 4) The focus is on the catch but Cummins has done everything right since lunch, especially with his relentless short-pitched attack. Whoa, now I\u2019ve written that, he sprays a short and loose ball at Stokes, who watches five wides get added to the total. Paine had no chance there. He gets off the mark himself with a boundary too, rocking back to pull a ball that isn\u2019t that short. The England all-rounder is in superb touch at the moment. \u201cHow many times in the history of test cricket has a batsman scored 5 runs from his first ball faced?\u201d asks Kip Wilckens re Buttler\u2019s first shot today. I have also been asked this on twitter. Anyone? WHAT A CATCH!!! One of the best I\u2019ve seen at short leg, diving with his non-preferred left-hand. They check upstairs that Bancroft\u2019s fingers are under the ball and Joel Wilson confirms that they are. 38th over: England 116-3 (Burns 53, Buttler 10) Buttler into double figures, pushing a Siddle half-volley through cover with ease. The delivery before found a leading edge but didn\u2019t go to hand. 37th over: England 112-3 (Burns 53, Buttler 6) Sorry about the delay, playing catch-up after a wifi drop-out. Cummins whacked Burns with a short one on the arm and then did it again. That\u2019s where he\u2019s so effective, aiming time and again for the area between the hip and shoulder. Nasty. But Burns is brave, getting inside the line to clip a couple down behind square to finish the over. 36th over: England 109-3 (Burns 51, Buttler 5) Good grief. PAINE HAS DROPPED BURNS from Pete Siddle\u2019s first ball back. That\u2019s the second bad drop off his bowling today. It is difficult to understand why the captain was going with one hand; so out of character. Sure enough, runs come for the opener later in the over, a second push past point for two raising his half-century. Sure, he\u2019s been dropped twice along the way but he\u2019s still there. \u201cHe\u2019s an old-fashioned opener,\u201d says Kumar Sangakkara. \u201c There for the hard graft.\u201d 35th over: England 105-3 (Burns 47, Buttler 5) Maiden from Cummins to the new man Buttler and a good one too, prompting a waft that could easily have ended up with a catch behind the wicket. Hazlewood might be the man with the wickets but Cummins has also been right on the money today across all of his spells. \u201cUnless we have hard stats,\u201d suggests Luke Baxter, \u201ccouldn\u2019t it also be the perception that Broad is dropped more often because he always makes a bit of a song and a dance about it all. Gives his guilty teammate a really nasty stare!\u201d Quite possibly. I acknowledge that this could all be in my head. \u201cIs this a world record for the most amount of first names starting with J in a cricket team?\u201d asks Pete Duffy from the mighty Mentone Cricket Club. 34th over: England 105-3 (Burns 47, Buttler 5) Four overthrows via a deflection! Of course it is! Not quite as dramatic as on Sunday 14 July, but Lyon\u2019s throw from mid-on at Buttler\u2019s end flicks his pad, enough to confuse the man backing up. Two more boundaries in the over too, the first in the byes column when Hazlewood sprays too wide for Paine down the legside then Burns gets four off his edge through about fourth slip. He made a lot of his runs at Edgbaston right there. In fairness to the opener, he\u2019s playing with soft hands - it wouldn\u2019t have carried to a catcher had there been one in there. 33rd over: England 92-3 (Burns 43, Buttler 0) What an important Burns plays now as the senior player, coming off a ton in his last start. He does as he must, defending then leaving. Cummins goes short to finish and he\u2019s up to the task there too with a timely sway. \u201cGood afternoon and a happy birthday, Adam.\u201d Cheers, Phil Sawyer. \u201cThis was the lunch at Lord\u2019s today. I\u2019d dearly love to know if anyone has taken to the field for the afternoon with a belly full of treacle sponge.\u201d Mitch Johnson\u2019s recollection was that the fast bowlers here spent ten minutes anihilating as much food as possible - main and dessert - before retiring to the dressing room for half an hour of recovery. The plan works! Cummins worked Denly over in the previous over and Hazlewood set him up perfectly for the outside edge. The No4 wafted at a delivery earlier in the set, then got under another brisk bouncer. Next up: right in the channel, he had to play. Gone. 32nd over: England 92-3 (Burns 43) 31st over: England 91-2 (Burns 42, Denly 30) Stinger! Denly can\u2019t get out the way of Cummins\u2019 short ball, whacked on the arm. He gives is a shake and gets on with it. Next up, the fast bowler did as he must with a follow-up bumper, jumping sharply over Denly and Tim Paine for four byes. Nothing wrong with that. Top Test Match cricket, this. 30th over: England 87-2 (Burns 42, Denly 30) That\u2019s back to the pre-lunch Hazlewood, dropping an accurate maiden on Burns. Chatting to Ben Jones from CricViz during the break, he threw a bunch of stats at me that told one overarching story: Hazlewood was tip top earlier. \u201cRory Burns could easily be Wilfred Owen\u2019s and Seigfried Sassoon\u2019s love child,\u201d David Brown believes. \u201cWell not easily but certainly a likeness.\u201d I\u2019ll take that as a comment. 29th over: England 87-2 (Burns 42, Denly 30) Denly picks a couple off Cummins to fine leg to start his afternoon as well. The attack-leader is back where he needs to be soon enough, the Austalians up for a big leg before shout... turned down by Aleem Dar. Paine isn\u2019t interested on the basis that he thinks it is high, and he\u2019s right. Umpire\u2019s Call the TV finds after the fact. Dave Voss has questions. \u201cIs the number of dropped catches off broad more of an indication of a) him being quite good, so generates a lot of chances and b) he\u2019s had a long career and hasn\u2019t been dropped (from the team) or injured that much so he\u2019s had a long time to rack them up?\u201d Yep, definitely both of those too. But in my time watching this team, he has been the guy who has the most go down per Test - surely? Or maybe this is some sort of confirmation bias and it\u2019s all in my head. Good point too, Gary Naylor. 28th over: England 85-2 (Burns 42, Denly 28) Shot. Burns is straight back on it with a lovely push off the back foot out to cover for four. He grabs two more behind point with soft hands then another couple tucked around the corner out to long leg. On reflection, that might have been off the inside edge. Nine off it, though - by far the most expensive Hazlewood has sent down today. \u201cI have previously wondered about Langer\u2019s query re surrendering the toss (over 23),\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cOf course there\u2019s always the option for the winning captain to toss the coin again and let chance dictate the decision. Feels a little un-Australian, though.\u201d I like the market solution. It\u2019s really very good. The players are back on the field. Strap in for a 150-minute middle session. Hazlewood is starting us off from beneath me at the nursery end, Denly facing the first ball after the long interval. PLAY! Lunch time chat. \u201cAre there any stats (or perhaps better still grossly misleading/unsubstantiated/anecdotal hunches) on which batsmen get dropped (eg catches) the most?\u201d asks Dan Thomas. \u201cI have a feeling some players are just luckier than others.\u201d I know they keep it for bowlers and that Broad went past 100 drops last week. I wonder what makes a seamer like him unlucky, so to speak? Is there something about the angle Broad bowls at making it more difficult for the cordon to take his chances? Any logic for me? \u201cAfternoon Adam.\u201d Hi, Kim Thonger. \u201cThe dog and I are putting ourselves outside a plate of ham, egg and chips and a pint of Holy Grail at The Free Press in Cambridge, and the dog thinks the reason England bat so randomly these days is they probably don\u2019t have proper lunch anymore, but just isotonic drinks and a bunch of radishes. I can\u2019t argue with him, can you?\u201d I spoke to Mitch Johnson about the Lord\u2019s lunches yesterday, prompted by an OBO question last week about what the players eat to maintain peak performance. Evidently, in our quaint old game, that means nothing: they tuck in and go hard. Cricket. Love it. Nice fightback from England. Hazlewood was superb with two early scalps but the track was true, Denly and Burns growing in confidence towards the break. The latter was dropped by Khawaja at gully but they remained calm, earning their fancy Lord\u2019s lunch. I\u2019m off to grab a marginally less posh feed from the back of the press box - I\u2019ll be back with you in about 20 minutes for some chit-chat. 27th over: England 76-2 (Burns 34, Denly 27) Cummins to bowl the final over before lunch, banging into Burns\u2019 thigh pad to begin - an area he targets to soften up players. But Burns is made of tough stuff, the opener leaning into a beautiful square drive that motors away towards Father Time. His best shot this morning. That\u2019s the 50 partnership too, put on in 105 balls. Cummins has two more opportunities before the break, beating Burns with a beauty with the penultimate delivery. A great comeback after the boundary. Burns then finishes as he has played the majority of the session: in defence. 26th over: England 72-2 (Burns 30, Denly 27) Huuuuge shout for lbw, Hazlewood again darting by the inside edge as he has so cannily from this end this morning. Denly is struck on the back leg, albeit just above the knee, which is why they elect not to refer it. The technology on TV shows that to be a good call from Paine, the ball going just above the bails - it would have been a second review blown. Hazlewood then goes the other way, Denly electing to throw his hands at a ball that seams away, beating his bat. \u201cSometimes your strength can be your weakness,\u201d observes Mikey Holding. Another top over from Hazlewood, who has been the pick of the bowlers. 25th over: England 72-2 (Burns 30, Denly 27) Cummins is rushing in and giving it his all at Burns. Twice he beats the outside edge along the way with deliveries that seam down the slope. But the opener keeps his cool, getting his bat out of the way of the tempter to finish. Here are the details for Ruth Strauss Day. They\u2019ve done a great job. 24th over: England 72-2 (Burns 30, Denly 27) Hazlewood returns, now from the Nursery End where he picked up both of the wickets so far. Burns defends and watches carefully, grabbing the one on offer to cover. Denly does the same. Good batting as we near lunch. 23rd over: England 71-2 (Burns 29, Denly 27) Cummins\u2019 turn for a quick blast before the break but Denly is seeing it well, watching a bouncer then deflecting off the outside part of his part with soft hands through the cordon for four. Nothing wrong with that. \u201cIs it just me,\u201d begins Jack Jorgensen, \u201cor has the word \u2018kidology\u2019 been in use about 1000x more than normal over the past two weeks of the Ashes? Michael Vaughan has just used it on TMS, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve seen it in the cricket press at least 4 or 5 times in writings about the test (not yours mind...). Maybe it\u2019s just an example of recency bias on my behalf (having not seen the word used for a long while beforehand.\u201d I haven\u2019t, but you can be sure that now you\u2019ve raised it, I will a dozen times before stumps and I\u2019ll accidentally use it in my copy. \u201cOn the topic of the actual cricket, I have a creeping dread that Tim Paine has made an error based more on a perceived weakness (batting) rather than perceived strength (bowling) here.\u201d It\u2019s certainly a fantastic batting track. It was interesting at Langer\u2019s press conference last night that he asked during the rain delays whether it would be allowable for Paine to win the toss and get Root to decide what England what to do first. He was told no. 22nd over: England 67-2 (Burns 29, Denly 23) Exchanging singles forward of square to begin the Lyon over, Burns makes amends for the short/wide ball he missed out on a few minutes earlier, carving the off-spinner away behind point for his fourth boundary. If England get to the interval two down, they\u2019ve nearly broken even. 21st over: England 61-2 (Burns 24, Denly 22) Shot, Joe. That\u2019s the second cover drive that Denly has played this morning that suggests he has the skillz to pay the billz at this level. He deals nicely with the rest of the Hazlewood set too, ducking a bouncer to finish. \u201cSorry to cast a cloud on Ian Forth\u2019s recollection,\u201d says John Starbuck, \u201cbut surely David Steele was the bank clerk who went to war, in the famous phrase? Mind you, in those days bank managers were well trained in refusals, a highly suitable temperament for a cautious defensive batsman.\u201d Am I right in remembering that he released a book last year, documenting the summer of his life and the career either side? More on SPOTY Steele/Denly from David Seare: \u201cFrom what I remember, he was promised a steak per run by a local Northants butcher. To my knowledge Denly doesn\u2019t have the same incentive and that might be the difference in the end.\u201d 20th over: England 57-2 (Burns 24, Denly 18) Burns misses out on hammering a poor Lyon delivery early in the over - they don\u2019t come around too often. Sure enough, the next is right on the money and finds his inside edge. In an effort to transfer some pressure back the other way, the opener jumps down the track at Lyon, flicking a couple. Nice work. His sweep to finish was struck well but stopped. \u201cSurprised that Robin Hazlehurst is interested in using Hazlewood\u2019s ancestry to \u2018get Smith out\u2019, when Smudge already had the ancestral goods to play for England (his mum was a Pom!),\u201d notes Sarah Bacon. \u201cBut he only ever wanted to wear the Baggy Green. While many Aussies say they \u2018wanna be a Wallaby\u2019, Smith\u2019s efforts playing English county cricket and working his way into the team, was a dream come true for Australia, despite his recent fall from grace. He\u2019s in at number four today, isn\u2019t he? Can\u2019t wait.\u201d 19th over: England 55-2 (Burns 22, Denly 18) Hazlewood is back from the pavilion end, a change from his earlier outstanding efforts running away from us at the nursery. Denly watches carefully to begin before pushing confidently through backward point for a couple. Good batting. More of it too, the right-hander grabbing a quick single to cover then Burns tucking one to backward square. \u201cHappy birthday!\u201d says Peter Salmon. Thanks kindly for all the emails on this topic. I\u2019ll reply at lunch! \u201cJust in and have just watched the Joe Root dismissal. Apart from a stump cartwheeling, is there any more satisfying dismissal than an LBW where the batsman ends up jumping and landing with both feet facing down the pitch, bang to rights? Always feels like they have just finished a dance number and should walk off whistling and goose stepping with their bat over their shoulder, while lifting their hat on and off. Why didn\u2019t Root do that, the joyless bastard?\u201d Oooh yes. As an opener bowler who can\u2019t bowl anymore (any shoulder experts?), that\u2019s the stuff occupying my dreams too often. 18th over: England 51-2 (Burns 21, Denly 15) \u201cThat\u2019s interesting,\u201d says David Gower as Burns sweeps Lyon just over midwicket, running away to the Mound Stand for four. The 50 is up with the shot. Earlier in the set, Lyon also found his inside edge. He isn\u2019t far away here. 17th over: England 47-2 (Burns 17, Denly 15) Another edge won by Siddle but nothing coming from it other than four runs to Denly through about fourth slip. The 34-year-old has bounced back well. \u201cJoe Denly as a late blossoming 33 year old emulating David Steele of 40 years ago?\u201d hopes Ian Forth. \u201cThe bank manager who went to war. After England got trashed in the 1st test in 1975 he held off Lillee and Thomson for the remainder of the series for England to emerge with some pride intact. Parallels, one hopes, somewhat optimistically.\u201d And Sports Personality of the Year. I don\u2019t quite see it, I\u2019m afraid. NOT OUT! Turning too much! Leg stump is visible when the contact is made with the front pad but Lyon has ragged it beyond the woodwork, so says the ball-tracker. That much spin? Review lost! 16th over: England 42-2 (Burns 16, Denly 11) HAS LYON GOT DENLY LBW? He\u2019s reviewing! Given not out. 15th over: England 40-2 (Burns 16, Denly 9) DROPPED CATCH! Burns gets a life, Khawaja putting him down in the gully. It\u2019s not a difficult chance as far as those go, moving quick but straight into his chest. Was he too close in there? Siddle the unlucky man... isn\u2019t he always? He created the chance after five high-quality dots. \u201cAs a gully fielder,\u201d says David Gower, \u201cthat\u2019s as easy as it gets.\u201d Enough said. 14th over: England 40-2 (Burns 16, Denly 9) Lyon is on, replacing Hazlewood who has 2/5 to his name after six overs this morning. He beat Burns 32 times (by his count) on day two at Edgbaston before finding his outside edge on the third morning at an important time. He does again here with his fourth ball of the morning but it falls just in front of Smith at first slip. He\u2019s found his range straight away. \u201cI\u2019m with Warne,\u201d says Jack Baker-Merry of Paine\u2019s decision at the toss. \u201cThe conditions today are objectively good for bowling, but they are still probably the best conditions the batsmen will have over the four remaining days. I would have batted first and looked to get a total big enough that you would only have to bat once.\u201d 13th over: England 39-2 (Burns 15, Denly 9) Another expensive over, Siddle taken for three by Denly through midwicket to begin, then driven lavishly through cover by the same man to finish. Between times the seamer was on the money but that he\u2019s gone for 22 in three overs won\u2019t be pleasing anyone on the balcony of Team Australia. \u201cMorning Adam and a very Happy Birthday to ya.\u201d Thank you, Brian Withington. \u201cMy brother can\u2019t be seen to be communicating with OBO whilst at work, but has telepathically volunteered the thought that England\u2019s best chance of victory is to be bundled out for 200+ inside the day and then to win a one innings race.\u201d I\u2019m not quite sure how you\u2019ve worked this out, but I\u2019ll trust your judgment. A note in from Dean Kinsella, too. Probably not the same Dean Kinsella who was the scariest cricketer I ever shared a dressing room with. \u201cI\u2019m struggling to come up with a strong argument for Buttler to come in ahead of Stokes in this first innings,\u201d he says. \u201cNot that either of them will be required any time soon.\u201d Buttler looks... very tired? Might have needed a longer break after the World Cup? 12th over: England 31-2 (Burns 14, Denly 2) Burns has one ball to deal with after the drinks/delay. Two men are out for the hook but he doesn\u2019t go upstairs, aiming at the stumps. He defends well. I saw CricViz\u2019s stat yesterday that Hazlewood\u2019s full-ball percentage in 2015 was higher than in any series he has played as a Test cricketer. He certainly has every right to fancy himself in England. Excellent spell. 11.5 overs: England 31-2 (Burns 14, Denly 2) Ouch! A 90mph Hazlewood bouncer has whacked Denly\u2019s helmet. He was attemping to help it down to fine leg but it got big on him. He appears okay, the leg bye taken before the medical staff race out. With a concussion test now mandatory in these situations, they take drinks. \u201cIn terms of getting Smith out,\u201d writes Robin Hazlehurst, \u201cwhat are the odds of Hazlewood suddenly discovering some English ancestry? Is swapping sides mid-Test allowed, or is that a bit frowned on?\u201d James Pattinson might be your best bet there given his parentage and the fact that his brother, you know, played for England. 11th over: England 29-2 (Burns 13, Denly 2) Better from Siddle, who needs to be back into his groove from Birmingham quickly here or it will get ugly for him in a hurry. Warne has already sacked him, for instance. It\u2019s a very good end to the over, almost going underneath Denly\u2019s blade before jagging the final delivery back a long way. Nice. \u201cGood to hear Mitchell Johnson on TMS,\u201d says David Seare. \u201cTo come back from his form and confidence issues the way he did and take 37 wickets in that series was an admirable turnaround.\u201d Geoff Lemon and I had Mitch talking at our live pod show the other night at Hampstead CC and he was in outstanding form. Not just with the gags, but talking about anxiety and confidence. Lovely fella. 10th over: England 28-2 (Burns 12, Denly 2) Hazlewood did that so well four years ago, getting the ball to go up the slope. He\u2019s born to bowl here. Denly\u2019s turn, replacing his skipper. Oooh, first ball it\u2019s another off-cutter again, the No4 saved only by his inside edge. Later in the over he\u2019s off the mark, with a couple through midwicket. Nice clip off the middle of the bat. He has a massive job ahead of him. Brilliant again from Hazlewood, going down the slope past Root\u2019s inside edge, striking him on the front knee. No need to review that. The change of ends works a t 9th over: England 26-1 (Burns 12, Root 14) Siddle is on to replace Cummins, which is an over or two early for mine. Alas, his first delivery is a genuine loosener, cut away with ease by Root behind point for four. Burns\u2019 turn, who takes four even easier runs off his pads down to fine leg. A third four follows, Burns this time hammering Siddle from well outside the off-stump. Poor start. 8th over: England 13-1 (Burns 4, Root 9) Shout for leg before! Turned down. Hazlewood brought it back to the left-hander past his inside edge to prompt the appeal but it was a fraction high. Other than that, Burns is looking a lot more comfortable now. 7th over: England 13-1 (Burns 4, Root 9) Burns gives Root a chance to take a look at Cummins early in the over and he makes the most of it, stroking him up the hill twice in a row with two picture-perfect cover drives. \u201cThat\u2019s why he should be batting three,\u201d says Nasser Hussain on the telly. \u201cSoaking up these high-pressure situations.\u201d Warne adds that he would have batted first had he won the toss. He\u2019ll be calling for Paine\u2019s head by the end of the series, nothing more certain. 6th over: England 4-1 (Burns 3, Root 1) Root\u2019s turn again, who is taking the approach that the ball is going to find his edge plenty, so he may as well play every delivery with soft hands. On three occasions this is the result, falling well short of the five catchers behind the wicket. Excellent cricket from both. Another maiden. Here is the TMS overseas link for the great many people asking for it. 5th over: England 4-1 (Burns 3, Root 1) Burns can\u2019t be flirting well outside the off-stump, even with Cummins angling from around the wicket. He\u2019s beaten. The bumper follows - a rapid one - but he does well to get his head and gloves underneath. Cummins remains on top to the end, twice winning the edge on the bounce to the cordon then beating Burns with a ball he did have to play at with genuine away movement. The Australian quicks couldn\u2019t have started better. \u201cGood morning.\u201d And to you, John Starbuck. He wants to get Smith out. \u201cSteve Waugh, on his first Ashes tour, at one point had an average of infinity, yet that didn\u2019t last. One way of getting Smith out is the old chestnut of \u2018tempting him to have a slash outside off stump\u2019 which would perhaps break his concentration.\u201d Root said something similar in the build up, noting that they need to be more patient with the traditional forms of breaking Smith\u2019s concentration before digging around for Plan B, C, D, etc. 4th over: England 4-1 (Burns 3, Root 1) Sheeeesh! Hazlewood is hooping this new Dukes ball around expertly, nearly going between Root\u2019s bat and pad with the inducker then beating the outside edge with a gorgeous outswinger. He finishes with the full ball, kept out again via the inside portion the captain\u2019s blade. Outstanding. 3rd over: England 4-1 (Burns 3, Root 1) Cummins is hammering away at Burns, already hitting the radar at 90mph. The opener handles the early part of the over well but full ball that follows the bouncer goes very close to locating his outside edge. The left-hander does well to finish, clipping one out to the grandstand. \u201cMichael Holding saying \u2018Joe Root, earlier than he would have expected to be at the crease\u2019\u201d emails Elliot Carr-Barnsley. \u201cNah.\u201d 2nd over: England 2-1 (Burns 1, Root 1) Root is off the mark first ball, keeping out a full delivery with soft hands and scampering down to the non-strikers\u2019 end. Burns does likewise, pushing a quick single to cover to end the outstanding Hazlewood over. A very good selection decision - he did dominate here four years ago up the slope. Fair to say Mikey Holding and Ian Botham are not happy with Jason Roy. That\u2019s a delightful gift from JP in his sign off. Of course, it was Jason Dunstall\u2019s 55th birthday yesterday. Growing up, I took great pride in the fact that we\u2019re born one day (and 20 years) apart. A truly perfect start from Hazlewood! He beats Roy twice then finds his outside edge, the opener gone for a three-ball blob. 1st over: England 0-0 (Burns 0, Roy 0) Cummins with four slips, racing down the slope at the left-handed Burns who defends with a nice straight bat to begin the Test Match. It\u2019s a wonderful sight looking out from the media centre, red in every corner of this grand old ground for Ruth Strauss Day. They did a fantastic job before play, the cap presentation with Andrew Strauss really well done. Burns maintains his defensive disposition throughout this first over, defending, leaving then defending again. A tidy start from both. The players are on the field! Thank you, JP. We are ready to roll here at Lord\u2019s. Roy and Burns to the middle, followed by Paine and his men. Cummins will take the first over, from the pavilion end. PLAY! Right, with play about to get underway it\u2019s time to hand over to Adam Collins. It\u2019s Adam\u2019s birthday, by the way. Happy birthday! And here come the players, both teams in red caps that will be auctioned off after the Test has concluded. Emotional scenes at Lord\u2019s with Andrew Strauss being applauded onto the field before the umpires and players. Mathis Bock, however... \u201cJohn Bains has a question for the hive mind. \u201cWhen was the last time the England opening pair batted through to lunch on the opening day of a test match?\u201d Never mind the openers, last time England were sent in here the whole side didn\u2019t make it to lunch.\u201d Quite. Some statistics for England fans to cling to like life rafts. Indeed. Ensuring Australia don\u2019t form partnerships around their former skipper is a matter of priority. \u201cHello,\u201d hi Vigasini Senthil. \u201cDespite being an Indian, Ashes has been my favourite part of the year. So, what\u2019s your Ashes predictions? And also what if Jason Roy doesn\u2019t perform?\u201d My Ashes prediction is Australia will obliterate the next month or so like a Targaryen after a bad night\u2019s sleep. Jason Roy? I think he\u2019s worth persevering with, but not as an opener. John Bains has a question for the hive mind. \u201cWhen was the last time the England opening pair batted through to lunch on the opening day of a test match?\u201d Back on the subject of cap numbers, Boris Starling has done a sporting comparison. \u201cA telling statistic as to how both football and rugby use many more players than cricket. England football cap 693 was Bill Jones in 1950; England rugby cap 693 was Walter Elliot in 1932.\u201d Excellent point from an excellent sportswriter. Ian Forth emailing in always brightens my day. \u201cAustralia go 1-up in series. Sense of gloom descends on England. Much-heralded debutant foreign-born player is waiting his moment. A key bowler is injured. Buoyed by sense of invincibility Australia win toss and insert opposition in second test. This is all going very much according to the 2005 script so far. 400 on the board by end of play?\u201d Yes please. KP nuts all round! \u201cThings might be tough for the English team and supporters in the wake of the first test, the Brexit fiasco and Boris,\u201d emails John Phaceas, \u201cbut at least they don\u2019t have to put up with the modestly talented ex-tennis player hosting Nine\u2019s coverage here in Australia.\u201d Oooh, I\u2019m a big fan of Todd Woodbridge. I think he\u2019s a safe pair of hands and refreshingly unobtrusive. And 22 doubles grand slams suggests he was than modestly talented. An email from Eagle-eyed Romeo: \u201cIn Sky\u2019s photo line-up of the side, Archer\u2019s wearing a 658 shirt, not his own 693. He\u2019s borrowed one of Stokes\u2019s.\u201d One must presume the publicity shot was taken before he was selected and unaware of his actual cap number at that time. Interesting that it would be Stokes who would offer his kit. In case you missed it, today is Ruth Strauss Foundation day at Lord\u2019s. The Ruth Strauss Foundation was set up by Andrew Strauss in honour of his wife Ruth, who died of a rare form of lung cancer in December 2018. The foundation provides grants for research into rare forms of lung cancers and provides emotional and wellbeing support to patients and their families. As part of the charity\u2019s fundraising and awareness-raising effort Lord\u2019s will be decked out in red. Sponsor branding has been changed, Andrew Strauss is doing the media rounds wearing a red suit, and both sides have had their team photos taken in special edition red caps which are now auction items. Paul, in Kazakhstan, reckons England will score 149 to 229. Jonathan, in Melbourne, is going for 250 to 280, thanks largely to a show-stopping turn from Jos Buttler with the tail. If you were concerned that the loss of an entire day\u2019s play might lead to the playing out of a pedestrian draw, think again. Although... No late surprises from Australia. Josh Hazlewood coming in for James Pattinson is the only change from Edgbaston. England are as expected with Jofra Archer\u2019s debut the headline. There are two changes from the side beaten at Edgbaston with Archer coming in for the injured Anderson and Jack Leach replacing Moeen Ali. Interesting. Very un-Australian call by Tim Paine. Interviewed by Michael Holding by the cut strip the Tasmanian suggests that with the weather that\u2019s been about and the pitch resting under covers for a long time it could be lively early on. Joe Root confirmed he would also have liked to bowl first. I think all this Nigel Haig talk has messed with Kim Thonger\u2019s brain. \u201cJonathan I think this Steve Smith nonsense is barking up the wrong tree,\u201d he emails, adding, questionably, \u201chere\u2019s my strategy: 1. Win the toss in each of the remaining four tests. 2. Bat every time. 3. Bat right through all five days, with a Leachesque approach, thus avoiding the need to bowl at Smith at all. 4. Accept a 1-0 series loss manfully. 5. Justify it by Anderson\u2019s injury in first test. 6. Claim moral drawn series.\u201d James Anderson update: Kim Thonger is single-handedly keeping Nigel Haig trending. From Wikipedia, I presume: \u201cIan Peebles, who played under Haig at Middlesex, said of him: \u201cHe had a witty and active mind, with interests ranging from bird watching to music and poetry. He was a wonderful companion and guide to us youngsters, and he had a hot Scots temper which kept us, very properly, in some awe of him.\u201d Peter Crees has come to the aid of overseas listeners unable to locate the TMS coverage. Logic &gt; fear. Graeme Thorn is in on the fun. \u201cHi Jonathan,\u201d he opens, \u201cwe just hope that there is sufficient rotation over the next five to ten years so that cap 909 can play alongside Archer for the full \u20186-0-6\u2019 experience.\u201d Marvellous. 606 was my introduction to David Mellor, back in the day. Kim Thonger is the first to log on this morning, and his contribution is a beauty, building on the cap number association musings. \u201cMatching player numbers to radio frequencies is a marvellously nerdy game,\u201d Kim emails., \u201clove it. Nigel Haig was number 198, the Radio 4 Long Wave frequency. I claim my nerdiness medal! \ud83e\udd47.\u201d Never mind Brexit, the most challenging task this English summer is to figure out a way to dislodge the immovable Steve Smith. Fortunately, Rob Smyth has put his considerable intellect to the task and arrived at five possible solutions. Sidenote: does anyone else immediately think of Radio Five when they see 693 (Archer\u2019s cap number) written down? Here\u2019s Vic Marks\u2019s scene-setter. It was filed to be enjoyed yesterday but continues to flourish despite the weather. The advent of any Test debutant is a source of excitement. But some are more exciting than others. On Wednesday, if the weather permits, Jofra Archer becomes the 693rd man to play for England. Despite the lack of play yesterday there was still enough going on for Andy Bull to file this report from the home of cricket. Some summer\u2019s day was this. After six hours of rain play was abandoned for the day at 4.15pm. There was not so much as a coin toss, let alone a ball bowled. Weather: North London is forecast to be dry and partly cloudy with temperatures around the 20C mark. It\u2019s probably also worth noting the stiff westerly breeze that will develop during the morning. Take two: hello everybody and welcome to the opening day of the second Test from Lord\u2019s. Ok, so we all know it\u2019s really day two of the marquee Test of the summer but yesterday was rained out so we need to gee ourselves up again and recapture those first session butterflies. The good news is the weather is set fair for the remainder of the day. We should have no rain-related interruptions during the scheduled 90 overs of play, and we should also get to enjoy an extra eight overs for lost time. We still haven\u2019t witnessed a toss so the playing elevens are yet to be confirmed. However, we can be confident Jofra Archer will make his eagerly anticipated debut after he was presented with a cap by Chris Jordan yesterday, and Josh Hazlewood seems certain to replace James Pattinson in Australia\u2019s attack. I\u2019ll be with you for the opening hour or so but once play begins the hardest working man in cricket-business, Mr Adam Collins, will take over. If you want to join in this pre-play fun you can drop me an email or a tweet.",

      "bodyText": "The backlash against Trump re-election fundraiser and New York\u2019s Hudson Yards developer, Stephen Ross, is intensifying as two fashion houses move their upcoming catwalk shows from the development. The brand Rag &amp; Bone is moving its New York fashion week show from the Shed, an event space within the controversial, multibillion-dollar development. The brand follows an earlier decision to pull out by designer Prabal Gurung following a protest against real estate developer Stephen Ross for hosting a fundraiser for Donald Trump at his Hamptons beachfront home last week, with tickets going for up to $250,000 each. In a message posted on Twitter, Gurung said his decision was motivated by a desire to \u201cquestion these individuals whose motivation seems to be nothing but $$$ and to also challenge our own integrity and choices that we make everyday\u201d. Several brands are reported to have planned shows at Hudson Yards during fashion week, which starts on 6 September. Other designers, including Humberto Leon and Dana Lorenz of the jewelry label Fallon, have also expressed outrage toward the fundraiser for the president, which prompted customers of the Ross-owned fitness companies Equinox and SoulCycle to call for a boycott. In a statement in recent days in wake of the controversy over the fundraiser, the Shed said it is \u201cfully-independent and not owned or controlled by any private profit or for-profit entity\u201d. Ross, 79, is owner of the Miami Dolphins and estimated to be worth nearly $10bn. According to the Washington Post, tickets for his Trump Victory fundraiser cost $100,000 for lunch and a photo opportunity with the president and $250,000 for a package that includes a roundtable discussion with Trump. Ross\u2019s wife, the jewelry designer Kara Ross, has also come under criticism, with Dana Lorenz writing to the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) head, Tom Ford, to cancel her membership and to complain that messages to the trade body expressing concern over Ross\u2019 board seat were \u201cmet with a response that felt very much like \u2026 \u2018not our problem\u2019, and to focus my energies elsewhere\u201d. The CFDA responded expressing regret at Lorenz\u2019s decision to resign her membership and noted that, as a not-for-profit, \u201cit does not participate in political campaigns\u201d. The decision to move the shows from Hudson Yards presents organisers of the biannual round of fashion weeks with the kind of dilemma that is increasingly buffeting arts institutions or those representing creative businesses. Last month, at least seven artists demanded that their work be removed from the 2019 Whitney Biennial, citing the New York museum\u2019s lack of response to calls for the resignation of board member Warren Kanders over his connections to Safariland, a teargas distribution company. Protest against the Shed, an arts center that is reportedly set to be the new home of New York fashion week, comes at a moment when the fashion industry is itself coming under attack for a failure to address production-related environmental damage estimated to account for 10% of planet-heating emissions. Earlier this month, the protest group Extinction Rebellion announced plans to \u201cshut down\u201d London fashion week in September. \u201cIn recognition of the existential threat that faces us, we ask the British Fashion Council to be the leaders the world needs now and to cancel London fashion week,\u201d the group wrote in a letter to the British Fashion Council. \u201cWe ask that the industry convene a people\u2019s assembly, declare emergency, face the truth and act now,\u201d the organisation wrote in a post on Instagram, urging followers to boycott fashion for a year. In New York, protests have yet to evolve to the same level and remain politically, not environmentally, focused. \u201cDesigners and creative people have every right to remove themselves from any association from causes and people they don\u2019t believe in,\u201d the fashion consultant Kim Vernon said. \u201cIt\u2019s increasingly important that they follow what they believe.\u201d Following the initial protest against Ross\u2019 luxury fitness brands, Equinox\u2019s executive chairman, Harvey Spevak, attempted to reassure customers, assuring them that Stephen Ross \u201cdoes not run the company. I do.\u201d Spevak apologized on Thursday for the fundraiser\u2019s \u201cimpact it has had on our community\u201d. \u201cMr Ross is not the majority investor in Equinox,\u201d wrote Spevak, who joined the company in 1999. \u201cHe is one of the investors including myself. He does not run the company. I do.\u201d Equinox said it will donate $1m to five charities as way to give back to the \u201ccommunities that have given us so much\u201d. In his own letter to SoulCycle and Equinox customers, reported CNN, Ross wrote: \u201cI have always been an active participant in the democratic process ... I have known Donald Trump for 40 years, and while we agree on some issues, we strongly disagree on many others and I have never been bashful about expressing my opinions.\u201d",

There\u2019s too much footy, too many opinions, too many trifles. But we\u2019re finally through the winter grind. It will be 27C at the Gabba on Saturday. The following day, the last two premiers square off at the MCG. Richmond has its swagger back. The Eagles are perennially underestimated. The Western Bulldogs and Port Adelaide are capable of anything on their day. All around Australia, there are double chances, finals spots and coaching futures on the line. Things are getting serious. Things are finally getting interesting.",

An assessment of Palmer\u2019s extraordinary cash splash undertaken for Labor by an external consultant using industry standard analytics also indicates the controversial businessman changed his messaging strategy in the final week of the campaign, training a higher proportion of the spend on attack ads targeting the Labor party and Bill Shorten. During April and early May, the United Australia party advertisements were focused predominantly on encouraging voters to support Palmer candidates, with a proportion of the spend devoted to criticising both of the major parties. But in the week beginning 12 May, as undecided voters were firming up their voting intention, the focus of Palmer\u2019s persuasion exercise changed. Ads attacking Labor \u2013 which included \u201cShorten\u2019s taxes will destroy Australian lives\u201d, \u201cLabor sold airport to China for $1\u201d, and \u201ctell shifty he\u2019s dreaming\u201d \u2013 increased significantly. In a snapshot of Palmer\u2019s messaging by week, looking at television and radio in Melbourne in the week beginning 12 May, of 683 advertising spots, 272 were negative messages about Labor and Shorten. This compares with only 39 attack ads in the week beginning 5 May, and zero in the week beginning 28 April. As the 2019 campaign entered its final weeks, according to Guardian Essential\u2019s post-election review, more than a quarter of voters, 26% of the sample, were still on the fence about who to vote for. That number was down to 11% by polling day, with those voters making their decision on the day they cast their ballots. If that sample was indicative of sentiment in the broader community, undecided voters broke decisively the Coalition\u2019s way, particularly in the final week, when the Palmer spend \u2013 which amplified the Coalition\u2019s negative messages about Labor\u2019s high taxes \u2013 hit $8m. The cohort of voters who decided who to vote for on 18 May broke 38% for Scott Morrison and 27% for Shorten. The Guardian Essential survey also showed voters were more conscious of negative messages about Labor and tax in the closing week of the contest than other issues, like climate change, which was also a vote-shifting issue. The external analysis of the Palmer spend has been given to Labor\u2019s campaign review, which is being undertaken by the former South Australian premier Jay Weatherill and former federal minister Craig Emerson. It only looks at advertising on television and radio. Palmer also ran significant outdoor advertising and digital campaigns, which are not captured. The sections of the report seen by Guardian Australia show Palmer spent more than the major parties combined between early April and election day. It also shows the gap between what Palmer spent and what the major parties were spending widened in the final two weeks of the campaign. In the final three weeks of the contest, Palmer spent $15m, the Coalition $6.3m, Labor $7m, and the ACTU close to $3m. The analysis also indicates that conservative messaging during the 2019 campaign outgunned progressive messaging on television in all the metropolitan markets \u2013 Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth \u2013 which was a marked shift from the 2016 contest. The analysis assesses share of voice for television advertising in 2016 versus the conditions in 2019. In 2016 the share of voice between progressive and conservative political forces was roughly 50/50 in every market except Sydney, where the ratio was 39% progressive and 61% conservative.

The UAP was sixth on the list, with a spend of $67m \u2013 bigger than the banks, Sportsbet, Telstra, Bunnings, Coles, Toyota and McDonald\u2019s. No other political party made it to the top 50. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Joo-Cheong Tham, the director of the Electoral Regulation Research Network at the Melbourne Law School, argues the Palmer case study in 2019 sets a new and troubling benchmark in the Australian political system. \u201cIt appears the UAP spend in this election is the biggest campaign spending by a single party in the history of Australian elections, and I stress appears because what we have is a regulatory gap \u2013 the parties haven\u2019t had to report since 1998 on their campaign expenditure,\u201d he said. \u201cIt points to the absence of spending controls in election campaigns. \u201cEven though UAP did not win a seat, it is clear the big spending had an important influence on the election outcome, and this is influence not by sheer force of ideas, or mobilisation in terms of people, but by money itself, and I think that undermines the fairness of the electoral contest\u201d. The Melbourne university professor, who is an advocate for caps on election spending for political actors and third parties, said the case study also pointed to the outsized influence of the fossil fuel industry on Australian elections. He said it was self-evident that Palmer was a mining magnate, and electoral records show fossil fuel companies are among the largest contributors to the major parties.",

      "bodyText": "When Gibraltar\u2019s authorities unexpectedly impounded the Iranian oil tanker Grace 1 in July, one member of Donald Trump\u2019s administration was particularly pleased. John Bolton, the president\u2019s hawkish national security adviser, tweeted: \u201cExcellent news\u201d. The authorities in Gibraltar \u2013 with the backing of the British \u2013 said the vessel was heading for Syria. Selling oil to the regime of Bashar al-Assad was in breach of EU sanctions. But for the US, the seizure served a wider purpose, first to ratchet up the economic pressure further against Syria and above all Iran. Its cargo, worth $140m (\u00a3116m), represented lost revenue for Tehran as well as a lost source of energy for Damascus regime. Caught up in the middle, however, was Britain. Iran seized a British-flagged tanker in the Gulf in retaliation, under the noses of the stretched Royal Navy, leaving British merchant shipping looking vulnerable in the region, despite UK claims that Gibraltar had acted independently. Britain needed help in the Gulf and under new prime minister, Boris Johnson, chose to turn to the US, abandoning an idea first aired by his defeated leadership rival Jeremy Hunt, who had wanted to create a European-led naval protection force in the world\u2019s busiest oil shipping lane. It was a decision British officials tried to play down when it was announced last week that the UK would \u201cjoin in with\u201d the US on maritime security in its initiative, Operation Sentinel. But when Bolton came to London on Monday, he was far less subtle. \u201cWe were pleased PM Johnson\u2019s government has agreed to participate in Operation Sentinel,\u201d he said, adding pointedly that the move \u201creflects a change from the prior government\u201d. Hunt and the former prime minister Theresa May were acutely aware of French and German sensitivities and did not want to throw their naval lot in with the US in waters just south of Iran, at a time when all three European powers want to cool tensions with Tehran and keep the nuclear deal negotiated under the Obama administration alive. As for the Grace 1 tanker, Iran had given assurances behind the scenes to Gibraltar that, if released, it would not sail to a country subject to EU sanctions such as Syria, meaning that the continuing detention of the ship was becoming increasingly hard to justify. But with Washington determined to maintain the economic pressure on Iran, the Americans had little choice but to raise the stakes by making a legal challenge to Gibraltar\u2019s decision on Thursday \u2013 a policy denounced by Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif as \u201ceconomic terrorism\u201d. London has acknowledged that the US notified the British authorities of its intentions to try to prevent the release of the Grace 1. But such are the sensitivities, British officials would not say whether Bolton had raised the topic of the tanker in his meeting with Johnson this week, or in any of the other meetings with ministers. It would be surprising, however, if Bolton had not done so. But in any event, Britain has once again has become increasingly embroiled in the US economic power play with Iran, and if the Grace 1 is further detained, the tanker crisis is far from over.",

It must be stopped by parliament as soon and as decisively as possible. It is the duty of all MPs who oppose no deal to work together over the coming weeks, making necessary compromises, to ensure this outcome. The former chancellor Philip Hammond set out the case against no deal in a steely intervention this week. No deal would damage the British economy, he said, in both the short and long term. No deal makes the breakup of the United Kingdom more likely. No deal would threaten the Irish peace process. No deal weakens Britain\u2019s security and standing.

      "body": "<p>Twice a day, every day for almost a month, Angie Kim and her then-two-year-old son would enter a hyperbaric oxygen tank, and be sealed inside. Kim\u2019s son had ulcerative colitis, a condition that caused him great pain, and the constant vomiting had left him underweight. The theory behind hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) goes that if damaged cells need oxygen to heal, immersing a patient in pure oxygen will accelerate healing. Although the experimental treatment was not FDA-approved and has no proven benefits, it was a last resort Kim was willing to try.</p> <p>Her son called the tank \u201cthe submarine\u201d, and he wasn\u2019t far off: when the hatch was closed, the dim, warm space, lit only by flickering episodes of Barney and Sesame Street outside the portholes, could almost have been underwater; Kim, 15 years on, likens it to confession. As the children watched TV, the bored caregivers and parents, wearing only cotton clothing and liberated of their potentially flammable glasses, underwire bras and belts, began to talk.</p> <p>There, Kim found a window into other peoples\u2019 lives. One of the children was a fecal smearer, which could interrupt a \u201cdive\u201d as they all filed out for the tank to be cleaned \u2013 which could set off another child, who\u2019d violently bang his head against the wall. She began to feel guilty: though her son was in pain, the other children were mostly severely autistic or disabled and for their parents, HBOT was a stab in the dark for children who couldn\u2019t walk, talk or hug. \u201cI had always thought of myself and my family as the unlucky ones,\u201d the author, now 50, says. \u201cThat son was also deaf in one ear and had coeliac disease. My other son had anaphylactic food allergies. I couldn\u2019t work because of all the CT scans, MRIs and specialist cooking I needed to do. So I felt really sorry for us until I met these families, who were so upbeat. It made me have such a totally different outlook on life, the relativity of happiness.\u201d</p> <p>Her debut thriller Miracle Creek centres on that relativity, and the explosion of a HBOT tank, which injures many and kills two, one being Henry, a severely autistic boy. As new details are unearthed by shark-like lawyers, characters go from \u201chero to murderer in an hour\u201d and the truth becomes more and more unfixed as gossip spreads in the small town. But for Kim, the explosion was \u201ca Trojan horse, a MacGuffin\u201d that gave her space to explore deeper issues: the identity crisis among migrants in the US, the realities of severe autism and chronic illness, and the extremes of parental sacrifice.</p> <p>Of the latter, there are plenty. Elizabeth, who may or may not have killed her son Henry, finds herself on trial but liberated of a responsibility she increasingly resented. Teresa, nicknamed Mother Teresa for her squeaky clean image, wishes the trial would last longer because it gives her time away from her daughter. And Pak, the owner of the HBOT tank and a \u201cgoose father\u201d \u2013 a South Korean phenomenon where patriarchs send their children and wives abroad while they save money to migrate as well. He feels \u201cthe shame of becoming less proficient, less adult, than his own child\u201d, Mary, a teenager who serves as the family translator and is increasingly contemptuous of both her parents.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A migrant is like a really close friend who loves you, but can also tell you what you need to hear ... we bring that perspective</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kim\u2019s father was neither a goose nor a penguin father (the latter being those who can\u2019t afford a short annual visit like the former). The family left Seoul together for suburban Baltimore when Kim was 11. In Korea, a teacher had asked for students to nominate themselves to be class president; Kim was the only girl to raise her hand and the teacher slapped her with a ruler in front of the class, \u201cfor daring to think girls can be president of anything. Korea is a very male-dominated, patriarchal culture where having sons is everything. When my mum heard she was so angry and I think it was a big motivator for the move. Ironically, Korea had a female president before the US.\u201d</p> <p>When they arrived, Kim lived with her aunt and uncle while her parents ran a grocery store downtown, where they also slept, among the cans and food in the back room. Kim, an only child, resented their sacrifice. For the first time, she had her own bedroom and indoor plumbing \u2013 but no parents. \u201cI accused them of abandoning me. We were so poor in Korea, so coming to the US was a fortunate thing. But losing contact with my parents was something I really resented, so I acted up.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until 40 years later, writing Miracle Creek, that she acknowledged it was a sacrifice: \u201cYou\u2019d think after law school and having children of my own that I would have let it go. But we never talked about it. Writing made me consider what it had been like for them. I realised I had been a brat. They have read it and we had a really cathartic conversation. That\u2019s the best thing that came out of this novel for me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e70abee75ef0ad3a871f9538e34119af399dcb74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e70abee75ef0ad3a871f9538e34119af399dcb74/1150_218_3645_4556/800.jpg\" alt=\"Angie Kim\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I felt really sorry for us until I met these families, who were so upbeat\u2019 \u2026 Angie Kim.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Coburn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before having her own children, Kim worked as a trial lawyer.

      "bodyText": "Twice a day, every day for almost a month, Angie Kim and her then-two-year-old son would enter a hyperbaric oxygen tank, and be sealed inside. Kim\u2019s son had ulcerative colitis, a condition that caused him great pain, and the constant vomiting had left him underweight. The theory behind hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) goes that if damaged cells need oxygen to heal, immersing a patient in pure oxygen will accelerate healing. Although the experimental treatment was not FDA-approved and has no proven benefits, it was a last resort Kim was willing to try. Her son called the tank \u201cthe submarine\u201d, and he wasn\u2019t far off: when the hatch was closed, the dim, warm space, lit only by flickering episodes of Barney and Sesame Street outside the portholes, could almost have been underwater; Kim, 15 years on, likens it to confession. As the children watched TV, the bored caregivers and parents, wearing only cotton clothing and liberated of their potentially flammable glasses, underwire bras and belts, began to talk. There, Kim found a window into other peoples\u2019 lives. One of the children was a fecal smearer, which could interrupt a \u201cdive\u201d as they all filed out for the tank to be cleaned \u2013 which could set off another child, who\u2019d violently bang his head against the wall. She began to feel guilty: though her son was in pain, the other children were mostly severely autistic or disabled and for their parents, HBOT was a stab in the dark for children who couldn\u2019t walk, talk or hug. \u201cI had always thought of myself and my family as the unlucky ones,\u201d the author, now 50, says. \u201cThat son was also deaf in one ear and had coeliac disease. My other son had anaphylactic food allergies. I couldn\u2019t work because of all the CT scans, MRIs and specialist cooking I needed to do. So I felt really sorry for us until I met these families, who were so upbeat. It made me have such a totally different outlook on life, the relativity of happiness.\u201d Her debut thriller Miracle Creek centres on that relativity, and the explosion of a HBOT tank, which injures many and kills two, one being Henry, a severely autistic boy. As new details are unearthed by shark-like lawyers, characters go from \u201chero to murderer in an hour\u201d and the truth becomes more and more unfixed as gossip spreads in the small town. But for Kim, the explosion was \u201ca Trojan horse, a MacGuffin\u201d that gave her space to explore deeper issues: the identity crisis among migrants in the US, the realities of severe autism and chronic illness, and the extremes of parental sacrifice. Of the latter, there are plenty. Elizabeth, who may or may not have killed her son Henry, finds herself on trial but liberated of a responsibility she increasingly resented. Teresa, nicknamed Mother Teresa for her squeaky clean image, wishes the trial would last longer because it gives her time away from her daughter. And Pak, the owner of the HBOT tank and a \u201cgoose father\u201d \u2013 a South Korean phenomenon where patriarchs send their children and wives abroad while they save money to migrate as well. He feels \u201cthe shame of becoming less proficient, less adult, than his own child\u201d, Mary, a teenager who serves as the family translator and is increasingly contemptuous of both her parents. Kim\u2019s father was neither a goose nor a penguin father (the latter being those who can\u2019t afford a short annual visit like the former). The family left Seoul together for suburban Baltimore when Kim was 11. In Korea, a teacher had asked for students to nominate themselves to be class president; Kim was the only girl to raise her hand and the teacher slapped her with a ruler in front of the class, \u201cfor daring to think girls can be president of anything. Korea is a very male-dominated, patriarchal culture where having sons is everything. When my mum heard she was so angry and I think it was a big motivator for the move. Ironically, Korea had a female president before the US.\u201d When they arrived, Kim lived with her aunt and uncle while her parents ran a grocery store downtown, where they also slept, among the cans and food in the back room. Kim, an only child, resented their sacrifice. For the first time, she had her own bedroom and indoor plumbing \u2013 but no parents. \u201cI accused them of abandoning me. We were so poor in Korea, so coming to the US was a fortunate thing. But losing contact with my parents was something I really resented, so I acted up.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until 40 years later, writing Miracle Creek, that she acknowledged it was a sacrifice: \u201cYou\u2019d think after law school and having children of my own that I would have let it go. But we never talked about it. Writing made me consider what it had been like for them. I realised I had been a brat. They have read it and we had a really cathartic conversation. That\u2019s the best thing that came out of this novel for me.\u201d Before having her own children, Kim worked as a trial lawyer. She loved the drama but hated the machismo of the courtroom. After a busy period, she took a brief break in San Francisco; she went to an empty cliffside restaurant and spent the entire day there, alone with a bottle of wine and a plate of cheese and reading Tim O\u2019Brien\u2019s In the Lake of the Woods cover to cover. \u201cWhen I closed it, I couldn\u2019t remember being so happy. That day, I decided to quit.\u201d Though she would later become a dotcom entrepreneur, then stay at home for her sons for a decade, she decided to be an author that day. Decades on, with her first book under her belt, she finds herself alongside fellow migrant authors including Ocean Vuong and Viet Thanh Nguyen, writing back to the US about itself in both fiction and reality: all three recently signed a starry open letter calling for an end to inhumane conditions in detention centres on the US-Mexico border. The migrant perspective is crucial in the US, Kim says, because \u201cwe are like a really close friend who loves you, but can also tell you what you need to hear. Migrants have a responsibility as people who have chosen to come to this country to bring that perspective, to make us stronger. I disagree with the argument that says we should be grateful, or shut up and \u2018go back to where we came from\u2019.\u201d As for Trump\u2019s recent racist comments, she remembers a confusing two-month period when she first arrived in the US during which she was finally able understand enough English to know other children were mocking her, her looks, her smell, but without the language to respond. \u201cI went from feeling grateful I could finally understand to feeling awful because these seemingly nice kids had been making fun of me the entire time.

      "body": "<p>The long read by Daniel Cohen (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/13/brexit-remain-radicalisation-fbpe-peoples-vote\" title=\"\">Among the remainists</a>, Journal 13 August) charts the radicalisation of remain supporters. But as someone who identifies strongly with this movement and is active within it, I found the sneering and patronising tone difficult to stomach. The caricatured presentation of remainers as an eccentric and ineffectual sect \u201clocked in an arms race to out-remain each other\u201d undermined the presentation of the facts and was antagonistic towards a large swathe of Guardian readers.</p> <p>Many people in the movement have put their careers and family life on hold. We have stood out in rain, wind and heat engaging with the public. We have endured abuse in the street and online. We have stumped up for crowdfunders and campaigns, travelled hundreds of miles to attend rallies and written countless letters to MPs and newspapers. I have nothing but admiration for the grassroots campaigners and organisers who have given far more of their time and energy that I ever could. </p> <p>Surely this new political awakening is cause for celebration, not contempt? Out of the remain movement will come the positive change this country needs.<br><strong>Melissa Percival</strong><br><em>Crediton, Devon</em></p> <p>\u2022 Daniel Cohen presents a disturbing picture of remain fanatics who are determined to subvert a democratic decision. The 2016 referendum was not advisory or a test of public opinion; it was presented by those who expected a different result as binding. That was the whole point of holding it.</p> <p>I voted to leave because I am a radical socialist-anarchist and an absolute pacifist. The EU seeks to prevent members opting for socialism or from contracting out of a nuclear-armed alliance like Nato, with which the EU is closely associated. But if this country is to play its part in avoiding catastrophe, it needs to renounce nuclear weapons, close foreign bases, refuse to participate in foreign wars of choice and break the special relationship with the US. We can do none of these things if we are members of the EU and Nato.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only person who voted for Brexit for these reasons. But the remainists cannot even comprehend that such a view exists and can be sustained by powerful arguments.<br><strong>Malcolm Pittock</strong><br><em>Bolton, Lancashire</em></p> <p>\u2022 One aspect of Brexit that Daniel Cohen fails to acknowledge is the implicit permission that leave has given to the politics of racism and exclusion. It is possible that many who support remain also fear the implications of the free movement clause in the EU agreement, but so far this has not become a central remain concern. Contrast this with the politics of leave, which from the start invoked a clear call to define and exclude \u201cothers\u201d.</p> <p>What this has provided is not just the toleration of the hostile environment, but also a further legitimation of state-organised racism. By all means identify the persona and literature of remain, but do not exclude the mindset that the politics of leave is creating.<br><strong>Mary Evans</strong><br><em>Patrixbourne, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022 As one of the generation blamed for the Brexit vote, I identified with so much of the long read. I too will feel bereaved if/when Brexit goes ahead and I will be on the march on 19 October. But for me it\u2019s personal. In 2010, my younger son went to Australia to work and is now a dual British and Australian citizen, followed in 2016 by my elder son going to California. Both thought they would return, but have now said they will not come back while the UK is such a divided and racist society. At one time that would have been painful, but now I can only be pleased that they are making careers away from this mess. For the UK, it is the loss of two talented, well-educated individuals who would have contributed much to society. This cannot be a unique situation.<br><strong>Cynthia Battersby</strong><br><em>Surbiton, Surrey</em></p> <p>\u2022 Daniel Cohen says Brexit has torn the country apart and remainism isn\u2019t trying to put it back together. This fails to recognise that it is likely that remainers and leavers have a lot of concerns in common, such as NHS underfunding, rising private debt, austerity, inequality, etc. The difference is that they blame different institutions: on the one hand, UK government policy over the past 30 years, on the other, the EU. Both domestically and within the EU, the prevailing ideology is neoliberalism, and the Brexit debate has generated a great deal of heat but very little light. The media highlights and cultivates this division rather than providing a balanced assessment of the causes, myths and misinformation that created it. To do such a thing would show that Brexit has been, perhaps, a deliberate distraction.<br><strong>Charlie Mason</strong><br><em>Glogue, Pembrokeshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 The long read could only have been written by someone without sympathy for the estimated half a million workers who will lose their jobs because of the uncompetitive market Brexit will create for exporters, who now pay in tax all of the UK\u2019s contribution to the EU plus about \u00a3800m. Defending government policy cannot be right if it means putting people out of work, and when job losses will be so great, any journalist not questioning the justice and decency of it disrespects humanity and themselves.</p> <p>How can anyone believe that the US is going to take what the UK sends to the EU \u2013 \u00a34bn a week tariff-free in exports \u2013 or enough to make up what the tariffs of no deal will cost.

      "bodyText": "The long read by Daniel Cohen (Among the remainists, Journal 13 August) charts the radicalisation of remain supporters. But as someone who identifies strongly with this movement and is active within it, I found the sneering and patronising tone difficult to stomach. The caricatured presentation of remainers as an eccentric and ineffectual sect \u201clocked in an arms race to out-remain each other\u201d undermined the presentation of the facts and was antagonistic towards a large swathe of Guardian readers. Many people in the movement have put their careers and family life on hold. We have stood out in rain, wind and heat engaging with the public. We have endured abuse in the street and online. We have stumped up for crowdfunders and campaigns, travelled hundreds of miles to attend rallies and written countless letters to MPs and newspapers. I have nothing but admiration for the grassroots campaigners and organisers who have given far more of their time and energy that I ever could. Surely this new political awakening is cause for celebration, not contempt? Out of the remain movement will come the positive change this country needs. Melissa Percival Crediton, Devon \u2022 Daniel Cohen presents a disturbing picture of remain fanatics who are determined to subvert a democratic decision. The 2016 referendum was not advisory or a test of public opinion; it was presented by those who expected a different result as binding. That was the whole point of holding it. I voted to leave because I am a radical socialist-anarchist and an absolute pacifist. The EU seeks to prevent members opting for socialism or from contracting out of a nuclear-armed alliance like Nato, with which the EU is closely associated. But if this country is to play its part in avoiding catastrophe, it needs to renounce nuclear weapons, close foreign bases, refuse to participate in foreign wars of choice and break the special relationship with the US. We can do none of these things if we are members of the EU and Nato. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only person who voted for Brexit for these reasons. But the remainists cannot even comprehend that such a view exists and can be sustained by powerful arguments. Malcolm Pittock Bolton, Lancashire \u2022 One aspect of Brexit that Daniel Cohen fails to acknowledge is the implicit permission that leave has given to the politics of racism and exclusion. It is possible that many who support remain also fear the implications of the free movement clause in the EU agreement, but so far this has not become a central remain concern. Contrast this with the politics of leave, which from the start invoked a clear call to define and exclude \u201cothers\u201d. What this has provided is not just the toleration of the hostile environment, but also a further legitimation of state-organised racism. By all means identify the persona and literature of remain, but do not exclude the mindset that the politics of leave is creating. Mary Evans Patrixbourne, Kent \u2022 As one of the generation blamed for the Brexit vote, I identified with so much of the long read. I too will feel bereaved if/when Brexit goes ahead and I will be on the march on 19 October. But for me it\u2019s personal. In 2010, my younger son went to Australia to work and is now a dual British and Australian citizen, followed in 2016 by my elder son going to California. Both thought they would return, but have now said they will not come back while the UK is such a divided and racist society. At one time that would have been painful, but now I can only be pleased that they are making careers away from this mess. For the UK, it is the loss of two talented, well-educated individuals who would have contributed much to society. This cannot be a unique situation. Cynthia Battersby Surbiton, Surrey \u2022 Daniel Cohen says Brexit has torn the country apart and remainism isn\u2019t trying to put it back together. This fails to recognise that it is likely that remainers and leavers have a lot of concerns in common, such as NHS underfunding, rising private debt, austerity, inequality, etc. The difference is that they blame different institutions: on the one hand, UK government policy over the past 30 years, on the other, the EU. Both domestically and within the EU, the prevailing ideology is neoliberalism, and the Brexit debate has generated a great deal of heat but very little light. The media highlights and cultivates this division rather than providing a balanced assessment of the causes, myths and misinformation that created it. To do such a thing would show that Brexit has been, perhaps, a deliberate distraction. Charlie Mason Glogue, Pembrokeshire \u2022 The long read could only have been written by someone without sympathy for the estimated half a million workers who will lose their jobs because of the uncompetitive market Brexit will create for exporters, who now pay in tax all of the UK\u2019s contribution to the EU plus about \u00a3800m. Defending government policy cannot be right if it means putting people out of work, and when job losses will be so great, any journalist not questioning the justice and decency of it disrespects humanity and themselves. How can anyone believe that the US is going to take what the UK sends to the EU \u2013 \u00a34bn a week tariff-free in exports \u2013 or enough to make up what the tariffs of no deal will cost. The EU expects to lose 1.5m jobs, and anyone thinking that it will not be taking steps to minimise its losses is not being realistic. Reducing a \u00a34bn-a-week import bill will become a priority for the EU, and its economies missing the UK contribution have no choice but to find investment to replace it. With a substantial labour cost advantage over the UK that won\u2019t be a problem. How will the UK regain its loss?

      "bodyText": "Peter Wilby gives his support to \u201cslow education\u201d as promoted by Mike Grenier (Eton master who wants pupils to learn very slowly, 13 August). A little-known fact is that Michael Gove\u2019s expert panel for the national curriculum review in 2011, of which I was a member, also recommended \u201ca focus on fewer things in greater depth\u201d, and on \u201censuring that all pupils have an appropriate understanding of key elements prior to moving on to the next body of content\u201d. Unfortunately Gove and Nick Gibb took little notice of this key recommendation, derived from evidence from high-performing countries, when deciding the overloaded and unbalanced national curriculum that we now have. Our report is still available on the Department for Education website. Mary James Professor (retired), faculty of education, University of Cambridge \u2022 How I wish that Mike Grenier would restrain his shudders at the thought of \u201cchild-centred education\u201d. As a teacher of young children in the 1970s, I find so much in common with his \u201cslow education movement\u201d, and wish that he would take a little time to understand the nature of learning through discovery at primary school level. It certainly wasn\u2019t a free-for-all as he contemptuously suggests.

      "bodyText": "The number of female students taking exams in A-level sciences overtook males for the first time ever this year, the culmination of decades-long efforts to encourage the take-up of science, maths and technology. But the publication of the summer exam results for hundreds of thousands of students across the UK also showed a dip in results across the board in England, including a sharp drop of one percentage point in those awarded the top A and A* grades to the lowest share since the A* grade was introduced in 2010. The proportion attaining the top A* grade in England fell to 7.7% while the proportion attaining A and A* went down from 26.2% last year to 25.2% this year. For entries in England attaining grades C and above, the rate also fell to 75.5%, down from 76.8% in 2018 and the lowest rate since 2012. England\u2019s weaker performance dragged down the UK average results, despite strong better performances in Wales and Northern Ireland, with more than 9% of entries in Wales gaining A*s. Nationally, 25.5% of entries in England, Wales and Northern Ireland attained As or A*s, compared with 26.4% last year, and the proportion of those attaining C or above dropped from 78% in 2018 to 75.8% this year. Experts said that the fall in grades was partly explained by more students taking A-levels than in the past. \u201cThe difference in outcomes this year is explained by the change in the students taking the subjects, and the changing mix of subjects they are taking,\u201d said Alex Scharaschkin of the AQA board. Ucas, the admissions facilitator, announced that a record proportion of 18-year-olds had been accepted on to higher education courses through its system, including more than 28% of 18-year-olds in England. But the total number of students accepted, including those from overseas, has fallen by 1% to 408,000. The musician Stormzy announced he would fund a further two scholarships for black students at the University of Cambridge, following the two launched by the award-winning grime artist last year.

Jill Duffy of the OCR exam board said the shift \u2013 a 10 percentage point change compared with 2012 \u2013 was the result of years of effort to get over some of the stereotypes girls might have had about studying science. \u201cAs a proud mum of two daughters who are scientists, I think it\u2019s absolutely brilliant to see this increase in females choosing to take A-level sciences,\u201d Duffy said. Biology was the most popular subject for females, who accounted for 63% of entries.

Adults in mental health crises were sent as far as 300 miles from home last year \u2013 a situation NHS chiefs have admitted reduces the chances of recovery because vulnerable people are separated from their loved ones. Figures uncovered by Labour show private healthcare firms are being paid increasing amounts to look after such patients as the NHS struggles to cope. In 2018/19, \u00a399,683,000 was spent on out-of-area placements provided by private companies, up from \u00a377,324,720 in 2017/18, government statistics show. Payments included more than \u00a331m to Cygnet Healthcare, which owned Whorlton Hall, a unit that was criticised after the BBC\u2019s Panorama revealed in May that residents had been abused by staff. Another provider, the Priory Group, received more than \u00a345m.

In 2018/19 more than 1,300 of these placements were more than 200 miles from the patient\u2019s home, effectively cutting off people from the vital support of their friends and family. The health service has a programme to create more beds but the widespread practice of out-of-area placements has triggered calls for this to be speeded up.

Greens Caroline Lucas, the Green party\u2019s sole MP \u2013 whose own plan for a women-only unity cabinet met with a frosty reception \u2013 has taken a similar view to Saville Roberts, and has also appealed to Swinson to reconsider backing a temporary Corbyn-led government. Rebel Tories The admittedly semi-detached Welsh Conservative party MP Guto Bebb has said that even a Corbyn government would be preferable to no deal. But it seems hard to see many other Tories following him. Former Labour independents Ian Austin, a long-time Corbyn foe, has already ruled out supporting his plan for a temporary government, and it is hard to see MPs such as Frank Field, John Woodcock, and others, doing so either.",

      "body": "<p>Jeremy Corbyn has always been more of a politician than either his most fervent supporters or detractors have wanted to admit. Last night he again demonstrated why. In a move unprecedented in modern times, the leader of the opposition has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/14/jeremy-corbyn-urges-opposition-leaders-and-tory-rebels-to-help-oust-pm\" title=\"\">offered to form a government</a> with the express proviso of not implementing any of his party\u2019s policies.</p> \n<p>Corbyn\u2019s offer, in a letter to other party leaders and moderate Tories, involves setting up a \u201cstrictly time-limited temporary government\u201d with the sole intention of extending article 50 and holding a general election. In that election, Corbyn will commit to a new referendum with the option of remaining in the EU. </p> \n<p>There might be debate about why he\u2019s done this, but ultimately his motives don\u2019t matter. Corbyn is the leader of the opposition and, in accordance with our unwritten constitution, the first alternative prime minister. He is also offering a concrete proposal to do exactly the thing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/15/remainers-stop-brexit-install-corbyn-pm\" title=\"\">remainers say they want</a> \u2013 to stop no deal and then offer voters the chance to stop Brexit altogether.</p> \n<p>Of course, if Corbyn was attempting to trap the Lib Dems, they have walked right into it. Jo Swinson, the party\u2019s leader, has dismissed outright the prospect of Corbyn leading such a government, and has not even signalled a willingness to enter discussions with him. Instead, she has declared she could support <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/15/corbyns-plan-to-lead-caretaker-government-unworkable-say-lib-dems\" title=\"\">a Ken Clarke or Harriet Harman government</a>. All well and good, but neither of these MPs is leader of the opposition (or any political party), and Swinson does not have the parliamentary numbers or time to pick and choose who she is prepared to work with.</p> \n<p>The new Lib Dem leader risks making a grave mistake. Even in purely party political terms, a Corbyn-led caretaker government does not necessarily strengthen Labour in the long term. But more importantly, Swinson has always emphasised, rightly, that her party\u2019s priority is to stop no deal. This could prove the only way to do so. If the Lib Dems really believe that a few months of a limited Corbyn government is worse than medicine shortages, it is their duty to say why.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6abb9549-0f30-403e-8f6c-7eff020700ee\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qViLF9oNupY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Remainers can, of course, be forgiven for some scepticism at Corbyn\u2019s offer, and many questions remain unanswered. Labour will offer a remain option in a referendum, but will it in all circumstances campaign for that? Is it still party policy to renegotiate Brexit first? Why not in fact call that referendum now, then hold a general election that \u2013 heaven forbid \u2013 might not actually be about Brexit, but instead focus on some of the vital issues we have been ignoring for the past three years? The point is that all parties will need to engage, fast and in good faith. Any prime minister derives their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/14/johnson-sparks-cross-party-backlash-over-brexit-collaboration-claim\" title=\"\">authority from parliament</a> alone, and if Corbyn strayed from the agreed path MPs could instantly withdraw their confidence.</p> \n<p>It is also the case that parliament can deploy multiple and simultaneous tactics to stop no deal.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has always been more of a politician than either his most fervent supporters or detractors have wanted to admit. Last night he again demonstrated why. In a move unprecedented in modern times, the leader of the opposition has offered to form a government with the express proviso of not implementing any of his party\u2019s policies. Corbyn\u2019s offer, in a letter to other party leaders and moderate Tories, involves setting up a \u201cstrictly time-limited temporary government\u201d with the sole intention of extending article 50 and holding a general election. In that election, Corbyn will commit to a new referendum with the option of remaining in the EU. There might be debate about why he\u2019s done this, but ultimately his motives don\u2019t matter. Corbyn is the leader of the opposition and, in accordance with our unwritten constitution, the first alternative prime minister. He is also offering a concrete proposal to do exactly the thing remainers say they want \u2013 to stop no deal and then offer voters the chance to stop Brexit altogether. Of course, if Corbyn was attempting to trap the Lib Dems, they have walked right into it. Jo Swinson, the party\u2019s leader, has dismissed outright the prospect of Corbyn leading such a government, and has not even signalled a willingness to enter discussions with him. Instead, she has declared she could support a Ken Clarke or Harriet Harman government. All well and good, but neither of these MPs is leader of the opposition (or any political party), and Swinson does not have the parliamentary numbers or time to pick and choose who she is prepared to work with. The new Lib Dem leader risks making a grave mistake. Even in purely party political terms, a Corbyn-led caretaker government does not necessarily strengthen Labour in the long term. But more importantly, Swinson has always emphasised, rightly, that her party\u2019s priority is to stop no deal. This could prove the only way to do so. If the Lib Dems really believe that a few months of a limited Corbyn government is worse than medicine shortages, it is their duty to say why. Remainers can, of course, be forgiven for some scepticism at Corbyn\u2019s offer, and many questions remain unanswered. Labour will offer a remain option in a referendum, but will it in all circumstances campaign for that? Is it still party policy to renegotiate Brexit first? Why not in fact call that referendum now, then hold a general election that \u2013 heaven forbid \u2013 might not actually be about Brexit, but instead focus on some of the vital issues we have been ignoring for the past three years? The point is that all parties will need to engage, fast and in good faith. Any prime minister derives their authority from parliament alone, and if Corbyn strayed from the agreed path MPs could instantly withdraw their confidence. It is also the case that parliament can deploy multiple and simultaneous tactics to stop no deal. MPs can enact legislation to force an extension request while still haggling over no-confidence motions and an alternative government. It is, however, more difficult to legislate in the face of government opposition than to work with a government that shares your basic objectives. Corbyn\u2019s solution may not be perfect, but may be the most viable. The truth is that if our political parties do not do everything possible to avoid no deal, none of them will escape the blame for it. When politicians put party or personality ahead of the national interest and people\u2019s lives, voters punish them. Such a spectacular failure of the political class would only benefit the extreme political fringes. It is time for the Lib Dems, and indeed all remainers, to decide what they really want. A few months of a Corbyn government is not worse than infrastructural or economic collapse. If your most important goal is to stop no deal, you must take every conceivable step to do just that.

This is not because they are lazy or unintelligent; the truth is more complex and it boils down to social class.

At face value, the decision to make early and unconditional offers to those with such profiles might appear perverse, but these young people aren\u2019t entering the system on an equal footing compared with the majority of their peers. Not all disadvantaged young people have such low results, but some research suggests that they are more likely to be predicted to have lower grades and this lowers expectations.</p> \n<p>Universities in England have been forced to reposition themselves as income generators within a competitive education market and they engage in fierce annual competition for students. Students are so valuable that larger numbers of unconditional offers are made earlier each year and students are cajoled into taking up a firm offer (to the exclusion of all others).

      "bodyText": "As A-level students across England, Wales and Northern Ireland open their results today it is fascinating to see how the public broadcasting of success is reaching ever wider audiences through news streaming and social media, where constant posting and comments will dominate news for the next few days. Images of young people literally jumping for joy dominate the headlines and the exam results data is closely interrogated. Data analysis usually rests on pass rates and concern about whether these have risen or fallen; each year there are questions that challenge our trust in the so-called gold standard examination, because A-levels have the potential to open doors for (some) young people. A record number of 18-year-olds (18,900 students) from the most disadvantaged backgrounds in England have been accepted into university this year; in Northern Ireland and Wales, there are increases too. But another story lurks behind all of these discussions \u2013 not all students will necessarily meet their academic potential at school. This is not because they are lazy or unintelligent; the truth is more complex and it boils down to social class. While some commentators might scoff about accommodations being made for those from disadvantaged backgrounds, the reality is that without engineered opportunity those young people will not have the chance to see if they can do more. Equality of opportunity is not enough, what we need is equity. Theodore Agnew, the Conservative minister for schools in the House of Lords, told a private schools\u2019 conference in May: \u201cWhy are we letting kids go to university with three Es at A-level? It\u2019s a lunacy\u201d. At face value, the decision to make early and unconditional offers to those with such profiles might appear perverse, but these young people aren\u2019t entering the system on an equal footing compared with the majority of their peers. Not all disadvantaged young people have such low results, but some research suggests that they are more likely to be predicted to have lower grades and this lowers expectations. Universities in England have been forced to reposition themselves as income generators within a competitive education market and they engage in fierce annual competition for students. Students are so valuable that larger numbers of unconditional offers are made earlier each year and students are cajoled into taking up a firm offer (to the exclusion of all others). It is disadvantaged students who are more likely to receive unconditional offers and, with an offer in the bag, this appears to hamper their motivation to aim for higher grades. Why is this a problem? Because it is another factor in suppressing potential; that young person might have achieved more highly than expected, and had different opportunities open to them, or more options in terms of course or institution. While an increase in the number of disadvantaged students being offered university places is to be welcomed, we should not assume the job of widening participation is complete. Much of the rhetoric about examination results is linked to future economic prosperity: good A-level results will provide a better lever into sustainable employment. However, getting to university is just the start for disadvantaged young people and once in, they face more challenges.

      "body": "<p>You can understand why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/01/rose-mcgowan-edinburgh-harvey-weinstein-me-too\">Rose McGowan</a> might want to leave this planet behind her. She grew up in and then fled a cult, fell into the arms of another cult (as she describes Hollywood), survived sexual assault and endured the abuse that came with leading the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\">#MeToo</a> campaign against it. Small wonder she created a place to take refuge: Planet 9, where orbs shimmer and we\u2019re all free to become our best and most beautiful selves. But on the basis of her new show, one doubts whether many will come along for the ride.</p> \n<p>The show and album that take us there were created alongside her memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/11/brave-rose-mcgowan-review-harvey-weinstein\">Brave</a>. The latter gave vent to her anger; the former is more optimistic. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to be so earthbound in our thinking,\u201d McGowan tells us, barefoot and stately in a white Grecian robe. This \u201cvisuals, spoken word and singing\u201d show features tracks from her album with video she has made herself, spliced into a sermon about escaping our psychological shackles and realising our potential to be free. \u201cNot to sound like a Californian hippy\u201d, she says at one point. That is exactly how she sounds.</p> \n<p>Which isn\u2019t a problem in itself: Californian hippies have plenty to teach us. But McGowan seldom escapes their most cliched expressions. \u201cTake my hand / Sail in air / On solar flares,\u201d she speak-sings to ambient electronica, while blissed-out visuals pulse and swirl onscreen. Her voice is strong but wayward: she can hold a note, but it doesn\u2019t always sound like the right one.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom

      "bodyText": "You can understand why Rose McGowan might want to leave this planet behind her. She grew up in and then fled a cult, fell into the arms of another cult (as she describes Hollywood), survived sexual assault and endured the abuse that came with leading the #MeToo campaign against it. Small wonder she created a place to take refuge: Planet 9, where orbs shimmer and we\u2019re all free to become our best and most beautiful selves. But on the basis of her new show, one doubts whether many will come along for the ride. The show and album that take us there were created alongside her memoir, Brave. The latter gave vent to her anger; the former is more optimistic. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to be so earthbound in our thinking,\u201d McGowan tells us, barefoot and stately in a white Grecian robe. This \u201cvisuals, spoken word and singing\u201d show features tracks from her album with video she has made herself, spliced into a sermon about escaping our psychological shackles and realising our potential to be free. \u201cNot to sound like a Californian hippy\u201d, she says at one point. That is exactly how she sounds. Which isn\u2019t a problem in itself: Californian hippies have plenty to teach us. But McGowan seldom escapes their most cliched expressions. \u201cTake my hand / Sail in air / On solar flares,\u201d she speak-sings to ambient electronica, while blissed-out visuals pulse and swirl onscreen. Her voice is strong but wayward: she can hold a note, but it doesn\u2019t always sound like the right one. It\u2019s frustrating, because I\u2019d guess the real McGowan, the one she relaxes into when she\u2019s not being her best, astral self, is more entertaining company. We get fleeting glimpses: the odd sardonic laugh or frank aside. More often \u2013 wafting around like a refugee from 1970s sci-fi \u2013 she\u2019s stilted: words blandly intoned, hands curiously rigid like the astral winds changed direction while she was doing yoga. This is clearly a meaningful project for her, one that has helped her survive, she says, the last three traumatic years. Good luck to her. But audiences might prefer more earthly pleasures.

Their stands are dotted with flickering synapses of light and their rousing, soulful music, at once full of life and mourning. Both song and story are blended with the myth of Orpheus, the god of music, and in tracing the history of Barton and Axe\u2019s grandparents, coincidental parallels tie myth to reality.</p> \n<p>The structure gets a little lost along the way. Reverb makes some of the lyrics hard to hear, a third mystical storyline is distracting, and a dip into neuroscience is too easily drawn from Wikipedia to match the beauty of the details in the family\u2019s history. It\u2019s their particular story that makes this piece so engaging, and at times it feels as though the current tugs too far away from Flora. But at its best, it soars. A particularly heartbreaking moment comes as Flora talks about her dead husband, who also had the disease, and wishes for the ability to forget her own dementia.</p> \n<figure class=\"element

      "bodyText": "This storytelling concert is a tribute to the power of music, both for its ability to create new memories and to restore old ones. Writer Max Barton and his sister Addison Axe weave together music, myth and family history, telling us about their 87-year-old grandma Flora, who has Alzheimer\u2019s. Accompanied by five Australian alt-rock musicians, STYX is a moving, creative exploration of memory loss. Beautifully staged, the band are gathered like the gods. Their stands are dotted with flickering synapses of light and their rousing, soulful music, at once full of life and mourning. Both song and story are blended with the myth of Orpheus, the god of music, and in tracing the history of Barton and Axe\u2019s grandparents, coincidental parallels tie myth to reality. The structure gets a little lost along the way. Reverb makes some of the lyrics hard to hear, a third mystical storyline is distracting, and a dip into neuroscience is too easily drawn from Wikipedia to match the beauty of the details in the family\u2019s history. It\u2019s their particular story that makes this piece so engaging, and at times it feels as though the current tugs too far away from Flora. But at its best, it soars. A particularly heartbreaking moment comes as Flora talks about her dead husband, who also had the disease, and wishes for the ability to forget her own dementia. STYX evokes a half-remembered song suddenly falling into a melody, with the people you love buried between the notes. Both intimate and epic, the show may be patchy in places, but so too are most of our memories. It left me full of love and desperate to call my grandma. At Zoo Southside, Edinburgh, until 17 August. Playground theatre, London, 2 to 14 September. Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews.",

The poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, both of whom survived after fighting for their lives, also left a policeman critically ill after he searched their home. Now counter-terrorism detectives investigating the attack, which is alleged to have been carried out by two Russian agents, have confirmed for the first time that another police officer was also poisoned during forensic testing at the UK\u2019s top secret laboratory Porton Down. The officer from Wiltshire police, who does not want to be named, was involved in the response to the attack in March last year, but Metropolitan police refused to say what role they played. The officer \u201cdisplayed signs at the time\u201d of exposure to a \u201cvery small amount\u201d of the nerve agent and returned to work shortly afterwards following medical treatment. It brings the number of confirmed victims of the initial attack to four, and the total number of victims of novichok exposure to six. Dawn Sturgess, 44, died months after the attack, after spraying on her the liquid found in a discarded perfume bottle her partner Charlie Rowley came across and which was used to carry the military-grade nerve agent. Rowley, who fell ill too but survived, said he gave the bottle to Sturgess as a gift. Counter-terrorism officers have also contacted a small number of people whose blood samples were taken at the time of the attack to seek their permission for forensic testing, the Met said.

The curve re-steepened and only inverted again as the Fed reversed course and hiked a few quarters later. The recession soon followed the subsequent inversion. The second, following the May 1998 inversion, took 34 months until a recession arose but the inversion was relatively brief and occurred just prior to the Russian/LTCM crisis where the Fed rapidly cut 75bps thus re-steepening the curve. The Fed then raised rates again from 1999 and the curve re-inverted in early 2000, around a year before the actual recession.</p> <p><strong>So, the</strong> <strong>conclusion is that the Fed has successfully acted before to delay the inversion turning into a recession but only on 2/9 occasions. Given that the market already prices in 65bps of cuts before year end it feels like they might need to out-pace that to make it 3 out of 10 where they\u2019ve delayed the recession.</strong></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-15T09:19:03.393Z\">at 10.19am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d5518658f08c7e177d4ad13\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-15T08:40:07.473Z\">9.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Online spending boosts UK retail sales</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Just in: UK retail sales grew last month, as consumer shrugged off Brexit uncertainty and fears that Britain\u2019s economy is weakening.</strong></p> <p>Retail sales rose by 0.2% in July, the Office for National Statistics says, better than the 0.2% decline which the City expected.</p> <p>Non-store retailing (such as internet shopping), surged by 6.9% during the month, and was 12.7% higher than a year ago. </p> <p>That may be due to Amazon\u2019s Prime Day, its regular summer sale.

      "bodyText": "Update: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has hit a new six-month closing low. The blue-chip index just closed 80 points lower at 7,067, a drop of 1.1%. Recession fears dragged the market down, with mining companies, and financial stocks leading the sell-off. Time for a quick recap Financial markets remain volatile today, as fears of an economic downturn hit stock prices and drive bond prices to new record highs. Shares fell sharply in parts of Asia, with Australia suffering its worst day of 2019. In London, the FTSE 100 has tumbled to its lowest level since the end of February - down 80 points at pixel time, with mining companies and banks among the top fallers. European markets also hit six-months lows, as concern grows that Germany could be sliding into recession (it shrank in the last quarter). America\u2019s bond yield curve inverted for the second day running, with 10-year Treasury bills trading at a lower yield than 2-year T-Bills. Some experts see as a clear warning sign of a recession, although others disagree. Retail sales have beaten expectations in both the UK and the US, calming some fears of a slowdown. After a nervy start, the Dow Jones industrial average is up 60 points -- having shed 800 points in an alarming selloff yesterday. The US-China trade war has flared up again. Beijing spooked investors by announcing it would impose counter-measures in response to America\u2019s plan to raise tariffs on $300bn of Chinese goods. But officials also spoke about meeting US half-way in search of a deal. Donald Trump, though, has insisted that any breakthrough will be on Washington\u2019s terms. He\u2019s also weighed in on the Hong Kong protests: Elsewhere in the markets, sterling has hit its highest level this week. The pound has gained three-quarters of a cent, to $1.2122. Traders are citing efforts to prevent a no-deal Brexit, as MPs try to stop Boris Johnson crashing the UK out of the EU at the end of October. On one hand, you have Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn trying to persuade Conservative rebels to vote against their own government in a no-confidence vote. On the other, the opposition Liberal Democrats are resisting Corbyn\u2019s advances, and proposing a unity government led by someone else. The pound\u2019s strength is helping to push the FTSE 100 down -- the index has recovered some of its early losses, but is still down 80 points at 7068, down 1%. After its worst day of 2019, Wall Street has just opened cautiously. The main stock indices are slightly lower, with traders keeping their powder dry while recession worries rage. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 28 points, or 0.1%, having slumped by 800 points on Wednesday (its fourth biggest points loss ever, although much less dramatic in percentage terms). Technology stocks are also weakening a little, pushing the Nasdaq a little lower (like the Dow, it lost 3% yesterday). Newsflash: Donald Trump has now weighed in, saying that the US-China trade deal has do be done \u201con our terms\u201d. That\u2019s pushing back against Beijing\u2019s call for a compromise \u201chalf way\u201d. Lori Calvasina, head of US equity strategy at RBC, thinks Trump is being too ambitious. Given the clashes in Hong Kong, Beijing can\u2019t afford to look weak over trade, she says on Bloomberg TV. Less good news: US factory output declined by 0.4% in July, new data show. That\u2019s a little worse than expected, and follows a 0.6% gain in June. It could be a sign that American manufacturers are struggling. Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at insurance giant Allianz, has dismissed talk that America could be heading into recession as \u201csilly\u201d. But he also warns that the stock markets will be more volatile in the months ahead, even though the strength of US consumer spending could insulate the US economy from problems overseas. Here\u2019s a clip from CNBC: Just in: US retail sales were stronger than expected last month, calming fears of an imminent recession. American shoppers spent 0.7% more in July than in June, beating expectations of a 0.3% rise. As in the UK (see earlier post), internet shopping provided a big boost -- again, Amazon Prime Day is a likely reason. It\u2019s hard to keep track of all the maneuvers in the US trade war. But helpfully, the Peterson Institute\u2019s Chad Brown has explained America\u2019s latest move - to impose higher tariffs on clothing, shoes and technology products made in China: Wall Street isn\u2019t even open yet, but the futures market has been pretty darn lively - hit by recession worries and trade war tensions. Newsflash: China has now made some more conciliatory comments about the trade war with the US. The Ministry of Finance has said that it hopes to meet America \u201chalf-way\u201d to resolve the dispute, and that presidents Xi and Trump are in touch through phone calls and letters, as well as their recent meeting at the last G7 summit. This is helping the markets to recover some ground - European stock markets are now a little higher again, and Wall Street is tipped to recover some ground too. What a day! How might China retaliate against the US\u2019s latest tariffs on $300bn of its exports? It can\u2019t simply respond in kind. China only bought $120bn of goods from America in 2018, and has already imposed tariffs on them, in response to earlier US sanctions. Beijing could raise its existing tariffs, I suppose but that would badly hurt Chinese consumers and companies (who would pay the tariff). Instead, policymakers could use non-tariff measures. It could allow the yuan to fall in value, or cut off purchases from America altogether in favour of other countries (Brazilian soybeans, anyone?). The nuclear option, as Eleanor Creagh of Saxo Bank points out, would be to stop buying US government debt. That would shake the markets, as China has been such a huge buyer of US Treasuries. Ironically, such a move might drive down the prices on US debt, pushing up yields and ending the yield curve inversion..... Oil is continuing to slide today, hit by fears of a global downturn. Brent crude has dropped by 2.5% to just over $58 per barrel. It was already a rough day in the markets, even before China ratcheted up the trade war tensions: Hold onto your hats, folks. The Dow Jones industrial average is now tipped to lose more than 200 points when trading begins, a drop of 0.8%. That\u2019s on top of yesterday\u2019s 800-point slide. August has been a torrid month for the markets, and we\u2019re only halfway through it! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100, for example, has fallen by over 7% in the last two weeks - from 7,586 points to just 7028 right now (down another 120 points today!). The Footsie is still up 5% this year, so it\u2019s not disastrous. Plus, August is notoriously volatile (liquidity is lower as investors take their holidays). Fund manager Brent Carlile thinks China\u2019s threat is a response to Donald Trump\u2019s decision to delay tariffs on Chinese-made consumer goods until December. That concession is meant to protect US consumers from pre-Christmas price hikes - but could also look like weakness from the White House. Crumbs. Shares in Europe\u2019s banking sector are down 1.2%, hitting their lowest level since 2012 - when the eurozone debt crisis was raging. Mining companies are among the top fallers in London, dragging the market deeper into the red. The FTSE 100 is now down 92 points at 7056, its lowest level since the end of February. Anglo American are down 5.7% and Glencore has lost 4.5%. Demand for coal, copper and iron ore will all decline if a trade war creates a global downturn. Financial stocks are also suffering from recession fears, with Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Life Aberdeen both losing 3.5%. One for the chartists out there: President Trump could retaliate to China\u2019s threatened retaliation by imposing higher tariffs on all Chinese imports, suggests Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group. Currently, the US is planning to levy a 10% tariff on the $300bn of Chinese goods that isn\u2019t already being taxed. That kicks in next month, although some consumer goods will be spared until December. Ouch! The Stoxx 600 index of Europe\u2019s top listed companies has hit its lowest level since February, down another 0.7% today. China\u2019s threatened retaliation is a slap in the face to Donald Trump. Yesterday, the US president claimed that Beijing was keen to make a deal, and even suggested a personal meeting with Xi Jinping to help resolve the protests in Hong Kong. I think we can expect a sharp response once @realDonaldTrump wakes up..... Neil Wilson of Markets.com says the threat of a deepening US-China trade war has spooked investors, wiping out the early recovery in Europe. This was always a very precarious bounce and it has died a quick death. Like a 1990s England Test top order it couldn\u2019t even make it to lunch. Let\u2019s see where we\u2019re at by stumps. European indices rolled over into the red to hit day lows as a series of news flashes indicated further worries about trade, with China saying the US has violated past agreements with the 10% tariffs and that Beijing will have to take countermeasures. Any retaliation from Beijing could encourage America to hit back hard, Wilson adds: This does not bode well and may encourage Trump to react \u2013 there is a chance he could bring forward all the tariffs to September 1st. Countermeasures suggests China is not interested in the delay to tariffs \u2013 and may have sniffed a weakness in the US position and is keen to exploit it. Retaliation by China means escalation in tensions, and diminishes the chances of a positive outcome in the near term. Risks are still to the downside. As ever, though, only a tweet away. European stock markets are sliding sharply, following Beijing\u2019s threat to impose new trade sanctions on the US. In London, the FTSE 100 has tumbled by 1%, losing 69 points to 7078 points - on top of the 103 points lost yesterday. That\u2019s its lowest point since March. The German DAX has hit a new five-month low too, and there are losses in France and Spain too. The prospect of Beijing retaliating to America\u2019s latest tariffs is also dampening the mood in New York. Wall Street had been expected to rally after yesterday\u2019s slump - but that putative recovery is fizzling out. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take on Beijing\u2019s pledge to retaliate in the ongoing trade war with America. China has to take necessary counter-measures to the latest U.S. tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods, the finance ministry said on Thursday. The ministry also said the U.S. tariffs violate a consensus reached by leaders of two countries and get off the right track of resolving disputes via negotiation. The United States said early this month it would slap duties on $300 billion of Chinese goods from Sept. 1, which would effectively cover all of China\u2019s exports to the United States. But President Donald Trump backed off part of the plan on Tuesday, delaying duties on some of the items on the list such as cellphones, laptops and other consumer goods, in the hopes of blunting their impact on U.S. holiday sales. Tariffs will still apply to those products from mid-December. NEWSFLASH: China has launched a fresh attack on America over the trade war, giving investors another reason to panic. The Chinese finance ministry has accused the US of violating the consensus drawn up between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. Specifically, Beijing is unhappy that America announced a new 10% tariff on $300bn of China\u2019s exports this month. This move undermines efforts to resolve the trade dispute, it says. In a worrying development, China says it will have to proceed with \u201ccountermeasures\u201d, suggesting it will further escalate the trade war. This is a blow - only on Tuesday, Trump backtracked and decided to delay some of the new tariffs until December, to avoid driving up the price of computer game consoles and mobile phones. Deutsche Bank analyst Jim Reid is so excited about the inversion of the US yield curve that he\u2019s broken off from his holiday to explain why (in his view) it\u2019s a very serious warning sign. He points out that every US recession since the 1950s has followed an inverted yield curve (where two-year US bonds are trading at higher rates than 10-year bonds). That\u2019s because such an usual situation shows that \u2018animal spirits\u2019 (or investor confidence) is waning. Central bankers have, in the past, slashed interest rates to support growth and delay a recession, but it doesn\u2019t always work. Reid explains: Every inversion since 1956 has seen a recession follow. Although the median length of time to a recession is 17 months, credit spreads have pretty much exclusively widened from the point of inversion onwards. Of those 2 of the 9 recessions since the 1950s took more than 2 years to materialise after the first inversion though. The first in the mid-1960s (took nearly 4 years) was due to a Fed policy error where the Fed didn\u2019t raise rates as expected (they actually cut) with inflation rising. The curve re-steepened and only inverted again as the Fed reversed course and hiked a few quarters later. The recession soon followed the subsequent inversion. The second, following the May 1998 inversion, took 34 months until a recession arose but the inversion was relatively brief and occurred just prior to the Russian/LTCM crisis where the Fed rapidly cut 75bps thus re-steepening the curve. The Fed then raised rates again from 1999 and the curve re-inverted in early 2000, around a year before the actual recession. So, the conclusion is that the Fed has successfully acted before to delay the inversion turning into a recession but only on 2/9 occasions. Given that the market already prices in 65bps of cuts before year end it feels like they might need to out-pace that to make it 3 out of 10 where they\u2019ve delayed the recession. Just in: UK retail sales grew last month, as consumer shrugged off Brexit uncertainty and fears that Britain\u2019s economy is weakening. Retail sales rose by 0.2% in July, the Office for National Statistics says, better than the 0.2% decline which the City expected. Non-store retailing (such as internet shopping), surged by 6.9% during the month, and was 12.7% higher than a year ago. That may be due to Amazon\u2019s Prime Day, its regular summer sale. This year, other retailers jumped on the bandwagon with their own price reductions, in a bid to win sales. The ONS also found that Britain\u2019s battered department stores grew their sales by 1.6%, after a six-month slump. Food sales fell year-on-year, though -- perhaps because 12 months ago Brits were gorging on barbecued burgers during the July heatwave. European bank shares are down this morning, hit by anxiety that Germany could be sliding into recession (possibly followed by the US next year, if the yield curve is to be believed). The Financial Times is also concerned by the surge in bond prices, saying: A sharp rally in government bonds set fresh records on Thursday, with the yield on 30-year US government bonds falling below 2 per cent for the first time as investors sought safety amid growing fears over the global economy. Traders have dumped riskier assets such as stocks and crude oil and moved into perceived \u201chavens\u201d, including bonds, sending their yields lower. On Wednesday a closely watched metric in the US government bond market turned negative, raising new recession concerns. That indicator, the yield curve, remained inverted in Thursday morning trading in London. Anxiety over the global economy sent Japan\u2019s stock market to a six-month low today. Our new friend, the US inverted yield curve, is being blamed (although it isn\u2019t an infallible recession indicator) . Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co, says: \u201cThe yield curve inversion prompted more investors to become concerned about the growth outlook,\u201d The UK government bond yield curve has also inverted for the second day running. That\u2019s because the rate of return on 10-year British gilts has dropped to 0.451%, below below the two-year bond which is yielding 0.455%. As with America\u2019s Treasuries, that shows investors are accepting a lower rate of return for longer-term lending than shorter-term lending. Does that mean Britain is plunging into recession? Not necessarily. As economist Rupert Seggins points out, the UK yield curve has been an unreliable forecaster of economic trends. It did invert before three recessions, but also inverted on four other occasions when a recession wasn\u2019t looming. Another important point is that Britain can borrow very cheaply right now -- perhaps for growth-boosting infrastructure programme? Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, is urging us all not to get obsessed by the inversion of the US yield curve. He points out that the tumble in longer-dated borrowing costs won\u2019t have much economic impact on its own --it\u2019s mainly an indicator of market sentiment. And, he argues, it doesn\u2019t mean shares are about to crash. Haefele explains: The length of time the yield curve is inverted, and how much is inverted, matter. If Fed rate cuts successfully steepen the curve comfortably into positive territory, this brief curve inversion may be a premature recession signal. Neither does a yield curve inversion indicate it is time to sell equities. Since 1975, after an inversion in the 2-year/10-year yield curve, the S&amp;P 500 has continued to rally for nearly two years, and has risen by 40% on average until hitting a bull market peak.\u201d Energy and financial stocks are down in London this morning, a sign that traders are pessimistic about growth prospects And we\u2019re off! European markets are open, and inching higher in early trading. The Stoxx 600 index, which contains a broad sweep of EU companies, has risen by 0.3% -- hardly a major recovery from Wednesday\u2019s 1.8% tumble. But in London. the FTSE 100 has dropped by 14 points to 7,132, back towards yesterday\u2019s lows. Traders are nervous, following the losses in Asia overnight and the 3% plunge on Wall Street last night. Alex Kuptsikevich, financial analyst at FX Pro, fears that investors could talk themselves into a crisis: The most dangerous thing in this situation is that market fears of recession could end up fuelling further demand for safe havens, further intensifying the anxiety of stock markets. Recession fears are also driving investors into German government debt - another safe haven (even though Germany may be sliding into recession). The yield on German 30-year bonds has fallen below minus 0.2% for the first time ever. That negative bond yield means asset managers are prepared to pay for the privilege of lending to Berlin, and not get their money back until 2049. Hardly a sign of optimism in the global economy. [Reminder: Bond yields, a broad measure of the interest rate on a bond, fall when prices rise]. Morning all. City traders are bracing for another volatile session, after European stock markets hit their lowest levels in six months yesterday. Alarmingly, the US yield curve is inverting again this morning, suggesting investors are worried that a recession is looming. The yield (rate of return) on America\u2019s 10-year Treasury bills has fallen below the yield for the 2-year bond for the second day running. Investors are now getting just 1.57% on the ten year, or 1.58% on the two-year bond. That\u2019s worrying -- longer-dated bonds ought to trade at a higher yield, to compensate for the extra risk of lending money for longer, and for the erosion of inflation. As many experts have been racing to tell us, an inverted yield curve has been a reliable indicator that a recession is looming (although it can take more than a year to arrive). Investors are certainly piling into US government debt, looking for a safe place to store their money. That\u2019s why the yield on American 30-year government bonds plunged below 2% for the first time ever. That\u2019s an astonishingly low return on your investment - basically matching America\u2019s inflation rate. I\u2019m about to hand over to my colleagues in London but here\u2019s what you need to know on a day when concerns about recession in the US, Germany and China have plagued markets in Asia. Asian stocks have fallen across the board although losses were not as bad as in Wall Street on Wednesday. The Nikkei was down 1.2% in the afternoon while the Shanghai Composite is off 0.4% and the Hang Seng is flat. The biggest falls were in Australia where the ASX200 has lost almost 3%, wiping around A$60bn off the value of shares. Oil has continued to tumble. Brent crude has lost another 0.6% to $59.12 a barrel, after shedding 3% on Wednesday. US crude was down 0.4% at $55.03. Gold rose 0.3% to $1,521.00 per ounce and is close to its highest since April 2013. The yield on 30-year US treasuries has fallen below 2% for the first time ever in another sign that interest rates are set to remain lower for longer. Some analysts pushed back a bit on fears that the inverted US bond yield curve seen on Wednesday \u2013 and which sparked the 800-point fall in the Dow \u2013 is as crucial as some believe. Futures trade points to a positive start in London and New York later. Thanks for joining me. Ouch. The ASX200 suffers its worst day since February 2018. It\u2019s down 2.85% at 6,408. Around A$60bn removed from values. The Australian market is now off 2.9%, or 187 points, at 6.408 points, but we\u2019ll know the full damage when trading closes in a few minutes. It\u2019s easily the worst performer in Asia Pacific where traders have reduced losses in Hong Kong and Shanghai. Japan is down 1.2%. Meanwhile, European markets are opening in an hour. IG are calling the market openings: In Australia the ASX has slumped by 2.8%, a real bloodbath for a market that hit an all-time high just a couple of weeks ago. The AMP economist Shane Oliver has been looking at today\u2019s employment figures and he reckons the signs aren\u2019t that great going forward. And our own Greg Jericho has weighed in: No blog is complete without a word from Holger. The Dutch economy seems in pretty good shape and will grow by 1.4% in 2020. But that is slower than expected because exports have been hit by weakening growth in Germany, Brexit and US trade policies, the country\u2019s forecasting body CPB has said. Growth in 2019 is expected to be a bit stronger than earlier expected at 1.8%, after a 2.6% expansion last year. That compares favourably with GDP data from Germany yesterday which showed the powerhouse economy contracting by 0.1% in the June quarter. Looking beyond Australia, Stephen Innes of Valour Markets in Singapore has written a note to clients in which he says the Fed will now be forced to cut rates again and possibly \u201cmuch more profoundly than they expected\u201d. China\u2019s central bank could also come to the party with another stimulus package. The steep falls in Asian markets on Thursday show that shell-shocked traders are \u201choping for the best on the policy front but positioning for the worst on the economic backdrop\u201d. Surely the world\u2019s central bankers are not going to allow President Trump tariff threats to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. Not yet, anyway. Not while there\u2019s still some monetary firepower left in their arsenal. The Fed, now out of necessity alone will need to adjust policy much more profoundly than they expected. While the threat of addition tariffs will make Beijing more accommodative to easing as policymakers have numerous avenues and a high degree for flexibility to respond. Suggesting that mainland\u2019s accommodative policies including infrastructure, fiscal and monetary measures will be aggressively dialled up in coming months. Even as trade tensions alternate between simmer and boil, a PBOC and Fed policy deluge could go a long way to establishing risk sentiment. Whether it\u2019s boom or gloom, the Australian stock market is being smashed at the moment. The benchmark ASX200 is down 2.7% today, a fall of 179 points to 6,416. That\u2019s a loss of more than A$50bn on this morning\u2019s opening prices and it could be the worst day since 25 October last year when shares fell 2.8% on the day. Telcos are down heavily after the poor Telstra numbers earlier and tech losses on Wall Street. Energy stocks are also being hammered because of the falling oil price. The Australian jobs figures from earlier have, as usual, produced some difference of opinion. In the bullish camp is Craig James, the chief economist at Commsec. He notes that overall employment has risen for the 33rd time in 34 months, up by 41,100 jobs in July against predictions of 14,000. Full-time jobs rose by 34,500 with part-time jobs up by 6,700. James writes: What is the definition of a strong job market? We would contend that it is one where employment is rising, more people are participating in the job market and where the jobless rate remains historically low. Australia has a strong job market. While the jobless rate in Australia is higher than the US, UK and New Zealand, in Australia job growth remains strong and more people are drawing down a wage. Retailers want to see more people with jobs because that converts to more opportunities to sell their goods and services. If you\u2019re not sure, you\u2019ll find a note of scepticism from the UBS economist George Tharenou who doesn\u2019t think that it\u2019s game, set and match for the Great Australian Economy just yet. He still thinks the RBA will cut rates agin in October and February. While jobs rebounded, our labour demand index at a 5-year low still suggests a drop ahead to ~1\u00bc% y/y; &amp; wages remain soft amid higher unemployment. Given the RBA will \u201cmonitor \u2026the labour market closely &amp; adjust monetary policy if needed\u201d \u2013 &amp; weak hours support our Q2 GDP forecast of 0.5% (1.4% y/y), below mkt (0.6%) &amp; RBA (\u00be%) \u2013 we still expect rate cuts in Oct &amp; Feb, with trade wars raising the risk of more. Traders in Tokyo are back from their lunch and the Nikkei is on the slide. It\u2019s down 1.55% to 20,333. The Hang Seng has slipped as well and is up just 0.03%. And London is now on course to slide into the red when it opens this morning. And the Dax30 in Frankfurt. The Dow is still on the dancefloor though and looking at a modest bounce of 30 points or 0.13%. I\u2019m taking a quick break so here are the main developments so far today: Asian stocks have fallen on Thursday \u2013 and recovered a bit after the bloodbath on Wall Street overnight. The Nikkei was down 1.2% in the morning session but the Hang Seng is up 0.5% after a weak start. Shanghai is down 0.75%. Not so good in Australia where the ASX200 is off 2.23% despite some encouraging employment figures. Oil has continued to tumble. Brent crude was down 37c, or 0.6%, at $59.11 a barrel by 0300 GMT. The yield on 30-year US treasuries has fallen below 2% for the first time ever in another sign that interest rates are set to remain lower for longer. Analysts have pushed back a bit on fears that the inverted US bond yield curve seen on Wednesday \u2013 and which sparked the 800-point fall in the Dow \u2013 is as crucial as some believe. Futures trade points to a positive start in London and in New York later today. One factor in the pickup in Asian shares could be a reassessment of the risks of the celebrated inverted bond yield curve. Several analysts and experts, including the former Federal Reserve bosses Alan Greenspan and Janet Yellen, have pointed out that structural market change means that the inverted yield curve might not be as important or reliable as it once was. Kerry Craig, a global markets strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, told Reuters that investors should also take note of how significantly markets had changed in the last decade, which meant a yield curve inversion might not be the harbinger it once was. Yield curve inversion is flashing a warning sign \u2013 investors should check their portfolios are resilient. But it\u2019s not a reason to panic or to lean into the sell-off. David Bassanese of Betashares in Sydney points out that: Current yield curve inversion is unusual compared to history as it\u2019s not associated with a high real Fed funds rate (average of past 5 recession episodes 3.2%). Currently the real rate is around zero. That either means the curve is providing a false signal (due to a structural flattening) or the \u201cneutral\u201d real Fed funds rate has fallen a lot and even a near-zero level (as at present) is restricting the economy. The latter is clearly US President Trump\u2019s claim. My view is that the yield curve is structurally flatter and not providing a signal of recession... as confirmed by still positive indicators such as US jobless claims. And Stephen Koukoulas, the independent Australian economist, thinks it\u2019s all a bit of \u201cblabber\u201d that a sharp cut in interest rates won\u2019t fix. As he observes, that puts him in the same camp as Trump. The Hang Seng index has climbed into positive territory. It is now up 0.5% at 25,430 points. Losses on the Shanghai Composite are just -o.5%. What a time to be alive. Analysts at UBS in Sydney have given up on a near-term resolution of the US-China trade war and have downgraded their forecasts for the two big economies. It also means a downgrade for industrial commodities such as iron ore and coal, and a boost for gold. Here they are: Our investment thesis heading into the back half of 2019 was predicated on a resolution to the trade war, but unfortunately this appears to have been short lived. As a result of increased tariffs, albeit somewhat delayed, this has lead to our economists downgrading US and Chinese growth for H2 19 and 2020. In light of this we have downgraded our industrial commodity forecasts and lifted gold. On the bright side (if that\u2019s the way you see it), the weakness makes another round of Chinese stimulus more likely. It\u2019s the old \u201cbad news is good news\u201d paradigm, folks: Continuing trade tensions are a headwind to global growth, but could prove positive for China stimulus. House prices rose 0.6% in China last month, the 51st consecutive month of gains, according to Reuters calculations based on national bureau of statistics (NBS) data released today. The gains are good news for the Chinese economy after some terrible data yesterday which showed industrial production falling to a 17-year low. Despite all the gloom, the markets are beginning to recover some ground. The Nikkei is now off just 1.3% compared with 2% earlier, and the Hang Seng is in the red by just 0.45% after hitting -1.4% earlier. Shanghai is still on -1%. In line with that improvement the FTSE100 and the Dow Jones are both seen opening in the black later today, according to IG Markets futures trading. Australia is looking more off colour, however, with the ASX200 in Sydney slipping -2.28% to 6,445 points. It wasn\u2019t long ago that it reached an all-time high of 6,875 points. Guy Debelle, the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, has given a speech this morning about what the global turmoil means for Australia and, not surprisingly, it\u2019s not good news. Speaking at a risk conference in Sydney, he said Australia \u2013 which has not had a recession for 28 years \u2013 benefited greatly from the \u201crules-based global order\u201d. But the threats to that from the US-China trade war were bad news for the economy. There were risks for household consumption but signs that house price falls were levelling out provided more optimism. If this is the case, the drag from declining wealth and turnover will dissipate. Housing market conditions may even start to support consumption growth again in the period ahead. It\u2019s all happening now! The yield on 30-year US treasury bonds has slumped below 2% for the first time this morning. The 30-year yield extended its sharp overnight slide and hit a record low 1.991% in Asian trade on Thursday. Concerns about the global economy is driving investors into the relative safe haven of government bonds. That drives up the price of bonds but reduces the yield. Trading has started in mainland China as well and the Shanghai Composite is off 1.1%, easing earlier losses. It follows the decision by the People\u2019s Bank of China to set the yuan slightly higher this morning. It also announced that it was lending 400bn yuan ($56.90bn) to financial institutions via its one-year medium-term lending facility, with an unchanged interest rate at 3.3%. It rolls over a bunch of loans worth 383bn yuan and adds more cash, Reuters reports. The bank also injected a net 30bn yuan into money markets on Thursday. Unemployment stayed at 5.2% in July, according to seasonally adjusted figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics released a few minutes ago. But the market was cheered by stats that showed 41,000 jobs were created last month against a forecast of 14,000. The Aussie dollar picked up 0.4% to US67.75c. The Hang Seng index has opened down 1.4% this morning. That\u2019s a fall of 365 points today and it takes the index below 25,000 to 24,945. The Hang Seng been battered by concerns about the growing political crisis in the city \u2013 the deepening fears about a slowdown in the Chinese economy won\u2019t help. Help is at hand though. Donald Trump is offering a trade deal to Xi Jinping if he can sort the mess in Hong Kong \u201chumanely\u201d. China\u2019s central bank has set the yuan higher this morning at 7.0268 against the US dollar, compared with 7.0312 the day before. In other words, Beijing is willing to see the yuan strengthen a little. (The lower the number, the stronger it is against the greenback). In the grand scheme of things that will be seen as a small olive branch to Washington, which last week accused Beijing of wanting to manipulate the yuan downwards and force cheaper goods on the world. The losses seem to be easing in Japan, where the Nikkei is now down 1.76% for the day. But Australia\u2019s ASX200 is now off a hefty 2.1%, not helped by a bad result for the telco Telstra. It has reported a 40% fall in profits this morning thanks to the mounting cost of rolling out the country\u2019s national broadband network, or NBN. Its shares are down nearly 2% and, as one of the biggest companies on the market, that makes a difference. The cocktail of economic news and data has been bad for the price of oil. Brent crude is down 39 cents, or 0.7%, at $59.09 a barrel this morning, after falling 3% in the last session. US crude was down 28 cents, or 0.5%, at $54.95 a barrel, having dropped 3.3% in the previous session. The falls have increased expectations that Saudi Arabi and other Opec oil-producing nations will cut production to force prices back up. That\u2019s bad for their national coffers though and the Saudis, who are fighting a war in Yemen, have been reluctant to cut. Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, notes that although the bond market was the trigger for the trauma on stock markets in the past 24 hours, not every inversion in the US curve has led to a recession. But he says that might not be enough to prevent a rush for the exits amid a delicate geopolitical position: Markets were in no mood for subtlety, and the damaging moves may provide their own rationale for more selling. The sell-off comes despite a better than forecast US earnings season. More than 90% of SPX500 companies have reported. Aggregate earnings are up around 2%, beating forecasts of a negative quarter. He also said poor earnings result in Australia, especially from the telco giant Telstra, would keep the pressure on stocks down under: Australian company results could add to market pressures. Telstra reported a 40% drop in profit, worse than forecast. Optimistic messages around the introduction of the 5G spectrum may not be enough to stem investor displeasure. Other misses include Blackmore\u2019s, Cleanaway, Treasury Wine Estates and Super Retail. Both Sydney Airports and QBE Insurance delivered earnings above expectations, and funeral group Invocare surprised with a 7.5% lift. A major factor in yesterday\u2019s selloff was the inverted US bond yield curve \u2013 not helped by recession warnings from Germany and China. It is a very reliable predictor of recession and preceded all six of the previous US recessions. It\u2019s not often it becomes a topic for everyday conversation. So in case you get stuck next to the water cooler and feel like making some small talk, here\u2019s a quick explainer. In normal times, investors would expect a higher return, or yield, for buying longer-term government bonds. Conversely, the shorter-term bonds, such as two-year bonds, give you less return. But as you can see in the theoretical chart below, the normal curve turns the other way, or inverts, when the yield on longer-term notes falls in relation to shorter-term. It indicates that investors see trouble ahead ... It looks more like this in the real world: You can go for the PhD level with this column from our economics editor, Larry Elliott: In Japan the Nikkei index is down 2.1% this morning. Stocks are suffering amid the fears of a global downturn but are also being pushed down because the value of the yen is rising. The Japanese currency is a \u201csafe haven\u201d asset and goes up in times of crisis \u2013 rather like gold and the Swiss franc which are both also up today. A higher yen is bad news for Japan\u2019s export-reliant big manugfacturers, hence the falling stock market. Here\u2019s Junichi Ishikawa, senior foreign exchange strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo: When volatility rises, dollar/yen becomes strongly correlated with [US] treasury yields, so the currency pair has more room to fall. I expect other safe havens to rise. The mood is downbeat, because of the trade war and bad economic data. Market turbulence will continue over coming months, the chief executive of the Australian Stock Exchange says. As the benchmark ASX200 took a 2% hit in early trading this morning, the ASX chief executive, Dominic Stevens, said the 2020 financial year would see \u201celevated volatility\u201d because of the geopolitical situation and the changing expectations for interest rates. My colleague Ben Butler writes that with rates at record lows the market expects further cuts in coming months as the Reserve Bank tries to boost Australia\u2019s sluggish economic growth. But while markets around the world may be melting down, it\u2019s been a good year for the ASX. It said this morning that profits after tax had risen 10.5% in the year to 30 June, to $492m. Shareholders in the market operator will reap the benefits, trousering dividends for the year totalling 228.7c a share \u2013 up 5.7% on last year\u2019s payout \u2013 plus a special dividend of 129.1c a share from the sale of ASX\u2019s stake in technology company Iress. Trading has started in Asia with steep falls \u2013 as expected \u2013 in Australia and Japan. Good morning/evening ... wherever you are in the world, welcome to the Guardian\u2019s business live blog which is starting early today before what\u2019s expected to be a turbulent day on the financial markets. My colleague Graeme Wearden covered all the action in the UK, Europe and the US on Wednesday and you can catch up on his blog here. But in the meantime here are the main points: Wall Street suffered huge losses after an inversion in the US bond yield curve sparked fears of an imminent recession. The Dow Jones plunged 800 points, or 3%, its fourth largest decline in history. The S&amp;P500 and Nasdaq were also down heavily. Fears were compounded by GDP figures in Germany pointing to a recession there and data in China showing industrial production was down 17% in July. The numbers sent European markets down, with the FTSE100 off more than 100 points. Oil slumped on fears of a global downturn. Donald Trump lashed out at the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, calling him \u201cclueless\u201d. Here\u2019s our news wrap of yesterday \u2013 and I\u2019ll have today\u2019s opening scores in a few minutes when trading starts in Sydney.",

      "bodyText": "Trevor Noah Following another immigration crackdown by the Trump administration \u2013 this week, it moved to revoke green cards from immigrants deemed likely to use public assistance \u2013 Daily Show host Trevor Noah sent a distress call for one American in particular: First Lady Melania Trump. Melania remains, according to polls, the most popular member of the Trump family, and \u201cpersonally, I love her, too\u201d, said Noah on Wednesday\u2019s Daily Show \u2013 the two have much in common, since they\u2019re both immigrants and \u201cneither of us would be here if it weren\u2019t for Donald Trump\u201d.

Trump has promised to end chain migration, though the policy allowed Melania\u2019s Slovenian-born parents to obtain US citizenship. \u201cThat\u2019s what Donald Trump was trying to stop,\u201d said Noah. \u201cHe was trying to turn his in-laws into outlaws.\u201d As for this week\u2019s policy change, targeting immigrants who use government assistance \u2013 \u201cwell, guess who lives in a free house provided by the United States?\u201d Noah said over an image of the White House. Noah rested his case. \u201cI see what you\u2019re doing, Donald, and I\u2019m not going to let it happen,\u201d he said. He encouraged Daily Show fans to tweet the hashtag #dontdeportmelania, \u201cbecause if this great immigrant is forced to leave this country, then the United States can never truly \u2018Be Best.\u2019\u201d",

Carson Holt, 18, who earned a C, B and an A* will take up a project management apprenticeship with Highways England this autumn. Her first project will be managing Liverpool\u2019s docks. \u201cIt\u2019s quite daunting, there\u2019s a lot of responsibility. I feel like it\u2019s going to be really interesting though,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "Police in Greater Manchester have been unable to charge many suspects since the introduction of a new \u00a327m computer system, leading to a massive backlog, lawyers have claimed. Robert Moussalli, a lawyer specialising in cases involving children and young people, said police had sent suspects home from stations following their arrests because they were unable to charge them due to problems with a new IT system introduced last month. The Integrated Operating Police Operating System (iOPS) was supposed to make it easy for officers from Greater Manchester police (GMP) to access all police records dating back to 1974 and provide \u201ca single, integrated platform to support public contact, policing response and investigative activity\u201d. But the system, delivered by the outsourcing company Capita, more than a year behind schedule at a cost of \u00a327m, has been fraught with problems. Officers told the Manchester Evening News, which first reported on the issue, they were unable to do their jobs properly and that IT failures were putting the public as well as the police at risk. Moussalli, who defends daily at Manchester youth court, said there was a massive backlog of cases as a result of problems with iOPS. \u201cTo start with they had real problems because for some reason the new software wouldn\u2019t let them charge anyone, so they were having to release suspects \u2018under investigation\u2019 unless they processed them manually, which takes a long time,\u201d said Moussalli. If a suspect is released under investigation, they are free to go about their lives as normal and are not subject to any limitations on their freedom as they might be if they are bailed. Other lawyers confirmed the same issues at police stations. This week one of Moussalli\u2019s clients, a 16-year-old boy, appeared in Manchester youth court to face charges of assaulting a police officer and possessing a knife. His case was adjourned after a prosecutor apologised to magistrates that she did not have any information about his alleged crimes and could not open the case - police had not been able to upload details to iOPS and send it to her. Two further cases in the youth court were adjourned for similar reasons blamed on iOPS. Four teenagers accused of joyriding almost a year ago were sent home from court with apologies after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) admitted it hadn\u2019t been able to access their files because of issues with iOPs. Nicola Durham, the CPS prosecutor, apologised to their mothers, who had taken time off work to attend court. She also asked for an adjournment on Tuesday to a case involving a 17-year old boy accused of drink-driving. She told magistrates she could not open the case because problems with iOPS meant police had not given her background information, including previous convictions, that was necessary for the case to progress.

      "body": "<p>Over the past century of popular culture, Satan has acquired the souls of delta blues musicians, incited youth rebellions, possessed small children and goats, impregnated unsuspecting women and transmitted evil through backwards lyrics on heavy metal records. But recently, to paraphrase the Rolling Stones, the nature of his game has been puzzling us.</p> <p>The forces aligned against Satan have become so objectionable that he no longer looks like the bad guy. They include such groups as the Westboro Baptist church, notorious for its hate speech against LGBTQ people, Jews, Muslims and other groups, all of which it condemns as \u201csatanic frauds\u201d. There\u2019s the Trump administration, in league with the US religious right, which has been aggressively pushing anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ legislation, not to mention engaging in overt Islamophobia. Those forces would also include the 20,000 people who recently signed an online petition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/20/petition-netflix-cancel-amazon-prime-good-omens-christian-neil-gaiman-terry-pratchett\">condemning the Amazon TV adaptation of the cult novel Good Omens</a> \u2013 about a demon and an angel \u2013 as \u201canother step to make satanism appear normal\u201d.</p> <p>Now, a documentary threatens to rehabilitate Satan. Directed by Penny Lane, Hail Satan? follows the early adventures of the <a href=\"https://thesatanictemple.com/\" title=\"\">Satanic Temple</a>, an institution that has hit upon the perfect counter-strategy to the evangelicals\u2019 efforts to recouple church and state. Based in Salem, Massachusetts (where else?), the Satanic Temple is officially recognised as a tax-exempt religious organisation. As such, it has been claiming the same rights and privileges as those obtained by evangelical Christian groups \u2013 albeit with a prankster sensibility.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_i6hRw4zR8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z_i6hRw4zR8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Where the city council of Phoenix, Arizona, began its meetings with a Christian prayer, for example, the Satanic Temple demanded that satanic prayers should also be said. The council chose to drop the prayers altogether. When the Child Evangelism Fellowship set up the pro-Christian Good News clubs in US public schools, the Satanic Temple introduced its own <a href=\"https://afterschoolsatan.com/assc-in-the-news/\" title=\"\">After School Satan clubs</a> \u2013 promoting scientific rationalism. And when the Oklahoma state capitol permitted the installation of a Ten Commandments sculpture in its grounds, the Satanic Temple campaigned to erect its own 8ft-high statue of Baphomet, the goat-headed, cloven-hoofed deity.</p> <p>\u201cIt became very apparent that there was a real need for what we were doing,\u201d says Lucien Greaves, the Satanic Temple\u2019s spokesman and de-facto leader. \u201cMore and more, they try to whittle away the rights of others and define us as a Christian nation, to the extent that religious liberty applies to them alone. That\u2019s just a scary circumstance for us to be in.\u201d</p> <p>Greaves is exactly what you would expect the earthly ambassador of Satan to look like. Pale-skinned, well-groomed and dressed entirely in black, and with one clouded eye, he could have walked off the set of a teen vampire series. Harvard-educated, he often sounds as if he is reading from an academic text. There is no mention of God in the US constitution, he points out, but there is a first amendment protecting freedom of expression and religion. The words <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pledge_of_Allegiance#Addition_of_%22under_God%22\" title=\"\">\u201cunder God\u201d</a> were added to the US pledge of allegiance in 1954, and \u201cIn God we trust\u201d first printed on US currency in 1956 \u2013 so as to differentiate the US from the godless communists. \u201cUp to that point, it had been <em>E pluribus unum</em> \u2013 \u2018from many, one\u2019 \u2013 which was a much better motto.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6c11adc6f9724d4af30e5d4386dd34fc8a5e879f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c11adc6f9724d4af30e5d4386dd34fc8a5e879f/66_0_3236_4042/801.jpg\" alt=\"The occultist Aleister Crowley\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Great Beast: the occultist Aleister Crowley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Greaves doesn\u2019t believe in God, Satan, \u201cevil\u201d or anything supernatural, he says. Nor does he sacrifice babies or serve a secret coven. The Satanic Temple is nontheistic, and its principles are broadly liberal humanism. The first of its seven tenets, for example, is: \u201cOne should strive to act with compassion and empathy towards all creatures in accordance with reason.\u201d</p> <p>So why call it \u201csatanism\u201d? \u201cThe metaphor of Satan is just as important to a lot of us as it would be to anybody who takes it literally because we grew up in a Judaeo-Christian culture. It really does speak to us in a very pointed and poignant way about our place in our culture and what our affirmative values are \u2026 and, of course, it defines what we oppose: these kinds of theocratic norms and authoritarian structures.\u201d</p> <p>The Satanic Temple\u2019s interpretation is closer to that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/jan/07/poem-of-the-week-from-paradise-lost-by-john-milton\">Milton\u2019s Satan in Paradise Lost</a>, Greaves says. \u201cThe rebel against tyranny, who stands in stark contrast to that mindless superstition and that mob mentality that causes people to give themselves the moral self-licensing to create the \u2018other\u2019\u2026 and thereby victimise people.\u201d</p> <p>You could say that is in keeping with Satan\u2019s place in pop culture. Only occasionally has he been taken as a literal figure of evil; more often, the devil represents the outsider, the provocateur, the one with the best tunes.

The Rolling Stones expressed their Sympathy and called an album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/17/the-rolling-stones-every-album-ranked\">Their Satanic Majesties Request</a>, but nobody considered them serious satanists. Led Zeppelin\u2019s Jimmy Page would have been more qualified; he inserted mystical symbols into the band\u2019s imagery, owned an occult bookshop in London and was a keen collector of the works. He even bought the Scottish home of the occultist Aleister Crowley (whose face also appears on the cover of the Beatles\u2019 Sgt Pepper album).

      "bodyText": "Over the past century of popular culture, Satan has acquired the souls of delta blues musicians, incited youth rebellions, possessed small children and goats, impregnated unsuspecting women and transmitted evil through backwards lyrics on heavy metal records. But recently, to paraphrase the Rolling Stones, the nature of his game has been puzzling us. The forces aligned against Satan have become so objectionable that he no longer looks like the bad guy. They include such groups as the Westboro Baptist church, notorious for its hate speech against LGBTQ people, Jews, Muslims and other groups, all of which it condemns as \u201csatanic frauds\u201d. There\u2019s the Trump administration, in league with the US religious right, which has been aggressively pushing anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ legislation, not to mention engaging in overt Islamophobia. Those forces would also include the 20,000 people who recently signed an online petition condemning the Amazon TV adaptation of the cult novel Good Omens \u2013 about a demon and an angel \u2013 as \u201canother step to make satanism appear normal\u201d. Now, a documentary threatens to rehabilitate Satan. Directed by Penny Lane, Hail Satan? follows the early adventures of the Satanic Temple, an institution that has hit upon the perfect counter-strategy to the evangelicals\u2019 efforts to recouple church and state. Based in Salem, Massachusetts (where else?), the Satanic Temple is officially recognised as a tax-exempt religious organisation. As such, it has been claiming the same rights and privileges as those obtained by evangelical Christian groups \u2013 albeit with a prankster sensibility. Where the city council of Phoenix, Arizona, began its meetings with a Christian prayer, for example, the Satanic Temple demanded that satanic prayers should also be said. The council chose to drop the prayers altogether. When the Child Evangelism Fellowship set up the pro-Christian Good News clubs in US public schools, the Satanic Temple introduced its own After School Satan clubs \u2013 promoting scientific rationalism. And when the Oklahoma state capitol permitted the installation of a Ten Commandments sculpture in its grounds, the Satanic Temple campaigned to erect its own 8ft-high statue of Baphomet, the goat-headed, cloven-hoofed deity. \u201cIt became very apparent that there was a real need for what we were doing,\u201d says Lucien Greaves, the Satanic Temple\u2019s spokesman and de-facto leader. \u201cMore and more, they try to whittle away the rights of others and define us as a Christian nation, to the extent that religious liberty applies to them alone. That\u2019s just a scary circumstance for us to be in.\u201d Greaves is exactly what you would expect the earthly ambassador of Satan to look like. Pale-skinned, well-groomed and dressed entirely in black, and with one clouded eye, he could have walked off the set of a teen vampire series. Harvard-educated, he often sounds as if he is reading from an academic text. There is no mention of God in the US constitution, he points out, but there is a first amendment protecting freedom of expression and religion. The words \u201cunder God\u201d were added to the US pledge of allegiance in 1954, and \u201cIn God we trust\u201d first printed on US currency in 1956 \u2013 so as to differentiate the US from the godless communists. \u201cUp to that point, it had been E pluribus unum \u2013 \u2018from many, one\u2019 \u2013 which was a much better motto.\u201d Greaves doesn\u2019t believe in God, Satan, \u201cevil\u201d or anything supernatural, he says. Nor does he sacrifice babies or serve a secret coven. The Satanic Temple is nontheistic, and its principles are broadly liberal humanism. The first of its seven tenets, for example, is: \u201cOne should strive to act with compassion and empathy towards all creatures in accordance with reason.\u201d So why call it \u201csatanism\u201d? \u201cThe metaphor of Satan is just as important to a lot of us as it would be to anybody who takes it literally because we grew up in a Judaeo-Christian culture. It really does speak to us in a very pointed and poignant way about our place in our culture and what our affirmative values are \u2026 and, of course, it defines what we oppose: these kinds of theocratic norms and authoritarian structures.\u201d The Satanic Temple\u2019s interpretation is closer to that of Milton\u2019s Satan in Paradise Lost, Greaves says. \u201cThe rebel against tyranny, who stands in stark contrast to that mindless superstition and that mob mentality that causes people to give themselves the moral self-licensing to create the \u2018other\u2019\u2026 and thereby victimise people.\u201d You could say that is in keeping with Satan\u2019s place in pop culture. Only occasionally has he been taken as a literal figure of evil; more often, the devil represents the outsider, the provocateur, the one with the best tunes. To be labelled \u201cthe devil\u2019s music\u201d, as jazz, blues and rock\u2019n\u2019roll all were, was the best possible branding. The Rolling Stones expressed their Sympathy and called an album Their Satanic Majesties Request, but nobody considered them serious satanists. Led Zeppelin\u2019s Jimmy Page would have been more qualified; he inserted mystical symbols into the band\u2019s imagery, owned an occult bookshop in London and was a keen collector of the works. He even bought the Scottish home of the occultist Aleister Crowley (whose face also appears on the cover of the Beatles\u2019 Sgt Pepper album). Page collaborated with the film-maker Kenneth Anger, whose films of the era, such as Lucifer Rising and Invocation of My Demon Brother, brought together a Who\u2019s Who of 60s occult-dabblers, including Page, Mick Jagger, Donald Cammell, Marianne Faithfull, the Manson family member Bobby Beausoleil, and Anton LaVey. LaVey is acknowledged as the founder of modern satanism, although he, too, was more theatrical showman than genuine prince of darkness. He strove to look the part, with his shaved head, sharp little goatee and black cloak \u2013 imagery largely gleaned from old horror movies.

Macfarlane praised his fellow contenders as \u201cexceptional\u201d. \u201cThis year\u2019s prize speaks of the fear and hope that characterise our relations with the natural world in today\u2019s crisis-contexts of climate breakdown, species loss and habitat degradation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe work celebrated by the 2019 prize fuses politics, ethics, pragmatism and poetry -- and shows a centuries-old tradition of literature flexing and responding to contemporary pressures.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Scotland Yard has said it is keeping an open mind over the motive for a knife attack outside the Home Office as it was confirmed that the victim is a government employee. Specialist firearms officers attended within six minutes to find a man in his 60s with knife injuries, the Metropolitan police said. The man\u2019s injuries were neither life-threatening or life-changing, the force said. The government confirmed that the victim is a civil servant at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG), which is in the same building as the Home Office in Marsham Street, Westminster. The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, called the incident a \u201chorrific attack on a colleague\u201d. The home secretary, Priti Patel, tweeted: \u201cAll my thoughts are with the victim and their family following horrific unprovoked knife attack on Marsham Street.\u201d A 29-year-old man was arrested outside St John\u2019s church in nearby Smith Square on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and possession of a CS spray. Video obtained by the Sun appears to show the suspect being arrested and items left at the scene, including a rucksack and a box containing a live ferret. Photos posted on social media showed police tape and several officers outside the building. A Reuters photographer captured images of a man holding a cloth to his face being escorted away from the building by a paramedic and armed officers. An office worker opposite the Home Office, who asked to remain anonymous, described seeing a man \u2013 thought to be the perpetrator \u2013 walking calmly down the road after the incident. She told PA Media: \u201cHe was standing over there outside the Home Office and then he was putting something away in his bag, but I didn\u2019t see a knife or anything. He was putting something away and then he just calmly just walked off down the road as if nothing had happened. Then people were being asked to go into the Home Office; they were being ushered in.\u201d A barista working opposite the Home Office said she saw the victim walking out of the government building. The witness described him as a man who appeared to be in his 50s. \u201cHe had just trousers, nothing on top ... He was full of blood. He was escorted by police and paramedics.\u201d London Ambulance Service attended the address and took the victim to a central London hospital. The injured man\u2019s family have been notified. The Met said: \u201cInquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances of the incident. We are keeping an open mind about any possible motive at this early stage.\u201d Jenrick said: \u201cI am deeply shocked by this horrific attack on a colleague today. My thoughts, and those of all my staff, are with him and his family. We are ready to provide as much support as we can and we all wish him a speedy recovery. \u201cWe will be reviewing security across the MHCLG estate. All our staff must feel safe as they go about their important work. I would like to give my heartfelt thanks to the police, ambulance service and our staff for their swift response today.\u201d A spokeswoman for the Home Office said: \u201cThe Metropolitan police is investigating a knife attack which took place outside the Home Office this afternoon. The victim is receiving medical care. This is a deeply concerning incident and our thoughts are with him and his family. As this is an ongoing investigation, it would be inappropriate to comment further.\u201d",

The \u201cBasic Law\u201d constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2003:&nbsp;</b>Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2007:&nbsp;</b>The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive\u2019s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong&nbsp;Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2014:&nbsp;</b>The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of \u201cfake universal suffrage\u201d and \u201cfake democracy\u201d. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015,&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party\u2019s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2019:&nbsp;</b>Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/hong-kong-lam-to-withdraw-extradition-bill-say-reports\">Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On Thursday Hong Kong\u2019s government unveiled $2.44bn (\u00a32bn) worth of economic relief measures and downgraded its growth forecasts.</p> \n<p>Although framed as a mini-budget amid economic uncertainty, some analysts saw the move as a sweetener aimed at winning over support from moderate Hongkongers.</p> \n<p>Police made five arrests on Tuesday night and 17 more on Wednesday during clashes outside police stations in the Sham Shui Po district as flights were suspended by mass demonstrations in Hong Kong airport.</p> \n<p>China initially censored all news of the protests but in recent days has taken to denigrating the protesters as criminals being manipulated by the US, Taiwan and other unnamed foreign powers.</p> \n<p>The ambassador accused foreign officials of fomenting unrest by meeting protest leaders, suggesting the involvement of \u201cdark hands\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Sino-British Joint Declaration signed in 1984 paved the way for Hong Kong\u2019s handover back to China and said the city would enjoy a \u201chigh degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs\u201d and be \u201cvested with executive, legislative and independent judicial power\u201d.</p> \n<p>The US national security advisor, John Bolton, warned China against creating a \u201cnew\u201d Tiananmen Square in its response to pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong in comments published on Thursday.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Chinese have to look very carefully at the steps they take because people in America remember Tiananmen Square, they remember the picture of the man standing in front of the line of tanks,\u201d Bolton said in an interview with VOA News.</p>",

The ambassador accused \u201cextremists\u201d of posing as as pro-democracy activists and said Beijing was not prepared \u201cto sit on its hands and watch\u201d. \u201cWe hope this will end in an orderly way. In the meantime we are fully prepared for the worst,\u201d he said, warning that the protesters risked dragging the territory into a \u201cdangerous abyss\u201d. Liu rejected a tweet from Donald Trump calling on Beijing to treat Hong Kong \u201chumanely\u201d in order to reach a trade deal, insisting that China would not \u201cbarter\u201d over the territory. Declining to speculate on what might trigger a Chinese intervention, the ambassador reiterated Beijing\u2019s warnings that it regarded recent incidents of \u201cradical street protest\u201d \u2013 including clashes during an occupation of Hong Kong\u2019s airport \u2013 as showing signs of \u201cterrorism\u201d. Liu\u2019s swipe at UK politicians followed a proposal by the foreign affairs select committee chairman, Tom Tugendhat, to extend UK citizenship rights to Hong Kong Chinese. China took over the former British colony in 1997 under the framework of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d, which protesters fear is being eroded. Recently Beijing told the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, to stop interfering in Hong Kong\u2019s affairs. \u201cPoliticians in this country know their body is in the 21st century but their heads are still in the colonial days,\u201d Liu said. \u201cThey are going to have to change their mindset, put them in the proper position and regard Hong Kong as a part of China, not as a part of the UK.\u201d Referring to the 300,000 UK citizens and thousands of UK businesses in Hong Kong, Liu added: \u201cI sincerely hope that people from all walks of life in the UK will have a clear understanding of a big picture, act in the interests of Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity and stability, and refrain from saying or doing anything that interferes in Hong Kong\u2019s affairs or undermines the rule of law in Hong Kong.\u201d On Thursday Hong Kong\u2019s government unveiled $2.44bn (\u00a32bn) worth of economic relief measures and downgraded its growth forecasts. Although framed as a mini-budget amid economic uncertainty, some analysts saw the move as a sweetener aimed at winning over support from moderate Hongkongers. Police made five arrests on Tuesday night and 17 more on Wednesday during clashes outside police stations in the Sham Shui Po district as flights were suspended by mass demonstrations in Hong Kong airport. China initially censored all news of the protests but in recent days has taken to denigrating the protesters as criminals being manipulated by the US, Taiwan and other unnamed foreign powers. The ambassador accused foreign officials of fomenting unrest by meeting protest leaders, suggesting the involvement of \u201cdark hands\u201d. The Sino-British Joint Declaration signed in 1984 paved the way for Hong Kong\u2019s handover back to China and said the city would enjoy a \u201chigh degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs\u201d and be \u201cvested with executive, legislative and independent judicial power\u201d. The US national security advisor, John Bolton, warned China against creating a \u201cnew\u201d Tiananmen Square in its response to pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong in comments published on Thursday. \u201cThe Chinese have to look very carefully at the steps they take because people in America remember Tiananmen Square, they remember the picture of the man standing in front of the line of tanks,\u201d Bolton said in an interview with VOA News.",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn just got inside everyone else\u2019s decision cycles. The Labour leader\u2019s offer to lead a \u201cstrictly time-limited\u201d government, to prevent a no-deal Brexit and to call a general election, has forced all political factions to react and led the news bulletins. Amid the initial responses \u2013 which ranged from cautious to churlish \u2013 the bigger point has been missed. Corbyn\u2019s gambit crossed numerous significant lines, both political and psychological. First, it was a decisive rebuff to the leader of the Unite union, Len McCluskey. McCluskey is leading a rearguard action against Corbyn\u2019s move to back a second referendum in all circumstances. Corbyn\u2019s letter offered to make the second referendum the centrepiece of Labour\u2019s election campaign.

These words open the possibility of either an outright temporary coalition or a technocratic government. Third, the letter says nothing about Labour fighting for its own particular desired form of Brexit \u2013 and was wise not to do so, because that prospect is dead. The party\u2019s policy, of course, remains officially confused. The shortest possible summary goes: \u201cWe\u2019d vote remain in a referendum now but might \u2013 if our conference agrees it \u2013 go into an election fighting for a specifically Labour form of Brexit which we would then try to negotiate and after that put to a referendum, in which we would decide how to vote once we knew if the deal was any good.\u201d As all activists know, that is death on the doorstep, and having experienced it in the European parliament elections in May, few of us have the appetite to go on the knocker encumbered with it again. Fortunately, we won\u2019t have to \u2013 and to understand why, you need to understand the possible permutations, timing and sequencing of what happens next. In early September the real action will not be around the confidence vote, but around an attempt by an expanded group of Tory rebels to use standing order 14 to take control of parliament\u2019s agenda and introduce legislation forbidding no deal. If Johnson were to defy parliament over that \u2013 for example by sabotaging the royal assent process \u2013 Tory rebel participation in a vote of no confidence would be both justified and, I am told, decisive. There will be a lot of angst unleashed in the next few weeks over whether the Tory rebels, the Liberal Democrats and the Labour right could support putting Corbyn in office, but for the purposes of the Brexit outcome it does not matter whether it is him, Keir Starmer or some bespectacled crossbench peer nobody has ever heard of. What matters is: what is the cross-party agreement over the function of that caretaker government? Should it, as Corbyn suggested, be limited to extending article 50 and calling an election. Or should it organise the second referendum itself, delaying a general election until the outcome of the referendum is known. Under the first option, the election itself would become a proxy referendum on Brexit. Johnson and Nigel Farage would make it so.

So even with a small Labour majority by December, there would be no practical majority for renegotiating Brexit. The arrow of time has narrowed the options, and the Trump administration has done the rest. The existential question for Britain now is whether it wants to be awash with chlorinated chicken and genetically modified food, and see the NHS privatised into the hands of US corporations \u2013 or whether it wants to be close to Europe. So both for reasons of avoiding electoral suicide and in the national interest, Labour would have to fight a November election not just on the promise of a second referendum, but of remain/transform. If we consider the preferred route of the Greens and Lib Dems \u2013 for a caretaker government that holds the referendum first, the election second \u2013 then Labour\u2019s unicorn half-Brexit plan is even more firmly dead and buried. The only way Corbyn gets to lead a \u201ctemporary government\u201d that stops no deal is if all his own MPs back him, together with 10 ex-Labour independents, the SNP, Plaid, Caroline Lucas and at least a handful of Tory rebels. But all his own MPs will not vote for him. So he needs a large number of Tory rebels \u2013 and that\u2019s not going to happen either unless they get something that they want. The temporary government we need is going to be formed on the terms of its most centrist supporters in the Commons \u2013 and that negates any possibility of a Labour government reopening negotiations. Corbyn has shown bravery and skill with his letter. As his allies predicted, it immediately forced the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, into a ludicrous position of refusal, which Labour strategists know will play very well for them on the doorstep. But it is only the first move. The next move is to take control of parliament and, after that, a decisive no-confidence vote.

Between 2007 and 2017 at least 10 modern language departments were closed at UK higher education institutions and nine more significantly downsized their undergraduate provision.</p> \n  <p>Prof Sir David Cannadine, the president of the British Academy, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If the UK is to achieve its strategic goals and tackle the major challenges we face \u2013 from climate change to the ageing society and the rise of artificial intelligence \u2013 the skills gained by studying humanities and social science subjects at A-level, and then at university, will be essential. After all, 80% of the UK economy derives from the services sector, fuelled in large part by graduates in the humanities and social sciences.</p> \n   <p>As we march onwards, into the 21st century and beyond, we will need individuals with expertise in law, philosophy, and politics to work hand in hand with Britain\u2019s outstanding science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) graduates. Developments such as automated technologies, health discoveries and other inventions cannot be looked at through the scientific lens alone \u2013 they need the input of those who have studied ethics, human behaviour, culture, the law and more.</p> \n   <p>Put simply, the UK\u2019s future success depends on students from a range of disciplines, and we will continue to work with our partners in the sciences to make the case for a broad and balanced curriculum, and for knowledge and insights from across the disciplinary spectrum.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-15T12:25:18.331Z\">at 1.25pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d554c6b8f08c7e177d4af66\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-15T12:14:04.474Z\">1.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Twenty-two pupils at a single east London state school have been offered places at Oxford and Cambridge universities. </p> \n  <p>They studied for their A-levels at the appropriately named London Academy of Excellence, which opened in 2012 in Newham. </p> \n  <p>By 2016 it had been named state sixth form of the year by the Sunday Times, and the following year it was awarded an \u201coutstanding\u201d grade from Ofsted.

McLeish said: <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Royal Society would like to congratulate students on today\u2019s A-level results. We recognise the hard work put in by students, with steadfast support from their teachers and families, has paid off for many, and hope that those meeting with disappointment today will receive the help they need to find the best way ahead.</p> \n   <p>The society is pleased that students value science subjects with an increase of 12,000 entries, now accounting for over 20% of all A-levels. In a changing world of work, young people are recognising that the jobs of the future will require the skills and insights offered by the sciences and maths.</p> \n   <p>The society is delighted that the sciences are faring positively with increases in the number of students studying biology (up 8.4%), chemistry (9.2%), physics (3%) and computing (8.1%). While the first year of the reformed mathematics A-level has seen a small but not unexpected drop in numbers, it still remains the most popular A-level, with a positive increase in the number of students getting the top grade. We need to ensure that the progress made in getting more young people to study maths to age 18 in ways that suit them continues.</p> \n   <p>A further cause for celebration is that female entries in the sciences are at a historic high, with increasing numbers of girls opting for chemistry and physics. However, there is still work to do in closing the gender gap in maths and computing.</p> \n   <p>Whilst Stem entries have increased, education is not a zero-sum game and the society is very concerned about the decline in some arts and humanities subjects, particularly English. The continued fall in AS level entries to under 200,000 compared with 1.3 million before the reforms, was expected, however the society is concerned this is contributing to further narrowing of students\u2019 choices and learning.</p> \n   <p>We urgently need a conversation at the highest levels about a broader curriculum fit for the future.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p

smuggled into Britain in the back of a lorry in 2015 to escape a violent home life, and was dumped in Keynsham, near Bristol, alone and unable to speak English. He was placed in foster care, but has now collected his A-level results in maths, biology and chemistry at St Mary Redcliffe and Temple school in Bristol. </p> \n  <p>Bregu faced a crisis while preparing to sit his exams, when he was told he would be deported after his application for asylum was rejected.

Uptake was also down for English literature, from 41,000 to 37,500, while combined English language and literature dropped from 9,000 to 7,600.</p> \n  <p>The author and former teacher Joanne Harris, whose works included the best-selling novel Chocolat, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We should be very, very concerned at this drop in the study of English.

The changes, they say, have hit the least able the hardest.</p> \n  <p>One assistant headteacher said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>GCSE English language is sucking the joy out of the study of how we communicate: the power and beauty in words.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for another action-packed day of A-level results reporting and analysis. The top lines for today have been: A drop in the proportion of A-level results at the top grades to the lowest level in more than a decade. Female students outnumbered males in science entries for the first time, with the proportion of girls on science courses rising to just over 50%. A 1% fall in the number of students accepted on to UK degree courses to 408,960 from the UK and overseas. The number of entries in Stem subjects increased by 1.7% in England this year, while participation in selected humanities subjects fell by 3.1%, prompting concerns from science and arts organisations alike. For the first time ever, the number of students taking A-level Spanish overtook French. And students taking A-levels in Northern Ireland obtained higher grades than their English and Welsh counterparts There is a wealth of other information and coverage throughout today\u2019s blog, so do scroll through. And I will (probably) be back next year with more. In the Guardian data team\u2019s final missive for the day, Pamela Duncan reports that the number of English A-level students taking computing hit 10,000 this year, with the proportion of female students rising to 13%. Given, this is still a low figure, but marks some progress considering that just 6.9% of those taking computing in 2011 were girls. There has been some interesting commentary on this disparity \u2013 which amounts to one female computing student for every six and a half males. In keeping with narratives surrounding national strategic objectives and such, Paul Farrington, the chief technology officer at Veracode, suggests it could plug a \u201ccybersecurity skills gap\u201d. Our research has found a lack of formal security eduction is contributing to the growing skills gap. Just 24% of respondents in our DevSecOps global skills survey were required to complete cybersecurity courses as part of their tertiary education, forcing many to learn on the job. Getting kids interested and succeeding Stem at the high school level is a big step in the right direction. For example, courses that teach secure coding and security by design will help elevate these skill sets and improve overall security of the software we use. Furthermore, cybersecurity pays really rather well. But Agata Nowakowska, area vice president at Skillsoft, said the number of female students taking Stem exams remained \u201cfrustratingly small\u201d. There are great initiatives out there allowing girls to dip their toe into areas such as coding, with Code Girls: First being a prime example. These help demystify areas that girls have had very little exposure to. We need to take this model into the classroom, but this is as much about educating teachers as it is students. Some are unconsciously biased about girls and Stem. The sooner we can make these changes, the sooner we can have more equality, diversity and balance in the world of technology. The number of entries in Stem subjects increased by 1.7% in England this year, while participation in selected humanities subjects fell by 3.1%, reports Pamela Duncan, a data journalist at the Guardian. This was mainly due to the steep decline in English entries, whereas there were year-on-year increases in geography and history. The Guardian data team\u2019s R\u00e9mi de Fleurian (who, full disclosure, is French) has been looking at languages. For the first time ever, more English A-level students took Spanish than French, which has plummeted in popularity since 2011. While the number of students taking German has fallen by 41%, Spanish, on the other hand, has risen in popularity, with 15% more students taking it at A-level than in 2011. French is down 36%. It\u2019s encouraging that the number of pupils taking languages this year has remained stable, but this is against the background of a marked decline over the past 20 years. It\u2019s clear that we need to help more young people understand the value of learning a foreign language. For the first time, Spanish has overtaken French. British Council research shows that Spanish is the most important language in terms of the UK\u2019s future prosperity, security and global influence. However, other languages \u2013 including French and German \u2013 are also important, and we need more pupils to continue learning a range of languages. More work needs to be done to understand why fewer boys see the advantage of learning languages. Rising numbers of students are taking politics A-level, perhaps triggered by significant political and social change across the world, PA Media reports. There were 19,729 entries for political studies A-level, up 9.8% on 2018, proportionately the biggest increase in uptake of any subject this year, according to the Joint Council for Qualifications. It follows five years of steady increase in the number of qualifications awarded in the subject, up from 13,761 in 2014. The majority of students sitting political studies A-level this year would have started the course in September 2017, months after the EU referendum and election of the US president Donald Trump in 2016. Three years ago, there were 15,540 entries to the subject, compared with 17,964 taking the exam in 2018. But the proportion of students achieving top grades has fallen slightly, with 26% achieving a political studies A* in 2019, compared with 27.6% last year. Today the Guardian has been at the University of Greenwich, where the phone lines have been inundated with students inquiring about the places on offer through clearing, write Aamna Mohdin and Adhiti Shenava. \u201cA lot of people have rearranged their annual leave to be here today,\u201d said Mark Betteney, the deputy head of the secondary education department. \u201cThere was a time, 10 years ago, where we wouldn\u2019t be recruiting over the summer but recruitment has become a lot more difficult. \u201cThere has been a pronounced trend of people not applying to university until they have got their results. I have a great deal of sympathy with that and would personally welcome a change in structure in that people once they knew their results.\u201d Charlotte Nickson, 24, who earned a place at the university through last year\u2019s clearing cycle, spoke of how her experience, though stressful, was made as \u201ceasy and painless as possible\u201d by the team on the other side of the phone. \u201cAt the end of the conversation I was quite excited and proud of myself to have gone through clearing, an achievement in itself, especially given the health problems I had during my A-levels, so I was really happy to start university that summer.\u201d She also supports a change in the application process, saying she would back \u201canything that makes people face less pressure, especially at the age of only 18.\u201d Nickson was keen to see what happened on the other side of her phone call and step in to this year\u2019s hectic clearing office. With all the commentary around the drop in entries to arts and humanities, the British Academy, the national body for humanities and social sciences, has warned that falling numbers in subjects such as English and modern languages could harm the chances of the UK \u201cachieving its strategic goals\u201d. It points out that in the past two decades there has been a steep drop in the number of pupils studying languages at secondary school \u2013 and this year A-level numbers continue to fall, with a 5% decline in take-up in England this year, compared with 2018. This has had a knock-on effect on university-level study. Between 2007 and 2017 at least 10 modern language departments were closed at UK higher education institutions and nine more significantly downsized their undergraduate provision. Prof Sir David Cannadine, the president of the British Academy, said: If the UK is to achieve its strategic goals and tackle the major challenges we face \u2013 from climate change to the ageing society and the rise of artificial intelligence \u2013 the skills gained by studying humanities and social science subjects at A-level, and then at university, will be essential. After all, 80% of the UK economy derives from the services sector, fuelled in large part by graduates in the humanities and social sciences. As we march onwards, into the 21st century and beyond, we will need individuals with expertise in law, philosophy, and politics to work hand in hand with Britain\u2019s outstanding science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) graduates. Developments such as automated technologies, health discoveries and other inventions cannot be looked at through the scientific lens alone \u2013 they need the input of those who have studied ethics, human behaviour, culture, the law and more. Put simply, the UK\u2019s future success depends on students from a range of disciplines, and we will continue to work with our partners in the sciences to make the case for a broad and balanced curriculum, and for knowledge and insights from across the disciplinary spectrum. Twenty-two pupils at a single east London state school have been offered places at Oxford and Cambridge universities. They studied for their A-levels at the appropriately named London Academy of Excellence, which opened in 2012 in Newham. By 2016 it had been named state sixth form of the year by the Sunday Times, and the following year it was awarded an \u201coutstanding\u201d grade from Ofsted. This year, a remarkable 93% of all grades achieved were A* to B, 65% were A* to A and the average was A+. The school said: Many of the students will be the first generation in their family to enter into higher education and, at a time when the UK\u2019s elite universities face mounting criticism for the lack of students from disadvantaged backgrounds taking up places, LAE\u2019s students (of whom 90% are BAME, 70% have English as a second language and 40% are classified by the DfE as \u2018disadvantaged\u2019) have once again shown that ethnicity or background need not be a barrier to educational success. The school attributes its success to its outstanding teachers and the support it receives from HSBC and a number of leading independent schools including Brighton College, Eton College, Caterham, Forest, Highgate and UCS. A significant part of its success must of course be credited to its selectivity. LAE takes the cream of students in the area. But New Vic sixth form college, in the same area, which recruits far more widely, also had plenty of happy students today. It achieved a pass rate of 97.3%. For many, A-level results day will be a day of celebration, with places confirmed and futures on track. But for some students the day has brought fresh uncertainty, whether that is because they have been disappointed by their results \u2013 or maybe even pleasantly surprised. The DfE\u2019s National Careers Service is running a helpline that offers free advice for such students. And with GCSE results day yet to come, it has published a list of mental health tips for students to better cope with exam results day. The careers service suggests that students: Exercise Get enough sleep Eat a balanced diet Do something nice every day Seek expert advice The helpline can be reached on 0800 100 900 The Royal Society, Britain\u2019s independent scientific academy, has hailed the rise in the proportion of students taking up science subjects, but it has also raised the alarm over the corresponding fall in arts and humanities. Prof Tom McLeish, the chair of the society\u2019s education committee, warned \u201ceducation is not a zero-sum game\u201d and raised particular concerns over the drop in English entries. McLeish said: The Royal Society would like to congratulate students on today\u2019s A-level results. We recognise the hard work put in by students, with steadfast support from their teachers and families, has paid off for many, and hope that those meeting with disappointment today will receive the help they need to find the best way ahead. The society is pleased that students value science subjects with an increase of 12,000 entries, now accounting for over 20% of all A-levels. In a changing world of work, young people are recognising that the jobs of the future will require the skills and insights offered by the sciences and maths. The society is delighted that the sciences are faring positively with increases in the number of students studying biology (up 8.4%), chemistry (9.2%), physics (3%) and computing (8.1%). While the first year of the reformed mathematics A-level has seen a small but not unexpected drop in numbers, it still remains the most popular A-level, with a positive increase in the number of students getting the top grade. We need to ensure that the progress made in getting more young people to study maths to age 18 in ways that suit them continues. A further cause for celebration is that female entries in the sciences are at a historic high, with increasing numbers of girls opting for chemistry and physics. However, there is still work to do in closing the gender gap in maths and computing. Whilst Stem entries have increased, education is not a zero-sum game and the society is very concerned about the decline in some arts and humanities subjects, particularly English. The continued fall in AS level entries to under 200,000 compared with 1.3 million before the reforms, was expected, however the society is concerned this is contributing to further narrowing of students\u2019 choices and learning. We urgently need a conversation at the highest levels about a broader curriculum fit for the future. If you\u2019re starting university soon, you may be interested in the Guardian\u2019s weekly Universities newsletter, or our updates on Twitter. And if you have something to say about the pressing issues of life on campus \u2013 from fees to face time, from deadlines to distractions \u2013 you can also pitch us an article: In case you were wondering why there are always so few pictures of boys celebrating their A-level results, and so many of ecstatic girls, there are actual genuine statistical reasons for it. According to our data cruncher Pamela Duncan, female students did better than their male counterparts in more than 20 subjects, with the biggest gaps in psychology, PE and sociology. By comparison boys achieved better grades than girls in just five subjects: political studies, Spanish, German, chemistry and computing. And here are the celebratory female students. While this lad brings back memories of my own A-level results day (sigh). A teenager threatened with deportation from the UK after being trafficked from Albania has a bright future after his A-level results secured him a place on an accountancy apprenticeship, PA Media reports. Stiven Bregu, 18, was smuggled into Britain in the back of a lorry in 2015 to escape a violent home life, and was dumped in Keynsham, near Bristol, alone and unable to speak English. He was placed in foster care, but has now collected his A-level results in maths, biology and chemistry at St Mary Redcliffe and Temple school in Bristol. Bregu faced a crisis while preparing to sit his exams, when he was told he would be deported after his application for asylum was rejected. Teachers and friends campaigned to keep him in Bristol and a petition was signed by more than 90,000 people. He later learned his appeal had been successful and he could remain in the UK. Next month Bregu will join the Bristol-based wealth management firm Rowan Dartington. Stiven, from Totterdown, Bristol, said: I was not expecting the reaction I received from the people of Bristol. I\u2019m quite grateful and very pleased I can stay here. Bristol is a wonderful place and the community around me have been wonderful. Bristol has been so welcoming and is my home. The school and teachers have been wonderful and really supportive. Bregu has been part of Bristol mayor Marvin Rees\u2019s city leadership programme, which invests in gifted students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Elisabeth Gilpin, the headteacher at St Mary Redcliffe and Temple school, said: I am delighted Stiven has succeeded in getting his three A-levels and an apprenticeship. He has worked really hard and not let the shocking news of his initial application to remain in the UK being turned down deter him. I am so touched that Bristol and people more widely across the UK really got behind Stiven at such a crucial time in his young life. All of the students here at Rochdale sixth form college have their results now, with many still clutching on to those all-important white slips of paper, reports Amy Walker, our reporter on the scene. More than 100 students, alongside teachers and a few parents, are still hanging around in the downstairs study area \u2013 and although there have been a few tears, most people look pretty chuffed. John Mullen, 18, who has been eagerly awaiting his A-level results, \u201cdistracted himself\u201d in recent weeks with a summer job in a kitchen. Mullen, who aspires to work in academia, gained A*s in maths and further maths, an A in computer science and a C in physics. The results mean his first choice place at Manchester University, where he will study maths, has been secured. \u201cIt\u2019s a big relief,\u201d he said. Although Mullen plans to relax for a while after an intense few months, he said the thing he was most looking forward to about university was the independence. \u201cEven though I don\u2019t live too far away from the campus, I\u2019m going to to be moving out into student accommodation. It\u2019s a really exciting time,\u201d the 18-year-old said. The number of female students taking exams in A-level sciences has overtaken males for the first time ever, the culmination of decades-long efforts to encourage the take-up of science, maths and technology, write Richard Adams, Sally Weale and Niamh McIntyre. In England, the proportion of female students among those taking sciences rose to just over 50%, as the numbers of both males and females taking Stem (science, technology and maths) subjects accounted for 21% of all A-level entries, up from 19.2% in 2018. Biology was the most popular subject for females, who accounted for 63% of entries. There were also more female chemists proportionally, but males continue to dominate in physics, making up 78% of entries in England. Read more of our headline coverage of this year\u2019s A-level results here: Here\u2019s a good question on Twitter about a perennial A-level results day social media favourite. Well, the answer to your question Mansesh is yes, yes he has. The National Association of Headteachers has welcomed the increase in female students taking up science subjects. But the organisationwarns that funding cuts have made the future uncertain. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary, said: Today\u2019s the day for giving credit where it\u2019s due. Congratulations to all the students getting their results this morning. We must also recognise the hard work of the school and college staff who have helped them along the way. Today is a massive moment. A-levels are a passport to the next stage of life, either in employment or for further training and study. The relevant organisations have worked hard to make sure students have not been disadvantaged by the reformed content and assessment, and this has been shown in the general stability of results. Grade boundaries are adjusted each year to reflect the demands of the exams, so this year\u2019s group can have confidence their results are as valid as any other year. It is very encouraging to see the continuing trend of more female students taking science. Hopefully this shows that traditional attitudes to subjects like these have changed and they are most certainly no longer felt to be the preserve of male students. We know there is room for further improvement in the system as a whole, and we will be working with our members over the coming months to identify some recommendations for change. To be successful at A-level, students need access to two things; a wide range of subjects to choose from and the right level of support to help them during their study. Sixth form funding has suffered terribly since 2010, making it harder and harder for schools and colleges to provide these essentials. We support the calls from across the education sector to raise the rate for 16-, 17- and 18 year-old students to at least \u00a34,760 per year. There is nothing guaranteed about A-level success, but the least we can do is to guarantee each student is properly supported with sufficient funding. R\u00e9mi de Fleurian, on the Guardian\u2019s data team, has been looking at the results across the UK (other than in Scotland, which has a different examination system). He reports that students taking A-levels in Northern Ireland obtained higher grades than their English and Welsh counterparts, with 30.9% achieving A*-A grades and 84.8% of students getting A*-C grades. However, students in Wales got the highest proportion of A*s, at 9.1%, across all subjects. The prime minister has bizarrely used his first comment on A-level results day to seemingly extend his law and order agenda to schools. In a release from the Department for Education (DfE), ostensibly about the rise in pupils studying sciences, Boris Johnson says: I congratulate everyone receiving their A-level results today. The new government will do all we can to improve funding for education and to give schools the powers they need to deal with bad behaviour and bullying so that pupils can learn. We also must focus much more attention on providing great apprenticeships for all those who do not go to university. The comments seem out of place in a DfE statement highlighting the 26.2% increase in pupils taking science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) related subjects since 2010. Other lines highlighted by the department include: More girls now do science subjects \u2013 biology, chemistry and physics combined \u2013 than boys and overall science entries are up by 7.4%, despite the fall in the population; Entries to Spanish have risen, making it the most popular language at A-level, while there has been a relative increase in entries to German for the first time since 2007; Maths remains the most popular subject; Since 2010, total entries in maths and further maths have increased by 20.0%, despite a 10.7% fall in the A-level cohort population in the period; Entries to history and geography have increased; Girls narrowly outperform boys at A and A* combined, reversing last year\u2019s trend, but boys did better than girls at A*; The north-east has the highest overall pass rate and the biggest percentage improvement at A and A* grades; There has been a rise in non-EU students coming to the country to study, and a rise in nursing admissions \u2013 bucking a recent trend. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said: Receiving your A-level results is a huge day for all involved, so I want to congratulate pupils, parents and teachers on all their hard work. I\u2019m delighted to see more pupils choosing science-related subjects. This is encouraging, particularly as we look to boost science in this country and the skills we will need in the future. Overall, the reforms we have put in place since 2010 and increasing rigour in our schools are giving pupils more opportunities. More analysis from Pamela Duncan. The gap between boys and girls increased this year with 73.3% of male students achieving a C grade or above compared with 77.2% of females. That said, the proportion of students receiving an A grade or above was as close as it has been in at least a decade, with just a 0.1% difference between boys and girls. Maths is still the most popular subject among England\u2019s A-level students, despite a fall of 5.8% compared with last year (the overall number of A-levels taken by students in England fell by 1.2%). The most popular subject this year was maths. However, English took the hardest knock. The subject was split into three in 2017. As Sally Weale wrote on Wednesday, the exams watchdog, Ofqual, reported a 13% drop in entries for all types of English A-levels between 2018 and 2019. The sharpest decline was for the English language A-level, which fell by 22.2%, English language and literature was down 15.8% and English Literature was 8.1% lower. The results are in, and grades overall are down this year. In England A*, A and C grades fell to their lowest level in at least a decade, according to the Guardian\u2019s data journalist Pamela Duncan, who is crunching the numbers this morning. The proportion of A-level entries awarded an A grade or higher has fallen to the lowest for more than a decade, national figures seen by PA Media show. Girls narrowly clawed back the lead from boys in terms of A* and A grades, although boys still outperformed their female classmates in the highest result. For the first time, there were more entries for A-level science subjects from girls than from boys. The shift comes after a big push in recent years to encourage girls to study science and maths-based subjects. Spanish has become the most popular foreign language at A-level, overtaking French for the first time. The figures, published by the Joint Council for Qualifications, cover A-level entries from students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. About 300,000 students are receiving their results today. In total, 25.5% of UK entries were awarded an A or A* grade this summer, the lowest proportion since 2007 when it was 25.3%. A* grades were introduced in 2010. Before this, the highest result was an A. Girls are back in front in terms of top grades, with 25.5% of entries handed at least an A, compared with 25.4% of boys - a gap of 0.1 percentage points. But on A* grades alone, boys performed better, with 8.2% of entries getting the highest result, compared with 7.5% of girls\u2019 entries. No A-level results day coverage would be complete without pictures of delighted teenagers reacting to their grades. So here are a few for your consideration. One of the room\u2019s at Rochdale sixth form college has been adorned with a huge congratulations banner, reports Amy Walker. There\u2019s also cake, croissants and orange juice (not buck\u2019s fizz) being served in champagne flutes, which marks a nice departure from the usual envelope-and-you\u2019re-out-the-door affair. Billal Iqbal, 18, is the college\u2019s first student to be accepted into the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was relieved to achieve an A* in maths, A in physics, A in computer science and an A* in an extended project qualification \u2013 particularly because his flight to the States is already booked for Saturday. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t get in I was just going to have to go on holiday,\u201d said Iqbal, who will begin a degree in mechanical engineering shortly as part of a scholarship for international students. It\u2019s been a stressful two years, he says, admitting that gaining work experience in the sector was sometimes prioritised over his studies. \u201cLast year, I finished college a week early and started a week late and I was working the entire time,\u201d Iqbal said. He also appeared on BBC Radio Manchester this morning to talk about his results. \u201cMy mum was really happy. I could hear her saying \u2018Quick, put the radio on, put the radio on\u2019 when I spoke to her before,\u201d he said. Richard Ronksley, the college principal and chief executive, said students achieved an A-level pass rate of 99% this year. Many of the students will be heading to university, with a significant proportion going to a prestigious Russell Group institution. \u201cIt\u2019s really important because a lot of these are first generation university-goers. They\u2019ve come from backgrounds where they haven\u2019t got the historic, social, economic or cultural background that traditional university-goers have got,\u201d Ronksley said. But many students have chosen apprenticeships over degrees. Carson Holt, 18, who earned a C, B and an A* will take up a project management apprenticeship with Highways England this autumn. Her first project will be managing Liverpool\u2019s docks. \u201cIt\u2019s quite daunting, there\u2019s a lot of responsibility. I feel like it\u2019s going to be really interesting though, and I\u2019m earning quite a big wage for an apprentice,\u201d she said. The university admissions gap between the most and least disadvantaged groups of students in England has narrowed slightly, Ucas has reported. The admissions service says a record 17.3% of 18-year-olds (18,900 students, which is also the highest on A-level results day) from the most disadvantaged backgrounds in England have been accepted \u2013 up 0.8 percentage points since 2018. In Wales, 15.8% of students from the most disadvantaged backgrounds have been accepted; in Northern Ireland the proportion is 13.2% \u2013 both record highs. Across the UK, 28.2% of all 18-year-olds have been accepted through Ucas, also a new record for results day. Last year\u2019s figure on A-level results day was 27.7%. In England, a record 28.5% of18-year-olds have been accepted through the admissions service. In Wales, 25.8% of young people will be starting an undergraduate course. In Northern Ireland, the entry rate is a record 29.4%. The 1% fall in the overall numbers of students placed on an undergraduate course \u2013 highlighted below \u2013 can perhaps partly be explained by a 1.9% drop in the number of 18-year-olds in the UK population. Fewer students have been accepted on to UK degree courses this year, according to Ucas figures seen by PA Media. In total, 408,960 people, from the UK and overseas, have had places confirmed, down 1% on the same point last year, according to data published by the university admissions service. Among UK students, 348,890 applicants have been accepted, also a 1% fall compared with 2018. We will have more on this as it comes in. Many young people believe the speed of technological advances means they will one day have a job that does not yet exist, according to new research carried out by the arms company BAE Systems. A survey of young people, timed to coincide with A-level results day, found 47% of 16 to 24-year-olds believe they will work in a role that does not currently exist. Worryingly, less than one-in-five think they have the skills required to future-proof their careers. In response to the study BAE used a panel of futurists and technologists to predict the job roles likely to exist in 2040, and the subjects which could provide skills for those jobs. It included roles such as an AI ethicist, who would be responsible for ensuring artificial intelligence was underpinned by robust ethics. Such a role could be crucial in the future, with the UK among a number of nations ploughing cash into so-called autonomous weapons, which use artificial intelligence to help decide when and who to kill. BAE Systems\u2019s principal technologist Nick Colosimo said: \u201cAdvances in technology, engineering and science, mean the workplace of today will look dramatically different in 2040. \u201cWhilst it\u2019s impossible for today\u2019s young people to know exactly where their career will take them in the next 20 years, a wide range of skills will be useful in future-proofing the careers of young people today. \u201cIndeed, subjects as varied as graphic design, philosophy, chemical engineering and cybersecurity will prove valuable for the jobs of tomorrow.\u201d The Department for Education this morning boasted of a rise in the numbers of entries to science courses, computing and history this morning. But concerns have been raised over a decline in the popularity of English among sixth formers after it emerged that there had been a 13% decline this summer in entries for all types of English A-level. Authors and teachers\u2019 leaders have called on ministers to urgently review the reformed English GCSEs because of concerns that the new qualifications are \u201csucking the joy\u201d out of the subject and may be putting students off pursuing it at a higher level, reports Sally Weale, the Guardian\u2019s education correspondent. According to provisional data from the exams watchdog Ofqual, entries for English language A-level dropped from just under 18,000 in 2018 to less than 14,000 this year. Uptake was also down for English literature, from 41,000 to 37,500, while combined English language and literature dropped from 9,000 to 7,600. The author and former teacher Joanne Harris, whose works included the best-selling novel Chocolat, said: We should be very, very concerned at this drop in the study of English. This, combined with the loss of so many public libraries, could be the start of a catastrophic decline in the quality of our secondary students, graduates and future colleagues and employees. This year\u2019s A-level cohort, who will receive their results on Thursday, were the first to sit the new GCSE English qualifications introduced in 2017 as part of the former education secretary Michael Gove\u2019s sweeping qualification changes, which were intended to make exams more rigorous and challenging. Teachers have since expressed concerns that the new GCSE English language exam is focused too heavily on analysis of historical texts, while English literature involves memorising large amounts of content. The changes, they say, have hit the least able the hardest. One assistant headteacher said: GCSE English language is sucking the joy out of the study of how we communicate: the power and beauty in words. English literature favours those with excellent memories; it has reduced our most magnificent pieces of writing to a collection of quotations. We\u2019ve already heard from Gavin Williamson, the new education secretary, this morning. Now it\u2019s time to hear from his counterpart in Her Majesty\u2019s Official Opposition, Angela Rayner. She said: Congratulations to everyone receiving their A-Level results today. And thank you to parents and carers, education leaders and teachers for their hard work in supporting young people through their education. We need to give more support to our students, so Labour will abolish predicted grades and implement post-qualification admissions. This will allow those studying to make informed choices, and reduce the stress of the transition to higher education. Students should be proud of what they have achieved today, and we are proud of them.\u201d The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, tweeted: Labour has proposed to overhaul university admissions by delaying the process until after after exam results are published, ending controversial practices that penalise disadvantaged students. Earlier this week, Rayner said a Labour government change the structure and timing of the higher education admissions system in England to avoid relying on inaccurate grade forecasts and to halt the controversial use of unconditional offers for school-leavers. In most cases the offers are the result of applications made in January or earlier, but under Rayner\u2019s plan the decision-making process at English institutions would be delayed until after 18 and 19-year-olds have had their exams marked and received their grades. Guardian reporter Amy Walker is at at Rochdale Sixth Form College this morning, where most of the students are still eagerly awaiting their A Level results. One of the students who have already opened theirs however, is Molly Howarth, 19 who is over the moon at having achieved two A*s and two As. \u201cI\u2019m really pleased \u2013 I got into York!\u201d said Howarth, as joyful tears on her cheeks dried. Having taken Psychology, Biology and Sociology and an Extended Project Qualification, she is among an increasing group of young girls taking up Stem subjects during further education. Entries for sciences overall continue to increase - in line with the the government\u2019s drive to encourage study of Stem subjects. But for first time more female entries than male - 50.3% compared to 49.6% in 2018. While studying for her GCSEs, Howarth was diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumour. Despite this she received 3 A*s and 7 As but the experience has informed her decision to study Psychology. \u201cI want to go into clinical psychology in the long-term. It\u2019s something I thought about after being in hospital for all that time,\u201d said Howarth. Howarth\u2019s parents are also here. Her mum Jane said she was \u201creally, really proud of her\u201d. Harry Tait, 18, is also struggling to stop beaming after achieving four A*s in Maths, Further Maths, Physics and an Extended Project Qualification. Although he says his grades will not have an effect on his career progression, because he\u2019s off to Spain to train as a pilot rather than university, Tait says doing well was \u201creally important\u201d to him. \u201cNo-one will ever ask me what I got in my results but I know that I got the recognition for the work I put in.\u201d His parents aren\u2019t here, but they heard Tait opening his results live on BBC Radio Manchester. \u201cThat was quite scary,\u201d he says. Young people in Britain are increasingly sceptical of the need to go to university and are more aware of apprenticeships, according to polling. Sixty-five per cent of young people up to the age of 16 said they thought it was important to go to university, continuing a downward trend seen since 2013, when 86% said a university education was important. A year ago the figure was 75% . This year\u2019s polling, by Ipsos MORI on behalf of the Sutton Trust, also found nearly two-thirds of respondents were interested in doing an apprenticeship rather than going to university after leaving school. The Sutton Trust said the change \u201cmay in part be down to a growing awareness of apprenticeships and other high-quality training routes\u201d. Despite the decline in enthusiasm, the latest poll found no change in the proportion of secondary school pupils expecting to go into higher education: 77% said they were very or fairly likely to go to university when they were old enough, with only 40% saying they were worried about cost. We\u2019d like to hear how A-level results day has been for you. Are you trying to find a university place through clearing after missing out on grades, or did you choose to bypass Ucas and instead go through clearing? Did the high cost of university influence your choice of subject? Have more pupils pursued vocational and STEM subjects instead of arts, like English? You can share your pictures, videos and stories by filling in our form or contacting the Guardian via WhatsApp by adding the contact +44(0)7867825056. We\u2019ll feature some of your submissions in our live blog. You can read terms of service here. A-level results day is upon us. The big day for hundreds of thousands of mostly teenage students has arrived. Many will be getting up just about now full of nerves about their grades - and whether they have got into university. More than 300,000 sixth formers across England, Wales and Northern Ireland will find out the results of their summer exams today, including results for the last major tranche of subjects given an overhaul by Michael Gove as education secretary. Candidates sat reformed exams in 19 subjects for the first time, including design and technology, Chinese, further maths and politics. Almost all A-levels have now been reformed, with the continuous testing of the previous regime removed and almost everything now riding on final exams sat at the end of the two-year courses. Provisional data published in May showed a total of 745,585 A level entries in England this academic year, including increases in the numbers entering science courses, computing and history. The new education secretary, Gavin Williamson, this morning sent a message of good luck to those waiting for their results. He said: \u201cEveryone receiving results today should feel proud of their achievements \u2013 as should the thousands of teachers that supported them in our brilliant schools and colleges. Today marks the culmination of years of hard work which it\u2019s right to recognise at this time of year. \u201cOf course, the minds of thousands of young people getting their results will soon turn to the next chapter in their lives, whether that\u2019s a place at one of our world class universities, earning on an apprenticeship or entering the world of work \u2013 and I hope every one of them is excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for them and I wish them the very best of luck for their results today.\u201d",

Today we must conclude these meetings sorely disappointed in the Federation\u2019s determination to perpetuate fundamentally discriminatory workplace conditions and behavior. It is clear that USSF, including its Board of Directors and President Carlos Cordeiro, fully intend to continue to compensate women players less than men,\u201d wrote Levinson in a statement. \u201cThey will not succeed. We want all of our fans, sponsors, peers around the world, and women everywhere to know we are undaunted and will eagerly look forward to a jury trial.\u201d</p> <p>For its part, US Soccer said the players have been too aggressive. \u201cWe have said numerous times that our goal is to find a resolution, and during mediation we had hoped we would be able to address the issues in a respectful manner and reach an agreement,\u201d said the federation in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cUnfortunately, instead of allowing mediation to proceed in a considerate manner, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel took an aggressive and ultimately unproductive approach that follows months of presenting misleading information to the public in an effort to perpetuate confusion.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Megan Rapinoe says the onus is on her employer after mediation talks between the US women\u2019s national team and US Soccer broke down on Wednesday night. In March, 28 players from the World Cup champions filed a lawsuit against their own governing body alleging years of \u201cinstitutionalized gender discrimination\u201d. The team are seeking equal pay with their male counterparts. Talks have been ongoing between the players and US Soccer with both parties hoping to avoid going to court but on Wednesday it emerged that the discussions have reached a stalemate. In an interview with ABC\u2019s Good Morning America on Thursday, Rapinoe said she was still hopeful the parties could come to an agreement. \u201cThey\u2019re the only employer that we could have playing for the national team, we\u2019re the only employees that they could have, so for better or for worse we\u2019re tethered together,\u201d Rapinoe said. \u201cI think that if and when and ever they are willing to have a conversation about equal pay that starts there and goes forward, we\u2019re always open to that.\u201d Rapinoe, one of the team\u2019s co-captains, said equal pay was still central to their demands. \u201cWe won\u2019t accept anything less than equal pay,\u201d she added. \u201cWe show up for a game, if we win the game if we lose the game if we tie the game, we want to be paid equally, period.\u201d The lawsuit also seeks \u201cat least equal playing, training, and travel conditions; equal promotion of their games; equal support and development for their games; and other terms and conditions of employment.\u201d On Wednesday, Molly Levinson, a spokesperson for the US players, said mediation talks had broken down due to US Soccer\u2019s unwillingness to change. \u201cWe entered this week\u2019s mediation with representatives of [US Soccer] full of hope. Today we must conclude these meetings sorely disappointed in the Federation\u2019s determination to perpetuate fundamentally discriminatory workplace conditions and behavior. It is clear that USSF, including its Board of Directors and President Carlos Cordeiro, fully intend to continue to compensate women players less than men,\u201d wrote Levinson in a statement. \u201cThey will not succeed. We want all of our fans, sponsors, peers around the world, and women everywhere to know we are undaunted and will eagerly look forward to a jury trial.\u201d For its part, US Soccer said the players have been too aggressive. \u201cWe have said numerous times that our goal is to find a resolution, and during mediation we had hoped we would be able to address the issues in a respectful manner and reach an agreement,\u201d said the federation in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cUnfortunately, instead of allowing mediation to proceed in a considerate manner, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel took an aggressive and ultimately unproductive approach that follows months of presenting misleading information to the public in an effort to perpetuate confusion.\u201d",

And that\u2019s ignoring their financial might \u2013 it has been suggested that an investment by former Arsenal, Milan and Crystal Palace player, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/04/20/mathieu-flamini-exclusive-interview-have-always-felt-connected/\">Mathieu Flamini,</a> in a biochemical firm could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2015/nov/16/mathieu-flamini-arsenal-chemical-company-saviour\">help to save the planet</a>.</p> <p>Flamini recognises, and welcomes, the power players have to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/football/46212974\">\u201cinfluence the next generation\u201d</a>.

It gets people talking about major issues. And it\u2019s then a snowball effect, once a few are able to come out and talk comfortably, it gives the freedom for others to voice their opinions that they were probably too scared to do before.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/in-bed-with-maradona/2017/dec/14/politics-football-premier-league-capitalism-neoliberalism\">Want to understand politics in the last 25 years? Look at football</a> </p> </aside>  <p>None of this is to say that footballers of the past never expressed progressive political positions. \u201cThere have always been socially conscious footballers, from Shankly and S\u00f3crates to Boban and Cantona, but it was generally when they were established in their careers,\u201d says Choudry. The former Barcelona defender Oleguer was well known for his leftwing, pro-Catalan independence views \u2013 and was even dropped by a sponsor for an <a href=\"http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2007/02/06/espana/1170796627.html\">article he wrote in 2007</a> questioning the independence of the Spanish judicial system. In the UK, Robbie Fowler was fined by Uefa, European football\u2019s governing body, in 1997 for expressing his support for the Liverpool dockers on a T-shirt when celebrating a goal. Political demonstrations were, and are, outlawed on the pitch. \u201cPlayers have always had an opinion,\u201d says Sanderson. \u201cIt depends if the club would let you express it. That\u2019s why a lot of them sound robotic.\u201d</p> <p>But that wasn\u2019t the only time Fowler was fined for behaviour on the pitch. The striker also perpetrated one of the most notorious incidents of homophobic abuse in football, when he taunted Le Saux in 1999 by bending over and gesturing to his rear end. Fowler took years to properly apologise, even though they had to share a dressing room for England. \u201cI did not want a public apology, just a private word would do,\u201d Le Saux wrote in 2007. \u201cBut he refused. He said that he had done nothing wrong, that it was just a bit of a laugh.\u201d</p> <p>And that\u2019s the thing. Footballers are people, as complex and capable of contradiction as anybody else in society. Someone can express welcome working-class solidarity while at the same time holding unpleasant, bigoted views. \u201cIt\u2019s telling that Nike backed Colin Kaepernick and amplified his stance,\u201d says Choudry about the American footballer\u2019s on-field protests at the treatment of minorities in the US. \u201cIn a way, that legitimises the voices of young athletes who aren\u2019t willing to remain silent on things that matter to them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDifference is celebrated now,\u201d says Le Saux. \u201cPlayers have individual needs, whether it be recovery drinks, gym programmes or politics. Until you are really yourself, you can\u2019t be the best version of you. The work of a club becomes not about sculpting the best footballer, but the best person. Whether they leave the game at 15 or 35, it\u2019s how they then contribute to society on which a club can be judged.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s a power that they\u2019re well aware of. \u201cSince footballers have such a large social media presence, we can shape the conversation as much as you do,\u201d Deeney told this paper. And that\u2019s ignoring their financial might \u2013 it has been suggested that an investment by former Arsenal, Milan and Crystal Palace player, Mathieu Flamini, in a biochemical firm could help to save the planet. Flamini recognises, and welcomes, the power players have to \u201cinfluence the next generation\u201d. It\u2019s something that Lolley, with his regular interventions on politics, is well aware of. \u201cThose with such high standing in the game have a chance to push for change. It gets people talking about major issues. And it\u2019s then a snowball effect, once a few are able to come out and talk comfortably, it gives the freedom for others to voice their opinions that they were probably too scared to do before.\u201d None of this is to say that footballers of the past never expressed progressive political positions. \u201cThere have always been socially conscious footballers, from Shankly and S\u00f3crates to Boban and Cantona, but it was generally when they were established in their careers,\u201d says Choudry. The former Barcelona defender Oleguer was well known for his leftwing, pro-Catalan independence views \u2013 and was even dropped by a sponsor for an article he wrote in 2007 questioning the independence of the Spanish judicial system. In the UK, Robbie Fowler was fined by Uefa, European football\u2019s governing body, in 1997 for expressing his support for the Liverpool dockers on a T-shirt when celebrating a goal. Political demonstrations were, and are, outlawed on the pitch. \u201cPlayers have always had an opinion,\u201d says Sanderson. \u201cIt depends if the club would let you express it. That\u2019s why a lot of them sound robotic.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t the only time Fowler was fined for behaviour on the pitch. The striker also perpetrated one of the most notorious incidents of homophobic abuse in football, when he taunted Le Saux in 1999 by bending over and gesturing to his rear end. Fowler took years to properly apologise, even though they had to share a dressing room for England. \u201cI did not want a public apology, just a private word would do,\u201d Le Saux wrote in 2007. \u201cBut he refused. He said that he had done nothing wrong, that it was just a bit of a laugh.\u201d And that\u2019s the thing. Footballers are people, as complex and capable of contradiction as anybody else in society. Someone can express welcome working-class solidarity while at the same time holding unpleasant, bigoted views. \u201cIt\u2019s telling that Nike backed Colin Kaepernick and amplified his stance,\u201d says Choudry about the American footballer\u2019s on-field protests at the treatment of minorities in the US. \u201cIn a way, that legitimises the voices of young athletes who aren\u2019t willing to remain silent on things that matter to them.\u201d \u201cDifference is celebrated now,\u201d says Le Saux. \u201cPlayers have individual needs, whether it be recovery drinks, gym programmes or politics. Until you are really yourself, you can\u2019t be the best version of you. The work of a club becomes not about sculpting the best footballer, but the best person. Whether they leave the game at 15 or 35, it\u2019s how they then contribute to society on which a club can be judged.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Last weekend, more than 200 brands and 20,000 beauty fans flocked to the Los Angeles Convention Center for <a href=\"https://beautycon.com/\">BeautyCon</a>, an annual festival that gives celebrities and brands the chance to celebrate all things <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/beauty\">beauty</a> with their fans. Among the brands touting the latest lipsticks and foundations were a number of those most covetable of companies: unicorns, a term coined by Silicon Valley for startups with a valuation of $1bn (\u00a3825m) or more. </p> <p>It is a good time to be in the beauty game: the industry has shown double-digit growth in the last few years and investors are eager to capitalise. But with buzzy new brands popping up at a prolific rate, not all startups will develop a line that has the cool-girl hype of Huda Beauty or transform the beauty game like <a href=\"https://www.glossier.com/\">Glossier</a>, which was valued at more than $1.2bn after its latest funding round earlier this year. So, what can new companies learn from some of the festival\u2019s more established successes?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"299e72cce81788d3e84e9760b4836078adb8014f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/299e72cce81788d3e84e9760b4836078adb8014f/0_236_4808_2885/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BeautyCon Media\u2019s chief executive, Moj Mahdara, speaks to Anastasia Soare during BeautyCon festival 2019 in LA\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BeautyCon Media\u2019s chief executive, Moj Mahdara (left), speaks to Anastasia Soare during the festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vivien Killilea/Getty Images for Beautycon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Anastasia Soare of <a href=\"https://www.anastasiabeverlyhills.co.uk/\">Anastasia Beverly Hills</a>, who started her brand in 1997 with a focus on eyebrows, it is about identifying a gap in the market.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I started 20 years ago, people thought I was crazy. But there were no eyebrow products in the 90s so I started to develop a full product line and, in 2000, we launched in [the US department store chain] Nordstrom and the rest is history,\u201d says Soare, whose empire is now worth approximately $3 billion. She now has a full brow bar inside Harrods that launched this summer, as well as a concession at Selfridges.</p> <p>Huda Kattan, the Iraqi-American influencer turned founder and chief executive of <a href=\"https://hudabeauty.com/\">Huda Beauty</a>, valued at $1.2bn, also attended the LA festival. \u201cUltimately, I think we built a community, and that\u2019s really the driving force behind the success of the brand\u201d she says. Like Glossier, Huda Beauty has a strong following on various social platforms and engages its community in the decision-making process when creating products.</p> <p>\u201cBecause our social family is so engaging, we are very skilled at identifying a gap in the market and creating products that serve a purpose,\u201d says Kattan. \u201cWhen we were developing the #FauxFilter Foundation, I reached out to our Instagram audience because I wanted to understand what kind of coverage and finish they wanted.

      "bodyText": "Last weekend, more than 200 brands and 20,000 beauty fans flocked to the Los Angeles Convention Center for BeautyCon, an annual festival that gives celebrities and brands the chance to celebrate all things beauty with their fans. Among the brands touting the latest lipsticks and foundations were a number of those most covetable of companies: unicorns, a term coined by Silicon Valley for startups with a valuation of $1bn (\u00a3825m) or more. It is a good time to be in the beauty game: the industry has shown double-digit growth in the last few years and investors are eager to capitalise. But with buzzy new brands popping up at a prolific rate, not all startups will develop a line that has the cool-girl hype of Huda Beauty or transform the beauty game like Glossier, which was valued at more than $1.2bn after its latest funding round earlier this year. So, what can new companies learn from some of the festival\u2019s more established successes? For Anastasia Soare of Anastasia Beverly Hills, who started her brand in 1997 with a focus on eyebrows, it is about identifying a gap in the market. \u201cWhen I started 20 years ago, people thought I was crazy. But there were no eyebrow products in the 90s so I started to develop a full product line and, in 2000, we launched in [the US department store chain] Nordstrom and the rest is history,\u201d says Soare, whose empire is now worth approximately $3 billion. She now has a full brow bar inside Harrods that launched this summer, as well as a concession at Selfridges. Huda Kattan, the Iraqi-American influencer turned founder and chief executive of Huda Beauty, valued at $1.2bn, also attended the LA festival. \u201cUltimately, I think we built a community, and that\u2019s really the driving force behind the success of the brand\u201d she says. Like Glossier, Huda Beauty has a strong following on various social platforms and engages its community in the decision-making process when creating products. \u201cBecause our social family is so engaging, we are very skilled at identifying a gap in the market and creating products that serve a purpose,\u201d says Kattan. \u201cWhen we were developing the #FauxFilter Foundation, I reached out to our Instagram audience because I wanted to understand what kind of coverage and finish they wanted. We had thousands of responses that helped guide us, so our community really and truly helps with the creation of Huda Beauty products.\u201d Perhaps there are lessons to be learned from looking at what the most successful brands have in common. A decade ago, a female-led beauty unicorn would have been unheard of, but as the industry continues to grow they are becoming more common \u2013 prompting a scramble to find, incubate and invest in what could be the next big thing. Many of the most successful beauty brands are putting a long overdue focus on inclusivity, and it is perhaps no coincidence that the US beauty landscape is currently being shaped by immigrants or the children of immigrants. The celebrity makeup artist Hung Vanngo, who left Vietnam for Canada as a child, hosted a panel discussion attended by passionate fans, while the festival\u2019s chief executive, Moj Mahdara, is a first generation Iranian-American. \u201cWe\u2019re afforded the opportunity in this country, especially women, to do a lot that we probably could not do in our original homelands,\u201d Mahdara says.",

      "bodyText": "Jeffrey Epstein is dead but the investigation that snared on sex trafficking charges has continued as authorities seek to make good on their promise not to let the convicted sex offender\u2019s apparent suicide mark an end to their quest for justice. Given the nature of the wealthy financier\u2019s elite international social scene, it\u2019s possible potential co-conspirators or other participants in the alleged trafficking would have the means to flee into hiding, in the US or abroad. Investigators on any potential manhunt would have at their disposal a range of tools, from facial recognition software and sophisticated techniques to track their finances. But the international character of some of Epstein\u2019s accused enablers begs the question: how would authorities find potential co-conspirators in hiding? If they fled the US or live abroad, how would authorities catch them? So far no one else has been charged in relation to Epstein\u2019s alleged sexual abuse of minors as young as 14 at his Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, homes. But the names of other possible co-conspirators have repeatedly surfaced in court documents and media reports. The highest profile is Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite long accused of procuring girls for Epstein \u2013 an allegation she has emphatically denied. Former federal law enforcement agents said that catching any wanted persons relies on traditional police work, the use of technology and close relationships with law enforcement agencies in other countries \u2013 not thriller movie-style tactics such as throwing a fugitive in the trunk of a car. The US Marshals Service is the main federal agency tasked with tracking and extraditing persons facing charges in the US who have fled abroad. US law enforcement does not have jurisdiction in foreign countries, so the first step \u2013 finding these wanted persons \u2013 takes place stateside and in some field offices, according to the Marshals Service. To track a wanted person, \u201cone of the things you always do is follow the money\u201d, said Clinton R Van Zandt, a former FBI criminal profiler and current corporate security expert. \u201cAn individual has to have money to function overseas. That money has to be in a bank account. It has to be wired from point A to point B.\u201d The financial instruments and personal documents people need to function \u2013 such as credit cards and passports \u2013 can tip off authorities. Facial recognition software allows authorities to take \u201cthe image of the face of the fugitive and run that against tens of thousands of individuals\u201d, Van Zandt said. \u201cYou and I can\u2019t walk anywhere in this world without leaving some type of digital footprint or fingerprint \u2013 it\u2019s just almost impossible to do,\u201d Van Zandt said. \u201cIt\u2019s fairly hard today to just drop out totally unless you\u2019re willing to go to some third-world country and live far below your economic means, change your appearance and never get stopped and never get arrested.\u201d Mary Ellen O\u2019Toole, a former FBI profiler who played an integral role in tracking down the Unabomber, said wanted persons are in a no-win situation when it comes to interacting with others. \u201cLaw enforcement will be looking at people who are likely to be able to help this person, who might stick their neck out to help this person,\u201d said O\u2019Toole, who heads the forensic science department at George Mason University in Virginia. Epstein\u2019s elite former associates might find their wealth and status now becomes a disadvantage. Other rich and famous people might well see this person as a liability \u2013 potentially making them more likely to tip off authorities. \u201cIf you run in a circle of very high-profile people, that means these people are well-known,\u201d she said. \u201cThat means these people have a lot to lose to associate with you.\u201d Joseph King, formerly a supervisory special agent with US customs in New York and former chief, national security section for the Department of Homeland Security in New York, said authorities can also use a \u201ctrap and chase\u201d to locate a wanted person based on communications with past associates. \u201cLet\u2019s say I\u2019m a fugitive, but they know that I speak to you,\u201d he explained, \u201cso they track all of your phone calls, and try and trace you back to their location.\u201d If US authorities did locate someone abroad, they would inform foreign authorities. If US law enforcement had a good relationship with authorities in that country \u2013 and if there weren\u2019t legal issues surrounding extradition \u2013 authorities abroad would generally help arrest those wanted persons. In some cases, US marshals are present for the arrest, the agency said. While Interpol does not investigate wanted persons whereabouts, it works \u201cto support police with any international aspects of their investigations\u201d, the agency said in an emailed statement. While US law enforcement doesn\u2019t have jurisdiction abroad, authorities sometimes use informants and subterfuge to track and catch wanted persons on foreign soil. \u201cI place a high value on informants, not just on luring people but on information on their whereabouts,\u201d said King, who is an associate professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. If a person can\u2019t be extradited for some reason, an informant could be used to bring that person into US jurisdiction. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get this Iranian out of England, so my informant said to him: \u2018Let\u2019s set up a business deal.\u2019 He said they were going to incorporate this company in Bermuda,\u201d King recalled of one case. \u201cInstead of going to Bermuda, the flight he was on was London-New York-Bermuda.\u201d When the flight stopped in New York, \u201cwe just took him off the plane and arrested him\u201d, King said. Private bounty hunters, however, are not controlled by US federal laws on extradition. While private bounty hunting is against the law in some foreign countries, US judges might not have a problem with a fugitive being apprehended in that manner. \u201cIf a [bounty hunter] dropped them at the foot of a courthouse, it would depend what a federal judge would ask.\u201d King said. \u201cWere they acting as an agent of the government? Or were they completely independent individuals?\u201d At times, bringing a wanted person back to the US could be a matter of negotiation. Jennifer Louis-Jeune, a criminal defense lawyer in New York City, said a wanted person out of the country may have a lawyer appointed to guide the process. A person might also broker an individualized deal to return to the US. \u201cThose may involve deals such as the United States agreeing that they won\u2019t pursue the death penalty if the person\u2019s extradited,\u201d Louis-Jeune said. But no matter the difficulties that may arise, the investigation will probably not stop. It has the public support of America\u2019s top law enforcement official. \u201cLet me assure you that case will continue on against anyone who was complicit with Epstein,\u201d said the US attorney general, William Barr. \u201cAny co-conspirators should not rest easy. Victims deserve justice and will get it.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The phrase \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d seems to sum up the state of Turkish football as the season approaches. The Super Lig giants are all in transition as financial fair play has forced clubs to address mounting debts and become more sustainable. It will benefit the league but in the short term most clubs will suffer.</p> \n<p>Now for the good news: the league is finally producing \u2013 and relying on \u2013 young, Turkish talent. A lot of it.</p> \n<p>Galatasaray pipped Basaksehir to the Super Lig title on the penultimate week last season. Besiktas were involved in the title race until the final three weeks but it is a tale of four clubs in Istanbul and last season it was Fenerbahce\u2019s plight that provided the biggest story.</p> \n<p>They finished sixth but it could have been a lot worse. They spent much of the season in the bottom half and were briefly involved in a relegation battle. There has been a lot of schadenfreude around from rival fans, as expected, but it is important to point out Galatasaray also finished sixth in 2015-16 and they were champions two years later.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/23/fenerbahce-victor-moses-turkey-loan-chelsea-interview\">Fenerbahce\u2019s Victor Moses: \u2018The atmosphere here in Turkey is amazing\u2019</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Fenerbahce have been at the bottom and are on their way up again. Last year Ali Koc, the heir of the wealthiest family in Turkey, replaced the club\u2019s longest-serving president Aziz Yildirim after 20 years in charge but by that point the club had been run into the ground. Debt had spiralled out of control to an astonishing \u20ac621m (\u00a3574m).</p> \n<p>Fenerbahce had faltered where most other Turkish clubs do. Several of the major teams are run on a \u201cfoundation club\u201d model \u2013 much like Real Madrid and Barcelona \u2013 with thousands of members. The problem with that is the fans expect silverware all the time. Club presidents typically get three-year terms and focus on the here and now rather than the future, leading to endemic short-termism.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"942b98b647298ed104251cd1cd8feb64ab43b50e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/942b98b647298ed104251cd1cd8feb64ab43b50e/0_0_5443_3136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fenerbahce fans celebrate after Elif Elmas scored the equaliser in their 1-1 draw against Galatasaray at the \u00fckr\u00fc Saracolu Stadium in April 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"576\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fenerbahce fans celebrate after Elif Elmas scored the equaliser in their 1-1 draw against Galatasaray at the \u00fckr\u00fc Saracolu Stadium in April 2019.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Koc may be rich but he has his hands tied with regards to using his fortune to fund the club. Koc is not the owner \u2013 the members are the owners \u2013 and has FFP to contend with.</p> \n<p>And in a break with Super Lig tradition he has decided to concentrate on the future of the club. He has started to work on the debt, created a sustainable transfer policy and focused on youth development. It is a risky strategy in a league that does not do patience. It is also a brave move considering it could be his successors, rather than himself, who benefit. \u201cThe academy is very important to us,\u201dKoc says. \u201cIt\u2019s our priority to produce talent. There are talented players emerging from all over Turkey and we cannot ignore them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Koc brought in Damien Comolli as the sporting director and gave him the freedom to decide all the key decisions, including recruitment and the academy. The Frenchman has made 10 signings, spending just \u20ac10.4m (\u00a39.5m) bringing in Max Kruse on a free, the club legend Emre Belozoglu and Mathias J\u00f8rgensen from Huddersfield, as well as a number of proven Super Lig players.</p> \n<p>The key thing is the Yellow Canaries are \u20ac5.7m in profit after selling the 19-year-old Eljif Elmas for \u20ac16m to Napoli. And it is the focus on exciting young talent that is the trend not only at Fenerbahce but the league in general.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9fcfa8f6-d6f1-4e6e-95c0-0498cdf2c010\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Istanbul Basaksehir</b>&nbsp;No longer underdogs and have been in the mix for the past six seasons. However, the architect of their success, the coach Abdullah Avci, has left and the last time he did that the club got relegated. His replacement, Okan Buruk, has an impressive track record but this is a huge test. Ba\u015fak\u015fehir added some depth in midfield and up front with the likes of Enzo Crivelli and Fredrik Gulbrandsen but did not make any galactico signings like we have become accustomed to over the past few seasons.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Besiktas&nbsp;</b>The Black Eagles were the beneficiaries of Avci\u2019s move and he is the club\u2019s best signing going into the new season. He consistently punched above his weight at Basaksehir by creating a team greater than the sum of their parts. Besiktas have been quiet on the transfer front and are the big unknown this season. If Avci gets anywhere near the same out of the Black Eagles as he did at Basaksehir we are looking at title contenders \u2013 but will he be able to implement his system at short notice?&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Galatasaray&nbsp;</b>The favourites yet again. They lost Fernand\u00e3o in midfield but he has been replaced by Steven Nzonzi and they have added depth in most positions and rolled the dice in others. The Lions signed Jean Micha\u00ebl Seri (pictured) on loan from Fulham and fellow Cottager Ryan Babel also joined. The reigning champs also took a gamble on Emre Mor. There is a fine line between genius and madness. Mor is a ridiculously talented showman able to produce magic with his feet. But he has been his own worst enemy. The young winger has held himself back with his off the field antics but he will not be able to get away with that under Terim.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Trabzonspor&nbsp;</b>Dark horses this season. The Black Sea-based side are producing some of the best young talent in the country. Star attacking midfielder Yazici was sold to Lille but 19-year-old Abd\u00fclkadir \u00d6m\u00fcr is ready to step up. They have been savvy in the transfer market and busy winning hearts and minds with viral content campaigns \u2013 if you haven\u2019t watched their shirt release video then make sure you do so.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The catalysts for this youth movement was FFP and the<strong> </strong>lifting of the foreign player restrictions<strong> </strong>in 2015. The market had become distorted. Turkish players were given an unfair advantage as clubs were forced to pay over the odds for players based on their nationality instead of talent.</p> \n<p>Demand outweighed supply and Turkish players ended up on extortionate wages and then blocked the path for young talent. Super Lig clubs were lumbered with players no one outside the country would pay significant money to buy. The lifting of the restrictions resulted in players starting to be valued on talent rather than anything else. Domestic players were forced to improve in order to compete with the influx from abroad and with a more even playing field young players were given more of a chance.</p> \n<p>FFP has a lot of critics but as far as Turkey is concerned it is one of the best things to happen in years. Super Lig sides have had to become more accountable. It is no coincidence that in the three seasons before 2015 only \u20ac4.8m was made from the sale of Turkish players to the top-five European leagues while in the three years after that the figure was \u20ac75m. Turkish clubs have been forced into investing in scouting, development and giving young players a chance \u2013 and have benefited.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/15/hungary-football-olympic-success-jonathan-wilson-book\">How Hungary\u2019s stars left their football mark with Olympic success | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Turkey is teeming with talent and is only scratching the surface. The country has a population of 80 million with the youngest demographic in Uefa. There are millions of players, often from poor backgrounds, desperate to become the next star. And for the first time in years they are being given a chance.</p> \n<p>Ozan Kabak was 18-years-old and had played six months of first-team football for Galatasaray when Stuttgart paid \u20ac11m for him last January (Schalke went on to sign him for \u20ac16m over the summer).Lille purchased Yusuf Yazici from Trabzonspor for \u20ac16.5m this summer and then there was the case of Merih Demiral who Juventus snapped up for \u20ac18m last month.</p> \n<p>The case of Demiral also highlights a problem for Fenerbahce. A childhood fan of the club, Demiral rose through the youth ranks but felt so disenfranchised with his chances of breaking into the first team he left for the Portuguese third-tier three years ago.</p> \n<p>And this is the culture Fenerbahce want to change. Comolli has given the academy an overhaul, set up a scouting network, recruited coaches and installed a data and analysis department. He also brought in talent from the Premier League to oversee the operation, making the former Crystal Palace head of first-team recruitment analyst, Beri Pardo, the head of performance analysis.</p> \n<p>It seems to be working. Fenerbahce are nurturing some talented young players and have hired some of the best youth coaches in the country.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"352632ecba795ec857373ef4906689e9488ddce7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/352632ecba795ec857373ef4906689e9488ddce7/0_0_4282_2855/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ferdi Kadioglu of Fenerbahce surges past Real Madrid\u2019s Marcelo during their Audi Cup match in July 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ferdi Kadioglu of Fenerbahce surges past Real Madrid\u2019s Marcelo during their Audi Cup match in July 2019.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Soccrates Images/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Now they have to give them a chance. Recent history has not been that encouraging. The goalkeeping protege Berke Ozer was signed amid high expectations from Altinordu last summer but the 19-year-old made one appearance before being loaned out to Westerlo this summer.</p> \n<p>Another example is the 19-year-old wonderkid Ferdi Kadioglu, who turned down several offers to join Fenerbahce from NEC last season but despite already having a season of Eredivisie football under his belt he spent most of his time on the bench.</p> \n<p>For the culture at Fenerbahce to change players need to believe there is a pathway from the academy and here Ersun Yanal is in a tough spot. Managers rarely last long in Turkey and while the club has long-term goals, Yanal has his job to worry about.</p> \n<p>It is expected he will strike a balance and we will see more young players this season and the number of youngsters coming through should then grow in the coming years. In 2019-20 Kadioglu and the 21-year-old goalkeeper Altay Bayindir given more games.</p> \n<p>In order to progress Fenerbahce may have to suffer in the short term. But no side are leaps and bounds above another. The title race has gone down to the wire for the past few seasons and that trend is likely to continue. Do not write anybody off.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The phrase \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d seems to sum up the state of Turkish football as the season approaches. The Super Lig giants are all in transition as financial fair play has forced clubs to address mounting debts and become more sustainable. It will benefit the league but in the short term most clubs will suffer. Now for the good news: the league is finally producing \u2013 and relying on \u2013 young, Turkish talent. A lot of it. Galatasaray pipped Basaksehir to the Super Lig title on the penultimate week last season. Besiktas were involved in the title race until the final three weeks but it is a tale of four clubs in Istanbul and last season it was Fenerbahce\u2019s plight that provided the biggest story. They finished sixth but it could have been a lot worse. They spent much of the season in the bottom half and were briefly involved in a relegation battle. There has been a lot of schadenfreude around from rival fans, as expected, but it is important to point out Galatasaray also finished sixth in 2015-16 and they were champions two years later. Fenerbahce have been at the bottom and are on their way up again. Last year Ali Koc, the heir of the wealthiest family in Turkey, replaced the club\u2019s longest-serving president Aziz Yildirim after 20 years in charge but by that point the club had been run into the ground. Debt had spiralled out of control to an astonishing \u20ac621m (\u00a3574m). Fenerbahce had faltered where most other Turkish clubs do. Several of the major teams are run on a \u201cfoundation club\u201d model \u2013 much like Real Madrid and Barcelona \u2013 with thousands of members. The problem with that is the fans expect silverware all the time. Club presidents typically get three-year terms and focus on the here and now rather than the future, leading to endemic short-termism. Koc may be rich but he has his hands tied with regards to using his fortune to fund the club. Koc is not the owner \u2013 the members are the owners \u2013 and has FFP to contend with. And in a break with Super Lig tradition he has decided to concentrate on the future of the club. He has started to work on the debt, created a sustainable transfer policy and focused on youth development. It is a risky strategy in a league that does not do patience. It is also a brave move considering it could be his successors, rather than himself, who benefit. \u201cThe academy is very important to us,\u201dKoc says. \u201cIt\u2019s our priority to produce talent. There are talented players emerging from all over Turkey and we cannot ignore them.\u201d Koc brought in Damien Comolli as the sporting director and gave him the freedom to decide all the key decisions, including recruitment and the academy. The Frenchman has made 10 signings, spending just \u20ac10.4m (\u00a39.5m) bringing in Max Kruse on a free, the club legend Emre Belozoglu and Mathias J\u00f8rgensen from Huddersfield, as well as a number of proven Super Lig players. The key thing is the Yellow Canaries are \u20ac5.7m in profit after selling the 19-year-old Eljif Elmas for \u20ac16m to Napoli. And it is the focus on exciting young talent that is the trend not only at Fenerbahce but the league in general. The catalysts for this youth movement was FFP and the lifting of the foreign player restrictions in 2015. The market had become distorted. Turkish players were given an unfair advantage as clubs were forced to pay over the odds for players based on their nationality instead of talent. Demand outweighed supply and Turkish players ended up on extortionate wages and then blocked the path for young talent. Super Lig clubs were lumbered with players no one outside the country would pay significant money to buy. The lifting of the restrictions resulted in players starting to be valued on talent rather than anything else. Domestic players were forced to improve in order to compete with the influx from abroad and with a more even playing field young players were given more of a chance. FFP has a lot of critics but as far as Turkey is concerned it is one of the best things to happen in years. Super Lig sides have had to become more accountable. It is no coincidence that in the three seasons before 2015 only \u20ac4.8m was made from the sale of Turkish players to the top-five European leagues while in the three years after that the figure was \u20ac75m. Turkish clubs have been forced into investing in scouting, development and giving young players a chance \u2013 and have benefited. Turkey is teeming with talent and is only scratching the surface. The country has a population of 80 million with the youngest demographic in Uefa. There are millions of players, often from poor backgrounds, desperate to become the next star. And for the first time in years they are being given a chance. Ozan Kabak was 18-years-old and had played six months of first-team football for Galatasaray when Stuttgart paid \u20ac11m for him last January (Schalke went on to sign him for \u20ac16m over the summer).Lille purchased Yusuf Yazici from Trabzonspor for \u20ac16.5m this summer and then there was the case of Merih Demiral who Juventus snapped up for \u20ac18m last month. The case of Demiral also highlights a problem for Fenerbahce. A childhood fan of the club, Demiral rose through the youth ranks but felt so disenfranchised with his chances of breaking into the first team he left for the Portuguese third-tier three years ago. And this is the culture Fenerbahce want to change. Comolli has given the academy an overhaul, set up a scouting network, recruited coaches and installed a data and analysis department. He also brought in talent from the Premier League to oversee the operation, making the former Crystal Palace head of first-team recruitment analyst, Beri Pardo, the head of performance analysis. It seems to be working. Fenerbahce are nurturing some talented young players and have hired some of the best youth coaches in the country. Now they have to give them a chance. Recent history has not been that encouraging. The goalkeeping protege Berke Ozer was signed amid high expectations from Altinordu last summer but the 19-year-old made one appearance before being loaned out to Westerlo this summer. Another example is the 19-year-old wonderkid Ferdi Kadioglu, who turned down several offers to join Fenerbahce from NEC last season but despite already having a season of Eredivisie football under his belt he spent most of his time on the bench. For the culture at Fenerbahce to change players need to believe there is a pathway from the academy and here Ersun Yanal is in a tough spot. Managers rarely last long in Turkey and while the club has long-term goals, Yanal has his job to worry about. It is expected he will strike a balance and we will see more young players this season and the number of youngsters coming through should then grow in the coming years. In 2019-20 Kadioglu and the 21-year-old goalkeeper Altay Bayindir given more games. In order to progress Fenerbahce may have to suffer in the short term. But no side are leaps and bounds above another. The title race has gone down to the wire for the past few seasons and that trend is likely to continue. Do not write anybody off.",

There had been crowded costume scenes before, but none with the same historical reality: hundreds on screen in the full dress of 1860, as individual and complete on those in the far background as in foreground closeup. The women are laced into bodices laden with ornament and jewels, atop tent-sized crinolines; their hairstyles are often accurately unflattering. Yet nobody looks conscious of being in period costume; they are just wearing extraordinary clothes that shape them into the postures and gestures of another time.</p> <p>Piero Tosi, who has died aged 92, was the Italian designer who created that time-travel effect. He could produce characterful modern costumes \u2013 pitiful singlets and thin blousons for peasant workers in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/dec/12/artsfeatures\" title=\"\">Rocco and His Brothers</a>(1960) \u2013 but his honorary Oscar in 2013 (by which time he had been nominated five times) was for his historical imagination.</p> <p>The cinema had never seen Tosi\u2019s standard of re-creation, executed after 1960 by his longterm collaborator Umberto Tirelli, who collected antique garments to study and established a company to replicate them. Each ensemble was unique \u2013 they made a single gown for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2011/dec/08/claudia-cardinale-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Claudia Cardinale</a> to wear during the five months spent shooting that ball; it had days off for cleaning and repair.

But the boy secretly loved theatre, reading Shakespeare and inventing costumes. He loved Hollywood movies, too, and his favourite designer was Travis Banton, to whose decadent fur and lace for Marlene Dietrich Tosi paid homage in The Damned (1969) and Liliana Cavani\u2019s The Night Porter (1974). The boy\u2019s artistic talent won him a place in Florence\u2019s applied arts institute for artisans, the Porta Romana.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In The Leopard women are laced into bodices laden with ornament and jewels, atop tent-size crinolines</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At barely 20 he helped with costumes for a local theatre production, but his break came through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/15/franco-zeffirelli-obituary\" title=\"\">Franco Zeffirelli</a>, also an art student from Florence, although at a different college; they had known each other for years.

In the same year Tosi\u2019s aunt took him to the Venice film festival (he had never been out of Florence, and he never went to another festival, even when his own work was in competition) where he saw Visconti\u2019s La Terra Trema and knew he wanted to make movies.</p> <p>That meant moving to Rome, where he, Zeffirelli and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/may/16/guardianobituaries.filmnews\" title=\"\">Mauro Bolognini</a> (later a director who commissioned Tosi) shared an apartment, the rowdy centre of their creative circle. Tosi worked on stage productions for Visconti, who came to trust his sure taste and never-satisfied research. His first film for Visconti was Bellissima (1951), starring Anna Magnani as a working-class woman venturing into Cinecitt\u00e0 studios; the contrast between her simple cotton frock and the movie people\u2019s cool adds pathos to the comedy.

The Damned demanded slithery crepe de chine when most silks in stock were hard and crisp; seaside outfits in Death in Venice had to be of linen, a fibre superseded by cotton or synthetics. Italian artisans could provide what could not be found, but it took time and Tosi\u2019s exacting supervision.</p> <p>He loved the search, and, when Visconti intended to film Proust\u2019s \u00c0 la Recherche du Temps Perdu, Tosi went to Paris to track down descendants of its characters\u2019 originals, hoping for family pictures.

      "bodyText": "The grand ball that ends Luchino Visconti\u2019s The Leopard (1963) was unprecedented in the movies. There had been crowded costume scenes before, but none with the same historical reality: hundreds on screen in the full dress of 1860, as individual and complete on those in the far background as in foreground closeup. The women are laced into bodices laden with ornament and jewels, atop tent-sized crinolines; their hairstyles are often accurately unflattering. Yet nobody looks conscious of being in period costume; they are just wearing extraordinary clothes that shape them into the postures and gestures of another time. Piero Tosi, who has died aged 92, was the Italian designer who created that time-travel effect. He could produce characterful modern costumes \u2013 pitiful singlets and thin blousons for peasant workers in Rocco and His Brothers(1960) \u2013 but his honorary Oscar in 2013 (by which time he had been nominated five times) was for his historical imagination. The cinema had never seen Tosi\u2019s standard of re-creation, executed after 1960 by his longterm collaborator Umberto Tirelli, who collected antique garments to study and established a company to replicate them. Each ensemble was unique \u2013 they made a single gown for Claudia Cardinale to wear during the five months spent shooting that ball; it had days off for cleaning and repair. Tosi influenced and trained a new generation of costume designers whose forte was the past, including Gabriella Pescucci and Milena Canonero. He researched through art, especially conversation pieces and genre paintings of the 18th and 19th centuries, since an artist showed both the architecture of clothes and how they were worn \u2013 the attitude, gait and gestures that expressed class and gender. Tosi\u2019s favourite recreation was people-watching; he could construct a whole life out of a T-shirt. Only non-fashion photographs inspired him, and his most remembered costume, Silvana Mangano\u2019s walking suit for Death in Venice (1971), evolved from an early colour photograph of Visconti\u2019s mother. Tosi came out of the artisan traditions of his birthplace, Florence, where his father taught him the family business of metalwork. But the boy secretly loved theatre, reading Shakespeare and inventing costumes. He loved Hollywood movies, too, and his favourite designer was Travis Banton, to whose decadent fur and lace for Marlene Dietrich Tosi paid homage in The Damned (1969) and Liliana Cavani\u2019s The Night Porter (1974). The boy\u2019s artistic talent won him a place in Florence\u2019s applied arts institute for artisans, the Porta Romana. At barely 20 he helped with costumes for a local theatre production, but his break came through Franco Zeffirelli, also an art student from Florence, although at a different college; they had known each other for years. Visconti came to the city in 1949 to stage Troilus and Cressida for a music festival, and Zeffirelli, then assistant to Visconti, got Tosi a beginner\u2019s job on the costumes. In the same year Tosi\u2019s aunt took him to the Venice film festival (he had never been out of Florence, and he never went to another festival, even when his own work was in competition) where he saw Visconti\u2019s La Terra Trema and knew he wanted to make movies. That meant moving to Rome, where he, Zeffirelli and Mauro Bolognini (later a director who commissioned Tosi) shared an apartment, the rowdy centre of their creative circle. Tosi worked on stage productions for Visconti, who came to trust his sure taste and never-satisfied research. His first film for Visconti was Bellissima (1951), starring Anna Magnani as a working-class woman venturing into Cinecitt\u00e0 studios; the contrast between her simple cotton frock and the movie people\u2019s cool adds pathos to the comedy. Tosi then worked for Visconti on 12 films. Modern realism was economic with cloth, but from Senso (1954) to L\u2019Innocente (1976) Visconti also made huge-scale period productions on budgets that fluctuated sharply, sometimes during shooting (The Leopard\u2019s funding dwindled from day to day) and demanded materials that were out of fashion, or no longer manufactured, even in textile-conscious Italy. Visconti could find authentic locations and dress them with genuine antiques, but, other than an occasional original accessory, Tosi had to create voluminous costumes from scratch, searching warehouses for outmoded fabrics and trimmings. The Damned demanded slithery crepe de chine when most silks in stock were hard and crisp; seaside outfits in Death in Venice had to be of linen, a fibre superseded by cotton or synthetics. Italian artisans could provide what could not be found, but it took time and Tosi\u2019s exacting supervision. He loved the search, and, when Visconti intended to film Proust\u2019s \u00c0 la Recherche du Temps Perdu, Tosi went to Paris to track down descendants of its characters\u2019 originals, hoping for family pictures. Proust was Tosi\u2019s ideal challenge, a writer who knew how a pair of shoes were both character and narrative. To Tosi\u2019s regret, the film was never made. He designed for Zeffirelli \u2013 La Traviata (1982) and Storia di una Capinera (1993), set in Tosi\u2019s beloved 1860s \u2013 and for Pier Paolo Pasolini an ethnographic Medea (1969) in which Maria Callas clanked with metal plaques like something out of his childhood. Federico Fellini longed to work with him; however Tosi could not abide Fellini\u2019s chaos and the closest they came was Tosi improvising wild makeups (unusually for a designer, he liked styling hair and painting faces) for Satyricon(1970). His Oscar may have been for period pieces, but, to appreciate his skill, look at Magnani in Bellissima in an underslip that elevates her ungirded figure from comic to tragic, or Sophia Loren in very little lingerie, craftily sculptured and layered, in Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow (1963); the image sold the film. In 1988, Tosi began to teach and coach at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome, which later helped organise exhibitions of his costumes in New York, Rome and Florence. Outside work, which he seldom was, Tosi was totally private; his personal life never became public knowledge. \u2022 Piero Tosi, costume designer, born 10 April 1927; died 10 August 2019",

Its main gig is the National Prayer Breakfast (NPB), an annual invitation-only festival of speeches and meetings that has been addressed by every president since Dwight D Eisenhower.

The Family\u2019s star witness is Jeff Sharlet, the author of two books about his brief period as a resident of the pillared mansion in Virginia where the Fellowship hosts impressionable and (with the honourable exception of Sharlet) discreet young men.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ebf9b2e33eae60478afc94bb379b23062bc4b772\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebf9b2e33eae60478afc94bb379b23062bc4b772/397_0_638_638/500.jpg\" alt=\"David Rysdahl plays Jeff Sharlet in The Family\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Rysdahl plays Jeff Sharlet in The Family.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Enhanced by dramatic reconstructions, the opener tells Sharlet\u2019s story, and it is here that The Family looks most like a febrile expos\u00e9 of sinister deviancy, \u00e0 la <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/24/wild-wild-country-netflix-cult-sex-noa-maxwell-bhagwan-shree-rajneesh-commune-childhood\">Wild Wild Country</a>. Everything is shadowy and creepy, all conversations revolve around glassy-eyed invocations of Jesus, and there is one scene in which Sharlet undergoes a slightly violent initiation rite. Then an elder visits and holds a disturbing seminar that sets out what is really at play. It is made clear to Sharlet that the gang he has joined is all about power, based on a Bible reading that sees Jesus \u2013 and, in the Fellowship\u2019s reading of its favourite scripture story, murderous home-wrecker David \u2013 as a sort of original alpha male, lending legitimacy to men who believe they have been chosen to be in charge. The faith and devotion are perfunctory, a means to an end, an excuse.</p> <p>The Family\u2019s focus on the Fellowship hides what is really a portrait of the whole \u201cChristian\u201d right wing in the US \u2013 as well as the type of (white) man who has thoroughly infected western postwar politics.

      "bodyText": "A clandestine religious sect secretly controls the US government! In an age when we are all grasping for outlandish solutions to what\u2019s gone wrong, it is an unbeatable premise for a non-fiction Netflix five-parter. Of course, The Family doesn\u2019t really demonstrate any such thing \u2013 but it does tell us a lot about a particular kind of elite mindset that has caused an awful lot of damage. The series profiles an American evangelical Christian organisation, sometimes dubbed \u201cthe Family\u201d but more often known as the Fellowship \u2013 which presumably was felt to lack the connotations of death cults and organised crime that make for a juicy documentary title. For decades, the Fellowship was overseen by the mysterious Doug Coe: a series of amusingly Zelig-esque photographs of him lurking smoothly behind US presidents and foreign leaders confirms Coe (who did Netflix\u2019s lawyers a favour by dying in 2017) as the most powerful guy you never heard of. The Fellowship has two signature moves. Its main gig is the National Prayer Breakfast (NPB), an annual invitation-only festival of speeches and meetings that has been addressed by every president since Dwight D Eisenhower. If you have measured out the Trump years in startling gaffes, the NPB is the one where Donald irrelevantly slagged off The Apprentice for tanking in the ratings. That was crass because the event is so reverently esteemed: The Family points out that it has achieved this status without most people, including many attendees, knowing who actually runs it. Even less is known about the luxurious residential properties in which politicians of the present or future are invited to live communally, helping each other to find Jesus. The Family\u2019s star witness is Jeff Sharlet, the author of two books about his brief period as a resident of the pillared mansion in Virginia where the Fellowship hosts impressionable and (with the honourable exception of Sharlet) discreet young men. Enhanced by dramatic reconstructions, the opener tells Sharlet\u2019s story, and it is here that The Family looks most like a febrile expos\u00e9 of sinister deviancy, \u00e0 la Wild Wild Country. Everything is shadowy and creepy, all conversations revolve around glassy-eyed invocations of Jesus, and there is one scene in which Sharlet undergoes a slightly violent initiation rite. Then an elder visits and holds a disturbing seminar that sets out what is really at play. It is made clear to Sharlet that the gang he has joined is all about power, based on a Bible reading that sees Jesus \u2013 and, in the Fellowship\u2019s reading of its favourite scripture story, murderous home-wrecker David \u2013 as a sort of original alpha male, lending legitimacy to men who believe they have been chosen to be in charge. The faith and devotion are perfunctory, a means to an end, an excuse. The Family\u2019s focus on the Fellowship hides what is really a portrait of the whole \u201cChristian\u201d right wing in the US \u2013 as well as the type of (white) man who has thoroughly infected western postwar politics. A stale whiff of viciously inadequate masculinity hangs over the whole show, from the young Fellows\u2019 awkwardly enforced celibacy to the episode that sets out how Fellowship missionaries have been sent to less developed countries that might be vulnerable to campaigns against gay rights. As an LGBT activist in Romania puts it: \u201cThey have a purpose in their life now. To hate you.\u201d Episode two outlines how Fellowship-affiliated Congressmen have been exposed as adulterers, and therefore huge hypocrites who don\u2019t follow their own moral teachings, yet have brazenly continued their careers with Fellowship support \u2013 because public shaming didn\u2019t dent their sense of entitlement to power. The Family\u2019s biggest lesson is probably how that entitlement has evolved. Coe is a key figure, not for any big policy wins \u2013 exactly what direct influence he had on US presidents remains fuzzy \u2013 but for the way he went about his business. He made the Fellowship non-hierarchical, publicity-shy and thus untouchable. The National Prayer Breakfast \u2013 really a giant corporate lobbying event \u2013 didn\u2019t have to advertise who organised it, so it didn\u2019t. C Street, the Washington townhouse that claimed to be a church for tax purposes, where Congressmen have been allowed to live at bargain rents, didn\u2019t have to tell anyone who the inhabitants were, so it didn\u2019t.

      "bodyText": "Sol Campbell had waited a long time for a chance in management but his debut job in charge of Macclesfield Town has ended after only eight months. The former England, Tottenham and Arsenal defender\u2019s departure was \u201cby mutual consent\u201d and comes with the League Two club facing a winding-up order after embroilment in a financial crisis which has sometimes seen payment of Campbell\u2019s salary delayed. Although there were reportedly tensions between the manager and Macclesfield\u2019s owners, Amar and Bashar Alkadhi, the 44-year-old performed a minor miracle to keep the team in the Football League last season and, outwardly at least, the split was cordial. \u201cThis has been conducted in the most amicable of ways and there has been total transparency between the club and Sol,\u201d said Macclesfield in a statement on Thursday. \u201cSol\u2019s passion, drive and football knowledge will always be remembered at the Moss Rose with fondness. \u201cWe would like to thank Sol for his time at the club \u2013 not only in helping us retain our League Two status but also for installing a winning mentality.\u201d In turn, Campbell, the holder of 73 England caps, said: \u201cMacclesfield Town provided me with a fantastic learning curve which I am truly grateful for.\u201d That term seems somewhat euphemistic when viewed in the context of the financial problems which resulted in not only the manager but his assistant, Hermann Hreidarsson, and their players repeatedly being kept waiting for their wages. Such delays recently prompted six former Macclesfield players to initiate a winding-up order against the club with HM Revenue and Customs having now taken over that petition before a High Court hearing on September 11. Campbell, this season\u2019s first managerial casualty, assumed control last November, kicking off with a narrow Checkatrade Trophy defeat at Newcastle United at a time when his new team were seven points adrift at the foot of League Two. Under his management the club collected 31 points from 25 League games, securing survival with a 1-1 draw at home to Cambridge United on last season\u2019s final day. Before signing up for the challenge in Cheshire, Campbell \u2013 whose now former side have made a strong start to the new season \u2013 described the lack of BAME managers in English football as a \u201csad indictment\u201d of the game, explaining he had made numerous unsuccessful job applications before eventually joining Macclesfield. His departure leaves five BAME managers in England\u2019s top four divisions: Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo (Wolves), Sabri Lamouchi (Nottingham Forest), Darren Moore (Doncaster), Keith Curle (Northampton) and Dino Maamria (Stevenage). \u201cI\u2019m slightly shocked about Sol going,\u201d said Curle. \u201cI thought he did a fantastic job. Considering the obstacles facing him, to keep Macclesfield up was remarkable.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A summons for jury service forces a student to reassess her father\u2019s nurturing skills and the values of the British society in which they live, while a friendship between two schoolgirls reveals the murky depths of Nigeria\u2019s political history. Jenna Mahale\u2019s Packed Lunch and Arenike Adebajo\u2019s The Hyacinth Girls are among six stories in contention for the 2019 Guardian 4th Estate short story prize, now in its fourth year.</p> <p>The all-female shortlist was selected from nearly 200 entries. Both Mahale and Adebajo hold a fine balance between the personal and the political, as does Jameen Kaur in Once We Were Warriors, which explores the pride and the pain of a Sikh family struggling to deal with a drug-addicted son.</p> <p>The stories\u2019 subjects span ages and genders. In 50 Rose Tower, Oluchi Ezeh captures the dangerous boredom of the long summer holidays in a touchingly comic story of a gaggle of prepubescent boys on a London council estate, while Sonia Hope takes an elegant period ride with a record-collecting Jamaican bus driver in The Cat by The Incredible Jimmy Smith. One of only two contenders to be set outside the UK, Kandace Siobhan Walker\u2019s Deep Heart spins a magical yarn around young sisters on an island where nothing is as it seems.</p> <p>Sponsored by the Guardian and publisher 4th Estate, the BAME prize is open to black, Asian and minority ethnic writers, who have been historically neglected by UK publishers. The winner will be announced on 10 September.</p> <h2><strong>50 Rose Tower by Oluchi Ezeh</strong></h2> <blockquote> <p>The summer before our family fell apart, a legend started on our estate. I was ten at the time, and like every other ten year old, all I wanted to do was spend summer riding around on my bike at the park near our house. The climbing frames in the park were rusty and completely discoloured \u2013 unless whoever built them had intended brown to be the colour of childhood excitement \u2013 so it didn\u2019t appeal to many parents as an after-school site. Also, I\u2019m pretty sure that drug dealers used to hang out there but I never met any, so how much of a presence could they have been really, you know?</p> <p>\u201cHooligans,\u201d my mother would say, shaking her head as the plantain simmered in the frying pan. She was cooking three things at once, as per usual, and the plantain was always the loudest, though no match for her voice. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want to be, abi Marcus? One of those ye-ye boys who hangs around this place, anyhow?\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know what a ye-ye boy was; man was really just out here trying to ride his bike with his friends, but mum wasn\u2019t having it. In the end, the only reason she let me go on these apparent daytime terror rides was because of Omar.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>What the judges said:</strong> \u201cThis playful coming of age story captures the simultaneous boredom and excitement of the school summer holidays through the eyes of 10-year-old Marcus, our cheeky, wise narrator. A tale of legends and love, and how these two things are twisted by time, 50 Rose Tower is a refreshing and poignant spin on urban boyhood.\u201d <strong>Niki Chang, literary agent</strong></p> <h2><strong>Packed Lunch by Jenna Mahale</strong></h2> <blockquote> <p>The night before I was due to begin jury duty for the first time, I asked my dad to help me make a sandwich to take with me in the morning. We had argued about something recently, though I can\u2019t remember what. It was impossible to keep track.</p> <p>So when I asked him to help me make the sandwich, I was partly extending an olive branch, but partly just seeking a non-hostile interaction with my father.</p> <p>My mum would always stock the house with the same Polish rye bread, packaged in orange and white with chleb polski scrawled across in black. Toasted, it is crispy, airy, and flavourful. Untoasted, it is spongy and tastes a bit like baking powder. This is the main issue with turning it into a sandwich.</p> <p>My dad knew exactly what to do. He diligently butters both slices, adding just a smear of English mustard. Next, he folds some pastrami onto the bread. Then, a few thin slices of cheddar cheese. And it has to be thin, you don\u2019t want to overpower the flavour of the meat, he said. Then, he slides a large jar of pickles out of the fridge.</p> <p>I balked. I hated pickles.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>What the judges said: </strong>\u201cI loved this eccentric, stylish gem. It gripped me wholeheartedly. I was so impressed by the beautiful crispness of the prose and the feeling that every sentence had been carefully shaped, considered, evaluated. The narrative was brave in the range of material it included \u2013 culinary delights, familial conflict, fraught senses of identity and selfhood \u2013 and it also somehow managed to be both fleet-footed and wise. I want to read much, much more by this writer!\u201d <strong>Michael Donkor, author</strong></p> <h2><strong>The Cat by The Incredible Jimmy Smith by Sonia Hope</strong></h2> <blockquote> <p>1964: the year his marriage ended. The year his record stopped spinning, the needle in his groove lifted haltingly, and with a snap returned his tone arm to its cradle.</p> <p>He had never wanted Marilyn. Not her prim-girl curls hot-combed into place on her head. Not her full-moon face so earnest that the sight of it irritated him. He hadn\u2019t wanted to hear, I\u2019m eight weeks gone! We have to marry, the corners of her mouth drooping. He hadn\u2019t wanted the ceremony in Hackney Town Hall, his signature and hers in the register (but he had wanted the tonic mohair suit that made him look like a prince). He hadn\u2019t wanted to live in rented rooms above a shop, with Marilyn asking, But where will the baby sleep? He hadn\u2019t wanted any of this. He had come to England to find work, to do something with his life, to send photographs of his handsome Jamaican self back home to his Grandma, make her proud. Dear Granny, I hope that when these few lines reach you they will find you well ...</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>What the judges said:</strong> \u201cLook what can be done over just four pages! A consistently surprising piece of short fiction which zips along at thrilling speed while still offering a convincing and determinedly unsettling take on the \u2018immigrant narrative\u2019. Its bitter, jolting ending is a particular stroke of genius. Compelling stuff by a writer of significant talent and promise.\u201d <strong>MD</strong></p> <h2><strong>Once We Were Warriors by Jameen Kaur</strong></h2> <blockquote> <p>\u2018Check the time and date properly on the ticket. I don\u2019t want us getting a fine. I\u2019m still paying off your brother\u2019s overdraft,\u2019 said Mum, as she pulled herself out of the car.</p> <p>I was pleased they had come. When they called this morning, I thought they were calling to cancel. It being a Saturday and we all knew what usually kicked off on a Friday night. The police were well versed to the goings-on. But here they were. \u2018This is a Bengali area - Tower Hamlets. You know, there were race riots here,\u2019 I said.</p> <p>\u2018We had them too, in Southall, when you were little; Dad was there \u2026 they had to board up the shops,\u2019 said Mum.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>What the judges said: </strong>\u201cA story that moves elegantly between humour and pathos, exploring ideas of masculinity, family, colonialism and tradition and the damage wrought by addiction. The family relationships are beautifully drawn and the dialogue is compelling. Above all, we were impressed by the way the author succeeds in creating rich layers of narrative within the confines of a short story.\u201d <strong>Helen Garnons-Williams, publisher at 4th Estate</strong></p> <h2><strong>The Hyacinth Girls by Arenike Adebajo</strong></h2> <blockquote> <p>When I met \u1eccl\u00e1\u00edd\u00e9, I was on punishment duty. Nabilah\u2019s doing. She was being particularly vindictive after we stopped speaking; becoming a prefect had gone to her head and she\u2019d banished me to the field to cut weeds. The elephant grass was thick, itchy against my calves as I thwacked at stalks furiously. The cutlass was too blunt. Wet ground underfoot sucked at my trainers, spat mud up my legs and spattered the hem of my skirt.

      "bodyText": "A summons for jury service forces a student to reassess her father\u2019s nurturing skills and the values of the British society in which they live, while a friendship between two schoolgirls reveals the murky depths of Nigeria\u2019s political history. Jenna Mahale\u2019s Packed Lunch and Arenike Adebajo\u2019s The Hyacinth Girls are among six stories in contention for the 2019 Guardian 4th Estate short story prize, now in its fourth year. The all-female shortlist was selected from nearly 200 entries. Both Mahale and Adebajo hold a fine balance between the personal and the political, as does Jameen Kaur in Once We Were Warriors, which explores the pride and the pain of a Sikh family struggling to deal with a drug-addicted son. The stories\u2019 subjects span ages and genders. In 50 Rose Tower, Oluchi Ezeh captures the dangerous boredom of the long summer holidays in a touchingly comic story of a gaggle of prepubescent boys on a London council estate, while Sonia Hope takes an elegant period ride with a record-collecting Jamaican bus driver in The Cat by The Incredible Jimmy Smith. One of only two contenders to be set outside the UK, Kandace Siobhan Walker\u2019s Deep Heart spins a magical yarn around young sisters on an island where nothing is as it seems. Sponsored by the Guardian and publisher 4th Estate, the BAME prize is open to black, Asian and minority ethnic writers, who have been historically neglected by UK publishers. The winner will be announced on 10 September. 50 Rose Tower by Oluchi Ezeh The summer before our family fell apart, a legend started on our estate. I was ten at the time, and like every other ten year old, all I wanted to do was spend summer riding around on my bike at the park near our house. The climbing frames in the park were rusty and completely discoloured \u2013 unless whoever built them had intended brown to be the colour of childhood excitement \u2013 so it didn\u2019t appeal to many parents as an after-school site. Also, I\u2019m pretty sure that drug dealers used to hang out there but I never met any, so how much of a presence could they have been really, you know? \u201cHooligans,\u201d my mother would say, shaking her head as the plantain simmered in the frying pan. She was cooking three things at once, as per usual, and the plantain was always the loudest, though no match for her voice. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want to be, abi Marcus? One of those ye-ye boys who hangs around this place, anyhow?\u201d I didn\u2019t know what a ye-ye boy was; man was really just out here trying to ride his bike with his friends, but mum wasn\u2019t having it. In the end, the only reason she let me go on these apparent daytime terror rides was because of Omar. What the judges said: \u201cThis playful coming of age story captures the simultaneous boredom and excitement of the school summer holidays through the eyes of 10-year-old Marcus, our cheeky, wise narrator. A tale of legends and love, and how these two things are twisted by time, 50 Rose Tower is a refreshing and poignant spin on urban boyhood.\u201d Niki Chang, literary agent Packed Lunch by Jenna Mahale The night before I was due to begin jury duty for the first time, I asked my dad to help me make a sandwich to take with me in the morning. We had argued about something recently, though I can\u2019t remember what. It was impossible to keep track. So when I asked him to help me make the sandwich, I was partly extending an olive branch, but partly just seeking a non-hostile interaction with my father. My mum would always stock the house with the same Polish rye bread, packaged in orange and white with chleb polski scrawled across in black. Toasted, it is crispy, airy, and flavourful. Untoasted, it is spongy and tastes a bit like baking powder. This is the main issue with turning it into a sandwich. My dad knew exactly what to do. He diligently butters both slices, adding just a smear of English mustard. Next, he folds some pastrami onto the bread. Then, a few thin slices of cheddar cheese. And it has to be thin, you don\u2019t want to overpower the flavour of the meat, he said. Then, he slides a large jar of pickles out of the fridge. I balked. I hated pickles. What the judges said: \u201cI loved this eccentric, stylish gem. It gripped me wholeheartedly. I was so impressed by the beautiful crispness of the prose and the feeling that every sentence had been carefully shaped, considered, evaluated. The narrative was brave in the range of material it included \u2013 culinary delights, familial conflict, fraught senses of identity and selfhood \u2013 and it also somehow managed to be both fleet-footed and wise. I want to read much, much more by this writer!\u201d Michael Donkor, author The Cat by The Incredible Jimmy Smith by Sonia Hope 1964: the year his marriage ended. The year his record stopped spinning, the needle in his groove lifted haltingly, and with a snap returned his tone arm to its cradle. He had never wanted Marilyn. Not her prim-girl curls hot-combed into place on her head. Not her full-moon face so earnest that the sight of it irritated him. He hadn\u2019t wanted to hear, I\u2019m eight weeks gone! We have to marry, the corners of her mouth drooping. He hadn\u2019t wanted the ceremony in Hackney Town Hall, his signature and hers in the register (but he had wanted the tonic mohair suit that made him look like a prince). He hadn\u2019t wanted to live in rented rooms above a shop, with Marilyn asking, But where will the baby sleep? He hadn\u2019t wanted any of this. He had come to England to find work, to do something with his life, to send photographs of his handsome Jamaican self back home to his Grandma, make her proud. Dear Granny, I hope that when these few lines reach you they will find you well ... What the judges said: \u201cLook what can be done over just four pages! A consistently surprising piece of short fiction which zips along at thrilling speed while still offering a convincing and determinedly unsettling take on the \u2018immigrant narrative\u2019. Its bitter, jolting ending is a particular stroke of genius. Compelling stuff by a writer of significant talent and promise.\u201d MD Once We Were Warriors by Jameen Kaur \u2018Check the time and date properly on the ticket. I don\u2019t want us getting a fine. I\u2019m still paying off your brother\u2019s overdraft,\u2019 said Mum, as she pulled herself out of the car. I was pleased they had come. When they called this morning, I thought they were calling to cancel. It being a Saturday and we all knew what usually kicked off on a Friday night. The police were well versed to the goings-on. But here they were. \u2018This is a Bengali area - Tower Hamlets. You know, there were race riots here,\u2019 I said. \u2018We had them too, in Southall, when you were little; Dad was there \u2026 they had to board up the shops,\u2019 said Mum. What the judges said: \u201cA story that moves elegantly between humour and pathos, exploring ideas of masculinity, family, colonialism and tradition and the damage wrought by addiction. The family relationships are beautifully drawn and the dialogue is compelling. Above all, we were impressed by the way the author succeeds in creating rich layers of narrative within the confines of a short story.\u201d Helen Garnons-Williams, publisher at 4th Estate The Hyacinth Girls by Arenike Adebajo When I met \u1eccl\u00e1\u00edd\u00e9, I was on punishment duty. Nabilah\u2019s doing. She was being particularly vindictive after we stopped speaking; becoming a prefect had gone to her head and she\u2019d banished me to the field to cut weeds. The elephant grass was thick, itchy against my calves as I thwacked at stalks furiously. The cutlass was too blunt. Wet ground underfoot sucked at my trainers, spat mud up my legs and spattered the hem of my skirt. I straightened up, and peered at the school building behind me, stark white against clouds that threatened showers. My classmates would be in the canteen by now, gossiping over fried rice, cool in the air conditioning. Taking a water-warped book and an apple from my satchel, I moved towards the shade of a flame tree. \u2018Aren\u2019t you on punishment?\u2019 A girl was looking down at me, arms crossed, a pink chit crumpled in one hand. I shrugged and nodded upwards at the chit. \u2018What did you do?\u2019 \u2018Nothing! Mrs Adeyemi sent me out after I fell asleep in English.\u2019 She stooped to pick up the discarded cutlass, gingerly pinching the blade between her fingers. \u2018Isn\u2019t this like a health and safety risk?\u2019 What the judges said: \u201cA deceptively familiar story of adolescent friendships and fallings-out among a group of Nigerian schoolgirls is awash with mysterious undercurrents: how did \u1eccl\u00e1\u00edd\u00e9\u2019s pastor stepfather really die?

It also solves two major mysteries in the new Star Wars trilogy: why Rey is so powerful with the Force and how she ended up in Jakku in the first place. Any child genetically related to Luke and descended from Darth Vader would be multi-midichlorian-tastic. And Chuck Wendig\u2019s in-canon Aftermath novels have previously revealed that the Emperor placed a secret observatory on Jakku, located conveniently in a place called the \u201cPlaintive Hand plateau\u201d.

The idea is that Palpatine cloned Rey from Luke Skywalker\u2019s severed hand, after recovering it following the Jedi knight\u2019s disastrous battle with Darth Vader in The Empire Strikes Back. It also solves two major mysteries in the new Star Wars trilogy: why Rey is so powerful with the Force and how she ended up in Jakku in the first place. Any child genetically related to Luke and descended from Darth Vader would be multi-midichlorian-tastic. And Chuck Wendig\u2019s in-canon Aftermath novels have previously revealed that the Emperor placed a secret observatory on Jakku, located conveniently in a place called the \u201cPlaintive Hand plateau\u201d. Could this have been the lab where Rey was nurtured into life, giving Palpatine a second chance at turning young Skywalker to the dark side? Tie this one in with the Palpatine as Snoke theory and it even explains away the latter\u2019s apparently clumsy use of the expression \u201cyoung Rey\u201d just before the old git copped it. And anything that can retrospectively make perfect symmetry of such apparently lazy writing has to be worth betting on.",

The high proportion of UK farm exports to the EU would stop, barred by regulatory barriers and deterred by tariffs: <a href=\"https://www.peoples-vote.uk/no_deal_could_put_over_half_of_farms_out_of_business_new_report_launches_farmers_for_a_people_s_vote\" title=\"\">27% on chickens, 46% on lamb and 65% on beef</a>. Cereals would be hit too. The government says it will remove or sharply lower all tariffs on imported food to keep prices down as the pound plunges. But this report shows how that import surge would wreck British farming.</p> <p>WTO rules mean Britain must let in food from all over the world on the same tariffs and terms, no picking and choosing, open to all comers. Brazilian beef costs 50% less, US cereals 30% less. What leverage will the UK have for any future deals with the US or anyone, if we have already removed most tariffs?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/quarter-english-farms-bankrupt-after-brexit-2018-4?r=US&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">Some 60% of farm incomes</a> depend on subsidies from the EU\u2019s basic payment scheme. Michael Gove promised to replace it with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/12/gove-hails-plans-to-reward-uk-farmers-for-adopting-green-policies\" title=\"\">environmental subsidies</a> \u2013 but only until 2022. Rickard rightly doubts that the same sums will be forthcoming in future when competing for funds with all the other urgent spending needs. The knock-on effect on Britain\u2019s large food- and food-processing sector will be dramatic, with widespread redundancies. Farming land and rent prices will fall, but, Rickard finds, not nearly enough to compensate for the loss of sales.</p> <p>Now there are varying views available on all this. <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/politics/1086319/brexit-will-boost-our-economy-and-cut-the-cost-of-bmws-and-even-brie/\" title=\"\">Patrick Minford</a>, the Brexiteers\u2019 favoured economist, wants shops flooded with cheap imports floating free on global commodities markets, unfettered by regulatory checks, with no tariffs or protection for home produce.

That\u2019s a price worth paying, a valid trade-off for market extremists, who are careless about food security, happy for us to grow nothing ourselves, leaving us wholly dependent on world markets. Minfordites are untouched by the romance of farming or the pull of manufacturing \u2013 shrugging them off as relatively small parts of the economy.

      "bodyText": "A small flock of sheep is trotting down Whitehall today to join a meeting of farmers who are coming together to mark the launch of a devastating report on the impact of a no-deal Brexit. The report rings the death knell for upland hill farming, but sheep are only the first in the line of fire: it also warns that half of Britain\u2019s farms would go out of business and calls for a public vote before any Brexit. Today\u2019s report, written by S\u00e9an Rickard, the former chief economist of the National Farmers\u2019 Union \u2013 and launched by Farmers for a People\u2019s Vote \u2013 is a forensic analysis of the effect of a crash-out Brexit, which the government will struggle to refute. The high proportion of UK farm exports to the EU would stop, barred by regulatory barriers and deterred by tariffs: 27% on chickens, 46% on lamb and 65% on beef. Cereals would be hit too. The government says it will remove or sharply lower all tariffs on imported food to keep prices down as the pound plunges. But this report shows how that import surge would wreck British farming. WTO rules mean Britain must let in food from all over the world on the same tariffs and terms, no picking and choosing, open to all comers. Brazilian beef costs 50% less, US cereals 30% less. What leverage will the UK have for any future deals with the US or anyone, if we have already removed most tariffs? Some 60% of farm incomes depend on subsidies from the EU\u2019s basic payment scheme. Michael Gove promised to replace it with environmental subsidies \u2013 but only until 2022. Rickard rightly doubts that the same sums will be forthcoming in future when competing for funds with all the other urgent spending needs. The knock-on effect on Britain\u2019s large food- and food-processing sector will be dramatic, with widespread redundancies. Farming land and rent prices will fall, but, Rickard finds, not nearly enough to compensate for the loss of sales. Now there are varying views available on all this. Patrick Minford, the Brexiteers\u2019 favoured economist, wants shops flooded with cheap imports floating free on global commodities markets, unfettered by regulatory checks, with no tariffs or protection for home produce. Cheap food, promised by Jacob Rees-Mogg, will please consumers and Minford is sanguine about farmers, fishers and most British manufacturers going to the wall. That\u2019s a price worth paying, a valid trade-off for market extremists, who are careless about food security, happy for us to grow nothing ourselves, leaving us wholly dependent on world markets. Minfordites are untouched by the romance of farming or the pull of manufacturing \u2013 shrugging them off as relatively small parts of the economy. Finance and services are the only future. But that was not the vision sold to the public by Brexiteers at the 2016 referendum. If it was their secret ideology, it was kept hidden from voters who backed Brexit. That dream of \u201ctaking back control\u201d and restoring British sovereignty was coupled to nostalgic imagery of British farming, fishing and manufacturing. Homegrown things would flourish: no one said they would be thrown to the wolves of yet harsher globalisation. Backing Britishness \u2013 mainly Englishness \u2013 was the theme tune, not unleashing an agricultural Armageddon that would alter forever the old English landscape, with no sheep safely grazing the hillsides. The tragedy is that so many farmers voted for this destruction of their own livelihoods: Rickard says they were seduced by Owen Paterson, who toured rural areas telling farmers that after Brexit they could have all the advantages of sales to the EU with none of the regulation and paperwork. Now, at the 11th hour, this report should be a wake-up call for what no deal means. \u201cThey can stop insulting us and calling this project fear. Let them come up with their own figures,\u201d Rickard challenges the government. This should galvanise farmers into action. The ones launching today\u2019s report are taking it on a roadshow around the country to key agricultural constituencies, warning their fellow farmers and calling on Tory MPs in rural seats not to allow a no-deal Brexit without giving the public a vote. If this were France, farmers confronted with a government about to destroy them wouldn\u2019t be driving a few sheep down Whitehall. They\u2019d barricade Westminster with battalions of muck-spreading tractors: maybe British farmers will in due course. There are others, too, who should hurry to read this report \u2013 the scriptwriters of The Archers. Extraordinarily, Brexit barely gets a mention in the show, though it\u2019s about to break over the dunderheads of David, Ruth, Brian, Helen, Eddie Grundy and all the rest of them. It\u2019s time they woke up too. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>A few weeks back, my Twitter feed was suddenly clogged with misty-eyed reminiscences of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/13/how-live-aid-continues-to-nourish-musicians\">Live Aid</a>. It is now generally regarded as a white saviour festival of mostly dreadful music. Still, there\u2019s much nostalgic love for Tony Hadley\u2019s leather trench coat, and Queen\u2019s alarming \u201cno time for losers\u201d philosophy. I lived through it; I remembered how a bunch of craven, ageing rock stars fell over themselves to reboot their careers. OK, I was 21, and cynical, but I was there for it, watching it all unfold on TV. I understand it.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/woodstock\">Woodstock</a> \u2013 which celebrates its <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/music/news/original-woodstock-site-bethel-restricted-to-ticketholders-on-anniversary-weekend-1203300298/\">50th anniversary this weekend</a> \u2013 was a primitive blueprint for Live Aid, and every mega-festival since. Its cultural weight has risen and fallen over the decades \u2013 depending on who you talk to, it was either the pinnacle of 1960s counterculture or the rain-sodden end of a dream. I was four years old. The soundtrack album would be in friends\u2019 houses in the 70s, and the movie seemed to be on TV every year, so I\u2019m part of a generation that thinks it knows Woodstock without having been there. But the movie is incomplete and out of sequence \u2013 some of the story is as fictionalised as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/21/why-bohemian-rhapsody-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar\">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>.</p> <p>Out this month is a 50th anniversary archive box set \u2013 all 38 CDs of it \u2013 which presents the festival in something approximating real time. Folk-blues singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/23/richie-havens\">Richie Havens</a>, who opened the event while almost every other act was stuck in traffic, would later claim he \u201cplayed for nearly three hours \u2026 I sang every song I knew!\u201d We now know he only played for 45 minutes. This is an audio v\u00e9rit\u00e9 documentary, right down to the on-stage announcements: \u201cEric Klinnenberg, please call home \u2026 Dennis Dache, please call your wife \u2026 Karen from Poughkeepsie, please meet Harold at the stand with the blood pills \u2026\u201d I listened to all 38 discs in sequence, over three days.</p> <h2>Friday: don\u2019t take the brown acid</h2> <p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, one of the most beautiful men in the whole world\u201d is the opening introduction for Havens. \u201cGroovy, groovy, groovy. How are you? Can you hear? Groovy. Groovy. It\u2019s really beautiful to see so many people together. Right? Groovy.\u201d So you may not have the Beatles at Woodstock (or Bob Dylan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/15/frozen-in-time-bob-dylan-woodstock-1968\">who lived within spitting distance</a>) but you do have Havens singing Strawberry Fields Forever as if it had been written in a shack. Havens goes into the terrific Freedom for an encore, which will turn out to be a highlight of the movie; its chopped guitar and conga slaps pre-empt late 90s R&amp;B. <a href=\"http://www.sweetwaterband.com/\">Sweetwater</a>, meanwhile, sound like a late-60s parody band; they even take time out to tell us they were busted on the way over. Their set is rescued by the lovely For Pete\u2019s Sake, a \u201cbossa nova blues\u201d vocalese with harpsichord.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ce15c4d82ead75581adab2e076c7ab339fd34bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ce15c4d82ead75581adab2e076c7ab339fd34bf/0_0_2250_1563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richie Havens at Woodstock.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"695\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richie Havens at Woodstock.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Someone should have told <a href=\"http://www.bertsommer.com/\">Bert Sommer</a> that, like Cilla Black, his softer register was very sweet, but singing out he resembled a goat caught on barbed wire. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/30/rocks-backpages-tim-hardin\">Tim Hardin</a> \u2013 writer of the immortal Reason to Believe \u2013 pulls off the opposite trick: singing out, he still sounds intimate, and though his tuning is wayward, his bruised set is a highlight. We\u2019re only four discs in, and deadpan stage manager John Morris is already telling the \u201csame boring pedantic speech\u201d about not climbing on the scaffolding. The flat, brown acid gets him more exercised: \u201cEverybody please, please \u2026 it is poison. There are 15 people who are very ill from it \u2026\u201d Rain is pouring down.</p> <p>\u201cFriends, we begin this evening\u2019s recital \u2026\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/dec/12/ravi-shankar-dies\">Ravi Shankar</a> had blown minds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/07/da-pennebaker-on-making-monterey-pop-festival-documentary\">at the Monterey pop festival two years previously</a>, when Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band was only a couple of weeks old. His set already feels like reliving the past, but it has the best sound so far. Thanks to the rain, the electrical setup is life-threatening, so the unbilled <a href=\"http://www.melaniesafka.com/bio\">Melanie</a> takes the stage with her acoustic guitar: Close to It All and Momma Momma are truly intense. Animal Crackers is not only intentionally amateurish but deliberately ugly.

Instead, the unknown <a href=\"https://www.arloguthrie.com/\">Arlo Guthrie </a>takes the stage, ending up in the movie, and \u2013 through sheer bonhomie \u2013 selling a million copies of Alice\u2019s Restaurant. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/24/joan-baez-interview-whistle-down-the-wind-farewell-tour-folk-music-protest-songs\">Joan Baez</a>\u2019s late Friday night appearance, oddly out of time, gives away that Woodstock is a celebration of the 60s before the decade has even ended.</p> <h2>Saturday afternoon: jazz rock and tie-dye tents</h2> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s get high!\u201d say <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/quill-and-the-man-woodstock-s-lost-band#/\">Quill</a>, Saturday\u2019s opening act and maybe the most obscure name on the bill. They are also awful. They Live The Life lasts a leaden, eight minutes, ending in a percussive wig out with the band sarcastically chanting: \u201cYou\u2019re so free!\u201d This was played during one of the brief sunny spells, but you wouldn\u2019t know it.</p> <p>San Francisco veteran <a href=\"https://www.countryjoe.com/\">Country Joe McDonald</a> is melancholy and sweet. Santana\u2019s lithe Latin groove is maybe the first thing that doesn\u2019t sound actively damp. The 21-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/16/carlos-santana-you-can-get-high-on-whats-within-you\">Carlos Santana</a> has apparently been given mescaline by the Grateful Dead\u2019s Jerry Garcia long before his scheduled set time. Years later, he laughed about it: \u201cI figured I had enough time to come down before it was time for us to play.\u201d But no, because everything is running on Woodstock time, and they go on early, the guitar wriggling like a snake in his hand. You can\u2019t tell \u2013 they sound great.

And lost car keys. <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Lovin-Spoonful\">The Lovin\u2019 Spoonful</a>\u2019s John Sebastian walks on stage, slack-jawed. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you can tell how amazing you look. You\u2019re a whole city. You\u2019re something an awful lot of us talked about 10 years ago.\u201d Sebastian adds that he\u2019s been living in California, in a tent, where he met a lady who tie-dyes \u2013 \u201ca cloth house is all you need if you\u2019ve got love.\u201d The beautiful Darling Be Home Soon is the only hit single we\u2019ve heard so far. Sebastian goes down better than anyone yet, maybe something to do with the brevity of his set. He plays Younger Generation (\u201cI\u2019d like to dedicate it to a cat whose old lady has just had a baby\u201d) and the lyric still sounds ridiculously grownup, more so than Bowie\u2019s Kooks, coming from a man in his early 20s.</p> <p>\u201cAt the information booth is a three-year-old girl, we don\u2019t know her name, she has light blond hair \u2026\u201d There\u2019s a constant whirr of helicopters before the bludgeoning jazz rock of England\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/youve-never-heard-of-keef-hartley/\">Keef Hartley Band</a>, who are greeted by one person clapping. By now, the army are flying in medical supplies in helicopters. \u201cThey\u2019re with us, man, they\u2019re not against us!\u201d cries lighting man and new MC Chip Monck \u2013 amid the chaos, the MCs are notably dropping their wink-wink references to getting high.</p> <p>The Incredible String Band are very much not bludgeoning. \u201cHello. I\u2019m going to read a poem before we start.\u201d They sound apologetic yet slightly grouchy. They could have created an indelible moment for Michael Wadleigh\u2019s cameras the previous night; instead they go on at teatime before festival-friendly Canned Heat and play a set consisting entirely of new songs. Canned Heat, at their best, sound like a proletarian Velvet Underground (Rollin\u2019 Blues), or maybe the American Status Quo (the endless Woodstock Boogie). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/aug/19/canned-heat-woodstock-anthem\">Going Up the Country will become the festival\u2019s anthem</a>, as well as a TV ad staple decades later.</p> <h2><strong>Saturday night: bad moon rising</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/woodstock-leslie-west-mountain-guitarist-856383/\">Mountain</a>? More brutal white blues shouting, more ear-squashingly heavy boogie. Night falls and on come <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/18/grateful-dead-bob-weir-im-nowhere-near-done\">the Grateful Dead</a>, who begin with St Stephen, a pretty song, largely instrumental, that clocks in at two minutes, and follow it with country classic Mama Tried. Garcia, like a proto-Alan Partridge, jokes about \u201cdesignated parking areas\u201d for 10 minutes while they try to sort out their sound. The 19 meandering minutes of Dark Star are attractive enough but, man, they go on, while poor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/jul/11/artsfeatures3\">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a> \u2013 headliners, with Bad Moon Rising still in the charts \u2013 are watching the clock tick in the wings. Eventually they go on at 3 am.</p> <p>Creedence\u2019s set is all the more remarkable given the ungodly hour. Fogerty\u2019s voice is raw but focused, they can stretch out on Born on the Bayou and Suzie Q, but can be succinct, punchy and still just as evocatively swampy on Green River. They have punch \u2013 this is easily the best set so far.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/janis-joplin\">Janis Joplin</a> sounds unerringly like Ray Stevens\u2019 Bridget the Midget in places. While Raise Your Hand is a pretty undeniable Stax-on-helium workout, her version of the Bee Gees\u2019 To Love Somebody is overegged. By contrast, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2017/mar/08/sly-and-the-family-stone-10-of-the-best\">Sly and the Family Stone</a> sound entirely futuristic \u2013 like everyone else they have malfunctioning gear, but they \u201churry up and play to avoid hanging you up\u201d. Bang! Straight into Sing a Simple Song. Tight as a drum. Everyday People, a No 1 hit just a few weeks earlier, is a festival high point.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/17/the-who-uk-singles-ranked\">The Who</a> start off ramshackle, draggy even. They pick up while on a run of Tommy songs; by Amazing Journey they sound much more like the fizzing fathers of freak-beat. Yippie founder<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/may/25/1\"> Abbie Hoffman</a> grabs the mic at one point to moan: \u201cI think this is a pile of shit, while [MC5 manager] John Sinclair rots in prison.\u201d Pete Townshend is heard to shout, \u201cFuck off my fucking stage!\u201d but we can\u2019t tell whether his guitar, allegedly wielded over Hoffman\u2019s head, makes contact.

      "bodyText": "A few weeks back, my Twitter feed was suddenly clogged with misty-eyed reminiscences of Live Aid. It is now generally regarded as a white saviour festival of mostly dreadful music. Still, there\u2019s much nostalgic love for Tony Hadley\u2019s leather trench coat, and Queen\u2019s alarming \u201cno time for losers\u201d philosophy. I lived through it; I remembered how a bunch of craven, ageing rock stars fell over themselves to reboot their careers. OK, I was 21, and cynical, but I was there for it, watching it all unfold on TV. I understand it.Woodstock \u2013 which celebrates its 50th anniversary this weekend \u2013 was a primitive blueprint for Live Aid, and every mega-festival since. Its cultural weight has risen and fallen over the decades \u2013 depending on who you talk to, it was either the pinnacle of 1960s counterculture or the rain-sodden end of a dream. I was four years old. The soundtrack album would be in friends\u2019 houses in the 70s, and the movie seemed to be on TV every year, so I\u2019m part of a generation that thinks it knows Woodstock without having been there. But the movie is incomplete and out of sequence \u2013 some of the story is as fictionalised as Bohemian Rhapsody. Out this month is a 50th anniversary archive box set \u2013 all 38 CDs of it \u2013 which presents the festival in something approximating real time. Folk-blues singer Richie Havens, who opened the event while almost every other act was stuck in traffic, would later claim he \u201cplayed for nearly three hours \u2026 I sang every song I knew!\u201d We now know he only played for 45 minutes. This is an audio v\u00e9rit\u00e9 documentary, right down to the on-stage announcements: \u201cEric Klinnenberg, please call home \u2026 Dennis Dache, please call your wife \u2026 Karen from Poughkeepsie, please meet Harold at the stand with the blood pills \u2026\u201d I listened to all 38 discs in sequence, over three days. Friday: don\u2019t take the brown acid \u201cLadies and gentlemen, one of the most beautiful men in the whole world\u201d is the opening introduction for Havens. \u201cGroovy, groovy, groovy. How are you? Can you hear? Groovy. Groovy. It\u2019s really beautiful to see so many people together. Right? Groovy.\u201d So you may not have the Beatles at Woodstock (or Bob Dylan, who lived within spitting distance) but you do have Havens singing Strawberry Fields Forever as if it had been written in a shack. Havens goes into the terrific Freedom for an encore, which will turn out to be a highlight of the movie; its chopped guitar and conga slaps pre-empt late 90s R&amp;B. Sweetwater, meanwhile, sound like a late-60s parody band; they even take time out to tell us they were busted on the way over. Their set is rescued by the lovely For Pete\u2019s Sake, a \u201cbossa nova blues\u201d vocalese with harpsichord. Someone should have told Bert Sommer that, like Cilla Black, his softer register was very sweet, but singing out he resembled a goat caught on barbed wire. Tim Hardin \u2013 writer of the immortal Reason to Believe \u2013 pulls off the opposite trick: singing out, he still sounds intimate, and though his tuning is wayward, his bruised set is a highlight. We\u2019re only four discs in, and deadpan stage manager John Morris is already telling the \u201csame boring pedantic speech\u201d about not climbing on the scaffolding. The flat, brown acid gets him more exercised: \u201cEverybody please, please \u2026 it is poison. There are 15 people who are very ill from it \u2026\u201d Rain is pouring down. \u201cFriends, we begin this evening\u2019s recital \u2026\u201d Ravi Shankar had blown minds at the Monterey pop festival two years previously, when Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band was only a couple of weeks old. His set already feels like reliving the past, but it has the best sound so far. Thanks to the rain, the electrical setup is life-threatening, so the unbilled Melanie takes the stage with her acoustic guitar: Close to It All and Momma Momma are truly intense. Animal Crackers is not only intentionally amateurish but deliberately ugly. We need someone to lift us up. What we hear next is Joe Boyd refusing Morris\u2019s request for the Incredible String Band to go on in the rain with just a couple of acoustic guitars, thereby missing their shot at future immortality. Instead, the unknown Arlo Guthrie takes the stage, ending up in the movie, and \u2013 through sheer bonhomie \u2013 selling a million copies of Alice\u2019s Restaurant. Joan Baez\u2019s late Friday night appearance, oddly out of time, gives away that Woodstock is a celebration of the 60s before the decade has even ended. Saturday afternoon: jazz rock and tie-dye tents \u201cLet\u2019s get high!\u201d say Quill, Saturday\u2019s opening act and maybe the most obscure name on the bill. They are also awful. They Live The Life lasts a leaden, eight minutes, ending in a percussive wig out with the band sarcastically chanting: \u201cYou\u2019re so free!\u201d This was played during one of the brief sunny spells, but you wouldn\u2019t know it. San Francisco veteran Country Joe McDonald is melancholy and sweet. Santana\u2019s lithe Latin groove is maybe the first thing that doesn\u2019t sound actively damp. The 21-year-old Carlos Santana has apparently been given mescaline by the Grateful Dead\u2019s Jerry Garcia long before his scheduled set time. Years later, he laughed about it: \u201cI figured I had enough time to come down before it was time for us to play.\u201d But no, because everything is running on Woodstock time, and they go on early, the guitar wriggling like a snake in his hand. You can\u2019t tell \u2013 they sound great. Weeks later, Evil Ways will be in the Top 10. By mid-afternoon, insulin and asthma medicine are the main concerns of the MC. And lost car keys. The Lovin\u2019 Spoonful\u2019s John Sebastian walks on stage, slack-jawed. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you can tell how amazing you look. You\u2019re a whole city. You\u2019re something an awful lot of us talked about 10 years ago.\u201d Sebastian adds that he\u2019s been living in California, in a tent, where he met a lady who tie-dyes \u2013 \u201ca cloth house is all you need if you\u2019ve got love.\u201d The beautiful Darling Be Home Soon is the only hit single we\u2019ve heard so far. Sebastian goes down better than anyone yet, maybe something to do with the brevity of his set. He plays Younger Generation (\u201cI\u2019d like to dedicate it to a cat whose old lady has just had a baby\u201d) and the lyric still sounds ridiculously grownup, more so than Bowie\u2019s Kooks, coming from a man in his early 20s. \u201cAt the information booth is a three-year-old girl, we don\u2019t know her name, she has light blond hair \u2026\u201d There\u2019s a constant whirr of helicopters before the bludgeoning jazz rock of England\u2019s Keef Hartley Band, who are greeted by one person clapping. By now, the army are flying in medical supplies in helicopters. \u201cThey\u2019re with us, man, they\u2019re not against us!\u201d cries lighting man and new MC Chip Monck \u2013 amid the chaos, the MCs are notably dropping their wink-wink references to getting high. The Incredible String Band are very much not bludgeoning. \u201cHello. I\u2019m going to read a poem before we start.\u201d They sound apologetic yet slightly grouchy. They could have created an indelible moment for Michael Wadleigh\u2019s cameras the previous night; instead they go on at teatime before festival-friendly Canned Heat and play a set consisting entirely of new songs. Canned Heat, at their best, sound like a proletarian Velvet Underground (Rollin\u2019 Blues), or maybe the American Status Quo (the endless Woodstock Boogie). Going Up the Country will become the festival\u2019s anthem, as well as a TV ad staple decades later. Saturday night: bad moon rising Mountain? More brutal white blues shouting, more ear-squashingly heavy boogie. Night falls and on come the Grateful Dead, who begin with St Stephen, a pretty song, largely instrumental, that clocks in at two minutes, and follow it with country classic Mama Tried. Garcia, like a proto-Alan Partridge, jokes about \u201cdesignated parking areas\u201d for 10 minutes while they try to sort out their sound. The 19 meandering minutes of Dark Star are attractive enough but, man, they go on, while poor Creedence Clearwater Revival \u2013 headliners, with Bad Moon Rising still in the charts \u2013 are watching the clock tick in the wings. Eventually they go on at 3 am. Creedence\u2019s set is all the more remarkable given the ungodly hour. Fogerty\u2019s voice is raw but focused, they can stretch out on Born on the Bayou and Suzie Q, but can be succinct, punchy and still just as evocatively swampy on Green River. They have punch \u2013 this is easily the best set so far. Janis Joplin sounds unerringly like Ray Stevens\u2019 Bridget the Midget in places. While Raise Your Hand is a pretty undeniable Stax-on-helium workout, her version of the Bee Gees\u2019 To Love Somebody is overegged. By contrast, Sly and the Family Stone sound entirely futuristic \u2013 like everyone else they have malfunctioning gear, but they \u201churry up and play to avoid hanging you up\u201d. Bang! Straight into Sing a Simple Song. Tight as a drum. Everyday People, a No 1 hit just a few weeks earlier, is a festival high point. The Who start off ramshackle, draggy even. They pick up while on a run of Tommy songs; by Amazing Journey they sound much more like the fizzing fathers of freak-beat. Yippie founder Abbie Hoffman grabs the mic at one point to moan: \u201cI think this is a pile of shit, while [MC5 manager] John Sinclair rots in prison.\u201d Pete Townshend is heard to shout, \u201cFuck off my fucking stage!\u201d but we can\u2019t tell whether his guitar, allegedly wielded over Hoffman\u2019s head, makes contact. The set peters out in farts of feedback. Sunday: mud, sweat and fears Coming on stage at sunrise on the Sunday, Jefferson Airplane greet the new day explaining they\u2019re not a \u201chippie band\u201d but \u201cmanic morning music\u201d, then eviscerate Fred Neil\u2019s Other Side of Life. Somebody to Love is also taken at breakneck speed \u2013 this turns out to be an energy tablet before a leaden day. Joe Cocker does Dylan and Ray Charles with added sweat and grease, before another rainstorm means the power is cut for several hours. There is a beautiful \u2013 though shorter \u2013 ambient interlude on the box set. By teatime, Country Joe McDonald is back with his band, messier than before. Ten Years After follow with more choogling, formless blues rock, and the MC announces that the hospital has \u201can awful lot of broken limbs\u201d. The Band\u2019s set is disappointingly heavy, leavened by the lightness of an old Four Tops hit Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever. They are followed by Johnny and Edgar Winter\u2019s endless jamming. Brass rock hitmakers Blood Sweat &amp; Tears would be cut from the movie and the soundtrack, apparently for being out of tune, but you wouldn\u2019t know it. Their take on Randy Newman\u2019s Just One Smile is surprisingly lovely, though there\u2019s possibly an element of Stockholm Syndrome at play. Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young are balm. Fresh from the Hollies, Graham Nash shows his working men\u2019s club stagecraft by crying, \u201cOoh, me zip\u2019s come down!\u201d just before the gorgeous Guinnevere. They sound like a cool freshwater stream alive with trout after the clogged, dead mud that has preceded them. It\u2019s back to the wailin\u2019 harp and high-wattage white blues with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, though at least they start with a cowbell-led groove on Born Under a Bad Sign. They have read their audience \u2013 Everything\u2019s Gonna Be Alright is a proper party tune. Monday: Jimi burns the house down Almost there. It\u2019s breakfast time on Monday, and the crowds are audibly smaller. Fifties revivalists Sha Na Na sound like a less together Showaddywaddy. And finally, Jimi Hendrix and the Band of Gypsies \u2013 or Gypsy Sun and Rainbows \u2013 play their first-ever show, for two hours, and it is blindingly great. How did the stage sound suddenly get this good? Hendrix is hilarious, as ever, explaining new song Izabella is \u201cabout a cat, blah blah, woof woof \u2026\u201d It\u2019s a real shame they wouldn\u2019t keep this lineup together.

But I do understand \u2013 now even more \u2013 why the footage and the soundtrack completely turned me off festivals as a teenager. It sounds like a battle, and sometimes it\u2019s almost frightening. When I eat my Kerala-style mackerel curry at Green Man this year, I\u2019ll do a silent prayer that, if Ten Years After decide to play an unannounced set, I\u2019ll be able to walk back to my bed and breakfast.

      "bodyText": "Brexiters stop at nothing to get what they want and remainers stop at everything. The laws of political motion then dictate which direction things move. Jeremy Corbyn has written to MPs inviting them to install him in Downing Street, having deposed Boris Johnson with a vote of no confidence. His tenure would, he promises, be \u201cstrictly time-limited\u201d \u2013 long enough to call a general election and seek the necessary article 50 extension to conduct a ballot. For Corbyn this is the simplest route out of the current mess. There is a government hell-bent on doing something that a majority of MPs oppose and believe to be ruinous \u2013 hurtling off a Brexit cliff-edge. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act gives the Commons 14 days to organise a replacement when an incumbent government is defeated in a no-confidence vote. Who else is going to lead that administration if not the leader of Her Majesty\u2019s opposition? In constitutional terms he is the obvious candidate; probably the only candidate. But in the minds of scores of MPs he is not. His past equivocations over Europe are not the reason, or at least not the only reason. Pro-European Tory rebels, Liberal Democrats, the rag-tag platoon of independents and semi-autonomous tribes of Labour MPs have spent months fretting about ways to thwart a hard Brexit, apparently ready to pull every procedural lever and contemplate all manner of unorthodox coalitions. Not much has been excluded from those considerations, except for a tacit prohibition on any route that makes a prime minister of the current Labour leader. Their horror of Corbyn is equal to \u2013 or greater than \u2013 their horror of Brexit. That has been so well understood by the participants in the discussion that few have felt much need to articulate it. Corbyn\u2019s letter now obliges them to spell it out. That is easier for some than others. Tories and ex-Labour independents don\u2019t have much difficulty vocalising reasons why they think the Labour leader is unfit for office, even on a time-limited basis.

When elected to lead the Lib Dems she ruled out an alliance with Corbyn on the grounds that he couldn\u2019t be trusted on the European question, but also (added almost as an afterthought) because \u201che is dangerous for our national security and for our economic security, too\u201d. Swinson dismissed Corbyn\u2019s letter swiftly last night, largely on the basis that others would surely do so too. The Lib Dem leader judges that Tory rebels and independents will not get on board and so the parliamentary numbers simply aren\u2019t high enough to express confidence in a Corbyn-led administration.

She is virtually unrecognisable here, subsumed by a homogenised 80s sound that leaves you pining for the astral lifelines of her earlier work.</p> \n<h2><strong>18. Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm (1988)</strong></h2> \n<p>It\u2019s hard to get to grips with this one. Joined by guest artists Billy Idol, Tom Petty, Don Henley and Willie Nelson, this is very much a record of its era. And, like Dog Eat Dog, sounds unremarkable when compared with her other work.</p> \n<h2><strong>17. Wild Things Run Fast (1982)</strong></h2> \n<p>There are some things \u2013 such as Mitchell\u2019s decision to jazzily segue into the Righteous Brothers\u2019 Unchained Melody \u2013 that will remain for ever baffling. Is any Mitchell fan <em>truly</em> comfortable with her 80s output? That is a rhetorical question, of course \u2013 please don\u2019t tweet me.</p> \n<h2><strong>16. Turbulent Indigo (1994)</strong></h2> \n<p>What begins promisingly (opening track Sunny Sunday is a reminder of her 70s work) soon disappoints with rhymes as basic as \u201cAnd the oil spills / And sex kills.\u201d That said, it won a Grammy for best pop album. Make of that what you will.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b30bdb31fff33de6f2907541951bf38b710e9f67\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b30bdb31fff33de6f2907541951bf38b710e9f67/51_0_2362_2952/800.jpg\" alt=\"Mitchell in the early 70s.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mitchell in the early 70s.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GAB Archive/Redferns</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>15. Both Sides Now (2000)</strong></h2> \n<p>A sumptuous concept album that lacks, perhaps, her supernatural edge. There is a smoothness to Mitchell crooning standards that seems slightly at odds with the artist we know and love. That said, it is a pleasant listen and her reworking of the title track, which she first recorded on 1968\u2019s Clouds, is a sage reclamation of a classic.</p> \n<h2><strong>14. Taming the Tiger (1998)</strong></h2> \n<p>The meandering melodies and layered voiceovers can be discombobulating. But there is enough lyrical reflection to keep the mega fans happy.</p> \n<h2><strong>13. Mingus (1979)</strong></h2> \n<p>If jazz \u2013 and, in particular, <em>Joni\u2019s jazz</em> \u2013 is a challenge, this isn\u2019t the album for you. Recorded in the months before Charles Mingus\u2019s death, Mitchell\u2019s 10th studio album is a total submersion. Pre-Mingus, Mitchell said she was just dipping her big toe into the lake of jazz. When she met the jazz giant, he pushed her in.</p> \n<h2><strong>12. Night Ride Home (1991)</strong></h2> \n<p>It may not be as compelling as Hejira, but there is still a lot here to admire. The percussive rhythms and jazz inflections are there \u2013 but the melodies are softer and her vocals are tender. More self-assured and at ease with where she is.</p> \n<h2><strong>11. Shine (2007)</strong></h2> \n<p>After the release of 2002\u2019s Travelogue, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/nov/21/artsfeatures.popandrock\" title=\"\">Mitchell announced her retirement</a>, only to return five years later with what many perceived to be a return to 70s form. Said to be inspired by environmental catastrophe and the Iraq war, Blue-era piano on its opening track, One Week Last Summer, gave fans exactly what they were waiting for.</p> \n<h2><strong>10. Travelogue (2002)</strong></h2> \n<p>Revisionist albums tend to fail miserably. Not this one \u2013 her orchestral reworking of her earlier classics soar with ascending strings and bittersweet tenderness. Stand-out tracks are Hejira and Amelia \u2013 stirring, soulful retellings of introspection and exploration that wash over you.</p> \n<h2><strong>9. Don Juan\u2019s Reckless Daughter (1977)</strong></h2> \n<p> Even compared with Hejira from the year before, this double album is a leap ahead in terms of abstraction and improvisation. And although not everyone is a jazzed-up Joni fan, it is impossible to listen to the epic Paprika Plains (all 16 minutes and 21 seconds of it) and not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/26/joni-mitchell-blue-hissing-summer-lawns-court-spark-hejira-dylan\">marvel at the breadth and scope of her ambitious transformation</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b5d2c27b5ce972b2717a581751f46329401e81d1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5d2c27b5ce972b2717a581751f46329401e81d1/0_846_4474_2684/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In the beginning \u2026 Mitchell, 1968.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the beginning \u2026 Mitchell, 1968.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Robinson/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>8. Song to a Seagull (1968)</strong></h2> \n<p>Mitchell once remarked that her chords are depictions of emotions, that there is always a question mark to be found within them. To understand what she means, begin with her searing debut \u2013 a record that questions far more than it answers. The opening track, I Had a King, is an ethereal lament that depicts her disastrous marriage to Chuck Mitchell with devastating lyrical honesty. \u201cI can\u2019t go back there any more / You know my keys won\u2019t fit the door,\u201d she sings. \u201cYou know my thoughts don\u2019t fit the man / They never can.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>7. For the Roses (1972)</strong></h2> \n<p>You Turn Me On I\u2019m A Radio was meant to be a sarcastic joke for her manager, David Geffen, who challenged her to write a hit. The joke was on Mitchell \u2013 it became her first top 40 hit in the US. Which aptly sums up this outing. It is a record that can\u2019t quite let go of its classic folk roots, but features enough experimental jazz flourishes to remind us that this is a metamorphosing artist who won\u2019t compromise. And she is on the move.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"635d6d2adfa48e9172b9dd200739cb7c6bd35385\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/635d6d2adfa48e9172b9dd200739cb7c6bd35385/0_0_1425_1425/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hejira.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hejira.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>6. The Hissing of Summer Lawns (1975)</strong></h2> \n<p>Mitchell\u2019s follow-up to Court and Spark might have received a bit of a kicking from Rolling Stone at the time of its release, but is now considered a classic. There is a reason why Prince referenced it as a major influence in the 80s. You can\u2019t pin it down. Rejecting the traditional structure of her previous work, Mitchell continued to embrace a fuller band sound, exploring a wild and roaming jazz score that finally severed ties with her folk past. If you want a real adventure, check out Mitchell\u2019s jarring synths and tribal drums on The Jungle Line. It doesn\u2019t mess around.</p> \n<h2><strong>5. Court and Spark (1974)</strong></h2> \n<p>See-sawing between folk-rock and jazz experimentation, with a pop sensibility that soars, there is a driving power and momentum to Mitchell\u2019s double platinum offering that sets it apart from her previous work. It is a confident and celebratory break-out. Yet, despite the melodic abandon, it is a record that still wrestles with core Mitchell themes: alienation and isolation; transient relationships; the need for love; the desire to escape. \u201cWe love our lovin\u2019,\u201d she sings on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4oY8ojxp_8\" title=\"\">Help Me</a>. \u201cBut not like we love our freedom.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>4. Ladies of the Canyon (1970)</strong></h2> \n<p>Like her masterpiece, Blue, Mitchell\u2019s third offering shows just how rich and luscious her piano-driven arrangements can be \u2013 mournfully played, yet always seeking the light. Equal parts forlorn and hopeful with Rainy Night House and For Free, its lilting title track is a glorious \u2013 and unashamedly romantic \u2013 tribute to the magical hillside of Hollywood\u2019s Laurel Canyon. Oh, and there\u2019s a little-known track called Woodstock thrown in there, too.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3814d7b98b0a7df3210de827e60e1308f5a7c483\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3814d7b98b0a7df3210de827e60e1308f5a7c483/0_253_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mitchell in 2007 at the launch of her album Shine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mitchell in 2007 at the launch of her album Shine.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Mazur/WireImage</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>3. Hejira (1976)</strong></h2> \n<p>This is definitely one for the road, evoking a hunger for movement, a sense of yearning and restlessness, that permeates every track. According to Mitchell, the album was written driving across the United States between Maine and Los Angeles. Amelia reflects upon the juxtaposition of concrete and skies after a break-up (an ode to the wild wings of Amelia Earhart \u2013 the urge to belong, the impulse to break free), whereas the album\u2019s title track redirects us inwardly with the haunting, spine-tingling work of jazz bassist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/22/jaco-pastorius-truth-liberty-and-soul-review\" title=\"\">Jaco Pastorius</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"327fe6993402c2d5d3551bf6b8c3e336accb6981\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/327fe6993402c2d5d3551bf6b8c3e336accb6981/0_0_1500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blue.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blue.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>2. Clouds (1969)</strong></h2> \n<p>Taut, sparse and exposed, listening to Clouds is a magical, immersive experience. Mitchell\u2019s second studio album weaves a strange and off-kilter landscape with rippling guitars, hypnotic vocals and a mysticism you can\u2019t quite define. It is worth noting that she produced nearly all of the album\u2019s songs, roping in the guitar skills of Stephen Stills to add depth to the instrumentation. And although Clouds is best known for the hit songs <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2dicRl4eAc\" title=\"\">Chelsea Morning</a> and Both Sides Now, the lesser known Roses Blue and Tin Angel are spellbinding creations worth lingering on.</p> \n<h2><strong>1. Blue (1971)</strong></h2> \n<p>When Mitchell packed her bags and headed to Europe, she sent her lover, Graham Nash, a letter that read: \u201cIf you hold sand too tightly in your hands, it will run through your fingers.\u201d A diaphanous line that painfully encapsulates the record she released the following year \u2013 a psychic masterpiece of melody, rhythm and lyricism that pulls us into Mitchell\u2019s interior world using the urgent pulsations of an Appalachian dulcimer. Widely considered to be the greatest relationship record of all time (if not the greatest <em>record</em> of all time), Blue expresses a refined truthfulness that permanently etches itself on to the listener, to quote Mitchell, like a tattoo. \u201cInk on a pin / Underneath the skin,\u201d she sings on the album\u2019s title track. \u201cAn empty space to fill in.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"166615a1-ed30-43e9-9201-083a41ce7713\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Actors</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/07/actors-playing-nightmarish-versions-of-themselves-in-cinema-ranked-keeanu-reeves\">Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema -

      "bodyText": "19. Dog Eat Dog (1985) Joni Mitchell is a non-conformer \u2013 which is why this is such an uncomfortable listen. She is virtually unrecognisable here, subsumed by a homogenised 80s sound that leaves you pining for the astral lifelines of her earlier work. 18. Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm (1988) It\u2019s hard to get to grips with this one. Joined by guest artists Billy Idol, Tom Petty, Don Henley and Willie Nelson, this is very much a record of its era. And, like Dog Eat Dog, sounds unremarkable when compared with her other work. 17. Wild Things Run Fast (1982) There are some things \u2013 such as Mitchell\u2019s decision to jazzily segue into the Righteous Brothers\u2019 Unchained Melody \u2013 that will remain for ever baffling. Is any Mitchell fan truly comfortable with her 80s output? That is a rhetorical question, of course \u2013 please don\u2019t tweet me. 16. Turbulent Indigo (1994) What begins promisingly (opening track Sunny Sunday is a reminder of her 70s work) soon disappoints with rhymes as basic as \u201cAnd the oil spills / And sex kills.\u201d That said, it won a Grammy for best pop album. Make of that what you will. 15. Both Sides Now (2000) A sumptuous concept album that lacks, perhaps, her supernatural edge. There is a smoothness to Mitchell crooning standards that seems slightly at odds with the artist we know and love. That said, it is a pleasant listen and her reworking of the title track, which she first recorded on 1968\u2019s Clouds, is a sage reclamation of a classic. 14. Taming the Tiger (1998) The meandering melodies and layered voiceovers can be discombobulating. But there is enough lyrical reflection to keep the mega fans happy. 13. Mingus (1979) If jazz \u2013 and, in particular, Joni\u2019s jazz \u2013 is a challenge, this isn\u2019t the album for you. Recorded in the months before Charles Mingus\u2019s death, Mitchell\u2019s 10th studio album is a total submersion. Pre-Mingus, Mitchell said she was just dipping her big toe into the lake of jazz. When she met the jazz giant, he pushed her in. 12. Night Ride Home (1991) It may not be as compelling as Hejira, but there is still a lot here to admire. The percussive rhythms and jazz inflections are there \u2013 but the melodies are softer and her vocals are tender. More self-assured and at ease with where she is. 11. Shine (2007) After the release of 2002\u2019s Travelogue, Mitchell announced her retirement, only to return five years later with what many perceived to be a return to 70s form. Said to be inspired by environmental catastrophe and the Iraq war, Blue-era piano on its opening track, One Week Last Summer, gave fans exactly what they were waiting for. 10. Travelogue (2002) Revisionist albums tend to fail miserably. Not this one \u2013 her orchestral reworking of her earlier classics soar with ascending strings and bittersweet tenderness. Stand-out tracks are Hejira and Amelia \u2013 stirring, soulful retellings of introspection and exploration that wash over you. 9. Don Juan\u2019s Reckless Daughter (1977) Even compared with Hejira from the year before, this double album is a leap ahead in terms of abstraction and improvisation. And although not everyone is a jazzed-up Joni fan, it is impossible to listen to the epic Paprika Plains (all 16 minutes and 21 seconds of it) and not marvel at the breadth and scope of her ambitious transformation. 8. Song to a Seagull (1968) Mitchell once remarked that her chords are depictions of emotions, that there is always a question mark to be found within them. To understand what she means, begin with her searing debut \u2013 a record that questions far more than it answers. The opening track, I Had a King, is an ethereal lament that depicts her disastrous marriage to Chuck Mitchell with devastating lyrical honesty. \u201cI can\u2019t go back there any more / You know my keys won\u2019t fit the door,\u201d she sings. \u201cYou know my thoughts don\u2019t fit the man / They never can.\u201d 7. For the Roses (1972) You Turn Me On I\u2019m A Radio was meant to be a sarcastic joke for her manager, David Geffen, who challenged her to write a hit. The joke was on Mitchell \u2013 it became her first top 40 hit in the US. Which aptly sums up this outing. It is a record that can\u2019t quite let go of its classic folk roots, but features enough experimental jazz flourishes to remind us that this is a metamorphosing artist who won\u2019t compromise. And she is on the move. 6. The Hissing of Summer Lawns (1975) Mitchell\u2019s follow-up to Court and Spark might have received a bit of a kicking from Rolling Stone at the time of its release, but is now considered a classic. There is a reason why Prince referenced it as a major influence in the 80s. You can\u2019t pin it down. Rejecting the traditional structure of her previous work, Mitchell continued to embrace a fuller band sound, exploring a wild and roaming jazz score that finally severed ties with her folk past. If you want a real adventure, check out Mitchell\u2019s jarring synths and tribal drums on The Jungle Line. It doesn\u2019t mess around. 5. Court and Spark (1974) See-sawing between folk-rock and jazz experimentation, with a pop sensibility that soars, there is a driving power and momentum to Mitchell\u2019s double platinum offering that sets it apart from her previous work. It is a confident and celebratory break-out. Yet, despite the melodic abandon, it is a record that still wrestles with core Mitchell themes: alienation and isolation; transient relationships; the need for love; the desire to escape. \u201cWe love our lovin\u2019,\u201d she sings on Help Me. \u201cBut not like we love our freedom.\u201d 4. Ladies of the Canyon (1970) Like her masterpiece, Blue, Mitchell\u2019s third offering shows just how rich and luscious her piano-driven arrangements can be \u2013 mournfully played, yet always seeking the light. Equal parts forlorn and hopeful with Rainy Night House and For Free, its lilting title track is a glorious \u2013 and unashamedly romantic \u2013 tribute to the magical hillside of Hollywood\u2019s Laurel Canyon. Oh, and there\u2019s a little-known track called Woodstock thrown in there, too. 3. Hejira (1976) This is definitely one for the road, evoking a hunger for movement, a sense of yearning and restlessness, that permeates every track. According to Mitchell, the album was written driving across the United States between Maine and Los Angeles. Amelia reflects upon the juxtaposition of concrete and skies after a break-up (an ode to the wild wings of Amelia Earhart \u2013 the urge to belong, the impulse to break free), whereas the album\u2019s title track redirects us inwardly with the haunting, spine-tingling work of jazz bassist Jaco Pastorius. 2. Clouds (1969) Taut, sparse and exposed, listening to Clouds is a magical, immersive experience. Mitchell\u2019s second studio album weaves a strange and off-kilter landscape with rippling guitars, hypnotic vocals and a mysticism you can\u2019t quite define. It is worth noting that she produced nearly all of the album\u2019s songs, roping in the guitar skills of Stephen Stills to add depth to the instrumentation. And although Clouds is best known for the hit songs Chelsea Morning and Both Sides Now, the lesser known Roses Blue and Tin Angel are spellbinding creations worth lingering on. 1. Blue (1971) When Mitchell packed her bags and headed to Europe, she sent her lover, Graham Nash, a letter that read: \u201cIf you hold sand too tightly in your hands, it will run through your fingers.\u201d A diaphanous line that painfully encapsulates the record she released the following year \u2013 a psychic masterpiece of melody, rhythm and lyricism that pulls us into Mitchell\u2019s interior world using the urgent pulsations of an Appalachian dulcimer. Widely considered to be the greatest relationship record of all time (if not the greatest record of all time), Blue expresses a refined truthfulness that permanently etches itself on to the listener, to quote Mitchell, like a tattoo. \u201cInk on a pin / Underneath the skin,\u201d she sings on the album\u2019s title track. \u201cAn empty space to fill in.\u201d",

Tickets are limited to 15,000, yet the county is reportedly preparing for upwards of 100,000 visitors to mark the anniversary. Police are warning that only ticket-holders will be allowed within a perimeter set by state police.</p> <p>The history of Woodstock is almost by definition convoluted. The 1969 festival was held 80 miles from the Catskills town of Woodstock, which has been dining out on its tie-dye association ever since, the town of Bethel has maintained a different relationship.</p> <p>According to Abramson, Bethel spent \u201calmost 50 years, essentially, trying to forget it happened here and doing things to stop people from gathering freely\u201d. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Abramson started a 17-year battle for town permits to hold an annual August \u201creunion\u201d. The ban was lifted in 2013 and permissions were issued for Woodstockers to legally gather at what is known in hippie-speak as \u201cthe Farm\u201d.</p> <p>The shift, Abramson says, came in \u201989 when the town\u2019s attitude went from \u201cWe don\u2019t want those crazy hippies here\u201d to \u201cHow can we make money?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1eea269f24c6b39067ca71e1d934c12fdf39886f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1eea269f24c6b39067ca71e1d934c12fdf39886f/30_245_4872_2924/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A couple attends the Woodstock music festival in 1969.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A couple attends the Woodstock music festival in 1969.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ralph Ackerman/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nowadays, says Abramson\u2019s son Zack, state bureaucracy has crept into every detail of planning and execution. \u201cForget about trying to put the show together, the application fee can increase to a quarter million dollars. Unless you have corporate backing there\u2019s almost no way to do it.\u201d</p> <p> Lighting up a joint at the concert venue could easily be accompanied by a tap on shoulder from a state trooper. At a \u201cMountain Jam\u201d concert at the Bethel Woods site in June, 11 people, including the front man Adam Ezra Olshansky of the Adam Ezra Group, were arrested, <a href=\"https://www.dailyfreeman.com/news/police-blotter/mountain-jam-performer-charged-with-minor-drug-offenses-at-festival/article_b8f51560-9114-11e9-88a2-9b8c5a1780d2.html\">according to state police.</a></p> <p>The fact that Bethel police are picking up marijuana smokers speaks to an enduring rift that Woodstock \u201969 left in the local community. Police lieutenant Cazzaro told the Guardian the original concert was \u201cpoorly organised, dangerous and left behind a mountain of trash\u201d.</p> <p>So as revelers make their way to Bethel this weekend, Abramson has her fingers crossed that it will turn out well. No brown acid, no trash mountains.</p> <p>\u201cThe Woodstock demographic has shorted out, so now we want to get the message out that there is a better side to Woodstock. We\u2019re open and whatever you wanna do there are places to do it, whether here with us, or Bethel Woods, or both.\u201d</p>",

The two are separated by two miles but the differences are stark: Bethel woods, site of the original Woodstock on what was Yasgur\u2019s land is now a lavishly manicured seated concert site, replete with copious concession stands and a museum filled with artifacts from the peace-and-love era. The Reunion site is far more basic with a stage, a campground and basic amenities for washing and cooking. It\u2019s here, from 15 August to 18 August, that Jeryl Abramson will host an event that, she says, is a truer invocation of the Woodstock spirit. \u201cIt is what it always was \u2013 the establishment vs the anti-establishment,\u201d says Abramson, who met her late husband Roy Howard at the \u201969 gig. \u201cWe\u2019re the anti-establishment staying true to the spirit of the sixties and they\u2019re the establishment staying true to the spirit of the earlier sixties.\u201d At the Yasgur Road Reunion event, Abramson plans to host two dozen bands, including Melvin Seals and the Gerry Garcia Band and Pink Talking Fish, to as many as 5,000 people, while Bethel\u2019s capacity is 15,000. In contrast, Michael Lang\u2019s now-defunct Woodstock 50 was hoping to get closer to the original\u2019s 400,000. Since 1985, when she and her husband purchased the homestead from Yasgur\u2019s widow Miriam, Abramson has been waging her own epic battle to stage Woodstock reunions. She points out the difference between the Bethel Woods operation and her own alternative festival. \u201cThey\u2019re preserving the site, and we\u2019re preserving the spirit.\u201d But if all goes according to plan, the two festivals can co-exist. For the last few months, the drama of Woodstock 50 has dominated efforts to celebrate the festival\u2019s golden anniversary. Lang finally admitted defeat ten days ago, telling the Associated Press it had \u201cnot been surprising that we weren\u2019t able to pull this off\u201d after a last-ditch attempt to move the concert to Maryland triggered an artist rebellion. Meanwhile, the 50th anniversary of the 1969 Woodstock Music and Art Fair will continue in the original punch bowl at Bethel Woods, now reconfigured as a commercialized concert venue owned by cable TV billionaire Alan Gerry. \u201cWe are in full-tilt-boogie, as they say,\u201d Darlene Fedun, the Bethel Woods CEO, told the Poughkeepsie Journal earlier this month. Abramson doesn\u2019t feel bad for Lang exactly, and thinks the fiasco was \u201cperpetuated by his own actions\u201d. \u201cHe did an amazing thing at 24 years old and he should be remembered for that,\u201d Abramson says. \u201cHis mistake was trying to out-do what he did last. I feel for him. It was an overwhelming thing for such a young person. I don\u2019t know that anyone could live up to that legacy.\u201d How far Bethel can go in invoking the free-concert spirit in 1969 is, apart from the advantage of geography, relatively limited. Tickets are limited to 15,000, yet the county is reportedly preparing for upwards of 100,000 visitors to mark the anniversary. Police are warning that only ticket-holders will be allowed within a perimeter set by state police. The history of Woodstock is almost by definition convoluted. The 1969 festival was held 80 miles from the Catskills town of Woodstock, which has been dining out on its tie-dye association ever since, the town of Bethel has maintained a different relationship. According to Abramson, Bethel spent \u201calmost 50 years, essentially, trying to forget it happened here and doing things to stop people from gathering freely\u201d. Meanwhile, Abramson started a 17-year battle for town permits to hold an annual August \u201creunion\u201d. The ban was lifted in 2013 and permissions were issued for Woodstockers to legally gather at what is known in hippie-speak as \u201cthe Farm\u201d. The shift, Abramson says, came in \u201989 when the town\u2019s attitude went from \u201cWe don\u2019t want those crazy hippies here\u201d to \u201cHow can we make money?\u201d Nowadays, says Abramson\u2019s son Zack, state bureaucracy has crept into every detail of planning and execution. \u201cForget about trying to put the show together, the application fee can increase to a quarter million dollars. Unless you have corporate backing there\u2019s almost no way to do it.\u201d Lighting up a joint at the concert venue could easily be accompanied by a tap on shoulder from a state trooper. At a \u201cMountain Jam\u201d concert at the Bethel Woods site in June, 11 people, including the front man Adam Ezra Olshansky of the Adam Ezra Group, were arrested, according to state police. The fact that Bethel police are picking up marijuana smokers speaks to an enduring rift that Woodstock \u201969 left in the local community. Police lieutenant Cazzaro told the Guardian the original concert was \u201cpoorly organised, dangerous and left behind a mountain of trash\u201d. So as revelers make their way to Bethel this weekend, Abramson has her fingers crossed that it will turn out well. No brown acid, no trash mountains. \u201cThe Woodstock demographic has shorted out, so now we want to get the message out that there is a better side to Woodstock. We\u2019re open and whatever you wanna do there are places to do it, whether here with us, or Bethel Woods, or both.\u201d",

Local magistrates had arranged for large support from armed cavalry officers and untrained volunteer yeomanry regiments. They were ordered to charge the crowd and arrest Hunt before he could start his speech. At least 15 people were killed and over 600 were injured. The event soon became known as Peterloo \u2013 a reference to the 1815 Battle of Waterloo.</p> <p>In the crowd was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/gnmeducationcentre/john-edward-taylor-peterloo-teaching-resource-gnm-archive\">John Edward Taylor</a>, a cotton merchant and journalist. The 28 year old had a keen interest in social and political reform and wrote for a number of liberal local newspapers including Manchester Gazette. John Tyas, a reporter from the Times in London sent to cover the event, was arrested. This prompted Taylor to send his eyewitness account to be published in London with the aim of holding the authorities to account before they tried to disseminate a different version of the event.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/gnmeducationcentre/john-edward-taylor-peterloo-teaching-resource-gnm-archive\">John Edward Taylor and Peterloo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Taylor served the committee that helped the victims of Peterloo, reported on the injured and produced the pamphlet <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/notesobservation00tayl/page/n11\">Notes and Observations</a> responding to a Government report which defended the magistrates.

      "bodyText": "On Monday 16 August 1819, 60,000 people from across Manchester and the surrounding areas attended a peaceful rally at St Peter\u2019s Field to demand political representation and hear \u2018Orator\u2019 Henry Hunt speak. Local magistrates had arranged for large support from armed cavalry officers and untrained volunteer yeomanry regiments. They were ordered to charge the crowd and arrest Hunt before he could start his speech. At least 15 people were killed and over 600 were injured. The event soon became known as Peterloo \u2013 a reference to the 1815 Battle of Waterloo. In the crowd was John Edward Taylor, a cotton merchant and journalist. The 28 year old had a keen interest in social and political reform and wrote for a number of liberal local newspapers including Manchester Gazette. John Tyas, a reporter from the Times in London sent to cover the event, was arrested. This prompted Taylor to send his eyewitness account to be published in London with the aim of holding the authorities to account before they tried to disseminate a different version of the event. Taylor served the committee that helped the victims of Peterloo, reported on the injured and produced the pamphlet Notes and Observations responding to a Government report which defended the magistrates. A few months before Peterloo, a friend had encouraged Taylor to set up a liberal newspaper and the events of 16 August 1819 strengthened his resolve to do so. By April 1821 he had been lent funds from 11 friends and fellow reformers. The paper\u2019s prospectus reflected its commitment to social and political reform demanded by those who came to the rally at St Peter\u2019s Field. An extract from it states The Manchester Guardian \u201cwill zealously enforce the principles of civil and religious Liberty, in the most comprehensive sense of those terms; it will warmly advocate the cause of Reform; it will endeavour to assist in the diffusion of just principles of Political Economy; and support \u2026 whatever measures may ... promote the moral advantage, or the political welfare, of the Community\u201d. The first edition of the paper was published on Saturday 5 May 1821. 200 years after Peterloo, the event is being widely remembered with whole series of events, exhibitions and a permanent memorial.

But it\u2019s fair to say that Clark makes the drums the least interesting thing about this record: though they are almost all clearly recorded live, they are often made to feel like drum machines, merely there to keep time. One of the pleasures of listening to Sleater-Kinney is the feeling that you\u2019ve opened your garage door to find them all practising together and nicking your lagers, but Weiss now sounds a little estranged from the family unit.</p> <p>Otherwise, this is a bold and brilliant leap into a new sound for the band. It\u2019s perhaps the perfect project for Clark, who on her solo records can infill and tinker to the point of fussiness \u2013 here, with the restriction of a trio, there\u2019s only so much they can play. The band\u2019s guitars are made to feel like synths on the Enjoy the Silence-channelling Reach Out, given a new-wave sheen on the brilliant chorus of Hurry On Home, and turned into dinky Devo toys on Love. Weiss gets a rare bit of invention on the title track, her drums miked up miles away so they sound like iron being forged in a vast warehouse, and that mood fills other tracks: a bedrock of sleazy static is the sound of friction itself.</p> <p>This is a rather post-apocalyptic landscape \u2013 on Ruins, strife manifests as Godzilla \u2013 but Brownstein and Corin Tucker romp across it with a series of excellent pop melodies. They wisely make <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTZXBmRaQtw\">Can I Go On</a>, a song about brutalising ennui and the futility of existence, into a Roxy Music disco strut with an exultant top line. The Dog/The Body, the most traditional song here, has a chorus made for drunken karaoke on a school night despite being about a worn-out love affair. The chorus from Bad Dance is extremely hammy: written as if for a musical called Anthropocene!, Brownstein casts herself as an agent of sexy chaos, and really sells its jazz-hands fervour.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5uAH0vNn2s\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E5uAH0vNn2s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Maybe musical theatre is in her future: she is a very actorly singer who has long had a streak of ludicrous, ironic coquettishness. This reaches its apex in Hurry On Home, where she seems to toss and turn on a bed, hopelessly horny, squeak-purring for someone to \u201cdisconnect me from my bones\u201d. But sex for Brownstein isn\u2019t just a roll in the hay \u2013 it\u2019s a counterweight to the abuse she faces by living in public (\u201cyou know I\u2019m unfuckable, unlovable, unlistenable, unwatchable\u201d), that lets her \u201cerase the marks, begin again\u201d. On the title track she similarly longs for \u201csomething muddy to cover up the stain\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/28/sleater-kinney-the-center-wont-hold-interview\">Sleater-Kinney: \u2018Music has always been the playground of men\u2019s sexuality\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This sense of sex being perhaps the only palliative in our fractious, disconnected world is essayed even more powerfully by Tucker, who has an innately more serious voice, an ideal foil for the sly goofball Brownstein. On The Future Is Here, her day begins on her phone, looking at the news, and ends on it too, perhaps looking at messages or photos from a decaying relationship. \u201cYou can cover me, just come over here and give me everything\u201d, she promises, a sext of pure need, for orgasm, intimacy, protection. Age, too, plays its part: on The Dog/The Body, Brownstein admits she\u2019s now \u201cjust the trick without the magic\u201d, a wonderfully wry, smutty double meaning, while on Love she says she\u2019s \u201cdone with being told that this should be the end\u201d and celebrates \u201ca well-worn body demanding to be seen\u201d. Brownstein is singing about being on stage, but it\u2019s also a credo for the boardroom, pavement and indeed bedroom.</p> <p>The album closes on Broken, a piano ballad about doggedly existing through trauma, beautifully sung by Tucker \u2013 another brand new and intense flavour for the band. Losing Weiss will be a trauma in itself, but Sleater-Kinney have announced that they are survivors, making fires out of friction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/0UMuX8pRsyfSkv0gPJMipQ\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0UMuX8pRsyfSkv0gPJMipQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",

Weiss gets a rare bit of invention on the title track, her drums miked up miles away so they sound like iron being forged in a vast warehouse, and that mood fills other tracks: a bedrock of sleazy static is the sound of friction itself. This is a rather post-apocalyptic landscape \u2013 on Ruins, strife manifests as Godzilla \u2013 but Brownstein and Corin Tucker romp across it with a series of excellent pop melodies. They wisely make Can I Go On, a song about brutalising ennui and the futility of existence, into a Roxy Music disco strut with an exultant top line. The Dog/The Body, the most traditional song here, has a chorus made for drunken karaoke on a school night despite being about a worn-out love affair. The chorus from Bad Dance is extremely hammy: written as if for a musical called Anthropocene!, Brownstein casts herself as an agent of sexy chaos, and really sells its jazz-hands fervour. Maybe musical theatre is in her future: she is a very actorly singer who has long had a streak of ludicrous, ironic coquettishness. This reaches its apex in Hurry On Home, where she seems to toss and turn on a bed, hopelessly horny, squeak-purring for someone to \u201cdisconnect me from my bones\u201d. But sex for Brownstein isn\u2019t just a roll in the hay \u2013 it\u2019s a counterweight to the abuse she faces by living in public (\u201cyou know I\u2019m unfuckable, unlovable, unlistenable, unwatchable\u201d), that lets her \u201cerase the marks, begin again\u201d. On the title track she similarly longs for \u201csomething muddy to cover up the stain\u201d. This sense of sex being perhaps the only palliative in our fractious, disconnected world is essayed even more powerfully by Tucker, who has an innately more serious voice, an ideal foil for the sly goofball Brownstein. On The Future Is Here, her day begins on her phone, looking at the news, and ends on it too, perhaps looking at messages or photos from a decaying relationship. \u201cYou can cover me, just come over here and give me everything\u201d, she promises, a sext of pure need, for orgasm, intimacy, protection. Age, too, plays its part: on The Dog/The Body, Brownstein admits she\u2019s now \u201cjust the trick without the magic\u201d, a wonderfully wry, smutty double meaning, while on Love she says she\u2019s \u201cdone with being told that this should be the end\u201d and celebrates \u201ca well-worn body demanding to be seen\u201d. Brownstein is singing about being on stage, but it\u2019s also a credo for the boardroom, pavement and indeed bedroom. The album closes on Broken, a piano ballad about doggedly existing through trauma, beautifully sung by Tucker \u2013 another brand new and intense flavour for the band. Losing Weiss will be a trauma in itself, but Sleater-Kinney have announced that they are survivors, making fires out of friction.",

      "body": "<p>Every week I receive emails requesting restaurant recommendations. There are significant birthdays that need marking, cantankerous relatives who need placating. I try but don\u2019t always manage to answer them all. The one I received at the end of May demanded an answer. Hugh Paton wanted my top 10 places in the UK; not gastro palaces offering experiences that would stay with him for the rest of his life, because it turned out there wasn\u2019t much of his life left. He had recently been given a terminal cancer diagnosis and was no longer in the business of creating memories. As he put it: \u201cGoing and eating a few decent meals strikes me as one good way to spend some of my remaining time.\u201d</p> <p>I wrote him a list: the ramshackle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/sep/23/foodanddrink.restaurants\" title=\"\">Company Shed</a> for bare-bones seafood on the Essex coast; the vivid, live-fire cooking of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/oct/21/trakol-gateshead-outrageously-good-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\" title=\"\">Trak\u00f6l</a> on the Gateshead side of the Tyne; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/29/the-game-bird-london-this-is-a-love-letter-restaurant-review\" title=\"\">the Game Bird</a> at the Stafford Hotel in London for a bit of old-school British classicism, and so on. Because people like lists, I posted it to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jayrayner1/status/1133643162507980800?s=20\" title=\"\">Twitter</a>, explaining the context. The response was immense. People tweeted the restaurants they would go to in the same circumstances. They discussed the pleasures of a good meal in bad times. They celebrated the dishes that would most give them comfort.</p> <p>Touchingly, many of the restaurants then stepped up, offering Hugh and his other half, Anna, lunch on them. Emails flew back and forth. Introductions were made. At one point he emailed his thanks but said he might leave it a month or two until treatment was under way. I counselled him against that. I had recently lost one of my closest friends to a similar cancer and knew full well that while you hope for time, it\u2019s not a commodity you can bank on. \u201cCarpe diem and all that,\u201d I said.</p> <p>He took my advice. \u201cOK,\u201d he wrote back, \u201ccarpe diem it is.\u201d There were, by all accounts, wonderful meals at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/13/margot-london-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\" title=\"\">Margot</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/26/rochelle-bar-and-canteen-london-this-food-feels-right-restaurant-review\" title=\"\">Rochelle Canteen</a> at the ICA in London, and a trip to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/feb/17/parkers-tavern-cambridge-crowd-pleasing-wont-want-leave\" title=\"\">Parker\u2019s Tavern</a> in Cambridge, where a fire alarm forced them all out on to the street. Hugh was given a doorman\u2019s plum-coloured coat against the chill, and was photographed in it, drink still in hand. He was the recipient of the kindness of strangers. But those three restaurants were all he managed. Hugh died towards the end of July, just two months after he first emailed me.</p> <p>Although we never met, other than via email, I came to like Hugh very much; I admired his phlegmatic approach to the hand that life had dealt him. I especially appreciated his approach to restaurants. As far as he was concerned, they weren\u2019t providing meals to be captured and pinned to a board like so many butterflies, stiffened with rigor mortis. They were about life lived firmly in the present tense.</p> <p>We are all of us prone to dwell on the future: on the job or relationship that will finally gift us the happiness we crave. But if you can afford it, a good meal, in a restaurant engineered to feed rather than impress, forces us into the now. And the now was exactly where Hugh needed to be. As Anna put it to me, after Hugh had died: \u201cFor the last time he could enjoy the taste, the ambience and the people who treated us with touching consideration.\u201d It\u2019s easy to dismiss a meal out as just lunch.

      "bodyText": "Every week I receive emails requesting restaurant recommendations. There are significant birthdays that need marking, cantankerous relatives who need placating. I try but don\u2019t always manage to answer them all. The one I received at the end of May demanded an answer. Hugh Paton wanted my top 10 places in the UK; not gastro palaces offering experiences that would stay with him for the rest of his life, because it turned out there wasn\u2019t much of his life left. He had recently been given a terminal cancer diagnosis and was no longer in the business of creating memories. As he put it: \u201cGoing and eating a few decent meals strikes me as one good way to spend some of my remaining time.\u201d I wrote him a list: the ramshackle Company Shed for bare-bones seafood on the Essex coast; the vivid, live-fire cooking of Trak\u00f6l on the Gateshead side of the Tyne; the Game Bird at the Stafford Hotel in London for a bit of old-school British classicism, and so on. Because people like lists, I posted it to Twitter, explaining the context. The response was immense. People tweeted the restaurants they would go to in the same circumstances. They discussed the pleasures of a good meal in bad times. They celebrated the dishes that would most give them comfort. Touchingly, many of the restaurants then stepped up, offering Hugh and his other half, Anna, lunch on them. Emails flew back and forth. Introductions were made. At one point he emailed his thanks but said he might leave it a month or two until treatment was under way. I counselled him against that. I had recently lost one of my closest friends to a similar cancer and knew full well that while you hope for time, it\u2019s not a commodity you can bank on. \u201cCarpe diem and all that,\u201d I said. He took my advice. \u201cOK,\u201d he wrote back, \u201ccarpe diem it is.\u201d There were, by all accounts, wonderful meals at Margot and Rochelle Canteen at the ICA in London, and a trip to Parker\u2019s Tavern in Cambridge, where a fire alarm forced them all out on to the street. Hugh was given a doorman\u2019s plum-coloured coat against the chill, and was photographed in it, drink still in hand. He was the recipient of the kindness of strangers. But those three restaurants were all he managed. Hugh died towards the end of July, just two months after he first emailed me. Although we never met, other than via email, I came to like Hugh very much; I admired his phlegmatic approach to the hand that life had dealt him. I especially appreciated his approach to restaurants. As far as he was concerned, they weren\u2019t providing meals to be captured and pinned to a board like so many butterflies, stiffened with rigor mortis. They were about life lived firmly in the present tense. We are all of us prone to dwell on the future: on the job or relationship that will finally gift us the happiness we crave. But if you can afford it, a good meal, in a restaurant engineered to feed rather than impress, forces us into the now. And the now was exactly where Hugh needed to be. As Anna put it to me, after Hugh had died: \u201cFor the last time he could enjoy the taste, the ambience and the people who treated us with touching consideration.\u201d It\u2019s easy to dismiss a meal out as just lunch. It\u2019s easy to see it as ephemeral. But sometimes, just sometimes, it can be so very much more. In memory of Hugh Paton, 1952-2019.",

In 2018 Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld disappeared as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. The likes of Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \u2018stuff\u2019 as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high-street presence want the government to change business rates. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs after October 2019. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the October 2018 budget the government announced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/26/budget-to-offer-business-rates-relief-for-small-shops\">some relief</a>&nbsp;on business rates for independent shopkeepers.

Weakened by a difficult Christmas \u2013 which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further Brexit wobbles to come \u2013 retailers are facing a tough 2019. Another rise in the national minimum wage in April and the falling value of the pound against the dollar, which is used to buy goods in the far east, have also added to costs and hit profits.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The high street is being rocked by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/09/half-of-uk-retail-sales-will-be-online-within-10-years-report-predicts\">long-term shift in shopping habits</a>, as consumers increasingly shop online rather than visit local stores.

Retail sales had also risen in June, by 1%. \u201cGranted, Amazon\u2019s Prime Day, which the retailer has run every July since 2015, probably was chiefly responsible for the colossal 6.9% month-to-month rise in non-store sales, which made a 0.7 percentage-point contribution to growth in total sales,\u201d he said. \u201cSales volumes likely will fall back in August, given that some shoppers probably brought forward planned purchases to take advantage of the temporary discounts offered by Amazon. Nonetheless, we still think consumers can be relied upon to steady the ship.\u201d Others said consumer spending also got a lift from the heatwave in July, and were sceptical that consumers would keep spending as much, as the 31 October Brexit deadline moved closer. Gabriella Dickens, the assistant economist at Capital Economics, predicted household spending would hold up as long as a no-deal Brexit could be avoided. \u201cThe outlook further ahead depends on what happens with Brexit. If there is a no deal Brexit, consumer spending growth would probably fall,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "Poor Dominic Cummings. Throughout his career, he has been surrounded by idiots. The \u201cgrotesque incompetents\u201d who blocked his agenda at the Department for Education. The \u201cdysfunctional egomaniacs\u201d who undermined his work for Vote Leave. The \u201cconspiracy network\u201d that has been out to get him since he won the EU referendum. The \u201cnarcissist-delusional\u201d members of the European Research Group who messed up his beautiful vision of Brexit. And now he is working with Boris Johnson at No 10. New Labour was heralded by intellectuals such as Will Hutton and Anthony Giddens. In their place, Johnson has Cummings. And, as a guide to his thinking, we have Cummings\u2019s blog. He started it five years ago and has used it as a dumping ground for his thoughts. All of his thoughts. Some entries are only a few lines long while others stretch to 10,000 words. The whole thing, including attachments, has a higher word count than Ulysses. Like Ulysses, it is both focused and digressive, obsessive and uncontainable; all emphatic italics and BLOCK CAPS and (1) numbered points leading to (2) apocalyptic conclusions. Cummings studied history at Oxford but writes knowingly about subjects from bio-engineering to space exploration. His style oscillates between the academic and the hard-boiled. He suggests \u201cbunging a few million quid\u201d to someone to liven up the civil service; claims that \u201cgreat unconventional hookers and a bit of imagination \u2026 get you into pretty much anywhere\u201d; and wonders \u201cwhat is to stop someone sending a drone swarm across the river and bombing parliament during PMQs\u201d.

It is not just his CV that distinguishes him from most politicians. He is not afraid to speak his mind. In fact, he cannot pass a sacred cow without shooting it.

The statistics for England and Wales \u2013 which show a 16% increase in deaths from drug poisoning in 2018, the highest annual leap since records began \u2013 come weeks after figures revealed Scotland\u2019s drug-related death toll had also reached record levels. The latest figures also highlight a north-south divide, with deaths in the north-east higher than any other English region or in Wales. Drug treatment experts, including the Royal College of Psychiatrists, reacted angrily to the data, accusing the government of putting people\u2019s lives at risk by cutting funding of vital treatments services.

More than half of the deaths, or 2,208, involved an opiate such as heroin, while deaths from psychoactive substances formerly known as legal highs doubled to 125. There were 637 deaths related to cocaine, almost double the number registered in 2015 when there were 320, and the seventh annual rise in succession.

Scotland\u2019s drug-related death toll increased by 27% over the past year to reach a record high of 1,187, according to data released in July, putting the country on a par with the US in per capita terms. The Scottish government has renewed calls for more powers to be devolved to Holyrood which it believes will allow it to take measures that would reduce the number of fatalities.

We too could one day reach the dizzy heights of a guest feature with N-Dubz.</p> \n<p>Over the course of this <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/felix-and-the-scootermen-self-help-yourself-famous\">Edinburgh festival show</a>, the motivational wheels (intentionally) come off. The bullet points are muddled by Broadway musical dream sequences, the arrival of a robotic sexual predator and Felix\u2019s revelations about soiling himself live on BBC Radio 1. Between the illiberal use of tasers and bitter asides about their savage rivalry with Scouting for Girls, stains begin to appear on the gleaming veneer of fame: the shallowness, exploitation and precariousness of flash-in-the-pan success, the inability to complain \u201cbecause you\u2019re so lucky to be there\u201d, the depths to which you\u2019ll stoop to cling on for another 15 minutes and the delectation a bloodthirsty world finds in watching you fall.</p> \n<p>By the end, the wannabe starlet may begin to suspect that the ladder to fame is built with the bones of a million <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/oct/29/tvandradio.columnists\">Chicos</a>, and leads to nothing but a long drop into psychological Armageddon. The show is a stark warning for an entire generation dreaming of Instagramming, YouTubing or sex-on-TVing their way to stardom.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"537485f4d8b7d279b4a207799930169c1b20ccb3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/537485f4d8b7d279b4a207799930169c1b20ccb3/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Irwin Sparkes on stage with the Hoosiers in 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Irwin Sparkes on stage with the Hoosiers in 2008.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Christophe Bott/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI remember the exact moment,\u201d says the <a href=\"https://www.thehoosiers.com/\">Hoosiers</a>\u2019 singer Irwin Sparkes, who plays Felix, recalling his own peak of success. \u201cWe came off tour, we got the text from our product manager saying: \u2018Congrats! You\u2019re No 1!\u2019 We made a show about all these shameful things that happened to us along the way but this was one we couldn\u2019t fit in, me looking at the phone and going: \u2018The only way is down\u2019. That was my first thought. What a dick! We\u2019d tried so hard to get there but the anxiety I felt from \u2018You\u2019re No 1\u2019! Who do I think I am, Michael Jackson?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the brutal reality of mental health for us,\u201d adds Delamere, AKA Hoosiers drummer Alan Sharland. \u201cYou go: \u2018I\u2019ve got everything I wanted and I\u2019ve hit my peak yet I still feel sad\u2019. It\u2019s a horrible industry, it\u2019s brutal.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cWe pretty much got dropped because our first single from the second album went to No 11 and they wanted Top 10,\u201d Irwin recalls. \u201cFor us, you were picked up and dropped, you\u2019re commoditised. There\u2019s no duty of care. No one\u2019s got your back, because you\u2019ve got this very narrow window to clamber through. It\u2019s not like we went to Afghanistan: we had a No 1 album, poor us. But the thing that you think would make you happy and be amazing can turn sour. It leaves you in this weird existential place of going: \u2018This thing I\u2019ve always wanted, I\u2019ve tasted it and I\u2019m still here\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\">

      "bodyText": "Felix Scoot and Lee Delamere, from one-time chart-toppers Felix &amp; the Scootermen, arrive on space hoppers, launch into a dance routine and bounce up the aisles chanting \u201cFame is good!\u201d They are presenting a motivational TED talk entitled Self-Help Yourself Famous, with a five-step plan to give us talentless no-marks a leg up the ladder to celebrity. We too could one day reach the dizzy heights of a guest feature with N-Dubz. Over the course of this Edinburgh festival show, the motivational wheels (intentionally) come off. The bullet points are muddled by Broadway musical dream sequences, the arrival of a robotic sexual predator and Felix\u2019s revelations about soiling himself live on BBC Radio 1. Between the illiberal use of tasers and bitter asides about their savage rivalry with Scouting for Girls, stains begin to appear on the gleaming veneer of fame: the shallowness, exploitation and precariousness of flash-in-the-pan success, the inability to complain \u201cbecause you\u2019re so lucky to be there\u201d, the depths to which you\u2019ll stoop to cling on for another 15 minutes and the delectation a bloodthirsty world finds in watching you fall. By the end, the wannabe starlet may begin to suspect that the ladder to fame is built with the bones of a million Chicos, and leads to nothing but a long drop into psychological Armageddon. The show is a stark warning for an entire generation dreaming of Instagramming, YouTubing or sex-on-TVing their way to stardom. \u201cI remember the exact moment,\u201d says the Hoosiers\u2019 singer Irwin Sparkes, who plays Felix, recalling his own peak of success. \u201cWe came off tour, we got the text from our product manager saying: \u2018Congrats! You\u2019re No 1!\u2019 We made a show about all these shameful things that happened to us along the way but this was one we couldn\u2019t fit in, me looking at the phone and going: \u2018The only way is down\u2019. That was my first thought. What a dick! We\u2019d tried so hard to get there but the anxiety I felt from \u2018You\u2019re No 1\u2019! Who do I think I am, Michael Jackson?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the brutal reality of mental health for us,\u201d adds Delamere, AKA Hoosiers drummer Alan Sharland. \u201cYou go: \u2018I\u2019ve got everything I wanted and I\u2019ve hit my peak yet I still feel sad\u2019. It\u2019s a horrible industry, it\u2019s brutal.\u201d \u201cWe pretty much got dropped because our first single from the second album went to No 11 and they wanted Top 10,\u201d Irwin recalls. \u201cFor us, you were picked up and dropped, you\u2019re commoditised. There\u2019s no duty of care. No one\u2019s got your back, because you\u2019ve got this very narrow window to clamber through. It\u2019s not like we went to Afghanistan: we had a No 1 album, poor us. But the thing that you think would make you happy and be amazing can turn sour. It leaves you in this weird existential place of going: \u2018This thing I\u2019ve always wanted, I\u2019ve tasted it and I\u2019m still here\u2019.\u201d A sideline to their continuing music career rather than a reboot, Self-Help Yourself Famous began life \u201cat our zenith, so eight minutes into the summer of 2007\u201d, when the pop-rockers topped the UK album chart with their debut The Trick of Life.

      "body": "<p>Part of the appeal of Jackie Kay\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/07/jackie-kay-adoption-on-stage-pay-rise-successor-scotland-national-poet-scandal-five-grand\">memoir</a> is the way it loops through time. It\u2019s called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/26/red-dust-road-jackie-kay\">Red Dust Road</a>, but the poet\u2019s path to discovering her birth parents is anything but straight. In chapters that jump backwards and forwards, from her first adult encounter with her birth mother to her childhood experience of racist taunting, the book takes a circuitous route. It has the impressionistic quality of a collage, as if to reflect the nebulous nature of identity.</p> \n<p>The structure is such an integral feature of the book that playwright <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/feb/14/tanika-gupta-playwright\">Tanika Gupta</a> has good reason to hold on to it in this adaptation for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/national-theatre-scotland\">National Theatre of Scotland</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/home-in-manchester\">Home, Manchester</a>. Thus, Sasha Frost, playing Kay with a sense of curiosity, humour and vulnerability, goes through a nonlinear sequence of scenes that feels dreamy and elliptical. One minute, she\u2019s standing alone beneath a spotlight in Lizzie Powell\u2019s brooding lighting design, the next she\u2019ll be surrounded by black feminist activists, meeting long-lost family in Nairn, discovering her birth father in Nigeria or getting involved with her adoptive parents\u2019 communist campaigning.</p> \n<p>Faithful though it is, the approach has limitations on stage. Away from the intimacy of the book, Kay\u2019s dilemma becomes less apparent. She is an adopted child from a loving home who is nonetheless in search of self-definition, hoping that finding her birth parents will fill an emotional void. But articulating her yearning is not so easy in a theatrical setting. As a play, her story is high on incident but low on dramatic conflict. You lose sight of the problem that needs to be resolved.</p> \n<p>The weakness is exacerbated by the structure. When scenes jump in time, they not only tend to repeat information we already know but drift towards the inconsequential. To hear Kay\u2019s adoptive family recite the whole of Robert Burns\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poem/address-haggis/\">Address to a Haggis</a> might tell us about their camaraderie, but does nothing to move the story forward. Theatre thrives in the present tense, but here the past drags on the play\u2019s momentum. Rather than spin impressionistically, it seems arbitrary and unfocused.</p> \n<p>It doesn\u2019t help that Dawn Walton\u2019s production feels like a studio play cast adrift on the main stage. Despite the imposing picture frame at the back of Simon Kenny\u2019s set, its sides morphing into a knotty trunk to create a literal family tree, the action is restrained and domestic. Kay\u2019s journey of discovery is played out in quiet exchanges in living rooms where people show each other photographs and reflect on the old days. In other circumstances, you\u2019d criticise the scene of 1980s disco dancing for going on too long (why the whole song?), but here you welcome it for breaking the pattern. There\u2019s an awful lot of sitting on chairs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"78adf7a8-43b9-487c-bf2e-3087ad01787e\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n

      "bodyText": "Part of the appeal of Jackie Kay\u2019s memoir is the way it loops through time. It\u2019s called Red Dust Road, but the poet\u2019s path to discovering her birth parents is anything but straight. In chapters that jump backwards and forwards, from her first adult encounter with her birth mother to her childhood experience of racist taunting, the book takes a circuitous route. It has the impressionistic quality of a collage, as if to reflect the nebulous nature of identity. The structure is such an integral feature of the book that playwright Tanika Gupta has good reason to hold on to it in this adaptation for the National Theatre of Scotland and Home, Manchester. Thus, Sasha Frost, playing Kay with a sense of curiosity, humour and vulnerability, goes through a nonlinear sequence of scenes that feels dreamy and elliptical. One minute, she\u2019s standing alone beneath a spotlight in Lizzie Powell\u2019s brooding lighting design, the next she\u2019ll be surrounded by black feminist activists, meeting long-lost family in Nairn, discovering her birth father in Nigeria or getting involved with her adoptive parents\u2019 communist campaigning. Faithful though it is, the approach has limitations on stage. Away from the intimacy of the book, Kay\u2019s dilemma becomes less apparent. She is an adopted child from a loving home who is nonetheless in search of self-definition, hoping that finding her birth parents will fill an emotional void. But articulating her yearning is not so easy in a theatrical setting. As a play, her story is high on incident but low on dramatic conflict. You lose sight of the problem that needs to be resolved. The weakness is exacerbated by the structure. When scenes jump in time, they not only tend to repeat information we already know but drift towards the inconsequential. To hear Kay\u2019s adoptive family recite the whole of Robert Burns\u2019s Address to a Haggis might tell us about their camaraderie, but does nothing to move the story forward. Theatre thrives in the present tense, but here the past drags on the play\u2019s momentum. Rather than spin impressionistically, it seems arbitrary and unfocused. It doesn\u2019t help that Dawn Walton\u2019s production feels like a studio play cast adrift on the main stage. Despite the imposing picture frame at the back of Simon Kenny\u2019s set, its sides morphing into a knotty trunk to create a literal family tree, the action is restrained and domestic. Kay\u2019s journey of discovery is played out in quiet exchanges in living rooms where people show each other photographs and reflect on the old days. In other circumstances, you\u2019d criticise the scene of 1980s disco dancing for going on too long (why the whole song?), but here you welcome it for breaking the pattern. There\u2019s an awful lot of sitting on chairs. Much of Kay\u2019s wry, observational humour does make the transition, however, and the cast do a pleasing job of populating the poet\u2019s world. Elaine C Smith and Lewis Howden have an instinctive feel for the old-school socialist values of her adoptive parents, while Stefan Adegbola captures the mysterious distance of a birth father who cares more about her as a potential recruit to Christianity than as an estranged daughter. By contrast, Irene Allan is touchingly lost as her birth mother. But despite the charm and sparkle of Frost\u2019s central performance, it\u2019s an underwhelming voyage of discovery.

One state legislature after another has passed right-to-work laws to undermine unions. Donald Trump has taken numerous anti-worker actions: scrapping several worker safety rules, rolling back a regulation extending overtime pay to millions more workers, and killing a rule that required Wall Street firms to act in the best interests of workers when overseeing their 401(k) plans. Trump has even nominated as labor secretary a lawyer who has spent decades fighting on behalf of corporations to weaken worker protections.</p> <p>In my new book, <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/246798/beaten-down-worked-up-by-steven-greenhouse/9781101874431/\">Beaten Down, Worked Up: The Past, Present, and Future of American Labor</a>, I explain that there is a little-understood, but profound reason why all these anti-worker actions are happening: America\u2019s unions and workers have less power in policymaking and the workplace than they have in decades. Indeed, the percentage of workers in unions is at its lowest level in over a century \u2013 down to 10.5% from a peak of 35%. All this helps explain why wages have stagnated for decades, income inequality has soared and corporations and billionaire donors have undue sway over our politics, policymaking and political appointments.</p> <p>In the 2015\u201316 election cycle, <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/blio.php?cycle=2016\">business outspent unions </a><a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/blio.php?cycle=2016\">16</a><a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/blio.php?cycle=2016\">-to-1</a> \u2013$3.4bn to $213m \u2013 according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

This has made many in Congress far more attentive to corporations than to workers, thus the rush to cut corporate taxes, but the failure to increase the minimum wage.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Each year, all of the nation's unions spend about $48m on lobbying in Washington, while corporate America spends more than $2.5bn</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Something urgent needs to be done to give America\u2019s workers more say in our politics so that their voices are not dwarfed by billionaires such as the Koch Brothers and Sheldon Adelson. How to do this? We should greatly expand public financing in political campaigns to amplify the voice of workers and non-affluent Americans. Under a New York City measure approved in 2018, campaign donations up to $250 <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-pol-charter-revision-ballot-questions-20181106-story.html\">are matched 8-to-1</a> in mayoral and city council races. Seattle has an innovative program, <a href=\"http://www.seattle.gov/democracyvoucher\">called Democracy Vouchers</a>, that enables even low-wage workers to donate to campaigns. Voters are given four vouchers of $25 each that they can contribute to city council and mayoral candidates. Good ideas like these should be extended to presidential, Senate, and House campaigns. Early this year the House of Representatives approved a smart proposal to offset wealthy donors\u2019 inordinate influence in House campaigns. If candidates <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/08/would-every-small-dollar-donated-be-matched-under-house-democratic-plan/?utm_term=.8fdc8ef10157\">agree not to accept donations of </a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/08/would-every-small-dollar-donated-be-matched-under-house-democratic-plan/?utm_term=.8fdc8ef10157\">more than $1,000</a>, every donation they receive up to $200 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/house-democrats-anticorruption-voting-rights.html\">would be matched 6-to-1</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/house-democrats-anticorruption-voting-rights.html\"> by public funds.</a></p> <p>As for giving workers more voice in the workplace, probably the quickest, most surefire way would be to let workers elect members to corporate boards \u2013 Elizabeth Warren has proposed having <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/12/31/warrens-agenda-break-up-monopolies-give-workers-control-over-corporations-fight-big-pharma/?utm_term=.f961b5381c13\">workers elect 40%</a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/12/31/warrens-agenda-break-up-monopolies-give-workers-control-over-corporations-fight-big-pharma/?utm_term=.f961b5381c13\"> of board members</a>. Whether it comes to freezing wages or moving operations to China or Mexico, American corporations often pay little heed to what\u2019s best for workers. The picture is very different in Germany. There workers elect nearly half the directors of corporations\u2019 guiding supervisory boards. That\u2019s a major reason German companies often embrace policies far friendlier to workers than do American companies: they invest far more in worker training and do far less offshoring than their American counterparts.</p> <p>Another important way to rebuild worker power would of course be to make it easier for workers to unionize. When America\u2019s workers mount unionization drives, the playing field is usually tilted hugely in favor of corporations. Managers have access to workers 24/7 and often show antiunion videos in lunchrooms and break rooms. They often require employees to attend meetings where high-priced consultants tell workers that unions are corrupt and only want their dues money and that companies have shuttered workplaces like theirs after unionizing. Meanwhile, corporations, thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1991/90-970\">supreme </a><a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1991/90-970\">court\u2019s Lechmere ruling</a>, have the right to prohibit union organizers from setting foot on company property.</p> <p>Workers deserve a fairer shot. If an employer requires employees to attend hour-long meetings to hear anti-union consultants, union organizers should be given equal access, either to speak at such a meeting or have equal time with employees. Union organizers should also be allowed to distribute flyers and talk to workers in parking lots and lunchrooms. The corporate-friendly supreme court has ruled that employers\u2019 property rights trump workers\u2019 rights, but with things so skewed against unions and workers, Congress and the courts should adjust that balance.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The corporate-friendly supreme court has ruled that employers' rights trump workers' rights, Congress and the courts should adjust that balance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many companies denounce card check, a practice in which companies grant union recognition once a majority of workers sign pro-union cards. With scant evidence, corporate lobbyists say \u201cunion thugs\u201d bully workers into signing those cards, and they argue that granting union recognition based on a simple majority of cards signed should not be allowed because, they say, some of the signatures were <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/jobs-and-labor/report/unions-know-card-check-does-not-reveal-employees-free-choice\">undoubtedly coerced</a>. To overcome these concerns, no matter how unsubstantiated, Congress should enact a law requiring employers to grant union recognition and bargain when 60% of workers sign pro-union cards.</p> <p>Researchers have found that <a href=\"http://cepr.net/documents/publications/unions_2007_01.pdf\">nearly 20%</a><a href=\"http://cepr.net/documents/publications/unions_2007_01.pdf\"> of employees leading unionization drives are fired</a> during those drives, a percentage that is so high because the punishment is so minuscule. Under the National Labor Relations Act, companies can\u2019t even be fined for violating workers\u2019 rights, and as a result, it\u2019s almost foolhardy for anti-union companies not to fire the two or three workers leading an organizing effort. Such illegal firings often snuff out unionization campaigns \u2013 the National Labor Relations Board might order the lawbreaking company to pay $5,000 or $10,000 in back wages two or three years later, but that is often long after the union drive has fizzled.</p> <p>For a major company, such modest fines are hardly a slap on the wrist. To deter frequent anti-union lawbreaking by employers, the NLRA should be strengthened so it has real teeth. To deter unlawful firings for union activity, the NLRA should have fines that bite: $100,000 for a first firing, $200,000 for a second one, and increasing from there.</p> <p>If companies egregiously violate labor laws by firing the workers spearheading a union drive, then corporate executives should also face penalties with real bite, such as large personal fines. It shouldn\u2019t be just the pro-union workers whose lives are turned upside down. There also needs to be swifter and surer means to reinstate union supporters who are improperly fired during organizing drives.</p> <p>For the past four decades, America\u2019s corporations and conservative politicians have often worked hand in hand to hobble labor unions. The result has been clear: reduced bargaining power and political power for workers overall. Turning that around won\u2019t be easy, but it is vital we do so if we as a nation hope to reduce income inequality and create a fairer more democratic nation.</p>",

Their peaceful protest turned bloody when Manchester magistrates ordered Yeoman \u2013 a private militia paid for by rich locals \u2013 to storm the crowd with sabres.</p>\n    <p>Most historians agree that 14 people were definitely killed in the massacre \u2013 15 if you include the unborn child of Elizabeth Gaunt, killed in the womb after she was beaten by constables in custody. A further three named people are believed to have either been stabbed or trampled to death.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is it called Peterloo?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The name was first coined five days after the massacre by James Wroe, editor of the Manchester Observer, the city\u2019s first radical newspaper (no relation to the Observer of today). According to historian Robert Poole, Peterloo was \u201ca bitter pun, comparing the cowardly attacks by the Yeomanry and soldiers on unarmed civilians to the brutality suffered at Waterloo.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What did the protesters want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>They wanted political reform. The years leading up to Peterloo had been tough for working class people and they wanted a voice in parliament to put their needs and wants on the political agenda, inspired by the French Revolution across the Channel. Machines had begun to take jobs in the lucrative cotton industry but periodic trade slumps closed factories at short notice, putting workers out on the street. The Napoleonic Wars, which ended in 1815 with the Battle of Waterloo, had taken a heavy toll on the nation\u2019s finances, and 350,000 ex-servicemen returned home needing jobs and food. Yet those in power seemed more interested in lining their own pockets than helping the poor.</p>\n    <p>At that point, only the richest landowners could vote, and large swathes of the country were not represented in Westminster. Manchester and Salford, which then had a population of 150,000, had no MP, yet Oxford and Cambridge Universities had their own representation. At the time the extension of the vote to all men, let alone women, was actively opposed by many who thought the vote should be restricted to those of influence and means.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is Peterloo important?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>It paved the way for parliamentary democracy and particularly the Great Reform Act of 1832 which created new parliamentary seats, particularly in the industrial towns of the north of England. It also led to the establishment two years later of the Manchester Guardian by John Edward Taylor, a 28-year-old English journalist who was present at the massacre and saw how the \u201cestablishment\u201d media sought to discredit the protesters.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/helenpidd\"><b>Helen Pidd</b></a>, <i>North of England editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It was there where I first heard of Peterloo. \u201cPeterloo, Peterloo,\u201d was often the subject of fierce conversation and denunciation. There were four of them in the cellar, in addition to an old woman who, sitting in the middle of the semi-subterranean workshop, wound coarse weft bobbins for them on a wooden wheel and spindle. Joss Wrigley was the leader of the poverty-stricken group. My father was the owner of the looms, all bought for a few shillings, and rented to the other three weavers for a few pence a week. Joss was a great talker. Ned Greenhalgh \u2013 gentle Ned \u2013 was a listener who nodded approval of Joss\u2019s political outbursts. Nathan Clegg, who occasionally varied his weaving by a short term in the Debtors\u2019 Gaol at Lancaster, helped Joss by swearing at capitalists and shopkeepers. Mary Miller, the bobbin-winder, sometimes shook with fear at the thought of what might be their plight if the police were to look in. Joss Wrigley had decorated \u2013 he called it decorated \u2013 one of his loom posts with verses from Ebenezer Elliott and democratic songs of Burns, cut from newspapers.</p> \n<p>My father sometimes played the fiddle to soothe their nerves \u2013 played old English airs and Jacobite songs. There was a stove in the cellar, which was lighted when they could afford to buy coal. I used to hear most about Peterloo when the looms were silent and the stove was burning and the decrepit weavers were \u201cwinding on\u201d a new warp by candlelight. One of them would guide the threads through the healds, two would sit on each side straightening the yarn and picking out foreign particles; Joss Wrigley usually sat on a stool unfolding the warp, and, having the least responsible task, he would talk the most.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/04/peterloo-massacre-bloody-clash-that-changed-britain\">The bloody clash that changed Britain</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It was then that \u201cPeterloo\u201d rang mostly in my ears. Often I wondered where Peterloo was till I learned it was at Manchester, a few miles away. Frequently I was puzzled to know why it was that they spoke so bitterly of it. Subsequently, I was informed that Joss Wrigley knew all about it, because he was there in support of the People\u2019s Charter, as Joss described it. Joss was a slim, nervous man with white hair and long beard; for a man of 77 years he was still sprightly physically and alert mentally. It was from these older time weavers\u2019 lips I first heard the names of Sam Bamford and Henry Hunt.</p> \n<p>I remember saying to my father one morning when he was playing his well-resined fiddle, \u201cWhat was this Peterloo about? \u201cAsk Joss,\u201d he said, \u201cIt were afore my time. Joss were theer. Fro\u2019 what he says, it were a damnable thing \u2013 summat as workin\u2019 folk should never forget!\u201d</p> \n<p>I was now particularly curious to know. And one day when Joss came from the cellar into the kitchen to beg some tea to drink with a meal of bread and cheese I put the question \u2013 boy-like \u2013 bluntly to him. I have never forgotten some of his Doric phrases. He drew me between his knees, and said, partly with pride and partly with indignation:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Peterloo, lad! I know. I were theer as a young mon. We were howdin\u2019 a meetin\u2019 i\u2019 Manchester \u2013 on Peter\u2019s Field, \u2013 a meetin\u2019 for our reets \u2013 for reets o\u2019mon, for liberty to vote, an\u2019 speak, and write, an\u2019 be eawrsels \u2013 honest, hard-workin\u2019 folk.

I could not then understand why he, having lived for over fifty years after the event, should still permit it to disturb his mind. I suppose it had got in his blood, and he could not live it out. I presume also that continuous years of poverty, together with years of political injustice and vagaries, and dear food, through which he had lived, had helped to nurse his hatred, which he resolutely passed on to others. His political career began at Peterloo \u2013 a dramatic beginning, to be sure. It ended in a damp, dark handloom cellar, at the age of 81.</p> \n<p><em>This is an edited extract. <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/08/13/Peterloo_13_Aug_1919.jpg\">Read the article in full</a>.</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"106b85deef3b0eb1cfc01e4cd02b0f37490725e6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/106b85deef3b0eb1cfc01e4cd02b0f37490725e6/0_0_1781_1599/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Guardian, 16 August 1919.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"898\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Guardian, 16 August 1919. <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/08/13/Print_Peterloo_16_aug_19.jpg\">Click to see larger image. </a></span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Nelsson/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The meaning of Peterloo</h2> \n<p>by JL Hammond<br>16 August 1919</p> \n<p>The teaching of history has always tended to emphasise the wars which the poor have levied against the rich; it has been inclined to pay less attention to the wars that the rich have levied against the poor. A century ago such a war was in brisk progress in England, and nowhere was it carried on with less scruple or mercy than in Lancashire. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/gnmeducationcentre/john-edward-taylor-peterloo-teaching-resource-gnm-archive\">Peterloo</a> was the most dramatic symbol of that war, and therefore it came to stand, in the imagination not merely of the poor but of the minority of comfortable and educated people who resented such proceedings, for all the abuses and injustices that were associated with the ancient regime in England.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/from-the-archive-blog/2017/nov/15/manchester-guardian-prospectus-1821\">In the wake of Peterloo: the Manchester Guardian prospectus, 1821</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Lord Robert Cecil had a good phrase the other day about people who wanted to perpetuate the war mind. The Peterloo massacre occurred four years after the conclusion of the war with Napoleon. But in the mind of the governing class of England the war with Napoleon was only part of the general struggle against all the forces and desires represented by the French Revolution. Those forces and desires were present in England as they had been in France. Hence the war mind was perpetual. If a man had found himself in Bolton or Oldham in 1813 or in 1819 he would have found himself in a district under military occupation, governed by magistrates who spoke in their letters to the Home Office of the mass of the people of those towns as if they were admittedly a hostile population. These magistrates employed spies, and spies of the most scandalous character, and they were not ashamed of obtaining a conviction on the sole testimony of men whom they knew to be untrustworthy. They were able to lock up men and women under the Vagrancy Acts, and they used this power freely. The Combination Acts made it impossible for a workman to take a single step to improve his position without the risk of prosecution, and by using the Combination Acts against the workmen and allowing the employers to combine openly whenever they liked the magistrates were able to put the great mass of the workpeople entirely under the power of their masters. It is only from a study of the Home Office papers of the period that we can learn how mercilessly the ruling authorities made war on the general body of the Lancashire workpeople a century ago.</p> \n<p><em><a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/08/12/Peterloo_16_Aug_19.jpg\">Continue reading.</a></em></p> \n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/applied-and-social-sciences-magazines/hammond-j-l-and-barbara\">John Lawrence Hammond</a> was a Manchester Guardian special correspondent and leader writer.</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"71e1b7e3b084be52ac130091a7ab84eb31ad533c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71e1b7e3b084be52ac130091a7ab84eb31ad533c/0_0_450_866/260.jpg\" alt=\"The Guardian, 16 August 1919.\" width=\"260\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Guardian, 16 August 1919. <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/08/13/16_Aug_191_peterloo_letter_.jpg\">Click to read the letter.</a></span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Nelsson/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06c25f3d5b7c90492dd6e3525e4f03d77ddf7808\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06c25f3d5b7c90492dd6e3525e4f03d77ddf7808/116_0_3369_2022/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peterloo, a 2018 Film4 production with Rory Kinnear.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peterloo, a 2018 Film4 production with Rory Kinnear.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/Alamy Stock Photo</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Peterloo: the centenary in Manchester \u2013 new attack on democracy</h2> \n<p>18 August 1919</p> \n<p>\u201cPeterloo, 1819: Labourloo 1919.\u201d That was the inscription on one of the banners carried on Saturday in the Peterloo centenary procession. A hundred years had passed since, near the spot where Saturday\u2019s procession assembled, some 60,000 persons gathered together to ask for their elementary political and social rights, were dispersed by cavalry, eleven dead and about 600 wounded remaining on St. Peter\u2019s Field. Though the triumph of their cause was not immediate, if, indeed, it can be said even yet to have arrived, their agitations and sacrifices were not wholly vain, for thirteen years later the Reform Act was on the Statute-book.</p> \n<p>The battle still goes on; Saturday\u2019s demonstrators evidently sees the situation to-day very clearly as a battle, and as nothing less. As much was said in a dozen speeches and written on no few banners. \u201cLabour is the scourge of all wealth,\u201d said one banner. The uncompromising \u201call\u201d was a little startling, and left one hoping that the originator of the phrase had a definition of wealth different from our own.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/20/peterloo-exhibition-targets-new-generation-of-protesters\">Peterloo exhibition targets new generation of protesters</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It was an interesting and motley procession that emerged, in the hot August afternoon, from the cool streets that flow into Albert Square and pieced itself together as it got to Deansgate. Then, with bands playing and banners flying, on foot or in waggonettes, men, women, and children moved southwards down Peter Street. The red bonnet carried on a long pole that came at the head of the procession stopped when the demonstrators were ranged along the Prince\u2019s Theatre and the Free Trade Hall. Here, on the very ground where, a century before, the horror of Peterloo was at that moment being enacted, heads were bared and the \u201cMarseillaise\u201d was sung, and \u201cWe\u2019ll wave the scarlet banner high\u201d went up from a thousand throats.</p> \n<p>This ritual observed, the procession made its way slowly along Oxford Street to Platt Fields. Four platforms were in readiness, and from them a succession of speakers addressed crowds that were smaller than one had expected. Apart from those who had come with the procession, and the customary Saturday afternoon frequenters of the park, but few people seemed to be interested in the demonstration.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d606685f5f86be16467b56b4294a77b19fb2aa7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d606685f5f86be16467b56b4294a77b19fb2aa7/0_194_5078_3048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The Massacre of Peterloo, or Britons Strike Home\u2019, 1819 (1904).

The celebrations showed that the meaning of Peterloo in the democratic movement of to-day was well understood. Peterloo taught the workers that the real enemy of freedom was not fastened up in St. Helena, but was entrenched in their own country. Contrasting the power of the strike with the power of the vote, he asserted that if the workers refused to develop the power of the vote they could not expect to win the better conditions for which the Peterloo martyrs had met.</p> \n<p>Mr. Philip Snowden, who had an enthusiastic reception, said they would do no honour to the memory of those who met on that spot a hundred years ago if their tribute were merely a demonstration. They must honour their memory by taking up and completing their unfinished task. To-day they were having controversies about the respective spheres and the respective utility and value of industrial action and political action. Than had had them all through the century. Unfortunately the great democracy of this country had yet to realise that it was neither by industrial action nor by political action that their salvation was going to be achieved but by a wise and constant combination of the use of both. (Cheers.) It would be time to decry political action when political action had been tried. Parliament was what the people made it. He had no patience with those who condemned the Parliamentary institution until the working people had captured that institution and made the utmost of its possibilities.

I could not understand then why Joss was trembling with rage. I could not then understand why he, having lived for over fifty years after the event, should still permit it to disturb his mind. I suppose it had got in his blood, and he could not live it out. I presume also that continuous years of poverty, together with years of political injustice and vagaries, and dear food, through which he had lived, had helped to nurse his hatred, which he resolutely passed on to others. His political career began at Peterloo \u2013 a dramatic beginning, to be sure. It ended in a damp, dark handloom cellar, at the age of 81. This is an edited extract. Read the article in full. The meaning of Peterloo by JL Hammond 16 August 1919 The teaching of history has always tended to emphasise the wars which the poor have levied against the rich; it has been inclined to pay less attention to the wars that the rich have levied against the poor. A century ago such a war was in brisk progress in England, and nowhere was it carried on with less scruple or mercy than in Lancashire. Peterloo was the most dramatic symbol of that war, and therefore it came to stand, in the imagination not merely of the poor but of the minority of comfortable and educated people who resented such proceedings, for all the abuses and injustices that were associated with the ancient regime in England. Lord Robert Cecil had a good phrase the other day about people who wanted to perpetuate the war mind. The Peterloo massacre occurred four years after the conclusion of the war with Napoleon. But in the mind of the governing class of England the war with Napoleon was only part of the general struggle against all the forces and desires represented by the French Revolution. Those forces and desires were present in England as they had been in France. Hence the war mind was perpetual. If a man had found himself in Bolton or Oldham in 1813 or in 1819 he would have found himself in a district under military occupation, governed by magistrates who spoke in their letters to the Home Office of the mass of the people of those towns as if they were admittedly a hostile population. These magistrates employed spies, and spies of the most scandalous character, and they were not ashamed of obtaining a conviction on the sole testimony of men whom they knew to be untrustworthy. They were able to lock up men and women under the Vagrancy Acts, and they used this power freely. The Combination Acts made it impossible for a workman to take a single step to improve his position without the risk of prosecution, and by using the Combination Acts against the workmen and allowing the employers to combine openly whenever they liked the magistrates were able to put the great mass of the workpeople entirely under the power of their masters. It is only from a study of the Home Office papers of the period that we can learn how mercilessly the ruling authorities made war on the general body of the Lancashire workpeople a century ago. Continue reading. John Lawrence Hammond was a Manchester Guardian special correspondent and leader writer. Peterloo: the centenary in Manchester \u2013 new attack on democracy 18 August 1919 \u201cPeterloo, 1819: Labourloo 1919.\u201d That was the inscription on one of the banners carried on Saturday in the Peterloo centenary procession. A hundred years had passed since, near the spot where Saturday\u2019s procession assembled, some 60,000 persons gathered together to ask for their elementary political and social rights, were dispersed by cavalry, eleven dead and about 600 wounded remaining on St. Peter\u2019s Field. Though the triumph of their cause was not immediate, if, indeed, it can be said even yet to have arrived, their agitations and sacrifices were not wholly vain, for thirteen years later the Reform Act was on the Statute-book. The battle still goes on; Saturday\u2019s demonstrators evidently sees the situation to-day very clearly as a battle, and as nothing less. As much was said in a dozen speeches and written on no few banners. \u201cLabour is the scourge of all wealth,\u201d said one banner. The uncompromising \u201call\u201d was a little startling, and left one hoping that the originator of the phrase had a definition of wealth different from our own. It was an interesting and motley procession that emerged, in the hot August afternoon, from the cool streets that flow into Albert Square and pieced itself together as it got to Deansgate. Then, with bands playing and banners flying, on foot or in waggonettes, men, women, and children moved southwards down Peter Street. The red bonnet carried on a long pole that came at the head of the procession stopped when the demonstrators were ranged along the Prince\u2019s Theatre and the Free Trade Hall. Here, on the very ground where, a century before, the horror of Peterloo was at that moment being enacted, heads were bared and the \u201cMarseillaise\u201d was sung, and \u201cWe\u2019ll wave the scarlet banner high\u201d went up from a thousand throats. This ritual observed, the procession made its way slowly along Oxford Street to Platt Fields. Four platforms were in readiness, and from them a succession of speakers addressed crowds that were smaller than one had expected. Apart from those who had come with the procession, and the customary Saturday afternoon frequenters of the park, but few people seemed to be interested in the demonstration. A Free Trade Hall meeting The Free Trade Hall was filled yesterday afternoon by a mass meeting called by the Manchester and Salford Independent Labour Party Federation to celebrate the centenary. Mr. J H Hudson, who presided, pointed out that the event they were met to commemorate was one of the greatest in the history of the modern democratic movement in England, and said they were fortunate in being able to assemble in a hall built on the site of that event. The celebrations showed that the meaning of Peterloo in the democratic movement of to-day was well understood. Peterloo taught the workers that the real enemy of freedom was not fastened up in St. Helena, but was entrenched in their own country. Contrasting the power of the strike with the power of the vote, he asserted that if the workers refused to develop the power of the vote they could not expect to win the better conditions for which the Peterloo martyrs had met. Mr. Philip Snowden, who had an enthusiastic reception, said they would do no honour to the memory of those who met on that spot a hundred years ago if their tribute were merely a demonstration. They must honour their memory by taking up and completing their unfinished task. To-day they were having controversies about the respective spheres and the respective utility and value of industrial action and political action. Than had had them all through the century. Unfortunately the great democracy of this country had yet to realise that it was neither by industrial action nor by political action that their salvation was going to be achieved but by a wise and constant combination of the use of both. (Cheers.) It would be time to decry political action when political action had been tried. Parliament was what the people made it. He had no patience with those who condemned the Parliamentary institution until the working people had captured that institution and made the utmost of its possibilities. (Hear, hear.)

There is a whole group on the forum <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bridezillas/\" title=\"\">Reddit</a> devoted to tales of so-called bridezillas. Newspapers devour them like a slice of naked wedding cake. Last month, a screengrabbed picture of a text conversation between a bride trying to <a href=\"https://www.indy100.com/article/bride-cousin-fat-shame-bridesmaid-reddit-9002726\" title=\"\">force her cousin to be a bridesmaid</a> before telling her she was \u201ctoo fat anyways\u201d was posted.

Earlier this year was the story of the bride-to-be who asked her pregnant bridesmaid to <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-6900291/Bridesmaid-reveals-bride-asked-abortion-wedding-run-smoothly.html\" title=\"\">consider having an abortion</a> so as not to complicate the dress fittings, and the bride who forced her friends to take a <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2019/01/08/results-are-in-for-the-bride-who-held-a-polygraph-party-to-see-who-snitched-on-her-dress-code-8322974/\" title=\"\">polygraph test</a>. She wanted to find out which one of them had leaked details of her planned dress code, in which colours were allocated according to weight. Whether or not these tales \u2013 usually anonymous \u2013 are true, in WhatsApp groups over the country, women are prefacing any request of their bridesmaids with \u201cnot to be a bridezilla or anything, but \u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t stand for it,\u201d says Mark Niemierko, a wedding planner, of outlandish demands.

      "bodyText": "It is wedding season, and as surely as an Ed Sheeran-soundtracked first dance follows a street-food-truck meal, stories of brides behaving badly are keeping the internet stoked. There is a whole group on the forum Reddit devoted to tales of so-called bridezillas. Newspapers devour them like a slice of naked wedding cake. Last month, a screengrabbed picture of a text conversation between a bride trying to force her cousin to be a bridesmaid before telling her she was \u201ctoo fat anyways\u201d was posted. Another post related how a woman had tried to force her fiance to get a second job to fund their wedding. There was also the story of a woman who posted the picture of her engagement ring \u2013 which once belonged to her partner\u2019s grandmother \u2013 complaining it wasn\u2019t what she had wanted, and the woman who complained her bridesmaids didn\u2019t want to pay for their dresses. Earlier this year was the story of the bride-to-be who asked her pregnant bridesmaid to consider having an abortion so as not to complicate the dress fittings, and the bride who forced her friends to take a polygraph test. She wanted to find out which one of them had leaked details of her planned dress code, in which colours were allocated according to weight. Whether or not these tales \u2013 usually anonymous \u2013 are true, in WhatsApp groups over the country, women are prefacing any request of their bridesmaids with \u201cnot to be a bridezilla or anything, but \u2026\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t stand for it,\u201d says Mark Niemierko, a wedding planner, of outlandish demands. Only recently, he says, he took a bride-to-be to one side and asked her to stop being so rude to his suppliers. When he talks to other people in the industry, they do share stories of overly-demanding brides, though he adds it has become such a well-worn \u2013 and feared \u2013 stereotype that the bridezilla has started to die out.

The worst behaviour he has seen from couples \u201ccomes from being somewhat insecure and more so, keeping up with the Joneses\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has urged Beijing to treat Hong Kong \u201chumanely\u201d in order to reach a trade deal, in his most extensive comments yet on weeks of increasingly violent unrest in the territory. \u201cMillions of jobs are being lost in China to other non-Tariffed countries. Thousands of companies are leaving. Of course China wants to make a deal. Let them work humanely with Hong Kong first!\u201d the US president tweeted. \u201cI have ZERO doubt that if President Xi wants to quickly and humanely solve the Hong Kong problem, he can do it,\u201d he said in a subsequent tweet, suggesting a \u201cpersonal meeting\u201d with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. Trump\u2019s intervention came as footage of paramilitary movements along China\u2019s border with Hong Kong emerged and official Communist party media warned \u201canti-China forces\u201d would be stopped. Satellite footage taken on Monday showed Chinese paramilitary vehicles gathered in a stadium in Shenzhen, a mainland city across the border from Hong Kong. Footage on Thursday showed thousands of military personnel in the stadium. On Wednesday, the official Wechat account of the eastern district of the People\u2019s Liberation Army posted an image of the vehicles in the stadium and with a map marking the distance to the Hong Kong airport, and quoted speeches by former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping that the \u201ccentral government must intervene\u201d in the event of \u201cturmoil\u201d in Hong Kong. The post has since been deleted. The US state department said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the movements along the border and urged Beijing to fulfil its commitments to Hong Kong and allow it a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d under the terms of its return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Chinese state media reported that the mobilisation was for previously planned exercises for the military, based in Shenzhen as well as within Hong Kong, and in more than a dozen cities in China\u2019s Guangdong province, which neighbours the city. State media have previously posted images of military and police exercises, probably intended as a warning to Hong Kong as well as appealing to nationalist audiences in the mainland. Analysts say military intervention would have disastrous results for China as well as Hong Kong. But as the mass protests enter their third month, the warnings from Beijing have grown more trenchant and officials have hinted that military intervention is possible. Chinese officials have described the protests in Hong Kong, which have devolved into frequent clashes between protesters, residents, and the police, as \u201cterrorism\u201d and an effort to topple the government. On Thursday, the People\u2019s Daily, the official voice of the ruling Chinese communist party ran a front-page article criticising protesters who seized a state media reporter during tense confrontations at the Hong Kong airport this week. \u201cWhat they really want to is to fight against Hong Kong and engage in a \u201ccolour revolution,\u201d read the article, among the first to appear on the paper\u2019s front page. The editorial warned the \u201cblack hands\u201d behind the protests that \u201c1.4 billion Chinese people are united and will stop any damage to the country and its people. Dream on.\u201d Despite the warnings from Beijing, protesters and residents continue to rally throughout the city. On Wednesday evening, demonstrators burned joss paper and pointed lasers at a police station in Sham Shui Po in Kowloon, prompting the police to fire teargas in the residential area. Demonstrations by teachers, pet owners, and public transport workers were planned through the rest of the week as well as a large march on Sunday. Protesters have staged 10 weeks of relentless marches and demonstrations to demand greater freedoms in Hong Kong, including rallies that paralysed the semi-autonomous city\u2019s airport, one of the world\u2019s busiest travel hubs. Beijing has accused western countries, in particular the US, for instigating the protests. Chinese officials have not provided concrete evidence of the alleged foreign interference but state media reports and editorials frequently push the narrative. While US lawmakers and officials have issued statements of support for the protests, Trump has remained neutral, referring to the demonstrations as \u201criots\u201d and an internal matter for Beijing. On Tuesday, he said the situation in Hong Kong was \u201ctricky\u201d but hoped it would be resolved \u201cfor liberty\u201d without anyone getting hurt or killed.",

Here\u2019s how he did it. 3) And talking of youthful vigour, can any more superlatives be applied to Simone Biles? Probably, if this brilliant triple double on her floor routine at the US Gymnastics Championships in Kansas City is anything to go by. 4) South African cricket is saying goodbye to two of its greats, Dale Steyn and Hashim Amla, who have each announced their retirement in the past week. A showreel for both would seem in order, and where better to start than to recall their emphatic win at Nagpur in 2010, when Amla flayed India\u2019s attack for 253 and Steyn ripped through the hosts\u2019 batting \u2013 Tendulkar and all \u2013 taking seven for 51. Steyn's pace was a thing of true menace, as Sourav Ganguly discovered here, and Australia discovered in his 10-wicket display at the MCG in 2008. And here he is making Michael Vaughan\u2019s life a misery in 2004 and 2008. Amla, of course, was a supreme stylist with the bat, known most famously perhaps in England for hastening the end of Andrew Strauss\u2019s reign with this triple-century at The Oval in 2012, the same year he took Australia for a peerless 196 in Perth. He could do it in the shortest form too; here he is swatting an effortless 81 for Trinbago Knight Riders in the Caribbean Premier League three years ago. 5) Anyone for Padel? The fast-paced racket sport \u2013 similar to tennis but with a dash of squash thrown in \u2013 can throw up some classic action. Here are three stunning points from the men\u2019s competition in the Cervezas Victoria Mijas Open. 6) Atrocious defending or an outrageous dribble? You decide. Our favourites from below the line last week 1) 2018\u2019s putts of the year, plus tips from Ben Crenshaw. 2) Switzerland\u2019s Gabriela Andersen-Schiess digs deeper than ever in the final lap of the Olympic marathon in 1984. 3) Emanuel Augustus\u2019s incredible fighting style in the ring dissected.

It is a nonsense.\u201d</p> \n<p>But others were more amenable with the SNP and Plaid Cymru responding to say they would be willing to enter talks, although Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid leader, said it was \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d that Corbyn would not support a second referendum first and general election second.</p> \n<p>Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, agreed with Plaid Cymru that the offer of talks was welcome but she argued \u201cholding a general election before a people\u2019s vote is the wrong way around\u201d.</p> \n<p>Ian Blackford, the SNP leader in Westminster, who had previously asked Corbyn to join talks, said: \u201cI am pleased to receive his letter today confirming that Labour will now work with the SNP and others collaboratively to stop the UK government \u2013 but this means Labour needs to get off the fence on Brexit.\u201d</p> \n<p>The others approached for talks were Dominic Grieve, Caroline Spelman, Oliver Letwin and former Conservative Nick Boles, but not any of the Independent Group for Change UK MPs, independent or other former Labour MPs who have left the party. Grieve said he would be \u201cconsidering it with colleagues\u201d but several Conservative would-be rebels told the Guardian they could not contemplate a national unity government that made Corbyn prime minister.</p> \n<p>In his letter, Corbyn said: \u201cThis government has no mandate for no deal, and the 2016 EU referendum provided no mandate for no deal. I therefore intend to table a vote of no confidence at the earliest opportunity when we can be confident of success.</p> \n<p>\u201cFollowing a successful vote of no confidence in the government, I would then, as leader of the opposition, seek the confidence of the House for a strictly time-limited temporary government with the aim of calling a general election, and securing the necessary extension of article 50 to do so.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/14/labour-bloc-plans-radical-move-to-push-through-brexit-deal\">Labour bloc plans 'radical' move to push through Brexit deal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Labour leader said he was offering talks with MPs across the parties in order to build support for a vote of no confidence in the government, although he did not say when this would be brought. The Labour leadership\u2019s argument is that if MPs are serious about stopping a no-deal Brexit then they will have to get behind his plan.</p> \n<p>The opposition could attempt an immediate vote in the first week of September in the hope an election could be fitted in before Brexit deadline day of October 31, but it is not clear there is yet enough support from Conservative backbenchers for this to be successful.</p> \n<p>Corbyn\u2019s letter came on a dramatic day in parliamentary recess, as Johnson ramped up his rhetoric against MPs who are working to block a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n<p>The prime minister was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/14/johnson-sparks-cross-party-backlash-over-brexit-collaboration-claim\">accused of echoing the rhetoric of the second world war</a> as he said some MPs were in \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/14/johnson-hits-out-at-terrible-collaboration-of-mps-and-eu-trying-to-block-brexit\">terrible collaboration</a>\u201d with the EU to prevent the UK leaving on 31 October.</p> \n<p>His comments were an apparent swipe at Philip Hammond, the former chancellor, who on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/14/philip-hammond-mps-can-stop-boris-johnson-delivering-no-deal-brexit\">wrote with 19 colleagues to the prime minister accusing him of setting the bar too high for a deal with the EU</a> and warning that crashing out without a deal would be a betrayal of the referendum result</p> \n<p>One Conservative MP, Guto Bebb, said Johnson\u2019s language was \u201cdespicable\u201d and \u201cabsolutely disgraceful\u201d in light of threats made to some MPs over the issue of Brexit and the murder of Labour\u2019s Jo Cox.</p> \n<p>However, Downing Street sources said Johnson had simply been trying to make the point that the EU is \u201clooking at what is happening here and getting the entirely wrong message that parliament is somehow going to block Brexit on 31 October\u201d, which he claims will make Brussels less likely to offer concessions.</p> \n<p>On a Facebook live stream, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/14/boriss-facebook-pmqs-show-how-politicians-can-bypass-scrutiny\">while answering pre-selected questions from the public</a>, Johnson conceded that the chances are a no-deal Brexit are now becoming more likely, while dismissing the idea that MPs will be able to stop him.</p> \n<p>In a sign that Whitehall preparations are stepping up, the Department of Health and Social Care announced a \u00a325m contract to set up an \u201cexpress freight service\u201d to deliver medicines and medical products into the country in the event of a no-deal Brexit, potentially lasting for up to two years.</p> \n<p>MPs are deeply divided over how and whether it is possible to stop no deal on 31 October but most Conservatives battling that outcome would rather start with legislative options to prevent the UK from crashing out. The primary method would be to amend legislation to mandate the prime minister to seek an extension.</p> \n<p>What the Tories refer to as the \u201cnuclear option\u201d is a vote of confidence in the prime minister, which could bring down the government and give rebels a 14 day period to form a new administration to ask for an extension from the EU. They are also looking at the possibility of trying to use this period to force Johnson as prime minister to seek an extension from the EU, without ousting him from No 10.</p> \n<p>If no MP can win a confidence vote in the fortnight after the first vote, then a general election is triggered. Johnson refused on Wednesday to rule out the idea that he could simply schedule an election for after 31 October, when the UK is due to leave with or without a deal.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think the British public have had a lot of elections and electoral events,\u201d he said when asked if would call one for the days after Brexit. \u201cThere was the election in 2015, the referendum in 2016, another election in 2017.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has called on rebel Tories and opposition leaders to stop a no-deal Brexit by ousting Boris Johnson as prime minister and allowing Labour to form a caretaker government until a general election. The Labour leader proposed that he should lead a temporary administration on a \u201cstrictly time-limited\u201d basis with the aim of calling a general election. His letter threw down the gauntlet to the Lib Dems, the SNP, Plaid Cymru, the Greens and rebel Tories, at a time when MPs opposed to no deal have been discussing a \u201cnational unity government\u201d led by a centrist figure. Corbyn\u2019s proposal makes it clear that the Labour frontbench consider he is the only politician who could lead a caretaker government, rather than a backbench candidate such as Tory veteran Ken Clarke or Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper. Jo Swinson, the leader of the Lib Dems, immediately dismissed the idea that Corbyn could be a caretaker prime minister, saying: \u201cJeremy Corbyn is not the person who is going to be able to build an even temporary majority in the House of Commons for this task \u2013 I would expect there are people in his own party and indeed the necessary Conservative backbenchers who would be unwilling to support him. It is a nonsense.\u201d But others were more amenable with the SNP and Plaid Cymru responding to say they would be willing to enter talks, although Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid leader, said it was \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d that Corbyn would not support a second referendum first and general election second. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, agreed with Plaid Cymru that the offer of talks was welcome but she argued \u201cholding a general election before a people\u2019s vote is the wrong way around\u201d. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader in Westminster, who had previously asked Corbyn to join talks, said: \u201cI am pleased to receive his letter today confirming that Labour will now work with the SNP and others collaboratively to stop the UK government \u2013 but this means Labour needs to get off the fence on Brexit.\u201d The others approached for talks were Dominic Grieve, Caroline Spelman, Oliver Letwin and former Conservative Nick Boles, but not any of the Independent Group for Change UK MPs, independent or other former Labour MPs who have left the party. Grieve said he would be \u201cconsidering it with colleagues\u201d but several Conservative would-be rebels told the Guardian they could not contemplate a national unity government that made Corbyn prime minister. In his letter, Corbyn said: \u201cThis government has no mandate for no deal, and the 2016 EU referendum provided no mandate for no deal. I therefore intend to table a vote of no confidence at the earliest opportunity when we can be confident of success. \u201cFollowing a successful vote of no confidence in the government, I would then, as leader of the opposition, seek the confidence of the House for a strictly time-limited temporary government with the aim of calling a general election, and securing the necessary extension of article 50 to do so.\u201d The Labour leader said he was offering talks with MPs across the parties in order to build support for a vote of no confidence in the government, although he did not say when this would be brought. The Labour leadership\u2019s argument is that if MPs are serious about stopping a no-deal Brexit then they will have to get behind his plan. The opposition could attempt an immediate vote in the first week of September in the hope an election could be fitted in before Brexit deadline day of October 31, but it is not clear there is yet enough support from Conservative backbenchers for this to be successful. Corbyn\u2019s letter came on a dramatic day in parliamentary recess, as Johnson ramped up his rhetoric against MPs who are working to block a no-deal Brexit. The prime minister was accused of echoing the rhetoric of the second world war as he said some MPs were in \u201cterrible collaboration\u201d with the EU to prevent the UK leaving on 31 October. His comments were an apparent swipe at Philip Hammond, the former chancellor, who on Tuesday wrote with 19 colleagues to the prime minister accusing him of setting the bar too high for a deal with the EU and warning that crashing out without a deal would be a betrayal of the referendum result One Conservative MP, Guto Bebb, said Johnson\u2019s language was \u201cdespicable\u201d and \u201cabsolutely disgraceful\u201d in light of threats made to some MPs over the issue of Brexit and the murder of Labour\u2019s Jo Cox. However, Downing Street sources said Johnson had simply been trying to make the point that the EU is \u201clooking at what is happening here and getting the entirely wrong message that parliament is somehow going to block Brexit on 31 October\u201d, which he claims will make Brussels less likely to offer concessions. On a Facebook live stream, while answering pre-selected questions from the public, Johnson conceded that the chances are a no-deal Brexit are now becoming more likely, while dismissing the idea that MPs will be able to stop him. In a sign that Whitehall preparations are stepping up, the Department of Health and Social Care announced a \u00a325m contract to set up an \u201cexpress freight service\u201d to deliver medicines and medical products into the country in the event of a no-deal Brexit, potentially lasting for up to two years. MPs are deeply divided over how and whether it is possible to stop no deal on 31 October but most Conservatives battling that outcome would rather start with legislative options to prevent the UK from crashing out. The primary method would be to amend legislation to mandate the prime minister to seek an extension. What the Tories refer to as the \u201cnuclear option\u201d is a vote of confidence in the prime minister, which could bring down the government and give rebels a 14 day period to form a new administration to ask for an extension from the EU. They are also looking at the possibility of trying to use this period to force Johnson as prime minister to seek an extension from the EU, without ousting him from No 10. If no MP can win a confidence vote in the fortnight after the first vote, then a general election is triggered. Johnson refused on Wednesday to rule out the idea that he could simply schedule an election for after 31 October, when the UK is due to leave with or without a deal. \u201cI think the British public have had a lot of elections and electoral events,\u201d he said when asked if would call one for the days after Brexit. \u201cThere was the election in 2015, the referendum in 2016, another election in 2017. I think what they want us to do is get on and deliver Brexit on 31 October. I never tire of telling you that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d Corbyn wrote to Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, last week demanding that he intervene to make clear the prime minister would not be allowed to do that under purdah rules, which restrict policy-making during election periods. Sedwill replied on Wednesday declining to clarify the purdah rules, saying they would be applied according to the circumstances. A No 10 spokesman responded to Corbyn\u2019s letter saying there was a \u201ca clear choice: either Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister who will overrule the referendum and wreck the economy, or Boris Johnson as prime minister who will respect the referendum and deliver more money for the NHS and more police on our streets\u201d. \u2018This government believes the people are the masters and votes should be respected, Jeremy Corbyn believes that the people are the servants and politicians can cancel public votes they don\u2019t like,\u201d he added.",

Members of the public join the search, and as the narrative swirls through the city, skipping from one household to another and following different women with each new chapter, the reader is also alert for clues, because how else are you supposed to read the story of missing girls?</p> <p>I was so absorbed I forgot to take notes for most of the first half, not so much because of the tension of the search as because each new domestic world was deftly conjured and fresh. We are in Petropavlovsk, on Russia\u2019s far eastern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/sep/25/russia-fishing-kamchatka-bears\" title=\"\">Kamchatka peninsula</a>, where it\u2019s a very long way to any other city; details of daily life will be exotic to most anglophone readers, and the inhabitants, both indigenous and Russian, are shaped by their relationships to Soviet Russia.</p> <p>We pause with students from Even reindeer-herding families from the northern tundra; with the wives and children of men far away for various kinds of work, frustrated and bored by ice and darkness; with the strict, slick women who are succeeding in Putin\u2019s Russia but are subject, in the end, to the same structural inequalities as their less prosperous sisters. Phillips is as attuned to ethnic tensions and class hierarchies as she is to weather and landscape, and all in all it\u2019s a pretty satisfying experience for the reader who enjoys narrative gratification along with vicarious travel, fine prose and thoughtful politics.</p> <p>But there are difficulties with setting a novel in a nation, community and language foreign to the writer and to almost all Anglophone readers. The concerns of this book are timely but also culturally specific \u2013 the narratives of gender, violence and trauma are distinctively those of liberal America. <em>Disappearing Earth</em> speaks from and to #MeToo, from and to women silenced and abused by US rightwing politics. The novel\u2019s refreshing concern for missing indigenous girls as well as the central characters recalls the recent Canadian recognition of the national failure to protect First Nations women and girls from abduction, rape and murder. This is a novel as much about the way infrastructure fails women as about the quest for the lost girls, but I wondered increasingly if Phillips was writing about the wrong infrastructure and the wrong girls.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Landscapes are beautifully rendered; the city, shore, forests and villages are distinctive and memorable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If, as she says in an interview in the Paris Review, \u201cI felt like what I brought to <a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2019/05/13/the-ideal-place-to-disappear-an-interview-with-julia-phillips/\" title=\"\">the story and the place</a> were very much American concerns and American ideas,\u201d why set the novel in Kamchatka? \u201cIt was like this enormous setting for a locked-room mystery,\u201d she remarks, and there lies the problem: Petropavlovsk, the miles of \u201cwilderness\u201d and the herders\u2019 villages appear here as the exotic backdrop for the projection of America\u2019s urgent stories, a setting for tales from somewhere else. Landscapes are beautifully rendered; the city, shore, forests and villages are distinctive and memorable. Like a good tourist, Phillips takes every opportunity to explore her environment, with mountain rescue teams, tourist guides and an ecology research unit as well as the reindeer herders and the urban dog-walkers and fl\u00e2neuses. She can certainly write: characters, dialogue, pacing, the fine balancing of what is shown and what goes unsaid are all done with aplomb.</p> <p>But there\u2019s no essential contradiction between exoticism and good writing, and in my view this novel is both: there\u2019s no space for cultural difference here, no intuition that the lived experiences of women in Kamchatka might require a different vocabulary from those of North America, that readers of a novel set there might reasonably hope to glimpse a different reality. There\u2019s always a conflict, of course, between \u201cothering\u201d and appropriation, between believing that differences of culture, history and language render groups of people incomprehensible to each other and insisting that the whole world is made in the image of one\u2019s own assumptions.

      "body": "<p>Plumes of smoke shroud the summer sky of Iraq\u2019s northern plains, creating an ominous veil of grey. Fires in Nineveh province have broken out on a scale that farmers here describe as unprecedented, turning tens of thousands of acres of wheat and barley fields into barren patches of black.</p> <p>\u201cLook at that, the livelihood of the people is destroyed,\u201d says Jalal Muamah as he picks up a handful of charred barley spikes that pepper his field near the town of Sinjar. \u201cWe won\u2019t have a harvest better than this year, not even in the next hundred years.\u201d</p> <p>Strong rains and a return to relative stability following Islamic State\u2019s territorial defeat had promised to yield a bumper harvest, even raising hopes that Iraq could wean itself off its dependence on crop imports.</p> <p>Iraq\u2019s prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi, said on 16 July that, despite the fires, Iraq had so far produced a record quantity of wheat, adding that only a negligible amount of crops had been destroyed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bf6da298e6d0db18510bc6fc43d4dc14b6148279\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf6da298e6d0db18510bc6fc43d4dc14b6148279/0_111_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Local farmers claim more crops have been burned than government figures reflect\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Local farmers claim more crops have been burned than government figures reflect.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Azad Lashkari/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But testimonies from the ground and data obtained from local officials suggest that the impact of the fires is greater than the government admits. Duraid Hikmat, Nineveh\u2019s director of agriculture, says his province alone had recorded 30,350 hectares (75,000 acres) of scorched crops as of 25 June, four times the figure given by the prime minister for the entire country.</p> <p>While the impact of the fires is plain to see, the causes remain shrouded in mystery.</p> <p>The prime minister attributed the fires largely to accidents, such as sparks from harvesting machines. \u201cMost of the fires were for natural reasons,\u201d Abdul-Mahdi told reporters at a press conference in Baghdad on 16 July. \u201cThe percentage of fires [caused] by criminal activities or terrorism is around 30%.\u201d</p> <p>This narrative is hard to accept for farmers, who say they have never before seen fires on such a scale. Local officials say there has been no thorough investigation into the causes, which has given rise to widespread speculation.</p> <p>The fires have particularly affected Sunni and Yazidi communities that have struggled to recover from years of war and displacement. Near Hawija, one of the last towns to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/iraqi-army-claims-recapture-islamic-state-isis-held-areas-hawija\">freed from Isis</a> \u2013 and a place where militants retain a presence \u2013 farmers braved the threat of guerrilla-style attacks, only to see their harvest go up in flames. In Sinjar, the fires have torched the livelihoods of Yazidis who had begun to return after Isis drove them from their ancestral land in 2014.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s economic warfare between countries so as to force Iraq to import,\u201d says Hikmat.

      "bodyText": "Plumes of smoke shroud the summer sky of Iraq\u2019s northern plains, creating an ominous veil of grey. Fires in Nineveh province have broken out on a scale that farmers here describe as unprecedented, turning tens of thousands of acres of wheat and barley fields into barren patches of black. \u201cLook at that, the livelihood of the people is destroyed,\u201d says Jalal Muamah as he picks up a handful of charred barley spikes that pepper his field near the town of Sinjar. \u201cWe won\u2019t have a harvest better than this year, not even in the next hundred years.\u201d Strong rains and a return to relative stability following Islamic State\u2019s territorial defeat had promised to yield a bumper harvest, even raising hopes that Iraq could wean itself off its dependence on crop imports. Iraq\u2019s prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi, said on 16 July that, despite the fires, Iraq had so far produced a record quantity of wheat, adding that only a negligible amount of crops had been destroyed. But testimonies from the ground and data obtained from local officials suggest that the impact of the fires is greater than the government admits. Duraid Hikmat, Nineveh\u2019s director of agriculture, says his province alone had recorded 30,350 hectares (75,000 acres) of scorched crops as of 25 June, four times the figure given by the prime minister for the entire country. While the impact of the fires is plain to see, the causes remain shrouded in mystery. The prime minister attributed the fires largely to accidents, such as sparks from harvesting machines. \u201cMost of the fires were for natural reasons,\u201d Abdul-Mahdi told reporters at a press conference in Baghdad on 16 July. \u201cThe percentage of fires [caused] by criminal activities or terrorism is around 30%.\u201d This narrative is hard to accept for farmers, who say they have never before seen fires on such a scale. Local officials say there has been no thorough investigation into the causes, which has given rise to widespread speculation. The fires have particularly affected Sunni and Yazidi communities that have struggled to recover from years of war and displacement. Near Hawija, one of the last towns to be freed from Isis \u2013 and a place where militants retain a presence \u2013 farmers braved the threat of guerrilla-style attacks, only to see their harvest go up in flames. In Sinjar, the fires have torched the livelihoods of Yazidis who had begun to return after Isis drove them from their ancestral land in 2014. \u201cThere\u2019s economic warfare between countries so as to force Iraq to import,\u201d says Hikmat. Unverified, shaky videos purportedly showing Iranian-backed armed groups setting fields ablaze have circulated on social media, fuelling conspiracy theories among Sunnis that Shia Iran wants to hamper Iraq\u2019s progress towards self-sufficiency. There is probably no single cause for the fires. Conversations with two dozen farmers and local officials paint a complex picture of a combustible region where land disputes, local grievances, an ongoing Isis insurgency and competition for power between armed groups all provide plausible reasons for arson attacks. In war-ravaged Sinjar, Isis\u2019s 2014 genocide of the Yazidi community has left deep rifts between Arabs and Yazidis, who accuse one another of land grabs. \u201cThere are problems over land between Yazidis and Arabs because of the displacements,\u201d says Lt Col Omar Alla Hassan, who heads the Iraqi army in Sinjar district. \u201cPeople planted fields that aren\u2019t theirs.\u201d Amid political strife, an enduring risk of mines, and lack of services, only 25% of Sinjar\u2019s Yazidiminority have returned to their ancestral land. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a civil defence officer in Nineveh alleged that Yazidi farmers set their unplanted fields alight in a bid to demand compensation from the central government, whom they accuse of chronic neglect. Farmers in rural Kirkuk believe Isis are probably to blame. In a May newsletter, the group claimed responsibility for blazes in Iraq and Syria. \u201cThere\u2019s no one else who can do such a thing,\u201d says Jassem Hussein Ahmed, a farmer from the village of Al-Abbasi who lost a third of his harvest to a fire. No Iranian-backed groups operate in the area, he explained, and an electrical spark was equally improbable as the electricity had been switched off for several hours by the time his fields caught fire. The fires have fuelled the marginalisation of Yazidis and Sunnis, with farmers and officials blaming the Shia-led government in Baghdad for not doing enough to help. In one village north of Mosul, a dozen farmers equipped with nothing but shovels and pieces of clothing rushed to quell the latest fires. Fuelled by strong winds, the flames engulfed their fields in a matter of minutes. A pickup truck carrying canisters of water trailed them as they braved the blaze in already blistering summer temperatures. \u201cThere are no firefighters,\u201d says Thamer Al Abadi, a local civil defence officer, as he coordinates the farmers\u2019 efforts. \u201cWe\u2019re afraid that the fire will reach our houses!\u201d Al Abadi says half of the province\u2019s 50 fire trucks are out of order: \u201cOur capacity is very limited because many of our vehicles were destroyed during the war against Isis.\u201d The perceived lack of support and clarity over whether farmers will receive compensation risks further deepening apprehension towards the central government. \u201cWe blame the government because they haven\u2019t even showed up yet,\u201d says Sami Jassem Mohammed, a farmer from Kirkuk province whose entire crop was scorched. \u201cA lot of farms were burned, but they won\u2019t get anything.

Under current legislation, transgender people have to undergo surgery to affirm their sex, which is often complicated, not conducted in Australia, and not covered by Medicare. In parliament on Thursday, Labor and Greens MPs in favour of the bill spoke of the embarrassment and shame trans and gender diverse people experience for the document not to reflect their identified sex. Often it was personal stories on how the change would directly affect the lives of transgender people, including Isabelle Langley, a student who had sent the parliamentarians a video on the law change.

      "body": "<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m due to start my teacher training in September. Which laptop should I buy on a \u00a3500 budget?<em> </em><strong>Ruqayyah</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>This question comes up every year. Obviously, the answers change as technology moves on. What doesn\u2019t change much, if at all, is the general advice. You can get most of it from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2018/aug/30/whats-the-best-laptop-for-university-under-600\">last year\u2019s answer</a>, though a brief summary might be useful.</p> <p>First, check with your school, university or college to see if they have any particular software requirements, any recommendations, and any special deals with manufacturers offering laptops at a discount. Most offer Microsoft Office free, but ask if this includes the desktop programs. (The <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/office/default.aspx\">free Office 365 Education</a> \u2013 yours for an academic email address \u2013 does not.)</p> <p>Second, if you\u2019re not doing any computer-intensive work such as video editing, almost any laptop with at least 4GB of memory and 64GB of storage will do the job. All the major brands have suitable laptops including Acer, Asus, Dell, HP and Lenovo. You could also consider a refurbished business laptop from <a href=\"https://www.tier1online.com/\">Tier1Online</a>, <a href=\"https://www.morgancomputers.co.uk/c/512/IBM-Lenovo/\">Morgan</a> or similar source. If you take this route, I strongly recommend a ThinkPad from the X or T ranges with an Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, 8GB of memory and an SSD.</p> <p>Third, think about peripherals. You\u2019ll need an external hard drive for backups, though you should also store important files online. For ergonomic reasons, I recommend a laptop riser (or using a pile of books to lift the screen) and an external ergonomic keyboard for home use. It adds up.</p> <p>Fourth, think about support. If you order a laptop online from Dell, HP or Lenovo, you may be able to buy three years of on-site support for a reasonable price. In Lenovo\u2019s case, it can be as little as \u00a361.56. Tier1Online also guarantees machines for three years for a small extra fee, but doesn\u2019t provide on-site support.</p> <h2><strong>How portable?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"538d43627198d0539941584f404163bbe4bd630b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/538d43627198d0539941584f404163bbe4bd630b/2_0_4442_2668/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft Surface Go\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Microsoft\u2019s Surface Go is a small, light, well-made convertible Windows 10 machine that doesn\u2019t break the bank.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Do you want a laptop for use at home or in your digs/flat/etc, or one that you can take to lectures and use around campus? There is scientific evidence that <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/\">students who make notes on paper</a> learn more.</p> <p>Traditionally, students have bought 15.6in laptops as desktop replacements. These machines are fast and cheap, but they are heavy to carry around, and tend to have short battery lives.</p> <p>If you want to take a laptop with you everywhere, look for one with a 10in to 12in screen. Some models double as touch-screen tablets. Some work with a pen or stylus for limited note-taking, drawing diagrams and annotating documents. <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/surface-go/8v9dp4lnknsz?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab\">Microsoft\u2019s Surface Go</a> is a worthy contender.</p> <p>Laptops with 14in screens are a good compromise. New ones have thin bezels so they are no bigger than old 13.3in laptops, and they generally have Full HD (1920 x 1080) instead of HD (1366 x 768) screens. Most are small and light enough to carry around at least part of the time.</p> <p>You can compare 14in and 15.6in laptops at any good computer store or a department store such as John Lewis.</p> <p>I think a 14in laptop is a good choice for most university and college students, but it may not be the best choice for you.</p> <h2><strong>15.6in options</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f62a7369f237f7f80b7f67756dd69fdb5ca8d447\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f62a7369f237f7f80b7f67756dd69fdb5ca8d447/32_37_2336_1403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Lenovo IdeaPad 330S comes with an AMD processor and 15in screen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Lenovo IdeaPad 330S comes with an AMD processor and 15in screen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lenovo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you decide to buy a 15.6in desktop replacement, the IdeaPad 330S 15 has the power.

The cheapest 81FB006QUK has a Ryzen 3 2200U in a rose pink case for \u00a3409.99, but it\u2019s worth paying \u00a3479.99 for the midnight blue 81FB002LUK with a faster Ryzen 5 2500U and Radeon Vega 8 graphics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/04/sign-up-guardian-students-newsletter\">Join us: sign up for the Guardian Students newsletter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These machines are quite sleek, relatively light (from 1.87kg), and good value for money.

However, Argos offers more than a dozen versions of the IdeaPad 330S, so you might find one that suits you.</p> <p>The HP Pavilion 15 is in some respects a nicer machine, with a better screen and better battery life (up to 11 hours). John Lewis has a version with an Intel Core i3-8145U \u2013 which would be fast enough for your needs \u2013 plus 8GB of memory and a 256GB SSD for <a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/hp-pavilion-15-laptop-intel-i3-processor-8gb-256gb-ssd-15-6-full-hd-silver/p4223465\">\u00a3499.95</a>.

Last year, it sold almost as many PCs as Lenovo (56m v 58m) thanks partly to the latest Pavilion laptops, <a href=\"https://press.ext.hp.com/us/en/press-releases/2018/hp-revamps-pavilion-pcs-with-premium-features-and-design.html\">launched in April last year</a>. They have a more premium look and feel, and their metal keyboard decks are distinguished by a geometric grid pattern (speaker grilles) between the keys and the screen.</p> <p>Laptops that sell in large volumes, like the HP Pavilion 14 and Lenovo\u2019s IdeaPad 330S, are available in lots of slightly different versions. This can be confusing, but if you focus on the specifications you care about, you can get the best balance between processor speed, storage and price. I\u2019m linking to Currys PC World for convenience, but you can shop around.</p> <p>The best Pavilions for just under \u00a3500 are the <a href=\"https://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/computing/laptops/laptops/hp-pavilion-14-ce2500sa-14-intel-core-i3-laptop-256-gb-ssd-silver-10193422-pdt.html\">14-ce2500sa</a> (Core i3-8145U, 8GB, 512GB SSD) and the <a href=\"https://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/computing/laptops/laptops/hp-pavilion-14-ce1510sa-14-intel-core-i5-laptop-128-gb-ssd-silver-10189248-pdt.html\">14-ce1510sa</a> (Core i5-8265U, 8GB, 128GB). Personally, I\u2019d go for the extra speed of the Core i5, unless you have a particular need for the extra storage space.</p> <p>You could save \u00a350 by going for the <a href=\"https://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/computing/laptops/laptops/hp-pavilion-14-ce1507sa-14-intel-core-i3-laptop-128-gb-ssd-silver-10188781-pdt.html\">14-ce1507sa</a> (Core i3-8145U, 8GB, 250GB SSD) for \u00a3449. This is slower but should comfortably do what you need.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m due to start my teacher training in September. Which laptop should I buy on a \u00a3500 budget? Ruqayyah This question comes up every year. Obviously, the answers change as technology moves on. What doesn\u2019t change much, if at all, is the general advice. You can get most of it from last year\u2019s answer, though a brief summary might be useful. First, check with your school, university or college to see if they have any particular software requirements, any recommendations, and any special deals with manufacturers offering laptops at a discount. Most offer Microsoft Office free, but ask if this includes the desktop programs. (The free Office 365 Education \u2013 yours for an academic email address \u2013 does not.) Second, if you\u2019re not doing any computer-intensive work such as video editing, almost any laptop with at least 4GB of memory and 64GB of storage will do the job. All the major brands have suitable laptops including Acer, Asus, Dell, HP and Lenovo. You could also consider a refurbished business laptop from Tier1Online, Morgan or similar source. If you take this route, I strongly recommend a ThinkPad from the X or T ranges with an Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, 8GB of memory and an SSD. Third, think about peripherals. You\u2019ll need an external hard drive for backups, though you should also store important files online. For ergonomic reasons, I recommend a laptop riser (or using a pile of books to lift the screen) and an external ergonomic keyboard for home use. It adds up. Fourth, think about support. If you order a laptop online from Dell, HP or Lenovo, you may be able to buy three years of on-site support for a reasonable price. In Lenovo\u2019s case, it can be as little as \u00a361.56. Tier1Online also guarantees machines for three years for a small extra fee, but doesn\u2019t provide on-site support. How portable? Do you want a laptop for use at home or in your digs/flat/etc, or one that you can take to lectures and use around campus? There is scientific evidence that students who make notes on paper learn more. Traditionally, students have bought 15.6in laptops as desktop replacements. These machines are fast and cheap, but they are heavy to carry around, and tend to have short battery lives. If you want to take a laptop with you everywhere, look for one with a 10in to 12in screen. Some models double as touch-screen tablets. Some work with a pen or stylus for limited note-taking, drawing diagrams and annotating documents. Microsoft\u2019s Surface Go is a worthy contender. Laptops with 14in screens are a good compromise. New ones have thin bezels so they are no bigger than old 13.3in laptops, and they generally have Full HD (1920 x 1080) instead of HD (1366 x 768) screens. Most are small and light enough to carry around at least part of the time. You can compare 14in and 15.6in laptops at any good computer store or a department store such as John Lewis. I think a 14in laptop is a good choice for most university and college students, but it may not be the best choice for you. 15.6in options If you decide to buy a 15.6in desktop replacement, the IdeaPad 330S 15 has the power. Lenovo is offering two models with fast AMD Ryzen processors, 8GB of memory, 256GB PCIe SSDs, 1920 x 1080-pixel anti-glare IPS screens and decent keyboards. The cheapest 81FB006QUK has a Ryzen 3 2200U in a rose pink case for \u00a3409.99, but it\u2019s worth paying \u00a3479.99 for the midnight blue 81FB002LUK with a faster Ryzen 5 2500U and Radeon Vega 8 graphics. These machines are quite sleek, relatively light (from 1.87kg), and good value for money. The screens are not great, and battery life can be quite poor, but they are within your budget and should cruise through anything you are likely to throw at them. Currys PC World sells a version of this machine for \u00a3399, but it only has half the memory (4GB) and half the storage (128GB), so it\u2019s not such a good deal. Also, avoid the \u00a3379.99 Argos version with 4GB of memory and a 1366 x 768-pixel screen. However, Argos offers more than a dozen versions of the IdeaPad 330S, so you might find one that suits you. The HP Pavilion 15 is in some respects a nicer machine, with a better screen and better battery life (up to 11 hours). John Lewis has a version with an Intel Core i3-8145U \u2013 which would be fast enough for your needs \u2013 plus 8GB of memory and a 256GB SSD for \u00a3499.95. It\u2019s currently out of stock, but other suppliers have very similar models. 14in laptops The Pavilion range has improved since HP spun off its PC and printer divisions into a separate company, HP Inc, in 2015. Last year, it sold almost as many PCs as Lenovo (56m v 58m) thanks partly to the latest Pavilion laptops, launched in April last year. They have a more premium look and feel, and their metal keyboard decks are distinguished by a geometric grid pattern (speaker grilles) between the keys and the screen. Laptops that sell in large volumes, like the HP Pavilion 14 and Lenovo\u2019s IdeaPad 330S, are available in lots of slightly different versions. This can be confusing, but if you focus on the specifications you care about, you can get the best balance between processor speed, storage and price. I\u2019m linking to Currys PC World for convenience, but you can shop around. The best Pavilions for just under \u00a3500 are the 14-ce2500sa (Core i3-8145U, 8GB, 512GB SSD) and the 14-ce1510sa (Core i5-8265U, 8GB, 128GB). Personally, I\u2019d go for the extra speed of the Core i5, unless you have a particular need for the extra storage space. You could save \u00a350 by going for the 14-ce1507sa (Core i3-8145U, 8GB, 250GB SSD) for \u00a3449. This is slower but should comfortably do what you need. However, you will get worse performance if you drop down to the 14-ce0593sa (Pentium Gold 4415U, 4GB, 128GB SSD) at \u00a3379, and you can\u2019t upgrade the processor later. Typically with these machines, you can remove the single memory module and replace it with a 16GB module. You can also upgrade the M2 SSD, or install a 2.5in SSD. However, if you plan to do either, check the specific model beforehand to make sure it can be upgraded. The Asus VivoBook 14 X420UA is another attempt at providing a premium-styled product at a mainstream price. John Lewis has a version with a slightly old Core i3-7020U for \u00a3399.99 (or \u00a3349.99 on Amazon), but it\u2019s let down by its 4GB of memory. Of course, an ultra-thin ZenBook like the UX410UA (\u00a3499.99) is the Asus of choice. Take a touch With its Yoga range, Lenovo pioneered laptops with 360-degree hinges that rotate for tablet use. I still love the orange (sorry, clementine) 11.6in Yoga 700 I bought for \u00a3339.99 in 2016: it\u2019s light enough to take everywhere, though it\u2019s backed up by a desktop PC for serious use. They are usually more expensive now. The cheapest I can see today is an 11.6in Yoga 330 for \u00a3299.95, \u201creduced to clear\u201d at John Lewis, and that\u2019s blighted by its slow Intel Celeron N4000 processor. Better options include the slightly-less-portable 14in touch-screen Yoga 530 available from Lenovo with what I assume is a Pentium Gold for \u00a3379.99, or a Core i3-8130U for \u00a3469.99. Currys PC World also has this model for \u00a3469. It works with an active pen, not supplied. All these Yoga 530s have 4GB of memory.

      "body": "<p>I took this shot in 1995 in my home studio in Highbury Hill, London. At that point, I was in a liminal state with my gender: I was moving from being perceived as female to being perceived as male, but really I was coming to terms with the fact I was born intersex.</p> <p>I was not transitioning. I had no interest in moving from one fixed point to another. The spaces in-between have always been so much more interesting to me. But this period felt like a turning point in my uncovering the ambiguity in my gender that had always been there. I felt it needed documenting.</p> <p>For my whole life, I was terrified of not being perceived as adequately feminine, both by straight people and by the lesbian community I was a part of. Because of that fear, I had plucked out the hairs sprouting on my chin \u2013 I literally pulled them out with tweezers as soon as they were visible. But I had entered a competition for Drag Kings at the National Film Theatre, and my partner at the time was more into my masculinity than my femininity, so it felt like the right time to come to accept my body.</p> <p>I went to Italy for a month, and let my beard grow out for the very first time. It was intensely liberating. It felt like coming to terms with myself. When I came back to London I kept it. This photo matters to me because it\u2019s ambiguous: I\u2019m sporting the beard, and playing with masculinity in my pose, but the blue mascara in my facial hair and makeup on my face still softens the shot. It felt accurate and honest, in terms of where I was at that period of my life.</p> <p>Self-portraiture is central to my work: it is a way of me understanding, responding to and coming to terms with my difference. I was born with an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/02/male-and-female-what-is-it-like-to-be-intersex\">intersex variation</a>, and when puberty hit I developed asymmetrically: one breast was much larger than the other, for example.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have been photographed and filmed a lot \u2013 and much of it presents an image of me that I find devastating</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For years I hid it. I hid what made me different, and I dealt with years of abuse for looking different, for being a little fat, for not conforming. My mother was gorgeous \u2014 fashion-model beautiful \u2014 and I didn\u2019t take after her. I destroyed almost every picture that survives of me from those years because I felt disgusting.</p> <p>Self-portraiture was a way of letting other people see me as I see myself. It was never a narcissistic project \u2013 I was never interested in being more beautiful or more attractive than other people \u2013 but it was an attempt to recuperate a sense of self and worth after years of that being taken away from me.</p> <p>I have been photographed and filmed a lot during my life, and much of it presents an image of me that I find absolutely devastating. Self-portraiture was me taking a stand, both for myself and people like me who differ from the norm. Because, while I am the subject of much of my work, it isn\u2019t purely about me. When people talk about the self-portraiture or confessional writing, there\u2019s often a pejorative edge to it, as though you\u2019re being self-indulgent or as if there\u2019s something wrong with it.</p> <p>But I think the real question is why you make yourself the subject of your art, and what your goal is. Is it to receive absolution? I don\u2019t need that. Is it to receive attention? Because I already get plenty. For me, I\u2019m presenting myself in the hope that others like me will understand that their difference is valuable, that they can be out and proud and unapologetic, that they do not have to conform.</p> <p>Self-portraiture has been popular among women and queer people and minorities throughout time, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/14/claude-cahun-finding-great\">Claude Cahun</a> last century to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jul/14/zanele-muholi-365-protest-photographs\">Zanele Muholi</a> today. I think for us, and for me, it\u2019s because we realise that the personal is political. This is our form of resistance.</p> <p>There\u2019s now an interest in queer photography and queer photographers. I don\u2019t know how deep that is, or how long it will last. When the year ends and we no longer have the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/19/stonewall-50th-anniversary-night-that-unleashed-gay-liberation\">50th anniversary of Stonewall</a> as a news hook, will the media still make space for us?

I went to Italy for a month, and let my beard grow out for the very first time. It was intensely liberating. It felt like coming to terms with myself. When I came back to London I kept it. This photo matters to me because it\u2019s ambiguous: I\u2019m sporting the beard, and playing with masculinity in my pose, but the blue mascara in my facial hair and makeup on my face still softens the shot. It felt accurate and honest, in terms of where I was at that period of my life. Self-portraiture is central to my work: it is a way of me understanding, responding to and coming to terms with my difference. I was born with an intersex variation, and when puberty hit I developed asymmetrically: one breast was much larger than the other, for example. For years I hid it. I hid what made me different, and I dealt with years of abuse for looking different, for being a little fat, for not conforming. My mother was gorgeous \u2014 fashion-model beautiful \u2014 and I didn\u2019t take after her. I destroyed almost every picture that survives of me from those years because I felt disgusting. Self-portraiture was a way of letting other people see me as I see myself. It was never a narcissistic project \u2013 I was never interested in being more beautiful or more attractive than other people \u2013 but it was an attempt to recuperate a sense of self and worth after years of that being taken away from me. I have been photographed and filmed a lot during my life, and much of it presents an image of me that I find absolutely devastating. Self-portraiture was me taking a stand, both for myself and people like me who differ from the norm. Because, while I am the subject of much of my work, it isn\u2019t purely about me. When people talk about the self-portraiture or confessional writing, there\u2019s often a pejorative edge to it, as though you\u2019re being self-indulgent or as if there\u2019s something wrong with it. But I think the real question is why you make yourself the subject of your art, and what your goal is. Is it to receive absolution? I don\u2019t need that. Is it to receive attention? Because I already get plenty. For me, I\u2019m presenting myself in the hope that others like me will understand that their difference is valuable, that they can be out and proud and unapologetic, that they do not have to conform. Self-portraiture has been popular among women and queer people and minorities throughout time, from Claude Cahun last century to Zanele Muholi today. I think for us, and for me, it\u2019s because we realise that the personal is political. This is our form of resistance. There\u2019s now an interest in queer photography and queer photographers. I don\u2019t know how deep that is, or how long it will last. When the year ends and we no longer have the 50th anniversary of Stonewall as a news hook, will the media still make space for us? Will galleries still show our work? Will audiences who aren\u2019t queer still care? Watch this space. \u2022 Del LaGrace Volcano\u2019s work can be seen at Kiss My Genders at the Hayward Gallery, London, until 8 September.

      "body": "<p>In the summer of 2001, a young first-time film-maker traveled across the US, shooting a documentary about an overlooked subject: black people inside the predominately white punk rock counterculture. Even with the established, historical contributions of African Americans to rock music and outsider culture \u2013 from Jimi Hendrix to Funkadelic \u2013 black people in punk rock was, at the turn of the 21st century, still an unfamiliar and unaddressed topic.</p> <p>Having himself grown up as a black person in the punk scene, James Spooner knew from experience that there was usually at least one black punk kid in every American town, and he sought to amplify their voices, to let them know they weren\u2019t alone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/13/soul-music-racial-tensions-leon-bridges\">'They put us in a little box': how racial tensions shape modern soul music</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn 2001, when I set out to make the documentary, there was a need for it,\u201d Spooner says. \u201cThis conversation wasn\u2019t happening on a broad enough scale. There were always black kids and brown kids peppered throughout the scene, but I literally had to drive across the country just to meet, like, 80 [of them].\u201d</p> <p>Afro-Punk was released in 2003 to wide acclaim. In 2005, Spooner, along with Matthew Morgan, who\u2019d also served as the film\u2019s co-producer, organized the first Afropunk Festival in Brooklyn \u2013 spread out over four days in early July, with performances from black punk bands, film screenings, and an impromptu picnic at Fort Greene Park. The festival has since grown at an exponential rate, with annual festivals not only in Brooklyn, but also Atlanta, London, Paris, and Johannesburg, drawing tens of thousands of attendees.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1c9ae3ab6c7a793f316989d1ce3527e2addbc17e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c9ae3ab6c7a793f316989d1ce3527e2addbc17e/0_0_2640_1760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Spooner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Spooner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of James Spooner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though it could be viewed as a successful model of a global black-owned and black-centered music festival, Afropunk has faced criticisms from the grassroots POC punk community, particularly for its sponsorships from companies like Red Bull and Coors Light; and for promoting fewer punk rock headliners in favor of popular R&amp;B or hip hop acts like Lauryn Hill, Lenny Kravitz, Ice Cube, and Tyler, the Creator. These criticisms even caused the <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/gentrifying-afropunk\">New Yorker to ask in 2015</a> whether Afropunk had abandoned its punk rock roots.</p> <p>\u201cI do think it\u2019s provided a lot of visibility, giving bands a chance to play on the same stage as all of these mainstream musicians,\u201d says the singer Jasmine Nyende of the all-female Los Angeles band Fuck You Pay Us (or Fupu). \u201cBut I think when the mainstream is privileged above the DIY and the grassroots, then it\u2019s not punk any more.\u201d</p> <p>On 30 March, the Texas-based feminist punk collective Xingonas in the Pit (XITP) hosted an event billed \u201cAfropunk in the Pit\u201d. More than 200 attendees crowded into La Botanica, a San Antonio vegan Mexican restaurant, to watch five Texas-based African American punk bands, followed by a screening of the Afro-Punk film, with a talk by Spooner.</p> <p>On 10 April, the collective received an email from Afropunk\u2019s lawyer, Gerard Anthony, declaring that Afropunk was a federally registered trademark owned by Afropunk LLC. Attached to the email was a cease-and-desist letter.</p> <p>\u201cOur trademark serves as an important distinctive representation of our products or services as well as the goodwill of our company,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cWe find it important and necessary to protect it against any misrepresentation that may cause substantial harm to our business or prospective opportunities.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"459c3ce20d75d4937dc0f8e3cfae41d695be1aef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/459c3ce20d75d4937dc0f8e3cfae41d695be1aef/0_0_3000_1996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tyler, the Creator performs during the 12th Afropunk festival in Brooklyn in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tyler, the Creator performs during the 12th Afropunk festival in Brooklyn in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kris Connor/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe will not hesitate to exhaust all legal remedies if you fail to heed this letter,\u201d the letter concluded.</p> <p>Though Afropunk in the Pit had been intended as only a one-time event, intended to celebrate the Afro-Punk film, the experience still shook the XITP collective. They decided to share the letter on social media.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted to be transparent about how hypocritical, how hurtful that was to us,\u201d says Daisy Salinas, a founding member of the collective. \u201cTo be threatening working-class punks of color? Like, how fucking punk.\u201d</p> <p>The Afropunk CEO, Matthew Morgan, explains that any enterprise, whether an individual artist or a global business, has an interest in protecting its brand from misuse.</p> <p>\u201cAfropunk has become a word that people use in popular culture. It becomes descriptive,\u201d Morgan says. \u201cAnd when you have a mark that you\u2019ve spent 20 years building \u2013 if not challenged when people use it, you can lose it. So it becomes something that we have to do, whether we want to do it or not, because, ultimately, if we don\u2019t do it, we will lose the mark.\u201d</p> <p>Whether as a reaction against Afropunk\u2019s perceived betrayal of punk values, a result of today\u2019s political climate, or an increasing demand for visibility for marginalized communities, the past couple of years have been a watershed moment for independent black and brown punk festivals and punk bands of color across the US.</p> <p>Monika Estrella Negra and Dont\u00e9 Oxun, two queer Chicago transplants, wanted to find a way to bring together isolated QTIPOC (queer, trans, and intersex people of color) communities in their adopted city, while also supporting local, radical causes.</p> <p>\u201cI was just like, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be a great idea if we just made our own festival, in order to raise money for grassroots organizations or bail support?\u2019\u201d Etrella Negra tells me. \u201cWe wanted to keep a radical practice in our organizing, and we wanted the idea to spread to other QTIPOC spaces.\u201d</p> <p>Estrella Negra and Oxun started the Black and Brown Punk Show Collective in 2010 and organized the first festival that August, with bands, DJs, artists, and activists of color.</p> <p>Shawna Shawnt\u00e9, a DJ and multimedia artist, was inspired by what she\u2019d seen in Chicago. She returned home to Oakland, California, and, together with the multidisciplinary artist Jade Ariana Fair, organized The Universe is Lit, a three-day festival in August 2017, with music, art, and film, centered on the local QTIPOC community. The festival was rebranded as The Multivrs is Illuminated for its 2018 festival and is planning its next event for August 2020.</p> <p>\u201cEven though we\u2019re including everyone that\u2019s a person of color, we are prioritizing black people,\u201d Shawnt\u00e9 says. \u201cBecause we still need to be seen and to be prioritized and to be acknowledged.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11c3317335805fed2f13eaabb54f74206de7c514\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11c3317335805fed2f13eaabb54f74206de7c514/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maafa performing at the Break Free Fest\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maafa performing at the Break Free Fest</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Farrah Skeiky</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2017, independent black and brown punk festivals launched in three major cities: Deep Cuts in New Orleans; Break Free Fest in Philadelphia; and Decolonize Fest in London, a multi-day festival organized by the London-based collective DIY Diaspora Punx. Decolonize Fest held its third annual festival in June 2019. Break Free Fest also hosted its third festival on Memorial Day weekend 2019.</p> <p>The Break Free Fest organizer Scout Cartagena explains what she sees as the driving force behind her and other independent black and brown festivals: \u201cWe want to be heard, but we also want a space to be joyful without white profit.\u201d</p> <p>Punk Black, an Atlanta-based collective, has held 60 events since 2015, in Atlanta, Brooklyn, Oakland, Chicago, and Washington DC, featuring people of color in music, art, and cosplay. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely in an era where more and more POC are being empowered and empowering themselves through the media,\u201d says Punk Black\u2019s Von Phoenix. \u201cSo this is a great time for all those collectives to spring up.\u201d</p> <p>The upsurge of festivals and collectives of color has also seen a rise of POC punk bands. The Muslims, from Durham, North Carolina, formed shortly after the last presidential election.

He had already begun to distance himself from the Afropunk Festival by 2008, for its increasing reliance on corporate sponsorships; but during the fourth Afropunk Festival, after a rap-reggae band had performed a cover song by the Jamaican dancehall singer Buju Banton, with lyrics espousing violence against gay people, Spooner walked onstage and told the audience that the festival owed all its gains to the contributions of the queer black punk community. He then walked away from the festival for good.</p> <p>\u201cPunk rock has always been reactionary,\u201d he says. \u201cBlack and brown punks didn\u2019t have something to rally against until Afropunk.

      "bodyText": "In the summer of 2001, a young first-time film-maker traveled across the US, shooting a documentary about an overlooked subject: black people inside the predominately white punk rock counterculture. Even with the established, historical contributions of African Americans to rock music and outsider culture \u2013 from Jimi Hendrix to Funkadelic \u2013 black people in punk rock was, at the turn of the 21st century, still an unfamiliar and unaddressed topic. Having himself grown up as a black person in the punk scene, James Spooner knew from experience that there was usually at least one black punk kid in every American town, and he sought to amplify their voices, to let them know they weren\u2019t alone. \u201cIn 2001, when I set out to make the documentary, there was a need for it,\u201d Spooner says. \u201cThis conversation wasn\u2019t happening on a broad enough scale. There were always black kids and brown kids peppered throughout the scene, but I literally had to drive across the country just to meet, like, 80 [of them].\u201d Afro-Punk was released in 2003 to wide acclaim. In 2005, Spooner, along with Matthew Morgan, who\u2019d also served as the film\u2019s co-producer, organized the first Afropunk Festival in Brooklyn \u2013 spread out over four days in early July, with performances from black punk bands, film screenings, and an impromptu picnic at Fort Greene Park. The festival has since grown at an exponential rate, with annual festivals not only in Brooklyn, but also Atlanta, London, Paris, and Johannesburg, drawing tens of thousands of attendees. Though it could be viewed as a successful model of a global black-owned and black-centered music festival, Afropunk has faced criticisms from the grassroots POC punk community, particularly for its sponsorships from companies like Red Bull and Coors Light; and for promoting fewer punk rock headliners in favor of popular R&amp;B or hip hop acts like Lauryn Hill, Lenny Kravitz, Ice Cube, and Tyler, the Creator. These criticisms even caused the New Yorker to ask in 2015 whether Afropunk had abandoned its punk rock roots. \u201cI do think it\u2019s provided a lot of visibility, giving bands a chance to play on the same stage as all of these mainstream musicians,\u201d says the singer Jasmine Nyende of the all-female Los Angeles band Fuck You Pay Us (or Fupu). \u201cBut I think when the mainstream is privileged above the DIY and the grassroots, then it\u2019s not punk any more.\u201d On 30 March, the Texas-based feminist punk collective Xingonas in the Pit (XITP) hosted an event billed \u201cAfropunk in the Pit\u201d. More than 200 attendees crowded into La Botanica, a San Antonio vegan Mexican restaurant, to watch five Texas-based African American punk bands, followed by a screening of the Afro-Punk film, with a talk by Spooner. On 10 April, the collective received an email from Afropunk\u2019s lawyer, Gerard Anthony, declaring that Afropunk was a federally registered trademark owned by Afropunk LLC. Attached to the email was a cease-and-desist letter. \u201cOur trademark serves as an important distinctive representation of our products or services as well as the goodwill of our company,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cWe find it important and necessary to protect it against any misrepresentation that may cause substantial harm to our business or prospective opportunities.\u201d \u201cWe will not hesitate to exhaust all legal remedies if you fail to heed this letter,\u201d the letter concluded. Though Afropunk in the Pit had been intended as only a one-time event, intended to celebrate the Afro-Punk film, the experience still shook the XITP collective. They decided to share the letter on social media. \u201cWe wanted to be transparent about how hypocritical, how hurtful that was to us,\u201d says Daisy Salinas, a founding member of the collective. \u201cTo be threatening working-class punks of color? Like, how fucking punk.\u201d The Afropunk CEO, Matthew Morgan, explains that any enterprise, whether an individual artist or a global business, has an interest in protecting its brand from misuse. \u201cAfropunk has become a word that people use in popular culture. It becomes descriptive,\u201d Morgan says. \u201cAnd when you have a mark that you\u2019ve spent 20 years building \u2013 if not challenged when people use it, you can lose it. So it becomes something that we have to do, whether we want to do it or not, because, ultimately, if we don\u2019t do it, we will lose the mark.\u201d Whether as a reaction against Afropunk\u2019s perceived betrayal of punk values, a result of today\u2019s political climate, or an increasing demand for visibility for marginalized communities, the past couple of years have been a watershed moment for independent black and brown punk festivals and punk bands of color across the US. Monika Estrella Negra and Dont\u00e9 Oxun, two queer Chicago transplants, wanted to find a way to bring together isolated QTIPOC (queer, trans, and intersex people of color) communities in their adopted city, while also supporting local, radical causes. \u201cI was just like, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be a great idea if we just made our own festival, in order to raise money for grassroots organizations or bail support?\u2019\u201d Etrella Negra tells me. \u201cWe wanted to keep a radical practice in our organizing, and we wanted the idea to spread to other QTIPOC spaces.\u201d Estrella Negra and Oxun started the Black and Brown Punk Show Collective in 2010 and organized the first festival that August, with bands, DJs, artists, and activists of color. Shawna Shawnt\u00e9, a DJ and multimedia artist, was inspired by what she\u2019d seen in Chicago. She returned home to Oakland, California, and, together with the multidisciplinary artist Jade Ariana Fair, organized The Universe is Lit, a three-day festival in August 2017, with music, art, and film, centered on the local QTIPOC community. The festival was rebranded as The Multivrs is Illuminated for its 2018 festival and is planning its next event for August 2020. \u201cEven though we\u2019re including everyone that\u2019s a person of color, we are prioritizing black people,\u201d Shawnt\u00e9 says. \u201cBecause we still need to be seen and to be prioritized and to be acknowledged.\u201d In 2017, independent black and brown punk festivals launched in three major cities: Deep Cuts in New Orleans; Break Free Fest in Philadelphia; and Decolonize Fest in London, a multi-day festival organized by the London-based collective DIY Diaspora Punx. Decolonize Fest held its third annual festival in June 2019. Break Free Fest also hosted its third festival on Memorial Day weekend 2019. The Break Free Fest organizer Scout Cartagena explains what she sees as the driving force behind her and other independent black and brown festivals: \u201cWe want to be heard, but we also want a space to be joyful without white profit.\u201d Punk Black, an Atlanta-based collective, has held 60 events since 2015, in Atlanta, Brooklyn, Oakland, Chicago, and Washington DC, featuring people of color in music, art, and cosplay. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely in an era where more and more POC are being empowered and empowering themselves through the media,\u201d says Punk Black\u2019s Von Phoenix. \u201cSo this is a great time for all those collectives to spring up.\u201d The upsurge of festivals and collectives of color has also seen a rise of POC punk bands. The Muslims, from Durham, North Carolina, formed shortly after the last presidential election. The band, who released their second album, Mayo Supreme, in April 2019, write songs about white supremacy and the anxieties of disenfranchised people in the Trump era. \u201cI write to get my feelings and my thoughts and my rage out, because I know I\u2019m not the only one feeling it,\u201d the singer and guitar player Laylatul Qadr says. \u201cThere are black folks that are feeling this angry, there are queer folks that are feeling this angry, there are Muslim folks that are feeling this angry.\u201d T\u00e9a Campbell is singer and guitar player of Meet Me @ the Altar, a pop-punk band consisting of three young women of color, who released their latest album, Bigger Than Me, in July 2019. Campbell sees her music and her band as providing inspiration to future generations. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have representation growing up as kids,\u201d Campbell says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have people who looked like us, playing the kinds of music we liked, but we want to change that for the little girls of color out there now.\u201d Spooner sees the recent surge of independent black and brown punk festivals as a natural response to the criticisms levelled at Afropunk.

A National Lottery-funded survey of disabled pupils by Disability Rights UK found that most of the young people with special educational needs and disability (Send) questioned described a school life of being bullied and socially excluded, saying that their group of school friends was small or non-existent. This is not a new problem but it has been intensified by years of austerity, under which negligent underfunding has left special needs education for disabled children on \u201cthe verge of crisis\u201d. Forget a dream university place \u2013 for thousands of Send pupils, they don\u2019t even have a school place. Others have had their specialist support worker removed; four out of five headteachers have been forced to cut back on teaching assistants, with vulnerable children with complex learning needs the most affected. The National Deaf Children\u2019s Society, notably, point to cuts to support services and specialist staff as a key factor in deaf pupils struggling to get the grades they need. Such inequality runs even deeper for BAME and working-class disabled pupils. Disability is still too often equated with low expectation: that \u201cstupid\u201d or \u201cweird\u201d disabled people neither have the ability or desire to excel like everyone else. In reality, government ministers need to get smarter to finally bridge the attainment gap by providing structural help: from offering disabled adult mentors for young disabled people, working with schools to deliver material on disability in the personal, social, health and economic curriculum, to long-term investment in Send. So congratulations to the disabled pupils who went above and beyond in school \u2013 no matter what happens in today\u2019s results. It\u2019s surely time the rest of us got to work. \u2022 Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist and author of Crippled: Austerity and the Demonisation of Disabled People",

Six years earlier, and two years before the Nazi occupation, the basement had been transformed into a control centre for key city services in the event of an air raid, but never used. It housed, among other useful amenities, a private, 250-line telephone exchange. It was perfect. Henri Rol-Tanguy, known as Colonel Rol, his wife C\u00e9cile and their comrades swiftly began setting up the subterranean command post from which, over the next five days, the final battle for the liberation of Paris would be run. Amid a bloody city-wide insurrection that ended on 25 August after US and Free French troops arrived, the occupying Nazis surrendered, the tricolour was hoisted from the Eiffel Tower and Charles de Gaulle made his trumphant entry into the capital, as many as 1,000 r\u00e9sistants lost their lives.

      "bodyText": "The autopsy of Nora Quoirin, the 15-year-old who went missing in the Malaysian jungle, has concluded that she likely died of starvation and stress after spending seven days in the jungle. Speaking outside the police headquarters in Seremban, Negri Sembilan police chief Mohammad Mat Yusop said Nora had died \u201ctwo to three days ago\u201d from internal bleeding in her intestine, possibly caused by \u201cprolonged starvation or stress\u201d. She also had bruising on her legs but there was \u201cno sign of violence, abduction or kidnapping\u201d and \u201cno evidence of foul play for the time being\u201d, though tests were still ongoing. The exact cause of death given by the police was \u201cupper gastrointestinal bleeding due to duodenal ulcer complicated with perforation\u201d. The body of the London teenager was found on Tuesday, down a steep ravine in the jungle, after a 10-day search. Nora had gone missing overnight on 3 August from the resort where she was staying with her family on holiday, sparking a large search operation involving over 350 people, including officers from the UK, France and Ireland, local tribes people and hundreds of volunteers. Nora was barefoot and just in underwear when she went missing, and a window was found wide open downstairs in the holiday cottage where she was staying. Her remains were eventually discovered unclothed in a stream 1.2 miles from the resort where she was staying by a team of local hikers. The area was highly inaccessible and the body had to be winched out by a helicopter before it was brought to Tuanku Ja\u2019afar hospital for a post mortem. Her clothes have still not been uncovered. The Malaysian attorney general Tommy Thomas, who is overseeing the case, will decide if an inquest will now be held. The police chief said Nora\u2019s family were now free to bring her body back to the UK. It had been a drawn-out wait for the results of the autopsy, which took 12 hours and was carried out by a pathologist from Kuala Lumpur, two experts from the department of chemistry and a local doctor. Nora was born with holoprosencephaly, a neurological disorder, which limited her speech and coordination and made her \u201cvery vulnerable\u201d, according to her parents. During the search, Nora\u2019s Irish and French mother and father, Meabh and Sebastien Quoirin, said she must have been abducted as she \u201cnever goes anywhere by herself\u201d, but police continued to treat the case as a missing person, while not ruling out a \u201ccriminal element\u201d in her case. The French prosecutor\u2019s office said they had opened a criminal investigation into Nora\u2019s case. In a statement on Wednesday, the family described their agony at Nora\u2019s death in a statement, describing her as \u201cat the heart of our family\u201d. They had travelled to Malaysia for a two week family holiday. \u201cShe is the truest, most precious girl and we love her infinitely,\u201d said the family. \u201cThe cruelty of her being taken away is unbearable. Our hearts are broken. We will always love our Nora.\u201d They thanked all those who had been involved in the search to find her, adding: \u201cNora has brought people together, especially from France, Ireland, Britain and Malaysia, united in their love and support for her and her family. She has truly touched the whole world. To all our friends and family at home, we can\u2019t thank you enough for all your love.\u201d The family\u2019s lawyer, Charles Morrell, urged people to be \u201cvery cautious about the first results of the autopsy\u201d.

      "body": "<p>What shines out brightest from Peter Gatrell\u2019s panoramic history of migration in Europe since 1945 is that this is a story of comings and goings, not just arrival. Ideas about home and belonging are constantly shaped by the forces of state power, capital and everyday human interaction. You can feel it most strongly in the accounts of individual experience that Gatrell has woven into his narrative. There are the \u201cstarved, frightened, suspicious, stupefied\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/11/germans-and-czechs-mass-expulsion-trying-to-deal-with-ghosts-of-the-past\" title=\"\">ethnic Germans expelled from eastern Europe</a> at the end of the war, who arrive in a country most have never set foot in before; or the returning British colonial settlers who decide in the 1960s that they prefer Portugal\u2019s Algarve to Blighty, because the cheap booze, servants and warm weather remind them of the Raj. Western European officials are surprised when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/18/german-finance-minister-guest-workers-row\" title=\"\">the \u201cguest workers\u201d from Turkey</a>, north Africa and elsewhere they invited in to help rebuild their economies in the 1950s and 60s don\u2019t want to return when recession sets in \u2013 but don\u2019t entirely want to give up their connections to the old countries either.</p> <p>It is also a story of sharp contrasts, of both violent uprootings and unremarkable journeys that continue today. Affluent \u201cEurostars\u201d \u2013 bankers and IT specialists who live in one EU country and work in another \u2013 jostle with \u201cillegal\u201d immigrants such as <a href=\"https://journals.openedition.org/etnografica/2630?lang=en\" title=\"\">Shahram Khosravi</a>, an anthropologist from Iran who turned the lens on his own clandestine journey to Sweden, or Ukrainian migrant workers who complain that the fall of communism has merely replaced the iron curtain with the \u201cvelvet drape\u201d of border control. In teasing out these differences, Gatrell \u2013 a professor of history at the University of Manchester who has written widely on migration and refugee rights \u2013 wants to add what he sees as the context missing from today\u2019s fractious political debates on immigration, in particular the response to Europe\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/15/big-decisions-unlikely-migration-summit-eu-leaders\" title=\"\">\u201cmigrant crisis\u201d of 2015-16</a>.</p> <p>Gatrell is concerned that the situation now is starting to resemble the \u201cviolent peacetime\u201d of the years immediately after 1945, when millions of people were uprooted, many of whom languished for years in \u201cdisplaced persons\u201d camps or were picked up and discarded by states according to their economic utility. \u201cAs the archipelago of camps and detention centres spread across the continent and farther afield,\u201d he writes of the recent crackdown on asylum seekers, \u201cthe founding fathers of closer European integration \u2013 many of them having had direct experience of Nazi persecution before and after the second world war \u2013 would surely have turned in their graves at what their successors had done in the name of Europe.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77e0cda4a4a553d8cfa20406fd9a718a811d95ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77e0cda4a4a553d8cfa20406fd9a718a811d95ec/0_63_2500_1499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Migrants in an inflatable dinghy are rescued by French coastguards in the Channel, August 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Migrants in an inflatable dinghy are rescued by French coastguards in the Channel, August 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If this crackdown is justified by appeals to \u201ca time of imagined security and stability\u201d, Gatrell argues, then it requires a profound forgetting of Europe\u2019s own recent past. Piecing together material from political and economic history, ethnography and cultural studies, <em>The Unsettling of Europe</em> makes the case that the continent has been neither an impenetrable fortress nor an open door. Instead, states have generally sought to manage migration to their economic advantage, with consideration of the human impact often coming as an afterthought.</p> <p>In part, this has been a story of progress, not least in the wealth and prosperity it has helped Europe achieve. Migration is at the heart of the development and maintenance of welfare states, the right of people to move freely was central to the liberalisation of regimes in the former eastern bloc, and the current international system of refugee protection has its roots in the efforts to deal with mass displacement in postwar Europe. But migration also has its dark side: the short-termist and sometimes callous policies of governments who treat migrant workers as a means to an end, the hostility and racism that people moving around Europe have often encountered, and the periodic imposition of border controls that push people to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/31/people-smuggling-how-works-who-benefits-and-how-to-put-stop\" title=\"\">hire smugglers, or risk their lives</a>, to get where they feel they need to.</p> <p>Gatrell divides his chronology into five periods. The first, which runs from 1945 until the mid-50s, covers the years when many of Europe\u2019s borders as we know them today were settled. This was no simple process of redrawing the map: in central and eastern Europe in particular, it involved the mass displacement of millions of people to create relatively ethnically homogeneous states in that part of the continent. Even at this early stage, governments on both sides of the emerging cold war looked to migration as a way to address their shattered economies. While the USSR and its satellites made heavy use of forced labour and resettlement, western European states cherry-picked the skilled and able-bodied workers from among the thousands who couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t return home. The distinctions made between desirable and undesirable migrants were reflected in the way they were talked about, then as now: in 1949 the Daily Mirror was complaining that other countries had \u201ctaken the cream and left us most of the scum\u201d who \u201cadd to our discomfort and swell the crime wave\u201d.</p> <p>The second part deals with the boom years from the late 50s to the early 70s, when millions of people moved from country to city, from south to north, or from other parts of the world entirely to fill a demand for labour. This was an era of decolonisation for many of the western European empires, although the subjects and citizens \u201creturning\u201d met with vastly different treatment. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/16/algeria-france-war-macron-apology-murder-michele-audin-interview\" title=\"\">French <em>pieds noirs</em> </a>forced out of Algeria were greeted with fanfares; the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/25/macron-faces-up-to-france-algeria-colonial-past-with-40m-euros-harkis-aid\" title=\"\"> <em>harkis</em>, Algerians who sided with them</a> during the war of independence, arrived in overcrowded boats by night, or took clandestine routes into France.

When her daughter told her she was pregnant, D didn\u2019t know how to react. D had had her own abortion before her daughter was born, and hadn\u2019t told her mother. Instead, she had confided in her male boss, who let her pay him back with small installments from her paycheck. On the day of her procedure, she had gone to the clinic alone. \u201cSo that why I feel I had to be here. [She\u2019s] my baby girl,\u201d D said. M offered her own thoughts. \u201cI don\u2019t like this more than anyone else. But I don\u2019t want to lose my daughter,\u201d she adds, referring to the treatment for her teenager\u2019s rheumatoid arthritis that could potentially endanger her daughter\u2019s life if she tried to see through the pregnancy. The day before Ivey signed the bill, M\u2019s daughter realized she was pregnant. In a panic, the pair called the clinic, not knowing there were months before the law could potentially go into effect. Another woman, A, says she panicked too when she heard about the legislation and the lack of consideration for rape victims. Her 29-year-old cousin, who she says was date raped in a nightclub in Montgomery, filed a police report and let authorities collect evidence through a rape test kit, just days before. Now, she\u2019s waiting for her to wrap up her abortion procedure next door. As she tells the group of women how her cousin usually never goes out alone, the man in charge of the Baptist-funded Life on Wheels RV across the street\u2019s yells \u201cdiablo\u201d at a couple walking by the house and tries to usher them into his RV. A clinic escort rushes off the Power House porch and thrusts her umbrella between the couple and the man. The group outside momentarily scatters after the commotion. Some head indoors for water or a break from the heat. Six hours after they drove into the clinic, D\u2019s daughter appears at the house. Her mother jumps up, giving her a hug. \u201cI feel a little loopy,\u201d D\u2019s daughter said. \u201cBut it was OK. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s over.\u201d",

Along with my elder cousin, we came to Nairobi both looking for opportunities. I wanted a high school education but needed part-time work to supplement our income.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nairobi was the natural choice for Okewa, who had watched countless others leave his village for \u201cthe big city\u201d and never return. Something he never quite understood, until he got to Kibera.</p> \n<p>Alongside his 25-year-old cousin, Okewa\u2019s naivety took him away from school into a life of dishonesty and crime. Ambition drove him from gang foot soldier, to becoming one of Kibera\u2019s feared \u201c12 disciples of crime\u201d, followed by a role as Kibera\u2019s \u2018crime overlord\u2019 \u2013 an \u2018honour\u2019 comparable to that of a mafia godfather.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the gang leadership there are structures, you had to show yourself as committed.

As the climate crisis continues to drive people away from rural areas and into cities, urbanisation has become a growing issue across the globe.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The Guardian's Global development team travelled to&nbsp; Africa's biggest slum, Kibera, in Nairobi, Kenya, in an effort to look beyond the stereotypes and myths of life in a slum.</p>\n    <p>Many people living in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kibera.org.uk/facts-info/\">Kibera</a>&nbsp;work hard, long days. They pay high rents for flimsy shacks on land owned by the government and effectively squatted on by landlords. They have no services and the only taxation comes in the form of protection money demanded by police and gangs. Each day is a struggle to scrape together enough money and food to reach the next.</p>\n    <p>Electricity, clean water, toilets, healthcare and schools are either non-existent or not available to all residents. At any one time, 50% of Kibera's 15- to 25-year-old women are pregnant. Abortion is illegal and contraception scarce. Rape and child sex abuse is endemic. Abuse of drink and drugs is rife. Food is cheap but unhealthy \u2013 fizzy drinks are easier to get than clean water.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Today Okewa is director of community relations for <a href=\"https://www.shofco.org/\">Shining hope for communities (Shofco)</a>, a 514-strong charitable organisation, which he co-founded with Odede in 2004. Okewa and his fellow disciples spend their time building relationships with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/aug/06/if-we-dont-kill-these-people-they-will-kill-you-policing-africas-largest-slum\">the police</a> and government in an effort to keep Kibera\u2019s young people alive and divert them from crime, while building infrastructure that supports Kenya\u2019s poorest. Okewa\u2019s first lesson to the youth: respect for oneself and for women.</p> \n<p>Smartly dressed, quietly spoken, Okewa is not what you would expect for an ex-crime overlord. Born in Siaya, western Kenya, he has lived in Kibera for 25 years. His father had three wives and could not afford schooling. \u201cMy mother and two stepmothers worked hard to provide for us, but the number of mouths to feed meant that all [their] earnings went on food.\u201d</p> \n<p>The only place Okewa and his cousin could afford to live in Nairobi when they arrived were the slums. They rented a shanty and carried out small building jobs. Enrolled in high school outside Kibera, Okewa made a promising start but soon faltered as he attempted to balance the need to earn money against an education. As their dream of city life slowly fell apart, disillusionment set in.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor me there was little choice. I started skipping lessons for a life on the street and the money it provided. It wasn\u2019t long before I was immersed in Kibera\u2019s gangs.\u201d</p> \n<p>Okewa\u2019s brief encounter with education had at least enhanced his communication skills and, along with his ambition to succeed, this provided him opportunities.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the slums we were powerful people ruling over our own. We ended up forming our own gang. We used to \u2018tax\u2019 people to protect them against landlords, the government and anybody who was interfering with their lives. We were not good friends with central government, the local chief or police. We were not given recognition or opportunities. We ended up in the slums and so formed our own government,\u201d says Okewa.</p> \n<p>By 15, Okewa had been inaugurated as \u201cSerikali\u201d, or government \u2013 leader of the gang \u2013 having made most of his money from contracts commissioned by wealthy individuals outside of the slums.</p> \n<p>\u201cDoing protection in the slums was interesting, but very dangerous,\u201d explains Okewa. \u201cRich people will always hire you to do their jobs [criminal activities]. Maybe they are having problems and they want to settle the cause and you\u2019d get hired \u2026 the best or most famous politicians know me by name, we are still friends.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7e8a3e4b70811e9351f55f1f2cd61a70a84537da\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e8a3e4b70811e9351f55f1f2cd61a70a84537da/0_256_3190_1914/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protestors run from police in Kibera slum, Nairobi, during a 2016 demonstration\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Election periods often trigger violent uprisings in Kibera.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl de Souza/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Not satisfied with being the leader of a small outfit, Okewa began taking control of rival slum gangs. As the number of foot soldiers grew, so did the robberies, the beatings of women, gang rapes, confrontations with the police and involvement with politicians who used the slum gangs as pawns to influence voting across Kenya.</p> \n<p>It is the persistent political influence over the gangs that Okewa believes continues to make Kibera a tinderbox, triggering violent uprising across the country during election time and leading to clashes with police and loss of life on both sides of the divide.</p> \n<p>Okewa identified the gang leaders and made them a proposal. \u201cWe were the top-ranking cabinet who can sit down and decide what the entire gang did, go raid or who to give protection to, depending on the pay. I didn\u2019t consider myself the best, but I ended up being the leader.\u201d</p> \n<p>He was now head of the \u201cthe 12 disciples\u201d. \u201cYou had to prove that you were at the top of your game, use extra violence. It\u2019s not all about being rough, killing or doing more crime \u2013 you have to show leadership, getting them together, giving strategies on how it can work, how you don\u2019t interfere with the lives of the common people, but at the same time getting a protection fee \u2026 leadership characteristics. There were jobs that we wouldn\u2019t take because it would make us look bad in the eyes of the community, so the 12 would sit down and decide on which jobs to take.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe average lifespan in Kibera is currently 30 years but it used to be younger due to disease and gang violence,\u201d says Okewa.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"86f4116f-4fb6-43de-8f1b-6fba52e9fb97\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>- Estimates of how many people live in Kibera range from 250,000 to 1 million.</p>\n    <p>- Life expectancy is 30 years.</p>\n    <p>- The biggest killers come from diet and dirt.

Some lost their lives in fights and through other gangs in other slums. They used knives and pangas [machetes], sometimes you\u2019d hire guns, but not much, as there are many loose guns. When employed by clients or politicians, they would pay for guns that could be delivered within two hours\u201d, he says.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe money we were making was much, but we used it straightaway for drugs, drinks and women; then we had nothing, and would say: \u2018Lets go do another job.\u2019 I would get the cream of it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were many, 30\u201340 from all the villages.\u201d</p> \n<p>From a \u201cjob\u201d that made 50,000 Kenyan shillings (\u00a3385), those who carried it out got 5,000 shillings and the rest went to \u201cthe rank\u201d \u2013 principally himself and the other disciples. With the proceeds Okewa rented his own home from where he also ran a small shop, providing an air of respectability.</p> \n<p>But that changed in 2004 when an equally intelligent and ambitious young man, Kennedy Odede, approached Okewa, hoping to join his gang. Okewa saw something in Odede and refused, hoping to deter him from a life of crime. Okewa listened as Odede told him of his dream to bring peace and resources to Kibera, admitting his first thought was: \u201cWho is this man?\u201d who seemed to want to overthrow his empire. Realising Odede had no interest in undermining him, he saw a challenge offering the opportunity he craved. The two men debated the future, whether it might be possible to use their skills to divert young men from violence \u201cto build positive aspirations, hope and security\u201d. Together they hatched a plot to make good what had been bad.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6dfd194e88b25f8817db88e44ae409a71ea126a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6dfd194e88b25f8817db88e44ae409a71ea126a/396_0_5364_3688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kennedy Odede, entrepreneur and co founder of Shining Hope for Communities (SHOFCO), a non-profit organisation that tackles urban poverty and gender inequity, poses for a photograph outside a shop bearing his organisation\u2019s name in Kibera, Nairobi, Kenya.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kennedy Odede, entrepreneur and co-founder of charity Shofco, had a \u2018dream to bring peace and resources to Kibera\u2019.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Holt/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cKennedy came up with the idea that the negative energy could be used in other things like soccer, theatre, cleaning up and helping our community.

As \u201cSerikali\u201d, Okewa was perfectly placed to negotiate. Odede formed Shofco, a charity promising to bring stability and resources. Slowly they brought the other disciples on board, followed by gang members. If Shofco had their monthly meeting, Okewa was present to show solidarity. If gang members did a cleanup, so did Okewa. At the registration of Shofco, Okewa stood alongside Odede at the government offices, where they informed officials that they were there to \u201ctransform Kibera\u2019s community\u201d. \u201cI wanted it registered and it was registered,\u201d Okewa says proudly.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere was big resistance, many would have loved to continue [with crime], but we had a strategy.

      "bodyText": "George Okewa once terrorised his community. Spurred on by violence, drink and drugs, he believed that one day his lifestyle would cause his death. The day he met Kennedy Odede, that changed. Following the realisation that their most powerful weapon was not guns but communication, they now use their skills to bring peace and resources to Kibera, Africa\u2019s largest slum. At the age of 11, Okewa\u2019s determination to seek out a better life regardless of the consequences overcame his insecurities, and he chose to leave his family, his 27 siblings, and all he knew. \u201cI decided: let me find something in the capital city. Along with my elder cousin, we came to Nairobi both looking for opportunities. I wanted a high school education but needed part-time work to supplement our income.\u201d Nairobi was the natural choice for Okewa, who had watched countless others leave his village for \u201cthe big city\u201d and never return. Something he never quite understood, until he got to Kibera. Alongside his 25-year-old cousin, Okewa\u2019s naivety took him away from school into a life of dishonesty and crime. Ambition drove him from gang foot soldier, to becoming one of Kibera\u2019s feared \u201c12 disciples of crime\u201d, followed by a role as Kibera\u2019s \u2018crime overlord\u2019 \u2013 an \u2018honour\u2019 comparable to that of a mafia godfather. \u201cIn the gang leadership there are structures, you had to show yourself as committed. You have to do it in the right way and be committed to their ideologies.\u201d Today Okewa is director of community relations for Shining hope for communities (Shofco), a 514-strong charitable organisation, which he co-founded with Odede in 2004. Okewa and his fellow disciples spend their time building relationships with the police and government in an effort to keep Kibera\u2019s young people alive and divert them from crime, while building infrastructure that supports Kenya\u2019s poorest. Okewa\u2019s first lesson to the youth: respect for oneself and for women. Smartly dressed, quietly spoken, Okewa is not what you would expect for an ex-crime overlord. Born in Siaya, western Kenya, he has lived in Kibera for 25 years. His father had three wives and could not afford schooling. \u201cMy mother and two stepmothers worked hard to provide for us, but the number of mouths to feed meant that all [their] earnings went on food.\u201d The only place Okewa and his cousin could afford to live in Nairobi when they arrived were the slums. They rented a shanty and carried out small building jobs. Enrolled in high school outside Kibera, Okewa made a promising start but soon faltered as he attempted to balance the need to earn money against an education. As their dream of city life slowly fell apart, disillusionment set in. \u201cFor me there was little choice. I started skipping lessons for a life on the street and the money it provided. It wasn\u2019t long before I was immersed in Kibera\u2019s gangs.\u201d Okewa\u2019s brief encounter with education had at least enhanced his communication skills and, along with his ambition to succeed, this provided him opportunities. \u201cIn the slums we were powerful people ruling over our own. We ended up forming our own gang. We used to \u2018tax\u2019 people to protect them against landlords, the government and anybody who was interfering with their lives. We were not good friends with central government, the local chief or police. We were not given recognition or opportunities. We ended up in the slums and so formed our own government,\u201d says Okewa. By 15, Okewa had been inaugurated as \u201cSerikali\u201d, or government \u2013 leader of the gang \u2013 having made most of his money from contracts commissioned by wealthy individuals outside of the slums. \u201cDoing protection in the slums was interesting, but very dangerous,\u201d explains Okewa. \u201cRich people will always hire you to do their jobs [criminal activities]. Maybe they are having problems and they want to settle the cause and you\u2019d get hired \u2026 the best or most famous politicians know me by name, we are still friends.\u201d Not satisfied with being the leader of a small outfit, Okewa began taking control of rival slum gangs. As the number of foot soldiers grew, so did the robberies, the beatings of women, gang rapes, confrontations with the police and involvement with politicians who used the slum gangs as pawns to influence voting across Kenya. It is the persistent political influence over the gangs that Okewa believes continues to make Kibera a tinderbox, triggering violent uprising across the country during election time and leading to clashes with police and loss of life on both sides of the divide. Okewa identified the gang leaders and made them a proposal. \u201cWe were the top-ranking cabinet who can sit down and decide what the entire gang did, go raid or who to give protection to, depending on the pay. I didn\u2019t consider myself the best, but I ended up being the leader.\u201d He was now head of the \u201cthe 12 disciples\u201d. \u201cYou had to prove that you were at the top of your game, use extra violence. It\u2019s not all about being rough, killing or doing more crime \u2013 you have to show leadership, getting them together, giving strategies on how it can work, how you don\u2019t interfere with the lives of the common people, but at the same time getting a protection fee \u2026 leadership characteristics. There were jobs that we wouldn\u2019t take because it would make us look bad in the eyes of the community, so the 12 would sit down and decide on which jobs to take. \u201cThe average lifespan in Kibera is currently 30 years but it used to be younger due to disease and gang violence,\u201d says Okewa. He has lost foot soldiers in the past. \u201cThe police killed some, back then we thought we were right but we were doing wrong. Some lost their lives in fights and through other gangs in other slums. They used knives and pangas [machetes], sometimes you\u2019d hire guns, but not much, as there are many loose guns. When employed by clients or politicians, they would pay for guns that could be delivered within two hours\u201d, he says. \u201cThe money we were making was much, but we used it straightaway for drugs, drinks and women; then we had nothing, and would say: \u2018Lets go do another job.\u2019 I would get the cream of it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were many, 30\u201340 from all the villages.\u201d From a \u201cjob\u201d that made 50,000 Kenyan shillings (\u00a3385), those who carried it out got 5,000 shillings and the rest went to \u201cthe rank\u201d \u2013 principally himself and the other disciples. With the proceeds Okewa rented his own home from where he also ran a small shop, providing an air of respectability. But that changed in 2004 when an equally intelligent and ambitious young man, Kennedy Odede, approached Okewa, hoping to join his gang. Okewa saw something in Odede and refused, hoping to deter him from a life of crime. Okewa listened as Odede told him of his dream to bring peace and resources to Kibera, admitting his first thought was: \u201cWho is this man?\u201d who seemed to want to overthrow his empire. Realising Odede had no interest in undermining him, he saw a challenge offering the opportunity he craved. The two men debated the future, whether it might be possible to use their skills to divert young men from violence \u201cto build positive aspirations, hope and security\u201d. Together they hatched a plot to make good what had been bad. \u201cKennedy came up with the idea that the negative energy could be used in other things like soccer, theatre, cleaning up and helping our community. We talked about ourselves and how we could protect our mothers and sisters from violence and rape.\u201d They took their proposals to the gang leaders. As \u201cSerikali\u201d, Okewa was perfectly placed to negotiate. Odede formed Shofco, a charity promising to bring stability and resources. Slowly they brought the other disciples on board, followed by gang members. If Shofco had their monthly meeting, Okewa was present to show solidarity. If gang members did a cleanup, so did Okewa. At the registration of Shofco, Okewa stood alongside Odede at the government offices, where they informed officials that they were there to \u201ctransform Kibera\u2019s community\u201d. \u201cI wanted it registered and it was registered,\u201d Okewa says proudly. \u201cThere was big resistance, many would have loved to continue [with crime], but we had a strategy. We arranged football matches, theatre workshops and lessons in respect, after which [we] encouraged them to debate on what was needed to make life comfortable for everyone.\u201d By 2008, the majority had joined Odede and Okewa and were given work in Shofco shops or as carpenters. Okewa introduces Miller, 46, one-time gang member turned community worker. He says: \u201cThese days George is a good person, back then he was bad, we would hang around together when the place was full of violence.\u201d Miller concentrates on bringing peace to the community, especially during elections. \u201cHere, politicians play with people\u2019s minds. I believe that our people should be better prepared to understand that leaders will come and go and that they use idle hands to carry knives and throw stones to fuel political uprisings. \u201cThere are rogue policemen, those who kill during demonstrations. Instead of using tear gas to disperse people they are shooting people for nothing,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter the shooting of Carilton Maina, we had to work with the police, as they wouldn\u2019t enter Kibera and the vigilantes took over. We helped to bring about change by showing people sense and giving support. Here, police are doing a lot of injustice, you\u2019re supposed to be innocent until proven guilty. That\u2019s why young men rise up and ask: \u2018Why are they killing?\u2019 If you kill a thief people will not rise up, they will not demonstrate. But with Maina they shot him without telling people what he did \u2026 you\u2019d like to think that justice would follow for the person who shot him, policeman are not above the law.\u201d A short distance away is ex-gang disciple Rastafarian Jonah Savimbe, who made it clear that he objected to Okewa\u2019s conformist approach. \u201cWe were very strong, even against the police we were fighting. We wanted our freedom, when they attack us we show them that we are very strong. Shofco introduced some empowerment to the youth, but we are still strong, we are militant. Even now if they attack us we still have spirit inside us. We can even attack them if they don\u2019t do what we want, I would fight and resist them with stones,\u201d says the 45-year-old carpenter. Another ex-disciple is Issac, 38, a quiet, softly spoken man, who lives with his wife and three children, and complains of rising costs.

      "body": "<p>Seventy years after partition, the annexation of Kashmir by India is the endgame of Devraj, the Hindu nationalist businessman protagonist of my 2017 novel<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/17/we-that-are-young-preti-taneja-review\" title=\"\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/17/we-that-are-young-preti-taneja-review\" title=\"\">We That Are Young</a></strong>.

But according to Article 370 of the Indian constitution, which among other protections prohibited non-Kashmiris from owning property there, he should never have been allowed to build it.</p> <p>In real life, Article 370 was last week unilaterally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/05/india-revoke-disputed-kashmir-special-status\" title=\"\">abolished</a> by the Indian government. The Kashmiri population were placed under lockdown; there was a shortage of medicines and baby food, people were not able to speak to family members outside the state. Reports emerged that police used tear gas and pellet guns to break up peaceful protest.</p> <p>The international community was caught off guard. But Kashmir has long been known as the most militarised region in the world. Trapped between India and Pakistan, the people have suffered decades of human rights abuses and state-sanctioned violence. The mass of papers in the UN archives since 1947 reveal much international diplomacy, but a lack of political will to intervene.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/05/curfewed-night-basharat-peer-review\" title=\"\">Curfewed Night</a></strong> is the Kashmiri writer Basharat Peer\u2019s moving memoir. He was just 13 years old in 1989, when the separatist movement turned violent. He writes of the desire for self-determination, the brutal Indian response. Of the friends who left their villages to train as fighters in Pakistan; of those who \u201cdisappeared\u201d, possibly to Indian torture centres run off\u2011grid; and the \u201chalf widows\u201d left behind.</p> <p>In <strong>Do You Remember Kunan Poshpora?</strong> five Kashmiri women piece together the evidence of a mass rape perpetrated by Indian security forces in 1991, and its cover-up. Though the authors were barely born then, they have lived with that violence for decades. This is an extraordinary book about their determination to uncover the truth.</p> <p>Freny Manecksha\u2019s <strong>Behold, I Shine</strong>, also pays tribute to the resilience of Kashmiri women, and includes her interview with Parveena Ahangar, founder of the Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons (ADPD). In the 1990s National Security Guard forces picked up her son; she has not seen him since. She heard he was \u201cstripped [\u2026] he desperately wanted a glass of water\u201d; she is now one of Kashmir\u2019s leading activists for justice.</p> <p>In his novel <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/mar/05/collaborator-mirza-waheed-review\" title=\"\">The Collaborator</a></strong>, Mirza Waheed gives us a boy whose friends vanish. He then gets a job counting corpses for the Indian army and is terrified he will discover his own missing friends. The prose is visceral, the tone dark and absurd. Malik Sajad captures the same desperation in <a href=\"https://maliksajad.net/\" title=\"\">his striking graphic novel</a>, <strong>Munnu</strong>, about a boy from Kashmir and the shame and compromises Kashmiri artists must make to survive in war. His book damns a world that cares little for people whose land is so strategically placed between India, Pakistan and China, while Feroz Rather\u2019s fierce and lyrical new book of linked stories <strong>The Night of Broken Glass</strong>, with its evocation of Kristallnacht, tells of those everyday lives, forgotten by the west.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/12/our-hearts-are-on-fire-kashmir-spends-eid-al-adha-in-lockdown\">'Our hearts are on fire': Kashmir spends Eid al-Adha in lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even as these writers document pain, they also reclaim Kashmiri spiritual traditions fractured by different rulers over centuries.

      "bodyText": "Seventy years after partition, the annexation of Kashmir by India is the endgame of Devraj, the Hindu nationalist businessman protagonist of my 2017 novel We That Are Young. His tactic is settler-colonialism: he is opening a seven-star hotel in Srinagar. But according to Article 370 of the Indian constitution, which among other protections prohibited non-Kashmiris from owning property there, he should never have been allowed to build it. In real life, Article 370 was last week unilaterally abolished by the Indian government. The Kashmiri population were placed under lockdown; there was a shortage of medicines and baby food, people were not able to speak to family members outside the state. Reports emerged that police used tear gas and pellet guns to break up peaceful protest. The international community was caught off guard. But Kashmir has long been known as the most militarised region in the world. Trapped between India and Pakistan, the people have suffered decades of human rights abuses and state-sanctioned violence. The mass of papers in the UN archives since 1947 reveal much international diplomacy, but a lack of political will to intervene. Curfewed Night is the Kashmiri writer Basharat Peer\u2019s moving memoir. He was just 13 years old in 1989, when the separatist movement turned violent. He writes of the desire for self-determination, the brutal Indian response. Of the friends who left their villages to train as fighters in Pakistan; of those who \u201cdisappeared\u201d, possibly to Indian torture centres run off\u2011grid; and the \u201chalf widows\u201d left behind. In Do You Remember Kunan Poshpora? five Kashmiri women piece together the evidence of a mass rape perpetrated by Indian security forces in 1991, and its cover-up. Though the authors were barely born then, they have lived with that violence for decades. This is an extraordinary book about their determination to uncover the truth. Freny Manecksha\u2019s Behold, I Shine, also pays tribute to the resilience of Kashmiri women, and includes her interview with Parveena Ahangar, founder of the Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons (ADPD). In the 1990s National Security Guard forces picked up her son; she has not seen him since. She heard he was \u201cstripped [\u2026] he desperately wanted a glass of water\u201d; she is now one of Kashmir\u2019s leading activists for justice. In his novel The Collaborator, Mirza Waheed gives us a boy whose friends vanish. He then gets a job counting corpses for the Indian army and is terrified he will discover his own missing friends. The prose is visceral, the tone dark and absurd. Malik Sajad captures the same desperation in his striking graphic novel, Munnu, about a boy from Kashmir and the shame and compromises Kashmiri artists must make to survive in war. His book damns a world that cares little for people whose land is so strategically placed between India, Pakistan and China, while Feroz Rather\u2019s fierce and lyrical new book of linked stories The Night of Broken Glass, with its evocation of Kristallnacht, tells of those everyday lives, forgotten by the west. Even as these writers document pain, they also reclaim Kashmiri spiritual traditions fractured by different rulers over centuries. As in poet Agha Shahid Ali\u2019s blazing collection The Country without a Post Office, their work is woven with the words of the 14th-century female mystic Lal Ded and the 16th-century Muslim poet-queen Habba Kahtoun. The poets also haunt Salman Rushdie\u2019s Kashmir novel, Shalimar the Clown, and appear in Kashmir: The Case for Freedom, by writers including Arundhati Roy. Her essential novel The Ministry of Utmost Happiness tracks the rise of Hindu nationalism over decades and brings us almost up to date in Kashmir. As for Indian culpability, two novels stand out. The Far Field by Madhuri Vijay and Jaspreet Singh\u2019s elegiac Chef bear witness to decades of denial and silencing. With the 72nd anniversary of partition falling this week, these works entreat us to hear what the people of Kashmir have to say. \u2022 We That Are Young by Preti Taneja is published by Galley Beggar.

Recent efforts to bridge this divide are complicated by America\u2019s failure to acknowledge the horrors of slavery. It is 400 years since the first Africans stolen from their homeland were brought to a British colony in North America. </p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian at the former South Carolina plantation of Middleton Place, Bernard Powers, the director of the College of Charleston\u2019s Center for the Study of Slavery, explained the importance of understanding the scope of life at these sites. \u201cIf you fail to understand what happened in the past at these plantations, you don\u2019t understand what the grievances are today,\u201d Powers said.</p> <p>For some Americans, the word \u201cplantation\u201d brings to mind the horrors of slavery and the white landowners who made it possible. But for many others, it is a symbol of refined living and hospitality \u2013 remnants of a more genteel time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"81cba2557f966cacd463651a82248f4edf5fc8f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81cba2557f966cacd463651a82248f4edf5fc8f6/0_0_4896_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Middleton Place in South Carolina is one of about 375 plantation museums across the US.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Middleton Place in South Carolina is one of about 375 plantation museums across the US.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Epics/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Across the south, housing developments, schools and golf courses include the word \u201cplantation\u201d in their name. And the market for plantation weddings is high.</p> <p>Over the past two decades, many plantation museums have moved to better incorporate the enslaved experience, in part because of consumer demand for more honest narratives and the growing minority tourism market. Other motivating factors include more honest depictions of slavery in films such as 12 Years a Slave, and the potent force of Black Lives Matter and other social justice movements pushing for America to remedy stark racial disparities that began with slavery.</p> <p>The shift was apparent at Middleton Place, where visitors are encouraged to take a special Beyond the Fields tour and to visit Eliza\u2019s House, a cottage filled with details about life for the enslaved. The main display inside the cottage includes the names and prices of the 2,800 individuals the Middleton family owned from 1738 to 1865, boiled down to their name, skillset and price: Quash, $50; Toney, blacksmith, $600; Old Hannah, $200.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0219f7b2a5a829eeffb015359f9d8958309f128c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0219f7b2a5a829eeffb015359f9d8958309f128c/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourists look over mannequins in the former slave quarters of the Boone Hall Plantation in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tourists look over mannequins in the former slave quarters of the Boone Hall Plantation in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the Beyond the Fields tour, the guide relayed a history of slavery that made it sound as though Africans simply arrived in North America, ignoring that men, women and children were held on ships for months at a time. There was no detail about the enslaved people\u2019s interior lives or acts of resistance. Instead, it was mostly a rote description of the work they did. And Powers identified some factual errors.</p> <p>Powers, who has been a consultant to Middleton Place, said it was important to shake people out of their modern mentality on these tours.</p> <p>\u201cSlavery was a state of war,\u201d he said. War in the form of learning to read and write when you were forbidden from doing so, or sabotaging the rice fields because you knew how they worked better than your boss. \u201cIt was a struggle for survival and to create more living space,\u201d he said.</p> <p>That Middleton Place, like more and more plantation museums, has a separate tour to speak about the lives of African Americans who lived on the property, represents a step forward and a point of contention. These separate tours can maintain the narrative that the lives of the enslaved were separate from what happened at the Big House, where the master lived. At some places, they cost extra.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"efcda876a0aca31e953b524669eb0fdcdb8ee770\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efcda876a0aca31e953b524669eb0fdcdb8ee770/0_0_4408_2939/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A graveyard at Middleton Place in South Carolina marks the graves of African American slaves.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A graveyard at Middleton Place in South Carolina marks the graves of African American slaves.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Epics/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jeff Neale, the director of preservation and interpretation at Middleton Place, said incorporating the African American narrative into the site was an important process that involved balancing the many issues that draw in visitors: its history, its gardens and its decor. \u201cI think it is our responsibility to try and meet all those expectations,\u201d Neale said.</p> <p>\u201cIf you came here [to Charleston] 20 years ago, you probably wouldn\u2019t have heard that word slavery,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was kind of the dirty little family secret \u2013 we just don\u2019t talk about that.\u201d</p> <p>This culture of silence has been supported by US public education.

Only 8% of high-school seniors surveyed by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) could identify slavery as a central part of the civil war, <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/teaching-hard-history-american-slavery\">according to a 2017 report</a>.</p> <p>In a review of 12 popular history textbooks, the SPLC found most failed to mention money being a motivating factor for slavery.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/13/us-slavery-400-years-virginia-point-comfort\">Point Comfort: where slavery in America began 400 years ago</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This information gap has also been highlighted by <a href=\"https://www.tourismreset.com/\">an initiative</a> called Reset led by geographers, historians and other researchers to study inequality in the US tourism industry.</p> <p>The study found that although plantation tours have improved in how often they speak about the African American experience, there is much room to do better.</p> <p>Amy Potter, an associate professor of geography at Georgia Southern University, has been leading a Reset project in Charleston, and found it was still possible to visit a plantation without learning about the African American experience.</p> <p>Starting in 2016, Potter and her team conducted research at four traditional plantations and observed 35 house tours.

      "bodyText": "It is a picture of southern splendor: a grand oak tree dripping with Spanish moss, a manicured green lawn leading to a pristine pond. It only takes a moment for a group of mostly white tourists to lift their cellphones and snap photos. Those phones were being returned to pockets and bags when a tour guide explained that the tidy green grass covers a cemetery for the enslaved: the unidentified remains of African men, women and children torn from their homelands lie below the picture-perfect setting. There are about 375 plantation museums across the US, where the atrocities of slavery compete with the grandeur of plantation living. Recent efforts to bridge this divide are complicated by America\u2019s failure to acknowledge the horrors of slavery. It is 400 years since the first Africans stolen from their homeland were brought to a British colony in North America. Speaking to the Guardian at the former South Carolina plantation of Middleton Place, Bernard Powers, the director of the College of Charleston\u2019s Center for the Study of Slavery, explained the importance of understanding the scope of life at these sites. \u201cIf you fail to understand what happened in the past at these plantations, you don\u2019t understand what the grievances are today,\u201d Powers said. For some Americans, the word \u201cplantation\u201d brings to mind the horrors of slavery and the white landowners who made it possible. But for many others, it is a symbol of refined living and hospitality \u2013 remnants of a more genteel time. Across the south, housing developments, schools and golf courses include the word \u201cplantation\u201d in their name. And the market for plantation weddings is high. Over the past two decades, many plantation museums have moved to better incorporate the enslaved experience, in part because of consumer demand for more honest narratives and the growing minority tourism market. Other motivating factors include more honest depictions of slavery in films such as 12 Years a Slave, and the potent force of Black Lives Matter and other social justice movements pushing for America to remedy stark racial disparities that began with slavery. The shift was apparent at Middleton Place, where visitors are encouraged to take a special Beyond the Fields tour and to visit Eliza\u2019s House, a cottage filled with details about life for the enslaved. The main display inside the cottage includes the names and prices of the 2,800 individuals the Middleton family owned from 1738 to 1865, boiled down to their name, skillset and price: Quash, $50; Toney, blacksmith, $600; Old Hannah, $200. On the Beyond the Fields tour, the guide relayed a history of slavery that made it sound as though Africans simply arrived in North America, ignoring that men, women and children were held on ships for months at a time. There was no detail about the enslaved people\u2019s interior lives or acts of resistance. Instead, it was mostly a rote description of the work they did. And Powers identified some factual errors. Powers, who has been a consultant to Middleton Place, said it was important to shake people out of their modern mentality on these tours. \u201cSlavery was a state of war,\u201d he said. War in the form of learning to read and write when you were forbidden from doing so, or sabotaging the rice fields because you knew how they worked better than your boss. \u201cIt was a struggle for survival and to create more living space,\u201d he said. That Middleton Place, like more and more plantation museums, has a separate tour to speak about the lives of African Americans who lived on the property, represents a step forward and a point of contention. These separate tours can maintain the narrative that the lives of the enslaved were separate from what happened at the Big House, where the master lived. At some places, they cost extra. Jeff Neale, the director of preservation and interpretation at Middleton Place, said incorporating the African American narrative into the site was an important process that involved balancing the many issues that draw in visitors: its history, its gardens and its decor. \u201cI think it is our responsibility to try and meet all those expectations,\u201d Neale said. \u201cIf you came here [to Charleston] 20 years ago, you probably wouldn\u2019t have heard that word slavery,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was kind of the dirty little family secret \u2013 we just don\u2019t talk about that.\u201d This culture of silence has been supported by US public education. Over the past 50 years, lessons about slavery in American schools have gone from largely nonexistent to woefully inadequate. Only 8% of high-school seniors surveyed by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) could identify slavery as a central part of the civil war, according to a 2017 report. In a review of 12 popular history textbooks, the SPLC found most failed to mention money being a motivating factor for slavery. This information gap has also been highlighted by an initiative called Reset led by geographers, historians and other researchers to study inequality in the US tourism industry. The study found that although plantation tours have improved in how often they speak about the African American experience, there is much room to do better. Amy Potter, an associate professor of geography at Georgia Southern University, has been leading a Reset project in Charleston, and found it was still possible to visit a plantation without learning about the African American experience. Starting in 2016, Potter and her team conducted research at four traditional plantations and observed 35 house tours. They found that on all but one of the observed tours, furnishings, family history, architecture and gardens are mentioned more often than slavery. Slavery was discussed on 70% of those tours, but Potter cautioned that this was often done by discussing the enslaved\u2019s labor, not humanity; as part of a narrative about a loyal slave and a kind master or told in the passive voice. \u201cThere are times when you have the humanizing factor, the use of names, and the visitor is able to meaningfully connect,\u201d Potter said. \u201cBut that is not often happening.\u201d The survey findings have been presented to the plantation owners and will be published in a book in 2020. The issues faced by the plantations in reckoning fully with their past are part of a broad national debate about the legacy of slavery. This June, Congress held its first hearing about reparations in more than a decade. Democratic 2020 candidates are also being forced to take positions on whether they support reparations. In 2018, Charleston, where 40% of Africans were brought first before being sold, became one of several cities to formally apologize for slavery. City officials pledged to work to improve racial equality. On an old wharf where slave ships were unloaded, the city is also planning to open the International African American Museum. These changes come after the summer of 2015 saw nine black people murdered by a 21-year-old white supremacist at Charleston\u2019s historic Emanuel AME church. The murderer, Dylann Roof, the first person in US history sentenced to death for a federal hate crime, visited South Carolina plantations. One plantation Roof visited, McLeod, is one of two sites known for putting the enslaved at the center of the site. The other is Whitney plantation near New Orleans. There are no fancy plates at McLeod. Instead, the big house is open for a self-guided tour which emphasizes the close ties between black and white lives on plantations. On the docent-led tour at McLeod, the guide explained the challenges the newly freed slaves faced after the civil war, while winding through their work sites and cabins. She drew a direct connection between the centuries-long fight for black votes and voter suppression efforts today. Many people visit McLeod because they are familiar with its reputation, though some unprepared guests leave displeased. \u201cWe did not receive a historical [perhaps more like hysteria] relevant or informative tour but depending on your ethnicity, were subjected to a lecture aimed to instil guilt,\u201d said one person in an April 2019 Tripadvisor review. Despite these complaints, which represent a sliver of Trip Advisor reviews, of the four tours the Guardian took at three plantations, the McLeod plantation was the only one where guests, all white, lined up to tip and thank the guide after it ended. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 August 2019.

      "bodyText": "Supporters of a historic bill to decriminalise abortion in New South Wales remain confident it will make it through parliament unscathed despite the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, caving in to calls for bans on so-called \u201csex selection\u201d terminations. The bill\u2019s passage through the lower house last week prompted a backlash from rightwing MPs, religious leaders and conservative figures in the media who have mounted a concerted campaign to derail the legislation ahead of the upper house vote. Opponents of the bill have seized on the so-called \u201csex selection\u201d issue ahead of the vote next week, despite expert medical, legal and women\u2019s groups saying there is no evidence the practice is an issue in NSW. And amid increasing pressure from the right wing of her party, Berejiklian has said she would support an amendment to change the Crimes Act to ban the practice. \u201cIf there were any members of the upper house who wanted to strengthen those provisions, I would be more than comfortable with that,\u201d she told reporters in London this week. On Thursday the Sydney Morning Herald quoted a Labor source saying the opposition leader, Jodi McKay, would also support such an amendment if it came back to the lower house. But Guardian Australia understands the bill\u2019s supporters in the upper house have no intention of supporting an amendment around sex selection, and remain confident they have the numbers to see the bill pass without substantial change. The influential Nationals MP Trevor Khan, one of the bill\u2019s 15 co-sponsors, told Guardian Australia he would not support an amendment around so-called gender selection. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for my colleagues but what I can say is that on the basis of the evidence that we\u2019ve received at the inquiry I wouldn\u2019t support an amendment on that basis,\u201d he said. Labor\u2019s Penny Sharpe, another co-sponsor, said she would look at any amendment on its merit and be \u201cinformed by the upper house inquiry\u201d. The issue of sex selection abortions was raised during the debate on the bill in the lower house when the conservative Liberal party MP Tanya Davies sought to include an amendment stating that terminations not \u201cbe used for gender selection\u201d. The amendment was rejected because, opponents said, it was unnecessary and unworkable. Instead, an amendment was passed requiring NSW Health to conduct a review into whether there was any evidence of the practice taking place. An upper house inquiry into the bill held hearings on Thursday and heard evidence from a number of medical and women\u2019s groups that the practice was not an issue in NSW. The inquiry received 13,000 submissions, causing state parliament\u2019s web portal to temporarily crash. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The NSW Australian Medical Association vice president, Dr Danielle McMullen, warned any amendment banning sex selection could make a doctor providing an abortion after nine weeks the \u201cparty to a crime\u201d as technology allows the sex of a baby to be identified from about this time. \u201cTherefore if a woman seeks termination of pregnancy after this point, any laws prohibiting gender selection as a reason would require doctors to be mind-readers of sorts to ensure no crime was being committed,\u201d she said. \u201cThis would have the effect of delaying or preventing the delivery of care.\u201d McMullen said there was no evidence of women approaching their doctors seeking terminations on these grounds. \u201cIf there was evidence that this was happening we\u2019re confident [that] doctors would be within their rights to refuse a termination,\u201d she said. In moving her amendment Davies relied on a 2018 study from La Trobe University which found that while the ratio of boys and girls born in Victoria was close to natural rates of 105 boys to every 100 girls, there were higher rates of boys born to mothers who had migrated from China and India. But Claire Pullen, the chair of Our Body, Our Choices, told Guardian Australia the study found \u201cno evidence gender selective abortion was taking place in Australia\u201d. She said asking doctors to assess whether an abortion was being performed on the basis of gender on those grounds would \u201cessentially require them to undertake racial stereotyping\u201d. Ann Brassil, the chief executive of Family Planning NSW, said there was \u201cno evidence that gender selection occurs\u201d. \u201cFor us to introduce legislation in relation to gender selection on the basis of no evidence would be irresponsible because we would be in a situation where we\u2019re making it up and we could create enormous harm. \u201cWe completely support the position within the current bill that NSW Health should do a review and we should understand what it is we are talking about.\u201d",

In a speech to mark the 74th anniversary on Thursday of Korea\u2019s liberation from Japan\u2019s 1910-45 rule, Moon also said South Korea would \u201cgladly join\u201d hands with its former colonial ruler to defuse an escalating trade dispute whose roots lie in the country\u2019s bitter wartime history. In Tokyo, Japan\u2019s new emperor, Naruhito, voiced \u201cdeep remorse\u201d over the country\u2019s wartime actions, echoing the language used in recent years by his father, Akihito, who abdicated in April. Moon, a left-leaning liberal who has encouraged dialogue on denuclearisation between North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, and Donald Trump, called on Pyongyang and Washington to arrange a fourth summit between the leaders \u201cat the earliest possible date\u201d. \u201cThis will probably constitute the most critical juncture in the entire process of achieving denuclearisation and establishing peace on the Korean peninsula,\u201d Moon said in a speech at the Independence Hall in the city of Cheonan. \u201cNow is the time for both Koreas and the United States to focus on resuming working-level negotiations \u2026 at the earliest possible date.\u201d Denuclearisation and greater economic cooperation with the North would lay the foundations for lasting peace on the peninsula, he said, vowing to realise unification between North and South by 2045 and to host a joint Seoul-Pyongyang Olympics in 2032. \u201cA new Korean peninsula, one that will bring peace and prosperity to itself, east Asia and the world, awaits us,\u201d he said. Moon was speaking soon after Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, sent a ritual cash offering to Yasukuni, a Shinto shrine in Tokyo that honours 2.5 million Japanese war-dead, including 14 leaders convicted as war criminals. Abe, a conservative who has said that future generations of Japanese should not have to keep apologising for the mistakes of the past, has visited Yasukuni only once since becoming prime minister in 2012, but has sent ritual offerings during seasonal festivals and on the 15 August anniversary of Japan\u2019s wartime surrender. There was no immediate reaction from South Korea or China to the gesture. Emperor Naruhito, who ascended the Chrysanthemum throne in May, said: \u201cLooking back on the long period of postwar peace, reflecting on our past and bearing in mind the feelings of deep remorse, I earnestly hope that the ravages of war will never be repeated.\u201d Relations between Seoul and Tokyo have deteriorated since South Korean court rulings calling on Japanese companies to compensate Koreans conscripted as forced labourers during the war. Japan, however, insists that all compensation claims were settled under a 1965 treaty normalising bilateral ties. South Korea, where large anti-Japanese demonstrations were expected to take place on Thursday, has interpreted Tokyo\u2019s recent decision to impose curbs on exports of some high-tech materials as retaliation for the court rulings. Moon called on Japan to \u201ccontemplate\u201d its wartime past, but added: \u201cWe hope that Japan will play a leading role together in facilitating peace and prosperity in east Asia while it contemplates a past that brought misfortune to its neighbouring countries.\u201d Touching on the trade dispute, he added: \u201cIf a country weaponises a sector where it has a comparative advantage, the order of peaceful free trade inevitably suffers.

Jo Swinson, the leader of the Lib Dems, called the idea \u201ca nonsense\u201d, arguing Corbyn would not be able to secure the cross-party backing needed. Others were more amenable, with the SNP and Plaid Cymru welcoming Corbyn\u2019s call for talks \u2013 although Plaid stood with the Greens in arguing a referendum should come before any election.</p> \n<p>Some Labour MPs have said meanwhile that they would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/14/labour-bloc-plans-radical-move-to-push-through-brexit-deal\">consider backing Theresa May\u2019s deal or a version of it after all</a>. \u201cI think Boris will present a deal to parliament, roll something in glitter and get themselves over the line and a number of my colleagues would vote for that deal at that point,\u201d one MP said. \u201cA second referendum is so divisive and no deal is so damaging.\u201d On the more batty side, the Conservative backbencher Tom Tugendhat is arguing the UK could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/14/uk-could-unilaterally-exit-eu-in-next-10-days-senior-tory-mp-says\">make a snap Brexit on 24 August</a>, followed by an immediate general election, with the Irish border issue solved by a Northern Ireland-only backstop. No 10 says it has no such plan.</p> \n<p>Farmers for a People\u2019s Vote will herd a small flock of sheep past the Cabinet Office this morning as they warn that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/15/half-of-uk-farms-could-fail-after-no-deal-brexit-report-warns\">more than half of UK farms could go broke</a> if Britain crashes out of the EU on 31 October. The group says the EU and other countries would immediately apply tariffs and other barriers on food imports from the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit. At the same time, UK tariffs on imports would be slashed in order to keep prices down for consumers, with British farmers left unable to compete.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018We will give a solid response\u2019 \u2013 </strong>Tensions have heightened over Kashmir after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/14/kashmir-more-protests-expected-as-india-marks-independence\">Pakistan\u2019s PM, Imran Khan, threatened to \u201cteach India a lesson\u201d</a> over its revocation of the disputed region\u2019s special status. \u201cThe Pakistani army has solid information that they [India] are planning to do something in Pakistani Kashmir, and they are ready and will give a solid response,\u201d said Khan. Millions of people in Indian-administered Kashmir remain without landlines, mobiles or internet access.

Eleven climbers were killed or went missing on the mountain in May: nine on the Nepalese side and two on the Tibetan side. Climbers and guides criticised officials for allowing anyone who paid \u00a39,000 to attempt the ascent. Nepal issued 381 permits for Everest for this year\u2019s climbing season.

We were hoping to see some sea birds and I was expecting to see a puffin or two, if we were lucky. But we saw guillemots, Arctic terns, fulmars, shags, razorbills, kittiwakes and hundreds of puffins. We also spotted grey seals lounging on the rocks. My expectations were already blown out of the water, but then on the return journey we came across a pod of bottlenose dolphins. The captain did a handbrake turn and they jumped alongside the boat. As a child I adored dolphins but had never seen them in the wild\u2013 it was such a magical moment and so unexpected.<br>\u2022 <em>Farne island boat trips at <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/farne-islands/features/getting-to-the-farnes\" title=\"\">National Trust website</a> </em><br><strong>Ellen</strong></p> \n<h2>Humpback whales, Madagascar</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a44550679acda4e01c9b8e94a1e2875207bb72a5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a44550679acda4e01c9b8e94a1e2875207bb72a5/0_134_4016_2409/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A humpback whale breaching off \u00cele Sainte-Marie, Madagascar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A humpback whale breaching off \u00cele Sainte-Marie, Madagascar.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paolo Torchio/Barcroft Media</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>With two friends I was on the last lap of an adventure in Madagascar, spending a few days relaxing on Nosy Boraha (also called \u00cele Sainte-Marie).

After a few minutes they disappeared, leaving the three of us scanning the horizon for signs of movement. Suddenly, a few feet from our canoe, the huge eye of the mother appeared, deep, black, and staring straight at us. She was giving us the once-over and, deciding we were not a threat, she rolled over to reveal her calf, nestled against her belly.

The city is one of the best places in the world for spotting great white sharks, and we hopped on a conservation boat with some PhD students studying great whites\u2019 behaviour in Hout Bay. The boat took us to Seal Island, about 20 minutes out. Around 30,000 seals were crammed on to what was essentially a very large rock. Deafened by the noise of the seals, we watched as great whites started circling the island, picking off young seals one by one. The sheer power of the sharks was intense. To top the trip off, we were followed by a pod of around 20 dolphins on the way back to shore and spotted a Bryde\u2019s whale descending.

For an altogether more relaxing swim with the likelihood of encountering these magnificent creatures, I often head to Carlisle Bay early in the morning. At that time of the day everyone is at the far ends of the beach and the tourist boats are nowhere to be seen. We have spent many a peaceful hour snorkelling around the shipwreck and coral, almost always in the company of a handful of sea turtles and huge shoals of reef fish. <br><strong>Kirsty Yeomans</strong></p> \n<h2>Rockpools, Fuerteventura</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"029602f64fa1e5f95700da65a6a48bc791526761\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/029602f64fa1e5f95700da65a6a48bc791526761/0_335_5023_3014/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rockpools on the coast of Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rockpools on the coast of Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Is there anything more captivating than a rock pool? Discovering these miniature ecosystems on a holiday in Corralejo, Fuerteventura, took me straight back to my childhood. Aged five, crouching on a Cornish beach, prodding anemones and scooping more sand than sea life into a bucket, life couldn\u2019t have been more glorious. Now older, I\u2019ve recaptured that pleasure, spotting tiny hermit crabs, suckerfish and curious little beautifully coloured blennies. Transparent shrimp tickled my feet as they investigated me, and crabs emerged from their rocky shelters to graze on algae. I could have spent hours watching all these fascinating little creatures.<br><strong>Robyn</strong></p> \n<h2>Otter, Isle of Skye<br></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aca850a179a9ad98e8e448bf2cc58c35b1c63e3d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aca850a179a9ad98e8e448bf2cc58c35b1c63e3d/0_91_1440_864/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Otter in Broadford Bay\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The otter was too engrossed to notice us.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pete Davis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There was a hissing sound like an angry cat and I looked up to see my first British otter in the wild \u2013 the culmination of many years of unsuccessful otter walks from the River Otter in Devon to the Isle of Mull. Otters are claimed on many rivers and much of our coastline but they have been avoiding me for years! My wife caught up with me just as the otter disappeared into Broadford Bay. We headed back down the coast savouring the late afternoon light and suddenly the otter re-emerged from the sea and climbed out on to a rock with a newly caught crab. It was too engrossed to notice us this time, and we enjoyed a superb and extended view of this beautiful and elusive creature.<br><strong>Pete Davis</strong></p> \n<h2>Puffins, Staffa, Inner Hebrides<br></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"388700cfee235cda6c8a37ff30a9806f749a315c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/388700cfee235cda6c8a37ff30a9806f749a315c/0_340_5052_3032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Puffins on Staffa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Puffins on Staffa.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A 50-minute boat ride from Fionnphort, Mull, off the west coast of Scotland, is the Isle of Staffa.

The Dow Jones plunged 800 points, or 3%, while the broader S&amp;P 500 sank also 3% and is now more than 6% off its July peak. The selling continued in Asia on Thursday with the Nikkei down 1.38% and the benchmark Australian market suffering its worst day since last October by dropping 2.74%. Losses were more modest in Shanghai and Hong Kong and shares in London and New York were on course to bounce back on Thursday. But oil prices continued to fall after sinking 5% on Wednesday as fears of a global slowdown intensified. For the first time ever recorded, the yield on 30-year US treasuries dipped below 2% on Thursday. Wednesday\u2019s selloff on Wall Street hit financial services badly, with Goldman Sachs dropping more than 4%. The sharp share declines came after a rally on Tuesday that following a statement by US trade negotiators that aggressive tariffs on some Chinese-made products, including popular consumer goods, would be delayed three months to 15 December. While an inverted bond yield curve is a classic warning sign of a recession \u2013 having preceded every economic decline in the past 60 years \u2013 some experts, including former Fed chief Janet Yellen, believe that a US recession can still be avoided. They argue that the bond market is predicting low growth in the future, but hopefully not a full-blown downturn. Still, the inversion between two-year and 10-year bond notes, last seen in 2007 as the American economy lurched into a recession, spooked investors. \u201cThis is not a positive sign for the market.

Meanwhile, Donald Trump continued his calls for further cuts in US interest rate cuts, ramping up pressure on central bankers to make the change at their next meeting in September. The president said on Twitter that the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, had been \u201cvery very late\u201d in cutting rates.

With Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bank predicted that the country\u2019s economy would continue to shrink in the current quarter, meeting the definition of a recession, economists urged Berlin to sharply boost government spending quickly to prop up growth. The German economy is also suffering from unpredictable UK efforts to leave the European Union \u2013 uncertainty that is discouraging new investment in German industry.

Belfast human rights law firm Phoenix Law confirmed on Thursday it had been instructed by Gareth Lee to take his case to the European court of human rights (ECHR). Lee was told by Ashers bakery in 2014 that it would not make a cake with the message \u201cSupport Gay Marriage\u201d on it because it was contrary to the owners\u2019 religious beliefs. Four years later the supreme court reversed earlier decisions at Belfast county court and court of appeal that Ashers had discriminated against Lee on the grounds of him being gay. Five judges on the supreme court, which in 2018 sat for the first time in Northern Ireland, found that the bakery did not refuse Lee\u2019s order because of his sexual orientation. They ruled therefore that there was no discrimination on those grounds. But Lee\u2019s legal team are now arguing in the ECHR that the supreme court ruling should be overturned because baking the cake did not imply \u201cthe bakery supporting (expressly or implicitly) the message of the cake\u201d.

After a rainy rendezvous in the Himalayan foothills, the pair embark on a brisk five-mile trek through Bengal tiger country with pitstops for Grylls to manhandle elephant dung.

      "bodyText": "Man vs Wild With Bear Grylls and PM Modi 11pm, Discovery After scrambling over Alaskan terrain with Barack Obama in 2015, the bush tucker man Bear Grylls buddies up with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, for a special episode of his survival travelogue. After a rainy rendezvous in the Himalayan foothills, the pair embark on a brisk five-mile trek through Bengal tiger country with pitstops for Grylls to manhandle elephant dung. For his part, the 68-year-old Modi matches the pace, but seems unwilling to veer too far from his list of talking points about conservation. Graeme Virtue Ross Kemp Living With Online Gambling Addiction 7.30pm, ITV The final episode of Kemp\u2019s series tracking modern dysfunctions explores the human collateral damage that is a byproduct of an industry that is worth \u00a35.4bn a year. He meets addicts who have lost everything and gambles a few quid himself in the hope of understanding. Eye-opening in its way. Phil Harrison Fugitives 8pm, BBC One The third film in the gritty real-crime series begins with a Metropolitan police extradition unit searching for two people convicted of slavery and extortion offences in Italy. Later, a team in Derbyshire are led a merry dance in their hunt for a felon wanted for perverting the course of justice in Slovakia.

MB This Way Up 10pm, Channel 4 Wittier by the week, Aisling Bea\u2019s bittersweet comedy places the emphasis firmly on the sweet in this episode. It is dedicated to demonstrating how everyone has been made so paranoid in the age of offence that they are even afraid to make jokes. Plus, a private tuition job goes horribly, gloriously wrong. MB Spank Me Harder: The Sex Business 10pm, Channel 5 From OAP escorts to transgender sex workers, nothing is off limits in this sex-themed documentary strand. While it has raised Ofcom\u2019s hackles with its graphic content, it is at least a fairly informative series, marrying Channel 5\u2019s growing obs-doc prowess with one of its favourite subjects. Hannah J Davies Film choice The Sugarland Express (Steven Spielberg, 1974) 6.50pm, TCM Movies After the success of his TV movie Duel, Steven Spielberg went back on the road for his first feature with this tragi-comic tale of a couple on the run across Texas, pursued by an armada of cop cars.

They sound a bit like episodes of Louis Theroux\u2019s Weird Weekends. Skin, in her blunt, affecting way calls it \u201clunacy\u201d. One time, they showed up to perform only to find that their set had been cancelled due to an anti-fascist demonstration. \u201cThey said, \u2018Well, you have a song called Little Baby Swastikkka right?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 He goes, \u2018And you\u2019re a skinhead right?\u2019 It\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah.\u2019 \u2018And the name of the band is Skunk Anazi?\u2019 I was like \u2018NOOOO, it\u2019s Skunk Anansie!\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At one US diner, people 'were praying for us: \"Please God, look after the heathens on the other table\"</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another time, at a US diner, they noticed the people at the table next to them had started praying. \u201cWe suddenly realised that they were praying for us. They were like, \u2018Please God, look after the heathens on the other table. May they find God and may they find the word. So, of course, we acted up.\u201d Towards the end of the tour, having been caught with weed at the US border after a stopover in Canada, Skunk\u2019s whole crew got sent back to the UK. \u201cWe had to get a new crew in America. They were the proper typical kind of American crew: horrible and greasy and slimy.\u201d</p> <p>The singer, born Deborah Anne Dyer, lived on military bases \u2013 her dad worked in the Royal Air Force \u2013 before moving to Brixton as a young girl, just around the corner from her grandad. \u201cIn those days, Brixton was a black place,\u201d she says with a hint of nostalgia. \u201cIt was one of the places that white people wouldn\u2019t go to. There was always a transient level of people. But Brixton is, underneath it all, a black community. And that\u2019s what I grew up in really.\u201d</p> <p>Her family<strong> </strong>moved from Jamaica to the UK as part of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush generation</a>, and Skin feels their connection to music is innate. \u201cEveryone in my family can sing. They can all sing. They just didn\u2019t work on it, so they ain\u2019t got great voices. But if they\u2019d worked on it, like I did, they would have been good. I was the one who had the drive and ambition to do music and to be successful.\u201d Her voice is often singled out as one of the best in rock. She sings, and articulates in general, from a pure-sounding place. Husky would never be the right word. It\u2019s high and precise with plenty of vibrato.</p> <p>Skin\u2019s first real exposure to music was through the shebeens her grandad would throw \u2013 however, the last time she labelled his parties as such in an interview, she got in trouble with her mum. \u201cIt was a shebeen. But for the purposes of this conversation, let\u2019s pretend it wasn\u2019t and it was a residential club.\u201d She pauses. \u201cI don\u2019t care what they say, it was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/jun/22/from-the-archive-south-africa-illegal-alcohol-sophiatown\">shebeen</a>.\u201d Bob Marley was one of the most lauded visitors, and the events set her down the path she is on now. The punters would listen to ska and Prince Buster, dancing and drinking the night away.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6eOKP4c140\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z6eOKP4c140?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cMy earliest memories were sitting at the top of the steps and watching everybody, watching all those people dance and hang out. And then at a certain point, we had to go to bed.\u201d Leaving the party was always a wrench so, later in life, she figured out a way to stay, at least symbolically. Although she studied interior design and computing at university, she quickly came to know the parameters of what would constitute personal success. \u201cNow, I think fame is a big part of people wanting to be successful. And it\u2019s a barometer. But for me, being successful was just, \u2018I wanna do that and I want to do that all day until I die, and not have to do anything else.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>For her mum, meanwhile, Skin wasn\u2019t successful until she appeared, lithe and glistening, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5zexel5lp4\">on Top of the Pops</a> in 1996. \u201cThat\u2019s when my mum stopped moaning at me and said, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re doing all right! You\u2019re on television.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Skunk Anansie\u2019s latest track, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6eOKP4c140\">What You Do for Love</a>, is their first original outing since 2016, and brings us back around to politics. Top of the Pops no longer exists, but Skin believes rock is having a renaissance thanks to social media and that, especially in London, there is a bubbling lesbian, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/feminism\">feminist</a> scene. The track again speaks to the contradictions and divides we\u2019re witnessing in society. \u201cThe fascists will say they love God,\u201d she explains. \u201cYou use the word love but you\u2019re doing really heinous things to a lot of people. And so that\u2019s just where the idea for that song came from.\u201d</p> <p>Despite her strong moral views, I wonder how it feels to no longer be at the radical forefront when it comes to perceptions of marginalised identities. \u201cWe write songs about all different kinds of things,\u201d she says, rewrapping the pink patchwork jacket she\u2019s wearing. \u201cIt\u2019s just you have a black shaven-headed woman fronting and there are all the preconceived notions about that. In actual fact, I never really thought anything I did was radical at all.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://skunkanansie.com/live-dates\">Skunk Anansie tour until 7 September</a>.</p>",

We\u2019re all proud of the fact he\u2019s a black man, doing the black man things.\u201d In terms of Skin\u2019s own voyage with Skunk Anansie, it was their maiden tour of the US that contained some of the oddest occurrences. They sound a bit like episodes of Louis Theroux\u2019s Weird Weekends. Skin, in her blunt, affecting way calls it \u201clunacy\u201d. One time, they showed up to perform only to find that their set had been cancelled due to an anti-fascist demonstration. \u201cThey said, \u2018Well, you have a song called Little Baby Swastikkka right?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 He goes, \u2018And you\u2019re a skinhead right?\u2019 It\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah.\u2019 \u2018And the name of the band is Skunk Anazi?\u2019 I was like \u2018NOOOO, it\u2019s Skunk Anansie!\u2019\u201d Another time, at a US diner, they noticed the people at the table next to them had started praying. \u201cWe suddenly realised that they were praying for us. They were like, \u2018Please God, look after the heathens on the other table. May they find God and may they find the word. So, of course, we acted up.\u201d Towards the end of the tour, having been caught with weed at the US border after a stopover in Canada, Skunk\u2019s whole crew got sent back to the UK. \u201cWe had to get a new crew in America. They were the proper typical kind of American crew: horrible and greasy and slimy.\u201d The singer, born Deborah Anne Dyer, lived on military bases \u2013 her dad worked in the Royal Air Force \u2013 before moving to Brixton as a young girl, just around the corner from her grandad. \u201cIn those days, Brixton was a black place,\u201d she says with a hint of nostalgia. \u201cIt was one of the places that white people wouldn\u2019t go to. There was always a transient level of people. But Brixton is, underneath it all, a black community. And that\u2019s what I grew up in really.\u201d Her family moved from Jamaica to the UK as part of the Windrush generation, and Skin feels their connection to music is innate. \u201cEveryone in my family can sing. They can all sing. They just didn\u2019t work on it, so they ain\u2019t got great voices. But if they\u2019d worked on it, like I did, they would have been good. I was the one who had the drive and ambition to do music and to be successful.\u201d Her voice is often singled out as one of the best in rock. She sings, and articulates in general, from a pure-sounding place. Husky would never be the right word. It\u2019s high and precise with plenty of vibrato. Skin\u2019s first real exposure to music was through the shebeens her grandad would throw \u2013 however, the last time she labelled his parties as such in an interview, she got in trouble with her mum. \u201cIt was a shebeen. But for the purposes of this conversation, let\u2019s pretend it wasn\u2019t and it was a residential club.\u201d She pauses. \u201cI don\u2019t care what they say, it was a shebeen.\u201d Bob Marley was one of the most lauded visitors, and the events set her down the path she is on now. The punters would listen to ska and Prince Buster, dancing and drinking the night away. \u201cMy earliest memories were sitting at the top of the steps and watching everybody, watching all those people dance and hang out. And then at a certain point, we had to go to bed.\u201d Leaving the party was always a wrench so, later in life, she figured out a way to stay, at least symbolically. Although she studied interior design and computing at university, she quickly came to know the parameters of what would constitute personal success. \u201cNow, I think fame is a big part of people wanting to be successful. And it\u2019s a barometer. But for me, being successful was just, \u2018I wanna do that and I want to do that all day until I die, and not have to do anything else.\u2019\u201d For her mum, meanwhile, Skin wasn\u2019t successful until she appeared, lithe and glistening, on Top of the Pops in 1996. \u201cThat\u2019s when my mum stopped moaning at me and said, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re doing all right! You\u2019re on television.\u2019\u201d Skunk Anansie\u2019s latest track, What You Do for Love, is their first original outing since 2016, and brings us back around to politics. Top of the Pops no longer exists, but Skin believes rock is having a renaissance thanks to social media and that, especially in London, there is a bubbling lesbian, feminist scene. The track again speaks to the contradictions and divides we\u2019re witnessing in society. \u201cThe fascists will say they love God,\u201d she explains. \u201cYou use the word love but you\u2019re doing really heinous things to a lot of people. And so that\u2019s just where the idea for that song came from.\u201d Despite her strong moral views, I wonder how it feels to no longer be at the radical forefront when it comes to perceptions of marginalised identities. \u201cWe write songs about all different kinds of things,\u201d she says, rewrapping the pink patchwork jacket she\u2019s wearing. \u201cIt\u2019s just you have a black shaven-headed woman fronting and there are all the preconceived notions about that. In actual fact, I never really thought anything I did was radical at all.\u201d \u2022 Skunk Anansie tour until 7 September.",

The water is also then diverted to a nearby treatment plant, where it can subsequently be used to clean streets and water parks. \u201cThe need for sustainable management has forced us to recover ancestral practices,\u201d says Jorge Olcina, professor of analytical geography at the University of Alicante. \u201cYou could say that these rainwater storage facilities in Alicante and Barcelona are the new aljibes of the 21st century.\u201d Over eight centuries, the Arab rulers of Spain became masters of water management and conservation. Much of this knowledge was lost when they were expelled en masse in the early 17th century. The park uses some of the same principles as the aljibe. \u201cWhen the rainfall is too heavy for the storm drains to cope, the overflow is diverted to the park,\u201d explains Amelia Navarro, director of sustainable development for the Alicante water authority. \u201cIt has the capacity of 18 Olympic pools but it\u2019s never reached more than 30%,\u201d she says, not even after its first big in test 2017 when there was unusually heavy rain. The park has been landscaped with native Mediterranean plants and rapidly populated by resident and migratory birds and small creatures, a fitting development given that marjal is the Spanish word for a coastal wetland. Since it opened in 2015, around 90 species of birds have been spotted in the park, an oasis among apartment blocks. \u201cWe introduced larvae-eating fish so that we don\u2019t get mosquitoes,\u201d said Navarro, adding that the water is oxygenated to reduce algae growth. When storms break, rising water levels trip an acoustic alarm to warn people to leave. The park is then closed until the rain eases off. La Marjal was built in two years for \u20ac3.7 million, a quarter of the cost of the city\u2019s traditional concrete reservoir. It also costs only \u20ac50,000 a year to maintain. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who end up running these projects so they have to be affordable,\u201d says Miguel Rodr\u00edguez, head of operations at the public-private Aguas de Alicante. \u201cUltimately, the public pays so we have to keep costs down.\u201d Although the park is a clever and relatively inexpensive solution, Spain\u2019s urban water authorities have been generally slow to adapt to the climate crisis, says Leandro del Moral, professor of human geography at the University of Seville. Only Madrid, C\u00e1diz and Seville have made any significant progress, he says. The country\u2019s water plans, announced every five years, now predict that 10-15% less water will be available in the near future, as higher temperatures brought on by global heating mean more water is lost through evaporation and plant respiration. \u201cEven if it rains as much as before there will be less water,\u201d says Del Moral. \u201cThis is a clear message that climate change is having an impact. Cities need to anticipate, not react to, the increased risk of drought.\u201d \u201cWe need new infrastructures, which are very expensive,\u201d says Francisco Bartual, managing director of Aguas de Alicante. \u201cWe have upgraded the water network to the point that it\u2019s operating at around 90%, which means we\u2019re letting very little water go to waste.\u201d But water is a scarce resource and political interests often trump environmental ones. Although agriculture accounts for only 3% of GDP, it takes up 80% of water consumption \u2013 and farmers are a major voting bloc. Water gets diverted from wet regions to dry, and Spain\u2019s few major rivers are interrupted by hundreds of dams, all of which impacts the big cities. \u201cAgriculture has to reduce water consumption when there is danger of drought, not when it has already arrived, when it is too late,\u201d says Del Moral. \u201cBut this is a political hot potato.\u201d Storing and recycling water, as La Marjal was designed to do, are rising up the list of alternatives.

      "body": "<p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/oct/28/science.research1\" title=\"\">Dutch elm disease</a> spread across Britain in the 1970s, the country fell into mourning. When the sentinel trees that framed our horizons were felled, their loss was a constant topic of sad and angry conversation. Today, just a few years into the equally devastating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ash-dieback\" title=\"\">ash dieback</a> epidemic, and as the first great trees are toppled, most of us appear to have forgotten all about it. I\u2019ve travelled around much of Britain this summer, and seen the disease almost everywhere. A <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-47483197\" title=\"\">survey</a> published this spring found infected trees across roughly three-quarters of England and Wales: the spread has been as rapid and devastating as ecologists predicted. But in this age of hypernormalisation, only a few people still seem to care. Ash to ashes: our memories wither as quickly as the trees.</p> <p>And almost nothing has been learned. Our disease prevention rules, whose scope is restricted by the European Union and the World Trade Organization, and whose enforcement is restricted by the British government\u2019s austerity, do little to prevent similar plagues afflicting our remaining trees. Several deadly pathogens are marching across Europe. While it is hard to prevent some of these plagues from spreading across land, there is a simple measure that would stop most of them from spreading across water: a ban on the import of all live plants except those grown from tissue cultures, in sterile conditions.</p> <p>But bans are more or less banned. Nothing must be allowed to obstruct free trade. Instead, the world\u2019s governments rely on hand wringing. Take, for example, a lethal plague called <a href=\"https://planthealthportal.defra.gov.uk/pests-and-diseases/high-profile-pests-and-diseases/xylella/\" title=\"\"><em>Xylella fastidiosa</em></a>, which is <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07389-8\" title=\"\">ravaging olive groves in Italy</a> and threatens a remarkable variety of trees and shrubs, including oak, sycamore, plane and cherry. The <a href=\"https://planthealthportal.defra.gov.uk/assets/uploads/Xylella-CP-May-19.pdf\" title=\"\">system for preventing its spread</a> depends on inspections of random consignments of known host plants, and a passport scheme to ensure they aren\u2019t imported from infected areas. This system is likely to be useless. The EU keeps a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/plant/docs/ph_biosec_legis_emergency_db-host-plants_update12.pdf\" title=\"\">list of plants</a> that can carry <em>Xylella</em>. It has been <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/plant_health_biosecurity/legislation/emergency_measures/xylella-fastidiosa/susceptible_en\" title=\"\">updated 12 times in four years</a>, as new carriers emerge. No one knows how many more host species there might be. Visual inspections won\u2019t reveal plants that carry the disease without symptoms. Random sampling won\u2019t protect us from a plague that can be introduced by a single plant.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/06/ash-dieback-expected-cost-british-economy-15bn\">Ash dieback expected to cost British economy nearly \u00a315bn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nor do we know whether <em>Xylella</em> is the most urgent risk to our remaining trees, or whether an entirely new contagion will hit them instead. Many plant pathogens evolve at extraordinary speed, jump unexpectedly from one host to another, suddenly hybridise with each other, and behave in radically different ways in different environments. A system that regulates only known risks is bound to fail.</p> <p>Even in economic terms, the live plant trade is senseless. Ash dieback alone, according to a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960982219303318\" title=\"\">paper in Current Biology</a>, will cost this country around \u00a315bn. But the UK\u2019s import and export of all live plants amounts to \u00a3300m a year \u2013 2% of the costs of this disease. The paper estimates that another 47 major tree pests and diseases now threaten to arrive in Britain, and these are just the known plagues. In ecological terms, this legislative failure is a total disaster. For the sake of deregulatory machismo, we face the prospect of tree species everywhere eventually meeting their deadly pathogens. Where logging and climate breakdown have so far failed to eliminate the world\u2019s forests, imported diseases threaten to complete the job.</p> <p>What will come next? Will our beech trees succumb to <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/epp.12022\" title=\"\"><em>Phytophthora kernoviae</em></a>, a disease that appears to have been imported to Cornwall on infected shrubs from New Zealand? Will Sitka spruce, on which commercial forestry in this country <a href=\"https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/statistics/forestry-statistics/forestry-statistics-2017/\" title=\"\">relies to an extraordinary extent</a>, be hammered by the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/eight-toothed-european-spruce-bark-beetle-ips-typographus\" title=\"\">larger eight-toothed spruce bark beetle</a>, found for the first time this year in a Kent woodland? Will it be hit by another marvellously named plague, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/forestry/article/92/1/26/5144836\" title=\"\"><em>Neonectria fuckeliana</em></a>? Or by something else entirely? As the trade in live plants reaches almost every corner of the Earth, nothing and nowhere is safe.</p> <p>Just as we need a precautionary approach, every lid is being ripped off, every barrier smashed, facilitating trade in everything, including pathogens.

      "bodyText": "As Dutch elm disease spread across Britain in the 1970s, the country fell into mourning. When the sentinel trees that framed our horizons were felled, their loss was a constant topic of sad and angry conversation. Today, just a few years into the equally devastating ash dieback epidemic, and as the first great trees are toppled, most of us appear to have forgotten all about it. I\u2019ve travelled around much of Britain this summer, and seen the disease almost everywhere. A survey published this spring found infected trees across roughly three-quarters of England and Wales: the spread has been as rapid and devastating as ecologists predicted. But in this age of hypernormalisation, only a few people still seem to care. Ash to ashes: our memories wither as quickly as the trees. And almost nothing has been learned. Our disease prevention rules, whose scope is restricted by the European Union and the World Trade Organization, and whose enforcement is restricted by the British government\u2019s austerity, do little to prevent similar plagues afflicting our remaining trees. Several deadly pathogens are marching across Europe. While it is hard to prevent some of these plagues from spreading across land, there is a simple measure that would stop most of them from spreading across water: a ban on the import of all live plants except those grown from tissue cultures, in sterile conditions. But bans are more or less banned. Nothing must be allowed to obstruct free trade. Instead, the world\u2019s governments rely on hand wringing. Take, for example, a lethal plague called Xylella fastidiosa, which is ravaging olive groves in Italy and threatens a remarkable variety of trees and shrubs, including oak, sycamore, plane and cherry. The system for preventing its spread depends on inspections of random consignments of known host plants, and a passport scheme to ensure they aren\u2019t imported from infected areas. This system is likely to be useless. The EU keeps a list of plants that can carry Xylella. It has been updated 12 times in four years, as new carriers emerge. No one knows how many more host species there might be. Visual inspections won\u2019t reveal plants that carry the disease without symptoms. Random sampling won\u2019t protect us from a plague that can be introduced by a single plant. Nor do we know whether Xylella is the most urgent risk to our remaining trees, or whether an entirely new contagion will hit them instead. Many plant pathogens evolve at extraordinary speed, jump unexpectedly from one host to another, suddenly hybridise with each other, and behave in radically different ways in different environments. A system that regulates only known risks is bound to fail. Even in economic terms, the live plant trade is senseless. Ash dieback alone, according to a paper in Current Biology, will cost this country around \u00a315bn. But the UK\u2019s import and export of all live plants amounts to \u00a3300m a year \u2013 2% of the costs of this disease. The paper estimates that another 47 major tree pests and diseases now threaten to arrive in Britain, and these are just the known plagues. In ecological terms, this legislative failure is a total disaster. For the sake of deregulatory machismo, we face the prospect of tree species everywhere eventually meeting their deadly pathogens. Where logging and climate breakdown have so far failed to eliminate the world\u2019s forests, imported diseases threaten to complete the job. What will come next? Will our beech trees succumb to Phytophthora kernoviae, a disease that appears to have been imported to Cornwall on infected shrubs from New Zealand? Will Sitka spruce, on which commercial forestry in this country relies to an extraordinary extent, be hammered by the larger eight-toothed spruce bark beetle, found for the first time this year in a Kent woodland? Will it be hit by another marvellously named plague, Neonectria fuckeliana? Or by something else entirely? As the trade in live plants reaches almost every corner of the Earth, nothing and nowhere is safe. Just as we need a precautionary approach, every lid is being ripped off, every barrier smashed, facilitating trade in everything, including pathogens. In response to a parliamentary question about Xylella, the environment minister, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, claimed that Brexit creates an opportunity to introduce \u201cstricter biosecurity measures\u201d. It does, but will it be used? Given that, for the monomaniacs who now run this country, the main purpose of leaving the EU is to escape its public protections, the chances of Brexit leading to stricter regulation of plant imports seem remote. Never mind that this trade makes neither ecological nor economic sense. Our government, like many others, favours a global trade regime that places the free movement of goods above all other values (while imposing ever tighter restrictions on the free movement of people). There\u2019s nothing good about ash dieback, but there is one useful thing that could be done: wherever possible, leave the dead trees to stand. There is more life in a dead tree than in a living tree: around 2,000 animal species in the UK rely on dead or dying wood for their survival. But (except in politics) there\u2019s a dearth of dead wood in this country. Many species, such as the lesser spotted woodpecker, the pied flycatcher and the stag beetle, are severely restricted by the shortage of decay, caused by our tidy-minded forestry.

We want a better life for everyone [whether we are] under the union flag or tricolour.\u201d</p> \n<p>There is a perception that in 1969 Northern Ireland\u2019s middle class, and by extension many of the non-aligned, went off to play golf in leafy enclaves, leaving the Troubles to unfold mainly in border towns and blighted urban pockets.</p> \n<p>For his part, Kennedy was hardly apolitical. He wanted \u2013 and still wants \u2013 Britain\u2019s Labour party to contest elections in Northern Ireland. Bereft of a leftwing option, Kennedy skirted politics and instead contributed by working in housing and reconciliation.</p> \n<p>The \u201cneithers\u201d surfaced in occasional elections, with the Alliance party scoring 14% in local elections in 1973 and 1977. But centrists lacked the urgency of nationalists and unionists who were locked in a zero-sum struggle that generated martyrs, songs, murals and parades. </p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to make a positive identity out of a negative definition,\u201d said Paul Nolan, a leading academic who studies social trends.</p> \n<p>The 1998 Good Friday agreement drew a line under violence and facilitated more fluid national identities but its focus on \u201cboth communities\u201d and \u201ctwo traditions\u201d entrenched binary politics, according to a 2018 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/25/northern-ireland-unionism-nationalism-tribalism\">Queen\u2019s University study</a>.</p> \n<p>However, the number of \u201cneithers\u201d still grew in the intervening 20 years, it found. They tended to have jobs, a good education and to have lived abroad. They were more likely to be women and Catholic.</p> \n<p>And the numbers would probably keep growing, said Katy Hayward, a co-author of the study. With Brexit and the recent electoral success of the Greens and the Alliance, a centre grouping in favour of devolution and EU membership seemed to be forming, she said. \u201cThose from a unionist a background that are pro-remain are reconsidering themselves as no longer unionist with a capital U.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the 2016 referendum, 57% of Northern Ireland voters opted to remain in the EU, but the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has since joined the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) in wanting to leave.</p> \n<p>It is unclear how \u201cneithers\u201d would vote in a unity referendum. It would depend on the impact of Brexit, the handling of cultural issues, such as same-sex marriage and the Irish language, and the details of a proposed united Ireland, said Nicholas Whyte, an analyst.</p> \n<p>Belfast still resembles a divided city. Flags and murals glorifying paramilitaries mark republican and loyalist territory; \u201cpeace walls\u201d split contentious neighbourhoods; and traditional parades and bonfires are used to taunt the other side.</p> \n<p>But change is afoot.</p> \n<p>Seemingly mundane developments, such as a bus route connecting east and west, had normalised journeys that cut across sectarian divides, said Fr Martin Magill, a Catholic priest on the Falls Road.</p> \n<p>Increasingly, foreigners come not to gawk at murals but for jobs in a burgeoning tech industry or for Titanic and Game of Thrones-themed tourism.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a23aa6133f634bac322a7025042e0c66ff6273f6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a23aa6133f634bac322a7025042e0c66ff6273f6/0_472_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People sit outside the Titanic Museum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People sit outside the Titanic Museum.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Orr/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Northern Ireland\u2019s other cultural export, poetry, has also evolved.</p> \n<p>Noland said cross-community \u201cplanter and gael\u201d collaborations between poets from each side of the political divide had given way to works by Sinead Morrissey, Alan Gillis and Leontia Flynn that reflect mobile, fluid identities.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is a perspective which allows them to touch glancingly on the Northern Ireland experience without ever being branded by tribal loyalties.\u201d</p>",

By 2021, the centenary of Northern Ireland\u2019s creation, Catholics are expected to outnumber Protestants but will fall well short of 50%, with \u201cothers\u201d accounting for the difference. \u201cWe\u2019re all minorities now,\u201d said Conor Houston, the founder of Connected Citizens, an initiative to foster dialogue and inclusion. \u201cNon-aligned people are starting to raise their voice.\u201d In the European elections in May, non-aligned parties took 21% of the vote, their highest share since the 1960s; Naomi Long, the leader of the cross-community Alliance party, astounded observers by winning a seat with 18.5% of first-preference votes. Last week an audience at F\u00e9ile an Phobail, a festival in the Sinn F\u00e9in bastion of west Belfast, welcomed Long almost as warmly as it did the Sinn F\u00e9in leader, Mary Lou McDonald. The paradox is that the centrist surge is happening amid polarisation that has collapsed power-sharing at Stormont and stirred resentment over unresolved \u201clegacy\u201d killings, many involving British soldiers. With nationalist and unionist blocs each hovering at around 40%, it is \u201cneithers\u201d who will be likely to determine the outcome of any referendum on unification with the Republic of Ireland, an existential choice, if it happens, paved by Brexit. The death of Lyra McKee, a 29-year-old journalist and activist shot by the New IRA in April, shone a light on a new generation that, like McKee, cares more about LGBTQ+ rights, healthcare and jobs than whether sovereignty lies in London or Dublin. Sara Canning, McKee\u2019s partner, has republican roots but does not yearn for unification. \u201cAs I grew up I realised that didn\u2019t match the person I was or my wants and needs for the future,\u201d she said. Pragmatism trumps ideology. \u201cMost of my friends are non-aligned. We want a better life for everyone [whether we are] under the union flag or tricolour.\u201d There is a perception that in 1969 Northern Ireland\u2019s middle class, and by extension many of the non-aligned, went off to play golf in leafy enclaves, leaving the Troubles to unfold mainly in border towns and blighted urban pockets. For his part, Kennedy was hardly apolitical. He wanted \u2013 and still wants \u2013 Britain\u2019s Labour party to contest elections in Northern Ireland. Bereft of a leftwing option, Kennedy skirted politics and instead contributed by working in housing and reconciliation. The \u201cneithers\u201d surfaced in occasional elections, with the Alliance party scoring 14% in local elections in 1973 and 1977. But centrists lacked the urgency of nationalists and unionists who were locked in a zero-sum struggle that generated martyrs, songs, murals and parades. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to make a positive identity out of a negative definition,\u201d said Paul Nolan, a leading academic who studies social trends. The 1998 Good Friday agreement drew a line under violence and facilitated more fluid national identities but its focus on \u201cboth communities\u201d and \u201ctwo traditions\u201d entrenched binary politics, according to a 2018 Queen\u2019s University study. However, the number of \u201cneithers\u201d still grew in the intervening 20 years, it found. They tended to have jobs, a good education and to have lived abroad. They were more likely to be women and Catholic. And the numbers would probably keep growing, said Katy Hayward, a co-author of the study. With Brexit and the recent electoral success of the Greens and the Alliance, a centre grouping in favour of devolution and EU membership seemed to be forming, she said. \u201cThose from a unionist a background that are pro-remain are reconsidering themselves as no longer unionist with a capital U.\u201d In the 2016 referendum, 57% of Northern Ireland voters opted to remain in the EU, but the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has since joined the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) in wanting to leave. It is unclear how \u201cneithers\u201d would vote in a unity referendum. It would depend on the impact of Brexit, the handling of cultural issues, such as same-sex marriage and the Irish language, and the details of a proposed united Ireland, said Nicholas Whyte, an analyst. Belfast still resembles a divided city. Flags and murals glorifying paramilitaries mark republican and loyalist territory; \u201cpeace walls\u201d split contentious neighbourhoods; and traditional parades and bonfires are used to taunt the other side. But change is afoot. Seemingly mundane developments, such as a bus route connecting east and west, had normalised journeys that cut across sectarian divides, said Fr Martin Magill, a Catholic priest on the Falls Road. Increasingly, foreigners come not to gawk at murals but for jobs in a burgeoning tech industry or for Titanic and Game of Thrones-themed tourism. Northern Ireland\u2019s other cultural export, poetry, has also evolved. Noland said cross-community \u201cplanter and gael\u201d collaborations between poets from each side of the political divide had given way to works by Sinead Morrissey, Alan Gillis and Leontia Flynn that reflect mobile, fluid identities. \u201cIt is a perspective which allows them to touch glancingly on the Northern Ireland experience without ever being branded by tribal loyalties.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Campaigners for a second referendum are herding a flock of sheep down Whitehall to protest against the impact a no-deal Brexit could have on the farming community. According to a new report commissioned by the supporters of second poll, more than half of UK farms could go out of business if Britain crashes out of the EU on 31 October. Backed by the People\u2019s Vote campaign and written by Dr S\u00e9an Rickard, former chief economist of the National Farmers\u2019 Union, the report warns that 50% of farms could go under as the government would prioritise keeping down food prices for consumers ahead of protecting agricultural producers. To coincide with the report and launch of the Farmers for a People\u2019s Vote group, campaigners are taking a small flock of sheep past the Cabinet Office where no-deal planning is taking place. The report says the EU and all the countries with whom it has free-trade agreements would immediately apply tariffs and non-tariff barriers on food imports from the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit. At the same time, UK tariffs on imports would be slashed or reduced to nothing. It argues: \u201cThe combination of the removal of support payments \u2013 only a proportion will be made up by enhanced environmental payments \u2013 and an adverse trading environment will render the majority of farm businesses unviable.

Helen Roberts from the National Sheep Association in Wales said in July it would be \u201cabsolutely catastrophic\u201d to leave with no deal and could lead to civil unrest among sheep farmers. Rickard said:\u201cThe campaign to leave the EU was based on the idea that the UK would quickly secure a comprehensive new trading relationship with Europe and that leaving would have only positive impacts on UK farming.

The slaughter, which was carried out by white Texas Rangers, US soldiers, and local vigilantes, was justified by labeling the Mexican American families \u201cbandits\u201d and criminals.</p> <p>The attack on Latino families in El Paso nearly two weeks ago left Valencia deeply afraid. \u201cIt\u2019s history repeating itself a hundred years later,\u201d she told the Guardian.</p> <p>The 3 August mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, which left 22 people dead, appeared to be the deadliest terror attack and hate crime against Latinos in recent American history.

When she learned, as an adult, that her great-grandfather had been murdered in a massacre, she was shocked, at first, and then determined to raise awareness.</p> <p>\u201cEvery since I\u2019ve been working on getting the Porvenir story out, I have always made reference to the fact that it can happen again,\u201d she said.</p> <h2>Lynchings and massacres</h2> <p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, public lynchings were an act of terror used against hundreds of Mexican Americans across the south-west, as well as against black Americans across the United States. The Porvenir massacre in 1918, which claimed the life of Valencia\u2019s great-grandfather, was part of a sweeping effort to consolidate white economic control of Texas, according to Monica Mu\u00f1oz Martinez, a professor of American studies at Brown University and a founding member of Refusing to Forget, a not-for-profit organization that advocates for public reckoning with racial violence in Texas.</p> <p>\u201cHistorians estimate that hundreds of Mexican Americans and Mexican nationals were murdered between 1910 and 1920, in Texas alone,\u201d Martinez said. </p> <p>\u201cPoliticians and the media and local residents described Mexicans, regardless of their citizenship, as violent people, as a threat to the nation and people who needed to be violently policed,\u201d Martinez said.</p> <p>The Texas Rangers, legendary as the \u201cgood guys\u201d of frontier law enforcement, were <a href=\"https://www.thestoryoftexas.com/discover/campfire-stories/texas-ranger\">at the center</a> of the violence and racial terror against Latino residents.</p> <p>To this day, the Porvenir massacre remains controversial: some white local residents in Texas <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/us/porvenir-massacre-texas-mexicans.html\">bristled</a> at the<a href=\"https://www.texasobserver.org/who-writes-history-the-fight-to-commemorate-a-massacre-by-the-texas-rangers/\"> attempt</a> to set up a public memorial to the massacre\u2019s victims and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/us/porvenir-massacre-texas-mexicans.html\">reportedly pushed</a> for more public recognition of Mexican American violence against white residents.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdf4684655bd73b26565e309bf0943a32c3999fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdf4684655bd73b26565e309bf0943a32c3999fd/0_0_2799_1866/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arlinda Valencia poses at her home in El Paso in April, with a portrait of her great-grandfather, Longino Flores, killed in the Porvenir massacre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arlinda Valencia poses at her home in El Paso in April, with a portrait of her great-grandfather, Longino Flores, killed in the Porvenir massacre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cedar Attanasio/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\ufeff</p> <p>\ufeff</p> <h2>\u2018A tremendous loss of life\u2019</h2> <p>In the past decades, violence by white residents against Latinos has often been tied to public debates over immigration \u2013 and to the federal government\u2019s decisions about how to treat migrants and refugees.</p> <p>More than 7,000 people, many of them from Mexico or Central America, have died trying to cross the border into the US in the past two decades, as changing US policies made the crossing more dangerous, Martinez said. \u201cThere are federal policies that have led to mass death at the border,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is a tremendous loss of life that the American public has largely ignored.\u201d</p> <p>Far-right citizen militia groups have organized since the 1980s to patrol the US-Mexico border, Martinez added. Just this April, the American Civil Liberties Union condemned the actions of a rightwing militia group, after video appeared to show militia members detaining a group of migrant families. A member of the militia group was later arrested for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/20/fbi-arrests-member-of-rightwing-militia-accused-of-detaining-migrants\">illegal weapons possession</a>.</p> <p>Anti-Latino hate crimes carried out by individual people are often closely connected to anti-immigrant polices and the broader public debate over immigration, said Juan Cartagena, president of the civil rights group LatinoJustice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cb39025ba2ad4ce05fdd9fe041560fa9964e9734\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb39025ba2ad4ce05fdd9fe041560fa9964e9734/0_0_1638_1395/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The mother and sister of Marcelo Lucero carry his portrait as they leave the church after his wake in Gualaceo, Ecuador.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"852\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The mother and sister of Marcelo Lucero carry his portrait as they leave the church after his wake in Gualaceo, Ecuador.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STR New / Reuters/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cartagena pointed at the death of <a href=\"https://projects.newsday.com/long-island/ms13-lucero-suffolk-police/\">Marcelo Lucero,</a> a 37-year-old from Ecuador, who was stabbed to death in Long Island in 2008 after being attacked by a group of local teenagers, who had reportedly said before the attack that they were planning \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/14/nyregion/14immigrant.html\">to go jump a Mexican</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Latino residents of the suburb outside New York City have been repeatedly attacked by white residents. In 2000, two men with white supremacist tattoos hired two Mexican day laborers for what they claimed was a job, drove them to a secluded building, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/05/nyregion/suffolk-man-gets-25-years-in-attack-on-laborers.html\">stabbed them</a>. In 2003, a group of teenagers were charged with arson and reckless endangerment after law enforcement officials said they had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/01/nyregion/4-suffolk-teenagers-charged-in-fire-at-home-of-mexicans.html\">thrown a burning object</a> into the home of a Mexican family, causing them to flee in terror.</p> <p>Cartagena said some of the attacks on Latinos were prompted by<strong> </strong>\u201cthe perception that the federal government wasn\u2019t doing anything to stop immigration, so they took it into their own hands ... people picking up a bat, [saying] go back home, go back to where you came from.\u201d</p> <p>Lucero, murdered in Long Island, had lived a quiet life in the United States for 16 years and had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/14/nyregion/14immigrant.html\">reportedly</a> been sending money back to support his mother, a cancer survivor.</p> <p>\ufeff</p> <h2>\u2018El Paso is a turning point\u2019</h2> <p>The El Paso attack is not the first time large numbers of Latinos have died in one of the United States\u2019 frequent public mass shootings.</p> <p>More Latinos were killed in the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, in 2016, than in the El Paso attack, Cartagena said. Activists estimated that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/14/latino-hispanic-orlando-shooting-victims\"> 90% of the victims</a> of the 2016 shooting at the popular LGBT club, which left 49 people dead, were Latino, may of them Puerto Rican. During the attack, the gunman made phone calls in which he pledged his loyalty to Islamic State.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b67181ba849e736cdd61038ea2e2b30169aa2b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b67181ba849e736cdd61038ea2e2b30169aa2b3/0_0_1678_1007/1000.jpg\" alt=\"About 90% of the victims of the 2016 shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando were Latino, according to activists.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">About 90% of the victims of the 2016 shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando were Latino, according to activists.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Genna Martin/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the El Paso shooting felt different, Cartagena noted. \u201cIt was clearly a manifestation of anti-Latino hate, anti-Mexican hate, to be very specific.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEl Paso is a turning point because it\u2019s citizen and non-citizen alike,\u201d Cartagena said.</p> <p>\u201cThe pre-El Paso feeling was, if you\u2019re not a citizen, keep your head down. If you are a citizen, watch out, everyone gets lumped together. Post-El Paso \u2013 now everybody\u2019s suspect, and it\u2019s very scary for us to think that you cannot go about your livelihood, your work and your family life.</p> <p>\u201cTo think that a person can be motivated to kill, quote unquote invaders, and of all places he goes to El Paso, Texas, where Mexicans have been living before this country was even forged,\u201d Cartagena said. \u201cIt\u2019s ahistorical.\u201d</p> <p>Martinez said that at least two previous major attacks in the United States may have been acts of terrorism against Latinos, though they were not portrayed that way in news coverage at the time. Both attacks deserved renewed scrutiny, she said.</p> <p>In 1970, a white man deliberately flew a plane into a Roman Catholic church near Brownsville, Texas. More than<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/24/archives/130-unhurt-as-pilot-dives-small-plane-into-church.html\"> 130 people</a> were in and around the church, including many Mexican American schoolchildren, but no one was harmed \u2013 an outcome hailed as a miracle.</p> <p>In 1984, a white man opened fire at a McDonald\u2019s in San Ysidro, California, leaving 22 people dead. Most of the victims were Mexican American and Mexican. The news coverage focused on the white shooter\u2019s mental health issues, Martinez said.</p> <p>Valencia, whose great-grandfather was killed in Porvenir, said the government of Donald Trump was contributing to a climate in which hate against Latinos thrived.</p> <p>\u201cWith the president we have, the things that he\u2019s been saying, it just gives me chills,\u201d Valencia said. \u201cThe fact that he\u2019s calling us murderers and rapists and drug dealers.\u201d</p> <p>The current administration was \u201cempowering white supremacy to step out into the light\u201d, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been there. You\u2019ve got to understand that. But it\u2019s kind of been in the darkness. It\u2019s kind of been hidden. And what\u2019s happened, with this president, it\u2019s that he\u2019s let them out. It\u2019s OK to hate Mexicans. It\u2019s OK to mistreat them. It\u2019s OK to hate anyone who\u2019s not white.\u201d</p>",

The 3 August mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, which left 22 people dead, appeared to be the deadliest terror attack and hate crime against Latinos in recent American history. A white nationalist manifesto that appeared to be linked to the shooting claimed that Latinos were \u201cinvaders\u201d, even though Latinos had been living in the area long before Texas became part of the United States. Valencia, 66, is the president of the local teachers\u2019 union in El Paso, where she has lived for three decades. When she learned, as an adult, that her great-grandfather had been murdered in a massacre, she was shocked, at first, and then determined to raise awareness. \u201cEvery since I\u2019ve been working on getting the Porvenir story out, I have always made reference to the fact that it can happen again,\u201d she said. Lynchings and massacres In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, public lynchings were an act of terror used against hundreds of Mexican Americans across the south-west, as well as against black Americans across the United States. The Porvenir massacre in 1918, which claimed the life of Valencia\u2019s great-grandfather, was part of a sweeping effort to consolidate white economic control of Texas, according to Monica Mu\u00f1oz Martinez, a professor of American studies at Brown University and a founding member of Refusing to Forget, a not-for-profit organization that advocates for public reckoning with racial violence in Texas. \u201cHistorians estimate that hundreds of Mexican Americans and Mexican nationals were murdered between 1910 and 1920, in Texas alone,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cPoliticians and the media and local residents described Mexicans, regardless of their citizenship, as violent people, as a threat to the nation and people who needed to be violently policed,\u201d Martinez said. The Texas Rangers, legendary as the \u201cgood guys\u201d of frontier law enforcement, were at the center of the violence and racial terror against Latino residents. To this day, the Porvenir massacre remains controversial: some white local residents in Texas bristled at the attempt to set up a public memorial to the massacre\u2019s victims and reportedly pushed for more public recognition of Mexican American violence against white residents. \ufeff \ufeff \u2018A tremendous loss of life\u2019 In the past decades, violence by white residents against Latinos has often been tied to public debates over immigration \u2013 and to the federal government\u2019s decisions about how to treat migrants and refugees. More than 7,000 people, many of them from Mexico or Central America, have died trying to cross the border into the US in the past two decades, as changing US policies made the crossing more dangerous, Martinez said. \u201cThere are federal policies that have led to mass death at the border,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is a tremendous loss of life that the American public has largely ignored.\u201d Far-right citizen militia groups have organized since the 1980s to patrol the US-Mexico border, Martinez added. Just this April, the American Civil Liberties Union condemned the actions of a rightwing militia group, after video appeared to show militia members detaining a group of migrant families. A member of the militia group was later arrested for illegal weapons possession. Anti-Latino hate crimes carried out by individual people are often closely connected to anti-immigrant polices and the broader public debate over immigration, said Juan Cartagena, president of the civil rights group LatinoJustice. Cartagena pointed at the death of Marcelo Lucero, a 37-year-old from Ecuador, who was stabbed to death in Long Island in 2008 after being attacked by a group of local teenagers, who had reportedly said before the attack that they were planning \u201cto go jump a Mexican\u201d. Latino residents of the suburb outside New York City have been repeatedly attacked by white residents. In 2000, two men with white supremacist tattoos hired two Mexican day laborers for what they claimed was a job, drove them to a secluded building, and stabbed them. In 2003, a group of teenagers were charged with arson and reckless endangerment after law enforcement officials said they had thrown a burning object into the home of a Mexican family, causing them to flee in terror. Cartagena said some of the attacks on Latinos were prompted by \u201cthe perception that the federal government wasn\u2019t doing anything to stop immigration, so they took it into their own hands ... people picking up a bat, [saying] go back home, go back to where you came from.\u201d Lucero, murdered in Long Island, had lived a quiet life in the United States for 16 years and had reportedly been sending money back to support his mother, a cancer survivor. \ufeff \u2018El Paso is a turning point\u2019 The El Paso attack is not the first time large numbers of Latinos have died in one of the United States\u2019 frequent public mass shootings. More Latinos were killed in the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, in 2016, than in the El Paso attack, Cartagena said. Activists estimated that 90% of the victims of the 2016 shooting at the popular LGBT club, which left 49 people dead, were Latino, may of them Puerto Rican. During the attack, the gunman made phone calls in which he pledged his loyalty to Islamic State. But the El Paso shooting felt different, Cartagena noted. \u201cIt was clearly a manifestation of anti-Latino hate, anti-Mexican hate, to be very specific.\u201d \u201cEl Paso is a turning point because it\u2019s citizen and non-citizen alike,\u201d Cartagena said. \u201cThe pre-El Paso feeling was, if you\u2019re not a citizen, keep your head down. If you are a citizen, watch out, everyone gets lumped together. Post-El Paso \u2013 now everybody\u2019s suspect, and it\u2019s very scary for us to think that you cannot go about your livelihood, your work and your family life. \u201cTo think that a person can be motivated to kill, quote unquote invaders, and of all places he goes to El Paso, Texas, where Mexicans have been living before this country was even forged,\u201d Cartagena said. \u201cIt\u2019s ahistorical.\u201d Martinez said that at least two previous major attacks in the United States may have been acts of terrorism against Latinos, though they were not portrayed that way in news coverage at the time. Both attacks deserved renewed scrutiny, she said. In 1970, a white man deliberately flew a plane into a Roman Catholic church near Brownsville, Texas. More than 130 people were in and around the church, including many Mexican American schoolchildren, but no one was harmed \u2013 an outcome hailed as a miracle. In 1984, a white man opened fire at a McDonald\u2019s in San Ysidro, California, leaving 22 people dead. Most of the victims were Mexican American and Mexican. The news coverage focused on the white shooter\u2019s mental health issues, Martinez said. Valencia, whose great-grandfather was killed in Porvenir, said the government of Donald Trump was contributing to a climate in which hate against Latinos thrived. \u201cWith the president we have, the things that he\u2019s been saying, it just gives me chills,\u201d Valencia said. \u201cThe fact that he\u2019s calling us murderers and rapists and drug dealers.\u201d The current administration was \u201cempowering white supremacy to step out into the light\u201d, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been there. You\u2019ve got to understand that. But it\u2019s kind of been in the darkness. It\u2019s kind of been hidden. And what\u2019s happened, with this president, it\u2019s that he\u2019s let them out. It\u2019s OK to hate Mexicans. It\u2019s OK to mistreat them. It\u2019s OK to hate anyone who\u2019s not white.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ryan Twyman was unarmed inside a parked car when two Los Angeles sheriff deputies approached and fired 34 rounds. Video of the entire incident, which happened in roughly 50 seconds, was as shocking as many police brutality cases that have gone viral in the US. But the killing of the 24-year-old father of three barely made the news. On that day, his death was far from unique: officers across LA shot five people in five separate incidents in just over 24 hours. Only one person survived. Families and activists said the bloodshed on 6 June provided a terrifying illustration of the culture of police violence and a system that trains officers to kill \u2013 while ensuring they won\u2019t face consequences. \u201cNobody deserves to be treated like that,\u201d Tommy Twyman, Ryan\u2019s mother, said on a recent afternoon, recounting how her son liked to talk to her on the phone once a day, always a true \u201cmama\u2019s boy\u201d. He loved sheltering dogs and dreamed of becoming a veterinarian, she said. \u201cYou took something that I\u2019m not gonna ever get back. You robbed me.\u201d Twyman was one of the more than 500 people who have been killed by on-duty officers in LA county or died in custody since 2013. That\u2019s according to Black Lives Matter LA, which maintains detailed spreadsheets tracking deaths at the hands of local law enforcement. Los Angeles has consistently ranked as one of America\u2019s deadliest regions for police violence, with one analysis finding that police shoot, on average, one person every five days. The county sheriff\u2019s department (LASD) \u2013 which killed Twyman and polices millions of people in the LA area outside of city limits \u2013 has a troubled record of brutality claims. Leading the department is Alex Villanueva, the elected sheriff sworn in last year and now mired in scandals, including over his reinstatement of a deputy previously fired for domestic violence and his collaboration with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). The FBI is also investigating a secret society of tattooed officers and other \u201cgang-like groups\u201d inside LASD \u2013 and whether deputies planted evidence and falsified reports. \u201cLA county sheriff\u2019s deputies are emboldened by who the sheriff is,\u201d said Melina Abdullah, a Black Lives Matter organizer who helps track killings and works with families. \u201cThere are gangs within the sheriff\u2019s department.\u201d On the streets of black and brown neighborhoods, this culture plays out in the form of harassment, racial profiling and abusive patrolling, critics said. LASD is known for having a \u201cwarrior mindset\u201d instead of a \u201cservice or guardian mindset\u201d in its treatment of citizens, said Alex Vitale, a Brooklyn College sociology professor. Twyman was a frequent victim of this mentality, his family said. \u201cWe call them the \u2018jump out boys\u2019,\u201d said Chiquita Twyman, Ryan\u2019s older sister. In Compton, a south LA city where Ryan lived, residents have grown accustomed to sheriff\u2019s deputies driving around with their doors partially open \u2013 so they can jump out at any moment to confront, detain and arrest people on the street, she said. \u201cI never knew how much a black man could get pulled over until my son became a teenager,\u201d said Tommy. \u201cIt never stopped.\u201d Charles Twyman, Ryan\u2019s father, said the police harassment \u201cbecomes a way of life\u201d, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re used to it. They talk about gangs in the inner city. Who is the bigger gang?\u201d Police even treated Ryan like a criminal when he was once suffering from a seizure, suggesting he was on drugs instead of helping him, she said. Sometimes, police would stop Ryan and eventually let him go, his mother said, after it became clear they had no reason to arrest him. But his final encounter with law enforcement was different. It escalated so quickly he had no time for a conversation. \u2018They came to assassinate\u2019 It was 7.30pm on 6 June when two LASD deputies drove up to the apartment complex in Willowbrook in south LA, a mile-and-a-half from Twyman\u2019s home in Compton. It was still light out when two deputies got out of the car, with guns pointed at a parked Kia, according to surveillance footage released by the department, which did not include audio. As the men approached on either side of the vehicle and opened one of the doors, the car appeared to reverse. Both deputies opened fire and continued shooting from a distance as the car rolled. One deputy returned to his vehicle, opened the trunk, grabbed a larger rifle \u2013 and continued shooting at the unmoving car in the distance. Within roughly 30 seconds, the men had fired a total of about 34 rounds at Twyman in the driver\u2019s seat, and a 22-year-old man in the passenger seat. \u201cThey came to assassinate and kill,\u201d said Chiquita, Ryan\u2019s sister, saying she was particularly disturbed by the first five seconds of the video: \u201cWatch the demeanor when they get out the car \u2026 They came there with intention to kill. They came there hunting for my brother.\u201d The sheriff\u2019s department released the footage with lengthy narration that presented Twyman as a criminal and a threat. \u201cThe vehicle was used as a weapon,\u201d said the commander April Tardy, claiming one of the deputies was \u201cstruck\u201d by the car door as Twyman \u201caccelerated\u201d the car in reverse, though in the video, the officer does not appear to be hit or lose his balance. He began firing, the captain continued, to \u201cavoid being knocked down and run over\u201d. Twyman, who was shot in the upper torso and pronounced dead on the scene, was \u201cunder investigation\u201d for illegal possession of weapons, and on probation after a gun possession conviction, Tardy said, adding that the department had been seeking to arrest him. She did not accuse him of any acts of violence. After the deputies finished shooting, they found no weapons in his car. Letitia Lynex, Twyman\u2019s aunt who lives nearby, rushed to the scene when she got word that something had happened. She said one officer initially told her a \u201cdeputy was down\u201d and refused to provide more information, saying: \u201cGoogle it.\u201d Eventually, a crowd formed, demanding answers, prompting some officers to \u201cdraw their guns down on us as if we were criminals\u201d, she said. Twyman remained lifeless in his car for hours as his relatives showed up trying to figure out what happened. Police have continued to mistreat the family by driving past their house in Compton, stationing themselves outside during a family gathering, and showing up at the funeral, the relatives said. They were also blindsided by the public release of the video, waking up to the horrifying footage on the news and their social media feeds. Tommy rushed to the bathroom to avoid seeing it as others viewed the final moments of his life. She still can\u2019t bring herself to watch it. Why officers keep killing Justice for Ryan would mean the officers who fired dozens of bullets at him face arrest, prosecution and prison, his family said. The odds of this happening are close to zero. But the family has some reason to maintain hope. After hundreds of killings by law enforcement during her tenure, the LA district attorney, Jackie Lacey, the county\u2019s elected prosecutor, has filed charges only once \u2013 against an LASD deputy who killed an unarmed man driving away in his car. The charges last December marked the first time an officer was charged for an on-duty killing in nearly 20 years, after roughly 1,500 shootings. LASD guidelines dictate that deputies shouldn\u2019t fire at moving cars unless someone in the vehicle is threatening deadly force with something other than the vehicle \u2013 a policy that is likely to be considered in the investigation of Twyman\u2019s death. The case resembled the controversial Vallejo, California, police killing of 22-year-old Willie McCoy, who was quickly shot 55 times while in his car. Charles, Ryan\u2019s father, said it was obvious that deadly force was unnecessary. He noted that days after his son was killed, LA police ended up on a high-speed chase with an armed man who was waving his handgun at the window. The incident ended after a long standoff and negotiations, and the man, who appeared to be white, was taken into custody without being harmed. Advocates hope a new landmark law in California, which dictates that police should only use deadly force when \u201cnecessary\u201d, will prevent this kind of death in the future. Current standards allow police to use deadly force whenever it\u2019s \u201creasonable\u201d. The footage suggests the killing was unnecessary, said Joanna Schwartz, a University of California, Los Angeles, law professor. \u201cCould it have been avoided? It seems like the answer is yes, in about 50 different ways.\u201d Departments need to enforce their policies restricting officers from firing at fleeing people, so that they face serious consequences when they violate the rules, added the sociology professor Alex Vitale. Otherwise, he said, officers would keep killing with impunity \u2013 and return to the streets. About three hours after Twyman\u2019s death, LASD deputies killed a 27-year-old man whom they had started following because, the department said, he was acting suspiciously. LASD said a handgun was recovered at the scene. LASD killed another man that day who the department said was armed and had barricaded himself in a house. Also that day, a Los Angeles police department (LAPD) officer killed a 59-year-old man carrying a \u201cbox cutter\u201d \u2013 fatally shooting the man while another officer fired a beanbag. A man accused of running from a traffic stop had been shot by LAPD just 20 hours prior. He was the only survivor. LASD declined the Guardian\u2019s repeated interview requests. Saying goodbye Twyman leaves behind three young children, ages one, two and three. Ryan Jr, the three-year-old, has struggled to process his father\u2019s absence, repeatedly asking: \u201cWhere\u2019s my dad?\u201d Sometimes, he stares at men\u2019s faces around him, wondering if they might be his father. Other times, the toddler asks to go home to \u201csee daddy\u201d in case he\u2019s waiting. The family designed Twyman\u2019s funeral program to look like a Time magazine cover celebrating him, filled with photos of him with his mother and his children. \u201cIn every picture, you can see how much of a family man he was,\u201d said Charles. \u201cHe protected everybody.\u201d Tommy has an alarm set on her phone that goes off every day at 8pm. It was her reminder to call her son to make sure he had taken his seizure medication. But they also both loved their daily catch-ups on the phone, she said, which sometimes would last an hour. \u201cIf anyone knows Ryan Twyman, they know what 8 o\u2019clock means,\u201d she said, with a smile. Tommy always worried about losing her son as he got older, afraid they wouldn\u2019t be as close after he moved out of the house, she recalled: \u201cWhen he turned 21, I told him, \u2018I don\u2019t know how to let you go,\u2019 and he told me, \u2018You don\u2019t have to let me go. I\u2019m gonna always be your baby.\u2019\u201d Since his death, she said, she can\u2019t bear to turn off her 8pm alarm.",

      "bodyText": "The national gender pay gap in Australia has remained stable at 14% with men on average earning $241.50 more per week than women. Australian Bureau of Statistics labour force figures released on Thursday show the gap has declined slightly from 14.1% in the past six months. Full-time average weekly earnings of women is at $1,484.80 compared with $1,726.30 for men. Workplace Gender Equality Agency director Libby Lyons said it was disappointing there hadn\u2019t been a stronger fall. \u201cWe still need to have more Australian employers taking action on gender equality and addressing pay equity,\u201d Lyons said in a statement. This year, Un-Equal Pay Day will be on 28 August, marking the 59 additional days from the end of the previous financial year that women must work \u2013 on average \u2013 to earn the same amount as men earned that year. Lyons said the day highlighted the barriers Australian women still face in having the same opportunities and rewards in the workplace as men. On a state-by-state basis Western Australia had the highest gender pay gap on 21.8%, followed by Queensland on 16.6%. South Australia had the lowest on 9.2%, closely followed by Victoria on 9.6%. RMIT University academic and economist Leonora Risse said high-paying jobs in the male-dominated mining industry skewed WA and Queensland\u2019s results. Risse said fluctuations in macroeconomic conditions had caused the gender pay gap to widen and narrow in the past decade and there was no guaranteed path ahead to closing it. \u201cAbout a decade ago, what we saw was a really rapid acceleration of wages in mining and construction and transport and these are male-dominated industries. That had the effect of widening the gender pay gap and it was at the mercy of economic forces,\u201d she said. An easing off of the resources sector boom has helped to slow down what was previously a growing divide between male- and female-concentrated industries, she said. On an industry basis, financial and insurance services were the worst gender pay gap performer followed by healthcare, real estate, science services and administration. Individual wage negotiation was more prevalent in the financial sector, Risse said, despite a fairly even composition of men and women. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily because men are better negotiators but they are rewarded more favourably for negotiating. Women \u2026 know that if they go too aggressively it can backfire,\u201d Risse said. The public sector had the lowest gender pay gap, followed by the retail sector where award agreements were prevalent. The national gender pay gap measures the difference between the average weekly full-time base salary earnings of both genders, expressed as a percentage of men\u2019s earnings. It is a measure of women\u2019s overall position in the paid workforce and does not compare like roles. The gender pay gap is not the difference between two people being paid differently for work of equal or comparable value which is unlawful.",

In July 2018, Public Transport Victoria (now the Department of Transport) released a dataset containing 1.8bn travel records for 15.1m myki public transport users for the period between June 2015 and June 2018. The data contained the touch on and touch off data such as time and date and location where people used their myki either jumping on a tram or train or bus around the state. The data was released as part of the Data Science Melbourne event, and the department had said it had anonymised the data, meaning people could not be identified in the sets of data. But researchers at the University of Melbourne discovered that by checking their own myki history online, they were able to match up their travel times with the data on file, and then had a complete set of their entire travel history for the three-year period on that card. \u201cAs soon as we had two events, there was only one possible match, which is our card,\u201d Dr Chris Culnane told Guardian Australia. The researchers, led by Culnane, were also then able to identify their co-travellers, merely because they had tapped on at close to the same time and at the same location as them. Once that identification was made, they were able to view that person\u2019s entire public transport travel history for the three-year period. \u201cThat is a significant concern because you obviously have a lot of information about yourself, so finding your own card is easy but finding someone else\u2019s card from maybe one or potentially two events, you can then identify cards for people you travelled once with for a night out or for work and identify their travel patterns for a three-year period,\u201d Culnane said. The researchers then went a step further to identify a politician. The data set included data on the card type \u2013 including concession cards for police and politicians. There are far fewer politician cards than other cards, meaning it would have been easier to identify politicians. There are 424 state parliamentarian travel passes but very few of those passes go to outer metro areas. Using his tweets, with his permission, the researchers were able to identify Victorian MP Anthony Carbines due to his travel from Rosanna train station, near his electorate office. The Department of Premier and Cabinet contacted the AFP and Victoria police about this, but said the risk for police and politicians was minimal. Culnane said it would be fairly easy for anyone to find their own data, but said the risk was mitigated because people can only check their previous six months of travel on the myki website, meaning there isn\u2019t any crossover in data with the data published by the department last year.

Failure to comply with the notice is a $99,132 fine for individuals and $495,660 for organisations. Culnane said there needed to be an open discussion around governments releasing supposedly de-identified data as part of its open government push. \u201cThere\u2019s been enough evidence now that the de-identification of this kind of transactional information just doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just far too unique about how we behave. \u201c[Open data] was supposed to be about government, so we were going to increase transparency about government operations, but a lot of what is being released is data about the people and population. \u201cWe are adding transparency to the people but not to the government.\u201d",

The minister for family and community services, Gareth Ward, has been sought for comment. In parliament in June, Ward said: \u201cI am advised that Facs uses alternative care arrangements as a last resort, and only in emergency situations. \u201cThere are currently significant efforts underway to reduce the amount of children and young people in alternative care arrangements and to increase permanency for all children and young people within NSW. \u201cI am advised that Facs closely monitors the use of alternative care placements, and significant work has and will continue to be implemented to reduce the need for them.\u201d Nationally, the rate of Aboriginal children being removed from their families is expected to triple by 2037, which First Nations families advocates say shows the child protection system is in crisis and is \u201cmanifestly failing young Indigenous people\u201d. \u201cThis rate of forced removals of Aboriginal children is causing ongoing damage to Aboriginal communities,\u201d Shoebridge said.",

Lichen found on footpaths can also be tainted by inner-city pollutants such as dog urine and excrement, car exhaust, arsenic, mercury and lead. The lichen in question is a species that only grows in New Zealand and the Pacific, most often in urban areas, and there are hundreds of products selling it in pill and powder form on the Chinese online marketplace Alibaba, retailing for anywhere between US$12-300 per kilogram. Knight said most of the products available online were made up of 80% Viagra and 20% grass clippings. To her knowledge no rigorous testing had been done of the \u201csexy pavement\u201d lichen to prove its efficacy or safety for human consumption. Knight\u2019s tongue-in-cheek name for the species has been adopted by website inaturalist, a popular global scientific initiative by the California Academy of Sciences and the National Geographic Society which describes itself as a place to \u201cidentify the plants and animals\u201d. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t ever really been tested, and it is somewhat toxic, so it is not advisable to consume it. But it is a precursor to Viagra, however large quantities could indeed be very harmful\u201d Knight told the Guardian. New Zealand botanist Dr Peter de Lange also derided the therapeutic qualities of the fungus, telling the Newsroom website that its effect on sexual function could be opposite of what was hoped for. But Knight said lichen could have huge health benefits. \u201cIt [Xanthoparmelia scabrosa] doesn\u2019t occur all over the world, it doesn\u2019t even occur in China where all these vast quantities are coming from. But lichen does have huge potential, and there is a lot of research underway to see how they can be used for the next generation of antibiotics to replace the ones we are becoming resistant too.\u201d There are at least 20,000 varieties of lichen known worldwide, 2,000 of which grow in New Zealand, especially on shady footpaths, the trunks of fruit trees and in native forests. Like much of New Zealand\u2019s unique biota, some varieties and species of lichen are now endangered or under threat. \u201cIt is nice to focus people\u2019s attention on lichens, I always say they are hidden in full view,\u201d said Knight. \u201cThey tend to be understudied and underreported. They\u2019re under-recognised, and they\u2019re very important because they are the colonisers \u2013 they are the first things that will colonise bare rock. When life came out of the ocean \u2026 there was lichen.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Kim Jung-im was three years old when her father, Kim Dong-won, was conscripted into the Japanese imperial army in 1940. He died, aged 23, in the jungles of New Guinea in 1943, two years before Japan\u2019s wartime defeat and the Korean peninsula\u2019s liberation from more than three decades of colonial rule by Tokyo. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know whether he was alive or dead, even after Korea was liberated,\u201d Kim told the Guardian during her recent visit to Tokyo along with other elderly relatives of South Korean conscripts desperate to learn the fates \u2013 and in some cases the final resting places \u2013 of \u201cforgotten\u201d soldiers who fought on distant battlefields more than seven decades ago. But as Japan and South Korea marked the 74th anniversary of the end of the war on Thursday, the families\u2019 prospects for a breakthrough appeared gloomier than ever amid an escalating bilateral dispute stemming from the legacy of their bitter wartime history. Campaigners in Japan and South Korea suspect the records of thousands of Korean men forced to fight in the name of Japan\u2019s wartime emperor, Hirohito, have gone missing. As the Korean peninsula\u2019s colonial power, Japan conscripted almost 244,000 Koreans, according to Japan\u2019s health ministry, including 110,000 drafted from early 1945 whose records appear to have vanished. An estimated 22,000 conscripts died in battle, their souls enshrined alongside those of Japanese soldiers at Yasukuni, a controversial war shrine in Tokyo. The absence of any documentary evidence of the fates of thousands of conscripts has left gaping holes in the families\u2019 histories, while some claim their own government has been reluctant to help. Many say they have struggled to win compensation because they have no evidence that their relatives ever served in the Japanese military, or that the money they have received is insufficient. The push to find out the fate of relatives comes amid an ongoing feud between Seoul and Tokyo about South Korean court rulings last year that ordered Japanese companies which used forced wartime labour to compensate survivors and the families of those who have died \u2013 a move that sparked outrage in Japan. The dispute has hit trade, triggered boycotts of Japanese goods in South Korea and prompted some restaurants and businesses to ban Japanese visitors. Japan\u2019s foreign ministry urged travellers to South Korea to \u201cexercise caution\u201d over their safety ahead of Thursday\u2019s war anniversary. Tokyo has insisted that the rulings broke a 1965 treaty normalising bilateral ties and an accompanying agreement that settled compensation claims \u201ccompletely and finally\u201d. \u2018Their records have disappeared\u2019 Kim, who was six when her father died, has no recollection of the man who fell in New Guinea, one of the longest, and for the Japanese, costliest campaigns of the Pacific war. But she knows more about her father\u2019s fate than many South Korean families whose members fought for Japan. \u201cWhat is certain is that towards the end of the war, Japan ruthlessly conscripted a large number of Koreans,\u201d said Choi Sang-yong, who heads an association of families seeking information about relatives who were conscripted by Japan. \u201cWe believe that tens of thousands \u2013 possible many more \u2013 were conscripted after January 1945 but and that their records have disappeared,\u201d said Choi, whose great uncle served in the Japanese navy. \u201cThis issue has never been properly dealt with, so a lot of people in Japan and South Korea don\u2019t even know there is a problem.\u201d An official at the Japanese health ministry said identifying conscripts had been complicated by the colonial era policy of forcing Korean conscripts to take Japanese names, which bereaved families may never have known.

      "bodyText": "The head of the Australian War Memorial, Brendan Nelson, will leave the role at the end of this year. The government has announced that Nelson, who has directed the institution for seven years, will not stay on beyond his current term. The veterans affairs minister, Darren Chester, said a national search would now begin to find his replacement. Chester praised Nelson, a former Liberal defence minister, for his \u201cpassion and outstanding contribution\u201d. \u201cBrendan has provided leadership to the Memorial that has made it world-renowned, including managing its extensive upgrades and overseeing the Centenary of Anzac program,\u201d Chester said. \u201cUnder his guidance, the Memorial has also led a range of exhibitions, displays, memorials and documentaries of our first world war, Korean and Vietnam conflicts, and more recently, the commemorations of the centenary of the first world war, including the poignant display of 62,000 knitted Poppies.\u201d Nelson has courted controversy during his time at the AWM, chiefly over the memorial\u2019s vast $500m expansion and his acceptance of donations from weapons companies. Critics said the $500m would be better spent on helping veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, and the acceptance of arms money was \u201ccontemptible\u201d. Arms manufacturers were afforded naming rights over parts of the memorial complex, such as the BAE Systems Theatre, named after a British arms multinational. Nelson has been a staunch defender of the acceptance of arms company\u2019s money. He said the companies had a duty to explain \u201cwhat is being done in the name of our country\u201d. Guardian Australia revealed this year that Nelson was also accepting a personal fee from an arms manufacturer, Thales, while acting on its advisory board. Nelson said he had not kept the personal fee from Thales. The money had been passed on to the memorial as a donation, he said. AWM directors are legally barred from taking outside employment unless they have the express permission of the government of the day. Documents obtained by the Guardian also showed previous ministers gave him such permission, while warning him against putting himself into a conflicted position. The then veterans affairs minister, Michael Ronaldson, said he was comfortable that \u201cthere does not appear to be a conflict\u201d but said: \u201cWhere the two roles could potentially be in conflict, I ask that you take the necessary steps to avoid these circumstances.\u201d Thales has had frequent interactions with the AWM. It has provided general sponsorship support and backs individual exhibitions, such as the artist Ben Quilty\u2019s After Afghanistan exhibit. It has also partnered with the AWM on the Napier Waller art prize. One former former AWM director, Brendon Kelson, previously criticised the arrangement, saying he believed there was a conflict of interest, regardless of whether Nelson donated his fee. \u201cThere\u2019s a conflict of interest, in my view,\u201d Kelson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a national cultural institution, he\u2019s sitting on the board of a donor to the institution. All of that \u2013 it just looks messy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "People in Japan hoping to predict the next big earthquake should ignore mysterious deep-sea fish after experts said rare sightings of the creatures on the country\u2019s beaches did not, as some had believed, foretell a seismic calamity. University researchers said they had debunked the theory of oarfish as a harbinger of doom by comparing sightings of deep-sea fish, including those caught in fishermen\u2019s nets, with earthquake records going back more than 90 years. \u201cWe thought that if we could understand the connection, it would be useful for disaster prevention,\u201d Yoshiaki Orihara of Tokai University\u2019s Institute of Oceanic Research and Development said. The experts, however, found no correlation between the sightings and major earthquakes. They uncovered 363 reported sightings since 1928 of oarfish and seven other species of deep-sea fish that have long been associated with earthquakes, while there were 221 earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater over the same period. But the team, whose findings were published in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, discovered that just one of those quakes \u2013 in July 2007 \u2013 had occurred within 30 days of a fish sighting and within a 100km radius. \u201cIt was disappointing to find no correlation, but we also want to investigate any connection between mass beachings of dolphins and whales with earthquakes in the future,\u201d Orihara told Kyodo. The oarfish theory\u2019s roots lie in Shokoku Rijin Dana, a collection of mystery stories published in the 18th century that makes a connection between deep-sea fish and seismic activity. Some experts have speculated that the creatures move to shallower waters when they sense electromagnetic changes caused by tectonic movement related to active faults, fuelling the popular belief that beached oarfish are an omen. Several sightings of oarfish, whose dorsal fin runs the entire length of its body, on beaches or in stationary nets sparked fear of impending disaster earlier this year. While Japan\u2019s early-warning system typically gives people several seconds to take cover before the arrival of a major earthquake, there is no proven method of predicting when tectonic plates will shift. Some experts believe there is a 70% to 80% chance that a large area of Japan\u2019s Pacific coast will experience a catastrophic earthquake within the next 30 years, with worst-case scenarios putting the death toll at more than 230,000 \u2013 more than ten times the number of deaths in the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in the country\u2019s north-east.",
