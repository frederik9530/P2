      "body": "<p>The FBI has identified prominent conspiracy theories, including the sprawling rightwing hoax known as QAnon, as motivators for \u201cdomestic extremists\u201d to carry out violence in the US.</p> <p>The warning comes from an agency bulletin produced by the FBI\u2019s Phoenix field office, first reported by <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/fbi-documents-conspiracy-theories-terrorism-160000507.html\">Yahoo News</a>. It states that \u201canti-government, identity based, and fringe political conspiracy theories very likely motivate some domestic extremists, wholly or in part, to engage in criminal or violent activity\u201d.</p> <p>The bulletin warns that \u201ccertain conspiracy theory narratives tacitly support or legitimize violent action\u201d, and that \u201csome, but not all individuals or domestic extremists who hold such beliefs will act on them\u201d.</p> <p>It further warns that conspiracy theories will continue to spread and incite violence unless social media companies make \u201csignificant efforts\u201d to \u201cremove, regulate, or counter potentially harmful conspiratorial content\u201d.</p> <p>Examples given in the report include the October 2018 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/27/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting\">Tree of Life synagogue massacre</a>, which the FBI describes as being motivated by the \u201cZionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory\u201d; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/22/pizzagate-conspiracy-theorist-prison-sentence-washington\">\u201cPizzagate\u201d-inspired attack</a> on Washington\u2019s Comet Ping Pong restaurant in December 2016; and an incident in June 2018, when a believer in the \u201cQAnon\u201d conspiracy theory blocked traffic at Hoover Dam in Nevada with an armored truck.</p> <p>In the latter case, the bulletin says that the man \u201csent letters from jail containing a distinctive QAnon slogan to President Trump\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/30/qanon-4chan-rightwing-conspiracy-theory-explained-trump\">What is QAnon? Explaining the bizarre rightwing conspiracy theory</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Elsewhere the report discusses <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/arizona-veterans-group-finds-homeless-camp-fuels-new-pizzagate-style-n880956\">false 2018 claims</a> by a border militia, Veterans on Patrol, that they had discovered a child sex trafficking camp near Tucson, Arizona, and the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/02/sandy-hook-school-hoax-massacre-conspiracists-victim-father\"> following which</a> \u201cconspiracy theorists who believed the shooting was a government hoax harassed and threatened family members of the slain victims\u201d.</p> <p>Currently, several families of Sandy Hook victims <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/17/claim-alex-jones-child-sex-abuse-images-sandy-hook-victims\">are suing</a> the conspiracy-minded broadcaster Alex Jones for what they say is his role in promoting \u201cfalse flag\u201d narratives \u2013 baseless claims that the shooting was covert operation aimed at deceiving and disarming Americans.</p> <p>The bulletin accords social media a central role in promoting conspiracy theories to a wider audience. It states: \u201cThe advent of the Internet and social media has enabled promoters of conspiracy theories to produce and share greater volumes of material via online platforms that larger audiences of consumers can quickly and easily access.\u201d</p> <p>As a result, the bulletin says, \u201cit is logical to assume that more extremist-minded individuals will be exposed to potentially harmful conspiracy theories, accept ones that are favorable to their views, and possibly carry out criminal or violent actions\u201d.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/30/qanon-4chan-rightwing-conspiracy-theory-explained-trump\">QAnon conspiracy theory</a>, which has emerged in the Trump era, is based on posts by an anonymous user on the 4chan and 8chan websites that believers attempt to decipher. While the QAnon narrative is sprawling and incoherent, many believers hold that Donald Trump is leading a behind-the-scenes fight against elements of the \u201cdeep state\u201d, including figures such as Hillary Clinton and the former FBI director James Comey.</p> <p>Recently, Trump has acted in ways that have encouraged believers to think that he is sympathetic to their cause. At a Greenville rally on 17 July, Trump <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/q-baby-qanon-trump-rally/\">singled out</a> a \u201cbeautiful baby\u201d whose jumpsuit was adorned with the \u201cQ\u201d symbol. And earlier this week, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/30/20747876/twitter-suspends-conspiracy-account-donald-trump-president-retweet\">retweeted</a> an account that promoted QAnon.</p> <p>FBI critics, though, worry that the bulletin exhibits the same excesses as previous reports identifying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/06/fbi-black-identity-extremists-racial-profiling\">threats</a> from so-called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/06/fbi-black-identity-extremists-racial-profiling\">black identity extremists</a>\u201d and other groups.</p> <p>Michael German is a former FBI officer and a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice. He called the bulletin \u201ctroubling\u201d, saying that \u201cit continues to promote the concept of radicalization \u2013 that it\u2019s bad ideas that put people on the path to violence\u201d.</p> <p>From the perspective of law enforcement officers, German said, \u201call it does is ramp up the fear of people whose ideas are strange\u201d.</p> <p>He also said the logic of the bulletin promoted a baseless fear of the internet and further justified mass surveillance: \u201cIf the spread of ideas is the problem, then preventing the spread of ideas is the solution.</p> <p>\u201cAre there conspiracy theorists who commit violence? Yes. But you\u2019re talking about a small amount of cases alongside millions of people who believe in conspiracy theories,\u201d German added, saying that such reports \u201cseem to have the function of getting the FBI over the one hurdle the Justice Department has imposed\u201d in protecting first amendment activity.</p> <p>The FBI bulletin concludes with the bleak prediction that \u201cconspiracy theories very likely will emerge, spread, and evolve in the modern information marketplace over the near term, fostering anti-government sentiment, promoting racial and religious prejudice, increasing political tensions, and occasionally driving both groups and individuals to commit criminal or violent acts\u201d.</p> <p>It does hold out hope that \u201csignificant efforts by major social media companies and websites to remove, regulate, or counter potentially harmful conspiratorial content\u201d might change this assessment.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The FBI has identified prominent conspiracy theories, including the sprawling rightwing hoax known as QAnon, as motivators for \u201cdomestic extremists\u201d to carry out violence in the US. The warning comes from an agency bulletin produced by the FBI\u2019s Phoenix field office, first reported by Yahoo News. It states that \u201canti-government, identity based, and fringe political conspiracy theories very likely motivate some domestic extremists, wholly or in part, to engage in criminal or violent activity\u201d. The bulletin warns that \u201ccertain conspiracy theory narratives tacitly support or legitimize violent action\u201d, and that \u201csome, but not all individuals or domestic extremists who hold such beliefs will act on them\u201d. It further warns that conspiracy theories will continue to spread and incite violence unless social media companies make \u201csignificant efforts\u201d to \u201cremove, regulate, or counter potentially harmful conspiratorial content\u201d. Examples given in the report include the October 2018 Tree of Life synagogue massacre, which the FBI describes as being motivated by the \u201cZionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory\u201d; the \u201cPizzagate\u201d-inspired attack on Washington\u2019s Comet Ping Pong restaurant in December 2016; and an incident in June 2018, when a believer in the \u201cQAnon\u201d conspiracy theory blocked traffic at Hoover Dam in Nevada with an armored truck. In the latter case, the bulletin says that the man \u201csent letters from jail containing a distinctive QAnon slogan to President Trump\u201d. Elsewhere the report discusses false 2018 claims by a border militia, Veterans on Patrol, that they had discovered a child sex trafficking camp near Tucson, Arizona, and the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut, following which \u201cconspiracy theorists who believed the shooting was a government hoax harassed and threatened family members of the slain victims\u201d. Currently, several families of Sandy Hook victims are suing the conspiracy-minded broadcaster Alex Jones for what they say is his role in promoting \u201cfalse flag\u201d narratives \u2013 baseless claims that the shooting was covert operation aimed at deceiving and disarming Americans. The bulletin accords social media a central role in promoting conspiracy theories to a wider audience. It states: \u201cThe advent of the Internet and social media has enabled promoters of conspiracy theories to produce and share greater volumes of material via online platforms that larger audiences of consumers can quickly and easily access.\u201d As a result, the bulletin says, \u201cit is logical to assume that more extremist-minded individuals will be exposed to potentially harmful conspiracy theories, accept ones that are favorable to their views, and possibly carry out criminal or violent actions\u201d. The QAnon conspiracy theory, which has emerged in the Trump era, is based on posts by an anonymous user on the 4chan and 8chan websites that believers attempt to decipher. While the QAnon narrative is sprawling and incoherent, many believers hold that Donald Trump is leading a behind-the-scenes fight against elements of the \u201cdeep state\u201d, including figures such as Hillary Clinton and the former FBI director James Comey. Recently, Trump has acted in ways that have encouraged believers to think that he is sympathetic to their cause. At a Greenville rally on 17 July, Trump singled out a \u201cbeautiful baby\u201d whose jumpsuit was adorned with the \u201cQ\u201d symbol. And earlier this week, Trump retweeted an account that promoted QAnon. FBI critics, though, worry that the bulletin exhibits the same excesses as previous reports identifying threats from so-called \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d and other groups. Michael German is a former FBI officer and a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice. He called the bulletin \u201ctroubling\u201d, saying that \u201cit continues to promote the concept of radicalization \u2013 that it\u2019s bad ideas that put people on the path to violence\u201d. From the perspective of law enforcement officers, German said, \u201call it does is ramp up the fear of people whose ideas are strange\u201d. He also said the logic of the bulletin promoted a baseless fear of the internet and further justified mass surveillance: \u201cIf the spread of ideas is the problem, then preventing the spread of ideas is the solution. \u201cAre there conspiracy theorists who commit violence? Yes. But you\u2019re talking about a small amount of cases alongside millions of people who believe in conspiracy theories,\u201d German added, saying that such reports \u201cseem to have the function of getting the FBI over the one hurdle the Justice Department has imposed\u201d in protecting first amendment activity. The FBI bulletin concludes with the bleak prediction that \u201cconspiracy theories very likely will emerge, spread, and evolve in the modern information marketplace over the near term, fostering anti-government sentiment, promoting racial and religious prejudice, increasing political tensions, and occasionally driving both groups and individuals to commit criminal or violent acts\u201d. It does hold out hope that \u201csignificant efforts by major social media companies and websites to remove, regulate, or counter potentially harmful conspiratorial content\u201d might change this assessment.",

      "bodyText": "US election jurisdictions with histories of egregious voter discrimination have been purging voter rolls at a rate 40% beyond the national average, according to a watchdog report released on Thursday. At least 17 million voters were purged nationwide between 2016 and 2018, according to a study by the Brennan Center for Justice. The number was basically unchanged from the previous two-year period. While the rate of voter purges elsewhere has declined slowly, jurisdictions released from federal oversight by a watershed 2013 supreme court ruling had purge rates \u201csignificantly higher\u201d than jurisdictions not previously subjected to oversight, the Brennan Center found in a previous report. That trend has continued, the watchdog said, with the disproportionate purging of voters resulting in an estimated 1.1 million fewer voters between 2016 and 2018. Voter purges accelerated in the United States with the 2013 Shelby County v Holder ruling, which released counties with histories of voter discrimination from federal oversight imposed by the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The Voting Rights Act barred jurisdictions with \u201cevidence of actual voting discrimination\u201d \u2013 for example, registration tests and a voter rate at least 12% below the national average \u2013 from changing their voting procedures without \u201cpre-clearance\u201d from federal authorities. In Shelby county, the supreme court declared that \u201cnearly 50 years later, things have changed dramatically\u201d and released the so-called section 5 jurisdictions from oversight. Chief justice John Roberts wrote that \u201cthe tests and devices that blocked ballot access have been forbidden nationwide for over 40 years\u201d. But the ruling was criticized for apparent blindness to contemporary voter suppression practices including strict voter identification laws, partisan gerrymandering and aggressive voter purges. A federal court for North Dakota on Wednesday upheld a law requiring voters to have a residential street address, rejecting a complaint by a Native American group that the law amounted to voter suppression, because many of its members had no such address. A dissenting judge said the law had a \u201cdevastating effect\u201d on Native American voters. The Columbia University professor Katherine Franke tweeted that the ruling was a \u201chuge setback for Native American voting rights\u201d. Voter roll purges are regularly undertaken to account for voters who move or die. But critics say that aggressive and unfair purges of voter rolls in recent years \u2013 such as a purge of 107,000 voters in Georgia in 2017 by the then secretary of state, Brian Kemp, who was subsequently elected governor by the electorate he had culled \u2013 have warped democracy. \u201cAs the country prepares for the 2020 election, election administrators should take steps to ensure that every eligible American can cast a ballot next November,\u201d the Brennan Center said in a statement. \u201cElection day is often too late to discover that a person has been wrongfully purged.\u201d",

Bolt used his significant platform to take aim at the 16-year-old campaigner, dismissing her followers as members of a cult and disparaging her decision to sail across the Atlantic to attend UN climate summits.

Axiomatic organised last year\u2019s Australian tour by Southern, a Canadian who was barred from entering the UK for \u201calt-right\u201d provocations. Axiomatic had arranged for Southern to meet up with Christensen on 16 July, taking a fishing charter out to the reef. But Southern did not turn up. The Morrison government\u2019s main climate change policy, the emissions reduction fund, has been labelled \u201ca joke\u201d after its latest auction bought cuts equivalent to only 0.01% of Australia\u2019s annual greenhouse gas pollution.

      "body": "<p>When it comes to documentaries about factories, British viewers have an impressive amount of choice. If Gregg Wallace in a hairnet shouting about biscuits isn\u2019t enough to put you off Inside the Factory, for example, you can see just how mass-produced food ends up in our shopping baskets. Watching factories at work can be mesmerising in terms of showing off their technical wizardry, like a giant game of Mouse Trap, or in the strangely comforting repetition of it all, like a fidget spinner, if your memory stretches back to those halcyon days of 2017. You might think Britain\u2019s Giant Pet Food Factory (Channel 4), then, is a steady bet for an hour of solid entertainment. It takes the odd appeal of factory TV and combines it with animals \u2013 which, as our dog-packed schedules suggest, we also love to watch. But it drains all the joy out of both, and ends up as an ad-friendly slog that lacks any substance. Ironically, it is crying out for a bit of meat on its bones.</p> <p>Mars, better known for its chocolate, actually makes more pet food than confectionery. It produces two popular brands of cat and dog food, which are mentioned copiously, so no need for an extra plug here. It has a big factory in Melton Mowbray and a research centre nearby in Waltham, where animals live and have their bowel movements studied for science. In one scene, which is meant to be funny, cats sit around a laptop indoors watching a video of squirrels \u201cto teach them about the world\u201d. \u201cAll this science goes towards the business of selling pet food,\u201d says the narrator, Robert Webb. Everyone is doing their bit for the business of selling pet food.</p> <p>We glimpse how pet food is made: lorries drop off gargantuan slabs of frozen meat \u2013 once seen, hard to forget \u2013 which are then chopped, pounded and mixed into a sort of flesh puree. \u201cIt\u2019s like blending a meat smoothie,\u201d Joe, a manager at the factory, says happily. This is squeezed out into thin strips \u2013 \u201cbasically, we\u2019re running ropes of meat\u201d \u2013 then cooked and cut into chunks, to make more than a million pouches a day.</p> <p>Joe is in charge of making sure a new line of cat food for older cats launches without a hitch. In terms of a storyline, that is essentially all they have to make this hour sing, and, barring a few production hiccups, it is not enough for it to be interesting. You can almost hear the producers crossing their fingers that something huge goes wrong, but a pipe clogs, and is unclogged. There is a side attempt to train a wayward office dog, too, but it\u2019s all just sort of fine.</p> <p>There is a brief visit to Germany, where new cat food has been developed by an earnest man called Rutger.

      "bodyText": "When it comes to documentaries about factories, British viewers have an impressive amount of choice. If Gregg Wallace in a hairnet shouting about biscuits isn\u2019t enough to put you off Inside the Factory, for example, you can see just how mass-produced food ends up in our shopping baskets. Watching factories at work can be mesmerising in terms of showing off their technical wizardry, like a giant game of Mouse Trap, or in the strangely comforting repetition of it all, like a fidget spinner, if your memory stretches back to those halcyon days of 2017. You might think Britain\u2019s Giant Pet Food Factory (Channel 4), then, is a steady bet for an hour of solid entertainment. It takes the odd appeal of factory TV and combines it with animals \u2013 which, as our dog-packed schedules suggest, we also love to watch. But it drains all the joy out of both, and ends up as an ad-friendly slog that lacks any substance. Ironically, it is crying out for a bit of meat on its bones. Mars, better known for its chocolate, actually makes more pet food than confectionery. It produces two popular brands of cat and dog food, which are mentioned copiously, so no need for an extra plug here. It has a big factory in Melton Mowbray and a research centre nearby in Waltham, where animals live and have their bowel movements studied for science. In one scene, which is meant to be funny, cats sit around a laptop indoors watching a video of squirrels \u201cto teach them about the world\u201d. \u201cAll this science goes towards the business of selling pet food,\u201d says the narrator, Robert Webb. Everyone is doing their bit for the business of selling pet food. We glimpse how pet food is made: lorries drop off gargantuan slabs of frozen meat \u2013 once seen, hard to forget \u2013 which are then chopped, pounded and mixed into a sort of flesh puree. \u201cIt\u2019s like blending a meat smoothie,\u201d Joe, a manager at the factory, says happily. This is squeezed out into thin strips \u2013 \u201cbasically, we\u2019re running ropes of meat\u201d \u2013 then cooked and cut into chunks, to make more than a million pouches a day. Joe is in charge of making sure a new line of cat food for older cats launches without a hitch. In terms of a storyline, that is essentially all they have to make this hour sing, and, barring a few production hiccups, it is not enough for it to be interesting. You can almost hear the producers crossing their fingers that something huge goes wrong, but a pipe clogs, and is unclogged. There is a side attempt to train a wayward office dog, too, but it\u2019s all just sort of fine. There is a brief visit to Germany, where new cat food has been developed by an earnest man called Rutger. Rutger tips a giant stuffed animal cushion upside down, to shape its face, and given that English is not his first language, struggles to explain what he\u2019s doing. \u201cI\u2019m giving ... him ... head,\u201d he says. I\u2019m sorry to say I laughed. But then he becomes the butt of every voiceover joke, some of which make the Come Dine With Me quips seem kindly. Rutger says sweetly that he always wanted to be on Ready Steady Cook. \u201cI\u2019m afraid they stopped making that 10 years ago,\u201d runs the narration. Excuse this brief attack of snowflakery, but the gags were surprisingly and needlessly acidic. Everyone here seems good-natured and well-intentioned, but by the end, even Joe was getting it.

      "bodyText": "Japan racing\u2019s 19-year wait for its second Group One winner in Britain finally came to an end here on Thursday as Deirdre, a five-year-old mare trained by Mitsuru Hashida, brought Frankie Dettori\u2019s golden run to at least a temporary halt with a one-and-a-quarter length defeat of the Italian rider\u2019s mount, Mehdaayih, in the Nassau Stakes. Hermosa, the winner of the 1,000 Guineas in May, finished tailed off at the back of the nine-runner field. Dettori came into the race attempting to win four consecutive Group One events in Britain for the first time in his career and for much of the race it seemed that his streak would continue. Mehdaayih set a strong pace from the off with Hermosa in close pursuit and when Ryan Moore\u2019s partner started to drop away rapidly shortly after the turn for home, Mehdaayih\u2019s path to victory seemed clear. Deirdre, though, had been quietly stalking the pace under Oisin Murphy, who was booked to ride the 20-1 chance after raising his profile in Japan with several valuable wins during a three-month spell there last winter. When Murphy unleashed her against the far rail, she stayed on strongly to secure her first victory outside Japan, and only the second for a Japanese runner in a British Group One after Agnes World\u2019s win in the July Cup at Newmarket in 2000. \u201cIt was a glorious day and everything just fell right for her,\u201d Seiko Hashida Yoshimura, the trainer\u2019s daughter, said afterwards. \u201cGoodwood is very different to Japanese racecourses, which are usually oval-shaped [but] we were sure that she would like this track and it worked out very well. The quicker ground [than at Ascot] was another important factor for her today and it is very special to win a Group One event in Britain. \u201cA lot of credit has to go to Oisin Murphy. We did not give him any instructions and just decided to let him ride the horse in the way he felt right.\u201d Murphy, who has recently regained the lead in the race for the Flat jockeys\u2019 championship from Danny Tudhope, will hope to cement his ties with Japan further when he returns there in November. \u201cI\u2019m so glad the Japanese have brought a horse here and she has performed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been telling people since I came back from Japan of the regard they hold their horses in and it\u2019s fantastic they have won a Group One race here. \u201cThere was no pressure on me and so I rode her as I felt from instinct [and] it paid off. I kept looking at her price, but thinking she had a wonderful chance and to go and win against a decent field was something else. \u201cLast year was the first time I\u2019d qualified to go to Japan and I was lucky to have really good connections when I got there. I worked really hard and it\u2019s paid off and a day like this makes it all worthwhile. Until you go to Japan it\u2019s hard to understand their love of horse racing but it\u2019s on a different level. The plan is to go to the Japan Cup in November and hopefully stay there for about three months.\u201d Threat was heavily backed to give Richard Hannon a third win in six years in the Group Two Richmond Stakes, but he came up short behind Clive Cox\u2019s Golden Horde, a 15-2 chance. The winner is a son of Lethal Force, who took two Group One sprints for Cox in 2013, and could well be the first of his offspring to score at Group One level. \u201cHe\u2019s a joy to have and improving all the time,\u201d the trainer said. \u201cHe\u2019s in the Gimcrack and the [Group One] Morny and we\u2019ll see what he\u2019s telling us.\u201d",

Joe Root\u2019s side will resume on 10 for no loss on the second morning at Edgbaston after Smith\u2019s 144 from 219 balls, in his first Test since his 12-month ball-tampering ban, helped Australia reach 284 all out in 80.4 overs. Stuart Broad stood out for England with the ball, claiming five for 86 from 22.4 overs. Australia\u2019s total might have been considered a triumph for England after losing Anderson only four overs into his day\u2019s work, with the 37-year-old pulling up lame and now awaiting scan results on the same right calf muscle that was torn last month.

      "bodyText": "Everyone in the UK and Ireland should be afraid of a no-deal Brexit, the Irish taoiseach said, after he was accused of engaging in \u201cProject Fear mark two\u201d. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, was responding to criticism from Arlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist party (DUP), who in turn had been reacting to his comments last week suggesting that the UK crashing out of the EU could increase the chance of Ireland being reunited. Varadkar said: \u201cIn terms of fear, I think we should be afraid of a no-deal Brexit \u2026 [it] would have very serious impacts on the economy, north and south, and on Britain. It could have security implications as well and it could have constitutional implications. It\u2019s something that we have to prepare for nonetheless. It is something we should be afraid about.\u201d His comments came as the British chancellor, Sajid Javid, ordered HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to prioritise no-deal planning ahead of the planned exit date from the EU of 31 October. Javid wrote on Thursday to the outgoing HMRC chief executive, Sir Jonathan Thompson, demanding action to \u201cdeliver a functioning regime\u201d on the day the UK left the EU. In an indication of tensions about HMRC\u2019s attitude towards hard Brexit plans, Treasury sources said Javid\u2019s letter was an instruction to \u201cWhitehall\u2019s unruliest department\u201d to prepare for a no deal. \u201cHMRC must make no-deal preparation their absolute top priority as the UK prepares to exit the European Union on 31 October 2019, with or without a deal,\u201d the chancellor wrote. Varadkar has been outspoken about the risks he sees as inherent to such plans, leading the DUP, which supports a hard Brexit, to accuse him of not engaging helpfully. Foster accused Varadkar of behaving \u201ccrassly\u201d towards victims of the Northern Ireland conflict in the past after he said moderate unionists and nationalists could question being part of the UK if they were forced into a hard Brexit. Speaking in Kilkenny on Thursday, Varadkar replied: \u201cIn terms of engagement, I have never refused a meeting request from the DUP and never refused a phone call from Arlene either, and she has my number.\u201d He added that he had spoken to the new UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, and had invited him to Dublin to hold further discussions \u201cwithout any precondition\u201d. Johnson this week held a private dinner with senior DUP figures as he visited Northern Ireland for the first time since moving into No 10 Downing Street. Varadkar, asked whether he was worried about Johnson\u2019s ability to be impartial on Northern Ireland, said: \u201cI think that remains to be seen. He\u2019s only just started in the job and I think we need to give him a fair wind and a decent chance.\u201d He added: \u201cThe Good Friday agreement is very explicit that the sovereign government, the UK government, must be rigorously impartial in how it administers Northern Ireland, and we all need to respect the fact that the aspirations about unionist people and nationalist people are equal.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "On a slightly showery first day of Ashes cricket, in between marshalling the humming hover cover and painting the crease lines, the local lads roped in to bolster the Edgbaston groundstaff were able to watch one of their own step up for England. Back in 2005, when Michael Vaughan\u2019s side were blazing their way back into that summer\u2019s epic series, a young Chris Woakes was among the additional cover-wallahs at the ground, doubtless performing his duties in much the same dependable way he plays his cricket these days. Previously in their shoes, here Woakes was part of a depleted attack charged with filling the more sizeable ones of Jimmy Anderson. The 37-year-old had sent down four overs in the morning, before being bussed off to hospital at lunch for scans on a re-injured calf muscle. With Australia having recovered to 83 for three, a sense of creeping English dread was looming. And so while Steve Smith\u2019s marvellous lone hand century made it Australia\u2019s day \u2013 ensuring Tim Paine\u2019s decision at the toss was not as duff as his Winston Churchill reference 24 hours earlier \u2013 that England remain in the contest owes much to the work of Woakes and Stuart Broad in the early afternoon. The centrality of Edgbaston draws punters from all parts but there is little doubt about the county loyalty of the crowd. This was reflected during the interval when Ian Bell received arguably the loudest cheers of all as six members of the victorious 2005 side were paraded on the outfield. But the Brummie bellow had gone up a notch further by 2.18pm when another of their own, Woakes, added to his earlier dismissal of Usman Khawaja \u2013 caught behind on review to a ball that seamed away \u2013 by removing the well-set Travis Head on 35 and Matthew Wade for one in the space of nine balls. In the case of Head, who had put on 64 precious runs with Smith, it was the ideal right-armer\u2019s set up from over the wicket, firing three across the left-hander\u2019s bows before getting a fourth to nip back in and smash the pads in front. For Wade, the one-time loudmouth wicketkeeper playing his first Test back as a specialist batsman after barging his way in by weight of runs, it was a similar delivery, albeit one that beat a more whippy and ill-judged shot, with Woakes rightly talking Joe Root into a review on a day to forget for the umpires. It is fair to say this burst, soon followed up by a double from the resurgent Broad, represented Woakes\u2019s best moment in Ashes cricket to date. His five previous appearances had consisted of his debut in 2013 at the Oval \u2013 a respectable outing that got unfairly lumped in with Simon Kerrigan\u2019s more harrowing experience \u2013 and four Tests schlepping around Australia. Bar a four-wicket spell with the pink ball under lights in Adelaide, that 2017-18 tour was a chastening one that, for many, highlighted some limitations overseas. But for England, probably now deprived of Anderson and still hoping Jofra Archer can get Test-ready with Sussex 2nds next week, the home-soil reliability of Woakes is a source of comfort. So too is a new-found hardiness that saw Woakes send down 21 overs for his three for 58. It may not sound taxing but an angry knee meant his previous toughest day by way of workload in the past year was 12 overs against Leicestershire last September. England\u2019s World Cup prioritisation is a factor here too, of course.

Looking down on the dug-outs from the west stand, Embleton pauses. \u201cThe last time I stood in that technical area for a competitive game,\u201d he says, \u201cI was winning the league standing next to Justin Edinburgh \u2026 I walked into the stadium last Saturday, and that was the first time I had come here to prepare for a game of football since Justin had passed. A bloke shook my hand outside and said good luck for the game and I walked inside and burst into tears. That just got me, I don\u2019t know why. I know there will be things the crowd drag up to show their love and support for Justin and how that gets you at the time, you cannot prepare for that. We know the emotion is coming.\u201d",

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In a stiffening of language, papers seen by the Guardian say:</p> \n<p>\u2022 A reasonable worst-case scenario is that the supply of medicines and medical supplies \u201cwill be impacted by reduced flow rates across the Dover Straits\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u2022 While officials are not anticipating an overall shortage of food, they believe there will be disruption to the food supply chain.

The prime minister, Boris Johnson, has made Michael Gove responsible for \u201cturbo-charging\u201d Brexit planning, and on Thursday the new chancellor, Sajid Javid, announced an extra \u00a32.1bn of funding to prepare for a no-deal exit. But with less than 100 days to go before the autumn deadline, the Cabinet Office\u2019s own internal analysis includes stark assessments of the potential problems ahead. A document circulating Whitehall shows some of the government\u2019s \u201creasonable worst-case scenarios\u201d (RCWS) have changed over the summer, including those related to the supply of food and medicines. In a stiffening of language, papers seen by the Guardian say: \u2022 A reasonable worst-case scenario is that the supply of medicines and medical supplies \u201cwill be impacted by reduced flow rates across the Dover Straits\u201d. \u2022 While officials are not anticipating an overall shortage of food, they believe there will be disruption to the food supply chain.

There is also concern that food banks may struggle for funding \u2013 a record 1.6m emergency food parcels were given out by the Trussell Trust food bank network last year \u2013 more than 500,000 of them to children. Though ministers insist \u201cworst-case scenarios\u201d are not predictions, they are used by officials for planning purposes to help highlight and address problems. The money announced on Thursday includes sums to pay for stockpiling medicines, though hospital heads have previously warned this might not be enough to stave off shortages. In a further blow to government attempts to downplay the possible risks of a no-deal Brexit, Sky News reported that it had obtained an official document setting out the threats to borders, the economy, security, data, Northern Ireland and individuals in the month after crashing out. It said the slide \u2013 which covers the risks on the first day, first fortnight and first month of no deal \u2013 was prepared in the final weeks of Theresa May\u2019s government and appeared to be the first time all the worst-case scenarios had been set out in a single document.

      "bodyText": "Factory output in Britain has fallen at the fastest rate in seven years as the risks posed to the economy by a no-deal Brexit rise and as global demand falters. According to the monthly snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, UK manufacturers scaled back production because of fading demand at home and abroad. Output and new orders shrank as factories came under pressure from the high level of uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU and from the US-China trade war, which has caused a sharp slowdown in international trade. New orders fell as businesses used up materials stockpiled in the run-up to the original 29 March Brexit deadline rather than place new orders. Alongside a drop-off in global demand because of the trade war, the survey also found EU-based companies were switching to non-UK suppliers to avoid potential Brexit disruption. Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said: \u201cJuly saw the UK manufacturing sector suffocating under the choke-hold of slower global economic growth, political uncertainty and the unwinding of earlier Brexit stockpiling activity. \u201cProduction volumes fell at the fastest pace in seven years as clients delayed, cancelled or rerouted orders away from the UK.\u201d The IHS Markit/Cips manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI), closely watched by the Treasury for early warning signs from the economy, remained at 48.0 in July, the same level as recorded in June. City economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 47.7 on a scale where anything below 50.0 indicates declining economic output. Stockpiling activity earlier this year drove up UK factory output in a boon for the British economy, as companies braced for potential disruption at UK borders and ports connected to Brexit. Many companies now either have adequate stockpiles or may run down their supplies rather than placing new orders, causing a sharp decline in demand for manufacturers. The downturn in Britain arrives as factory output also slides in other countries, as the trade standoff between Washington and Beijing serves as a brake on demand. Output in the eurozone has also fallen sharply, with the steepest decline in factory activity in the single-currency bloc since 2012. However, economists warned that Brexit would provide a double whammy for British manufacturers as they suffer from a simultaneous slump in international demand and disruption from leaving the EU. Seamus Nevin, the chief economist at Make UK, the British manufacturers\u2019 lobby group, said: \u201cThis is not a good time for our economy to be preparing to go it alone. \u201cThe downturn experienced by the UK\u2019s main trading partners, and slower world economic growth, combined with foreign customers routing supply chains away from the UK in advance of Brexit has hit British business hard in recent months.\u201d The IHS Markit/Cips PMI report, which surveys 600 manufacturers about their output levels, found the downturn in the sector hit employment in July. Employment fell for the fourth month in a row, with reports of companies not replacing the staff leaving their firms, recruitment freezes and cost-control initiatives leading to job cuts. Duncan Brock of Cips, said the reduction marked one of the sharpest cuts to jobs in the sector for more than six years. \u201cBusinesses hesitated to keep calm and carry on,\u201d he said. Unite, the UK\u2019s largest union representing manufacturing workers, warned there was a growing risk of a \u201cmanufacturing meltdown\u201d and called for Boris Johnson to take no-deal Brexit off the table in response. Steve Turner, Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary for manufacturing, said: \u201cUncertainty over the jobs of thousands of skilled, well-paid manufacturing jobs hang in the balance, from Vauxhall\u2019s Ellesmere Port plant to British Steel. \u201cIt\u2019s time Boris Johnson woke up to the reality of the manufacturing emergency facing communities across the UK.\u201d",

Viv had the opposite problem I think, that in a side that were steamrolling everyone else throughout the 80s, his runs were less and less important to a strong batting side, which translated into more cameo 60s and 70s, and a lack of daddy hundreds.

The nearest loo was an Aussie stronghold too. During Australia\u2019s 2nd innings when things were getting tense, Gilchrist came to the crease as I headed to the loo, keeping in touch with the goings on through my ear-piece and transistor radio. Surrounded by 30 or 40 Aussies and struggling to hear my radio over the noise of water hitting stainless steel, excited voices in my ear- piece said Gilchrist was out!! For one run!! My excited shout of \u2018Gilly\u2019s gone!!\u2019 was greeted with sudden silence. The sound of water on steel had instantly stopped as the shock news interrupted 35 flows. It remains the most satisfying moment of my life. Thanks for your brilliant OBO.\u201d </p> \n  <p>What an image. We should be so lucky to have anything like the 2005 (or 2009!) series over the next six weeks. Is 2009 is the most underrated Ashes contest of the modern era?

He is no-nonsense but quite Gen-Y in the way he will happily have a lash at anything outside the off-stump, where he is very strong. But he did get caught at third man twice in a Test last summer. Made a ton to finish the home season against Sri Lanka, securing his spot. That he\u2019s vice-captain suggests they see him as a potential long-term skipper. Nice fella, too.</p> \n  <p>Jerusalem is being sung, rather beautifully, by a choir beneath me in front of the pavilion. This is really cool.

Sound good? <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cAustralia look good on paper but with the suspended players all back can it still be called a scratch side? I wonder if their tactics will go with the grain or will they have some well-polished new drills? Roughly speaking it might be a grind playing five tests after the WC but I\u2019m sure Smith is looking forward to getting his pads on, Warner will be buffed up for the contest and Bancroft will want a smooth transition back into the fold even if the reception might be abrasive. Anyway, I\u2019m sure the only DIY cricket we\u2019ll see is the kind of improvised not-in-the-manual brilliance all these Test players are capable of. Shine on you cricketing diamonds. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Very good. Thanks, Tom.

Jofra Archer won\u2019t be in the XI - so Joe Root told us yesterday - but with Anderson, Stuart Broad and Chris Woakes they have the combination they want for this ground. </p> \n  <p>Of course, it is a venue where England haven\u2019t lost a Test Match for 11 years; where Australia haven\u2019t saluted for 19. Back then, it was routine for those dominant sides to win in this country - doing so four times on the trot - but they haven\u2019t retained the urn here since.</p> \n  <p>Urgh! So many storylines!

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for today\u2019s blog. I\u2019ll leave with you some reading from Edgbaston. Please join us in the morning for what should be a pulsating second day\u2019s play. Plotspoiler: there\u2019s plenty of testosterone. Here\u2019s Jos Buttler, chatting on Sky Sports \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit frustrating in the end. We bowled fantastically well this morning. Steve Smith played an exceptional innings. It\u2019s very tough, isn\u2019t it? We didn\u2019t get enough balls at Nos 10 and 11 in one go. Do you put everyone back and suck it up? I think we\u2019ve got to find a way of trying to keep a dismissal in the game as well. We\u2019ll see what kind of score that is tomorrow.\u201d 2nd over: England 10-0 (Burns 4, Roy 6) Whether it\u2019s the first over of the day or the last, if Jason Roy receives a half-volley he will try to put it away. He drives Pattinson confidently through extra cover for four to get off the mark and plays out the remainder of the over. That\u2019s the end of a spectacular day\u2019s play. It\u2019s the Ashes! 1st over: England 3-0 (Burns 3, Roy 0) Cummins goes around the wicket to Burns, who flicks his second ball confidently through midwicket for three. Roy starts with two very solid defensive strokes before missing an extravagant pull stroke. There should be time for one more over. \u201cWriting from Edgbaston about Smith,\u201d says Ross. \u201cMany still booing, yes, but also a lot of England fans on their feet clapping him off. From here it looked like he realised this just before he left the field, and raised the bat to the rest of the ground. A great (split second of a) moment to end a great performance, if so.\u201d Pat Cummins will bowl the first over, having taken a shortcut from first change to attack leader. Rory Burns and Jason Roy stroll onto the field. Apparently there are only six minutes remaining, so a maximum of two overs. Smith was booed off, which is pretty lamentable, but I doubt it registered. The zone is a noise-cancelling place. The timing of his dismissal means the England openers have a thoroughly nasty 15 minutes to survive before the close. Where\u2019s Jack Leach when you need him. Steve Smith misses a big heave and is bowled, which gives Broad a five-for and ends the most magnificent innings: 144 from 220 balls, with 16 fours and two sixes. The second of those sixes came earlier in the over, a mighty blow over midwicket. All things considered, Smith may never have played better. 80th over: Australia 278-9 (Smith 138, Lyon 12) Lyon drives Woakes crisply through mid-off for his third boundary. This is getting a little surreal - it\u2019s barely three hours since Australia were up to their neck in bother. 79th over: Australia 273-9 (Smith 137, Lyon 8) Smith muscles Broad for his 17th four. This is up there with the great tone-setting innings of modern Ashes series - Sir Ian Botham in 1986-87, Michael Slater in 1994-95, Joe Root in 2015 and Steve Smith again in 2017-18. \u201cWhat a player Steve Smith is, best in the world by a country mile,\u201d says Kevin Casserly. \u201cYou lot are great at moaning, the sandpaper incident, the Hand of God etc. Get over it, credit where it\u2019s due, he turned a collapse into a reasonable score.\u201d Fair point. I\u2019ll have a word with my lot and ask them to get over it. 78th over: Australia 268-9 (Smith 132, Lyon 8) As frustrating as this partnership has been for England and their supporters, it sets up a storming day\u2019s play tomorrow. My instinct is that England are in trouble, but I said that last night and they won comfortably. That\u2019s the beauty of cricket: it\u2019s okay to know the square root of diddly squat. \u201cI think this form of fielding complicity - employed by almost everyone - makes absolutely no sense,\u201d says Kristian Petterson. \u201cTry and get the batsman at the crease out. That is all. Don\u2019t overthink it, just try to get him out. Yes, I AM angry about this recovery and am irrationally thrashing out.\u201d Yep, I agree - especially as it has backfired in the past with Steve Smith. 77th over: Australia 267-9 (Smith 131, Lyon 8) Smith whirls Broad behind square for four to bring up the fifty partnership with Lyon. He has scored 22 from his last 11 deliveries, and Australia have more than doubled their score since the loss of the eighth wicket. Lyon joins in the fun by driving Broad down the ground for four more. England look in urgent need of rain and/or an ice bath. They are ragged. \u201cThe statisticians agree that Bradman is the greatest outlier in sport...\u201d says Scott Chapman. \u201cThere have been a few more cricketers come through since 2015, but DB is still way out there in any sport.\u201d 76th over: Australia 258-9 (Smith 126, Lyon 4) Smith has gone straight past one-day mode and into T20 mode. He drags Woakes over mid-on for four and clouts another boundary to midwicket. The sheer certainty of his batting has broken England\u2019s will yet again. This has to be one of his greatest innings. \u201cNot to be a pedant or a miser, but Steve Smith made no mistake,\u201d says Elliot Carr-Barnsley. \u201cHe paid the (pretty gentle) price and we shouldn\u2019t further punish him for it, but nor should we sugar coat deliberate cheating by one of the game\u2019s most recognisable and influential figures as a mistake. Sandpaper didn\u2019t magic its way onto the field, and it was cowardly to make Bancroft hold it instead of himself.\u201d That makes him sound like a Machiavellian genius rather than a fundamentally decent bloke who made some poor decisions because he was mentally shot. Each to their own but I have a bit more sympathy for him. 75th over: Australia 248-9 (Smith 117, Lyon 4) Smith survives an LBW review off the new bowler Broad - it was missing leg by a mile - and hits the next two balls for four. The first was an inside-edge wide of leg stump, the second a lofted straight drive that doesn\u2019t impress Broad one iota. \u201cHe may or may not be a good man (I don\u2019t know him at all) but I question the use of the word \u2018awful\u2019,\u201d says Kristian Petterson. \u201cHe did something wrong and received punishment - that punishment wasn\u2019t awful, it was punishment. Unless you think the punishment was unjust?\u201d I thought it was way over the top, yeah, but I\u2019m not sure we have the time, or I the energy, to go into all that again. But even if the punishment was appropriate, I wouldn\u2019t wish that level of public shaming on him. 74th over: Australia 240-9 (Smith 109, Lyon 4) Smith rocks back to cut Moeen emphatically for four. England don\u2019t know where to bowl to him. Since the start of the 2017-18 Ashes, these are his Test scores against England: 141*, 40, 6, 239, 76, 102*, 83, 104*. That\u2019s 796 runs at an average 0f 159.20. \u201cThe bookies have England 1/2, Australia more than 2/1,\u201d says Andrew Hurley. \u201cSurely it\u2019s closer than that? Par looks 240-250, and with Jimmy probably unable to bowl in the second innings...\u201d Yes, a lot depends on overhead conditions but I would make Australia favourites. This has been a really bad final session for England, although the injury to Anderson has made things so much harder for them. 73rd over: Australia 235-9 (Smith 104, Lyon 4) Steve Smith makes a glorious, cathartic hundred on his return to Test cricket! He drives Stokes through the covers for four before waving his bat to the Australian balcony, who are all on their feet. Never mind the sandpaper; feel the grit. This has been an innings of immense character, not to mention intelligence, skill and sheer geeky love of batting. Smith looks very emotional as he embraces Lyon. This is spine-tingling stuff, a wonderful moment for a good man who made a mistake and paid an awful price. That, truly, is a great innings. 72nd over: Australia 229-9 (Smith 99, Lyon 4) Smith launches Moeen for a huge six to move to 98. He\u2019s content to take a single off the fourth delivery of the over, which gives Lyon two balls to survive. And he does, to lusty cheers from the pocket of Australian fans. Steve Smith is one run away from a quite immense century. 71st over: Australia 222-9 (Smith 92, Lyon 4) Lyon squirts Stokes to the third-man boundary to get off the mark, and then survives the rest of the over. At this percise moment in time, Ben Stokes isn\u2019t entirely high on life. \u201cI know this is only First Day, First Test, but given Jimmy\u2019s injury, this pair are wrestling the game back and we don\u2019t seem to have many ideas on what to do,\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cPermission to get pretty moody and swig a beer on the way home, please. 122-8 and they could end the day 250-9. The Anger...\u201d I wish you lot weren\u2019t so ceaselessly pessimisitic. Chill out, can we. 70th over: Australia 218-9 (Smith 92, Lyon 0) Smith mangles a vile full toss from Moeen through midwicket for four before surviving a stumping referral after a smart bit of work from Bairstow. \u201cFollowing OBO from hospital ward in Zakynthos, Greece,\u201d says Gavin McCarthy. \u201cTeenage daughter, Lucy, admitted with collapsed lung after flight (ouch!). She\u2019s been napping and every time she falls asleep, England take a wicket. She\u2019s been awake for an hour or so now and shows no signs of drowsiness. Every time I try to sing her a lullaby, I\u2019m met with an eye-rolling, \u2018Shut up, Dad!\u2019 Hope she falls asleep before end of play. PS daughter improving day by day and we hope to be out of hospital tomorrow.\u201d I was going to joke about your priorities but it doesn\u2019t really seem appropriate. All the best to Lucy, you and the rest of your family \u2013 that sounds really unpleasant. Out of interest, she asleep yet? 69th over: Australia 212-9 (Smith 86, Lyon 0) Smith, left with the No11 Lyon, turns down a single for the first time. Stokes tries to keep Smith on strike by ramming bouncers over his head; when he gets the line wrong, Joel Wilson calls wide. Smith takes a single off the penultimate delivery to keep the strike and increase Stokes\u2019s agita. \u201cJerry Rice\u2019s record for receiving yards in the NFL (22,895) is almost 41% better than the second best (Larry Fitzgerald, 16,279),\u201d says Tom Brain. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d 68th over: Australia 210-9 (Smith 85, Lyon 0) \u201cAn obvious response to David Hindle would involve modern bats, protective equipment, shorter boundaries and (more subjectively) bowling standards, albeit Smith has higher quality fielding to contend with,\u201d says Geoff Wignall. \u201cI\u2019d also suggest that Smith worries even the best bowlers but doesn\u2019t frighten them as Viv could and that the best of Viv was a good way north of Smith\u2019s best. Anyway, Smith just isn\u2019t that cool. In a broader perspective anyone who considers Smith the best they\u2019ve seen is clearly too young to have seen Sobers, even after an all-night session.\u201d You misspelt \u2018especially\u2019. Boy did England need that. Moeen Ali comes into the attack and strikes with his second ball. Siddle inside-edged a lovely delivery, which turned and bounced from around the wicket, and Buttler took a really smart catch at short leg. Siddle gets a generous ovation for a superb, resourceful innings of 44 from 85 balls. 67th over: Australia 210-8 (Smith 85, Siddle 44) Bairstow appeals politely for caught behind against Siddle after swooping spectacularly to his left. The bowler Stokes wasn\u2019t interested. England are miles behind the over rate, which will cost them Test Championship points should they win any in this match. That\u2019s worth keeping an eye on, because teams will lose many more points in a five-Test series than if there are only two Tests. If I have understood the regulations - and there\u2019s a minuscule chance of that - there is the potential for high farce. \u201cThe largest earthquake ever recorded (Chile, 1961), was between two and three times as big as the next largest (varies between Sumatra, 2004, and Alaska 1964),\u201d says David Hindle. \u201cIf you look at the magnitude scale, it doesn\u2019t appear that way (M9.6 or 9.5 for Chile vs. M9.4 or 9.3 for the others, but a single unit of moment magnitude is equivalent to a 30-fold increase in released energy. But Bradman is still ridiculous for a human.\u201d 66th over: Australia 208-8 (Smith 84, Siddle 43) Smith runs down the track to drive Denly down the ground for four. Edgbaston, and the England team, have gone very flat. I\u2019m not sure which is the chicken and which is the egg. Here\u2019s our own Daniel Harris. \u201cKP told me that when they went through the South Africa team to work out plans for them, the best they could do with Kallis was \u2018run out candidate early in his innings\u2019.\u201d And if you haven\u2019t read that book, you should. It\u2019s nothing like the score-settling autobiography; just a brilliant insight into the mind of a massive genius. 65th over: Australia 201-8 (Smith 78, Siddle 42) Siddle works Stokes off the pads to bring up the 200. It\u2019s been such an impressive effort from this pair, who have batted without ego or fanfare. That said, England are really missing Jimmy Anderson, which has effectively left them with a three-man attack. \u201cTo earn a bit of beer money whilst a student a friend of mine set himself up in business as a cheesy DJ for hire,\u201d says David Tant. \u201cHe called TNT Discos (Top Notch Tunes), and to our surprise he actually got hired a few times. One of them being for a Golf Club annual dinner. \u2018Son of A Preacher Man\u2019 was requested by a predominantly white-haired audience for a nice gentle dance. He only had the version on the Pulp Fiction soundtrack. Unfortunately he accidentally queued up the first track, which is a bit of dialogue from the film: \u2018Any of you f***in\u2019 pr**ks move and I\u2019ll execute every mother*****g last one of you.\u2019 He didn\u2019t get paid, but personally I think if you book someone called Top Notch Tunes at a low price you get what you deserve.\u201d Including some explosive language, honkety honk. 64th over: Australia 198-8 (Smith 76, Siddle 41) And now for something completely different: Joe Denly\u2019s legspin. He starts with a maiden to Siddle, which was done and dusted in approximately 90 seconds. \u201cSo, according to Steve Hudson, either you suffer because the team around you is rubbish, or you suffer because they\u2019re too good - an essentially unfalsifiable hypothesis,\u201d sniffs David Hindle. \u201cNext it will be \u2018English batsman average less because they play in the bowlers\u2019 paradise of England more than the rest.\u2019 So why don\u2019t English bowlers top the bowling averages by light years then? And as to the late career decline. I give you Kumar Sangakkara. Some of them just don\u2019t know when to stop. Smith is already, statistically, in a place no batsman has been since Bradman. In terms of number of runs, number of series, tours etc. versus current average, nothing in the modern game has come close.\u201d Well, Sangakkara was a pretty big exception. I\u2019ll happily bet \u00a3100, for charity, that Smith finishes his Test career with an average below 60. Not that either of us will remember this conversation when he retires in 2025 \u2013 I just wanted to make everyone aware of how much imaginary work I do for charity. 63rd over: Australia 198-8 (Smith 76, Siddle 41) 62nd over: Australia 193-8 (Smith 76, Siddle 36) \u201cAll this talk about Smith and averages has me musing for the millionth time about how remarkable Bradman\u2019s average is,\u201d says Pete Salmon. \u201cWhich got me thinking \u2013 I\u2019m pretty sure, at approximately one third better than thousands of other players, he\u2019s the greatest outlier in all of sport \u2013 no one runs the 100m in six seconds for instance. But that got me thinking \u2013 is he the greatest outlier, human or otherwise, in anything? No planet (I think) is one third bigger than every other etc... Obviously its limited to things that are quantifiable, so no poetry or sunsets, but do any of your science boffin followers have anything that comes close?\u201d 61st over: Australia 190-8 (Smith 76, Siddle 33) Ben Stokes replaces Woakes. Smith walks across his stumps to pull carefully round the corner for four. There\u2019s a lovely paragraph in Mike Atherton\u2019s autobiography which I suspect may also apply to Smith. During the 2001 Ashes series, England listed detailed bowling plans for each Australian batsman in the dressing-room. One entry was shorter than the rest: Gilchrist: ??? Siddle steers Stokes deliberately to the third-man boundary to make it an excellent over for Australia. England look relatively ragged just now. 60th over: Australia 179-8 (Smith 71, Siddle 27) Siddle, lured onto the front foot by Broad, is beaten by a classic legcutter. Later in the over he gets a very thick edge through gully for a single. Broad has bowled jolly well today. 59th over: Australia 175-8 (Smith 70, Siddle 24) Smith steals a single after inside-edging a Woakes inducker onto the pad, and then Siddle drives jauntily through extra cover for a couple. He is playing superbly and has now scored as many as Warner, Bancroft, Khawaja and Wade combin ed. \u201cThis first innings of the first Test of the series is the 2019 Ashes in miniature, no?\u201d writes Dr Emmett Brown Simon McMahon. \u201cRegular clatter of wickets to the seamers, one decent contribution from the top/middle order, useful runs from the tail, cameos from the spinners/weather/crowd.\u201d 58th over: Australia 172-8 (Smith 69, Siddle 22) Siddle works Broad for two to bring up a calm, intelligent fifty partnership. England don\u2019t look like taking a wicket just now, and Broad and Woakes look slightly weary after bowling 17 overs apiece. \u201cThis Smith fella might be all that but I can barely bring myself to watch him bat,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cSome of his average should deducted for failing to make me meow.\u201d He makes me ow, usually at the precise moment he reaches 150, again. 57th over: Australia 169-8 (Smith 68, Siddle 20) Woakes beats Siddle with a lovely slower ball. It\u2019s hard to know what to make of this score. The pitch has done a bit, but I suspect a lot of the movement is due to the overhead conditions. My hunch is that this will be a low-scoring dogfight, but I\u2019ll level with you, I haven\u2019t really got a clue. \u201cSF Barnes you say?\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cOne of my favourite pieces of cricket writing - Peter Gibbs meets the great man.\u201d 56th over: Australia 168-8 (Smith 67, Siddle 20) 55.5 overs: Australia 168-8 (Smith 67, Siddle 20) It\u2019s raining again, although play will continue for now. Smith cuts Broad for a single to move to 67 - and take his average in the last 10 Ashes Tests to 99.66. Not exactly Bradmanesque, is it? After Siddle drives Broad for four, the umpires decide to take the players off. But by the time the covers reach the middle, the rain has relented sufficiently for the umpires to decide play can continue. 55th over: Australia 163-8 (Smith 66, Siddle 16) Siddle clips Woakes through midwicket for four, another sensible, efficient stroke. There are useful runs for Australia, who were in a heap at 122 for eight. \u201cDavid Hindle wonders why Viv R and Brian L didn\u2019t average significantly more than 50 in their careers,\u201d says Steve Hudson. \u201cThe answer is that Lara played for a WI team steadily going into reverse and often seemed to be scoring most of their runs for them, in losing causes. Viv had the opposite problem I think, that in a side that were steamrolling everyone else throughout the 80s, his runs were less and less important to a strong batting side, which translated into more cameo 60s and 70s, and a lack of daddy hundreds. We have no idea which way Smith\u2019s average will go, but I\u2019d be very impressed and surprised if he defies boredom, burnout and slowing reflexes to average 70.\u201d Most great batsmen lose 5-10 runs from their mid-career average once their eyes and resilience start to go. From memory Ricky Ponting had a peak average of 59.99 in December 2006 and retired six years later with an average of 51.85. I\u2019d be pretty surprised if Smith finishes with a career average over 60. 54th over: Australia 159-8 (Smith 66, Siddle 12) Stuart Broad returns to the attack after tea. Siddle edges a good delivery just short of third slip, where Stokes dives to his right to make a good half-stop and save a couple of runs. \u201cI see Dan Lucas\u2019 iPad mishap and raise him an iPhone/hearing aid debacle,\u201d boasts Kim Thonger. \u201cMarrying my final and favourite wife almost four years ago, I inadvertently played the romantic wedding music in the registry office through my hearing aid, which is set up by default to covertly receive the streaming Test match commentary from my phone in \u2018important meetings\u2019, reimagining the silent disco but not in a helpful way.\u201d I hope your final and favourite wife saw the funny side. The players are back on the field. It looks a lot brighter, too. And it looks like a very, very good time to bowl. \u201cSyd Barnes!\u201d says Mike Daniels, referring to this list of successful England bowlers in home Tests. \u201cThe famously grumpy/cantankerous Staffordshire bowler. Imagine Bob Willis on a bad day x10. Played for donkey\u2019s years in the Leagues. Was still pro-ing in his sixties.\u201d Mike, I think you\u2019re a bit out of order calling him cantankerous. This piece from David Frith shows the real Syd Barnes. Here\u2019s a little more detail about Jimmy Anderson\u2019s calf injury, which could rule him out for a wee while. \u201cSir Viv averaged about 65 with a couple of thousand runs on the board, just after the massacre of England in 1976,\u201d says David Hindle. \u201cThe one with two double hundreds in the same series. But it was all downhill from there. Smith is something else altogether. His trajectory, give or take a few blips (Sri Lanka a few winters ago for instance) is still upwards. He could be average 70 by the time he gets to 10,000 runs. You may ask why Viv (and Brian Lara) didn\u2019t average 60 for their careers, and it would be an interesting discussion. But fact is, they didn\u2019t, in fact they both averaged 10 less than Smith currently does, and what more can you say? Smith is in a class of his own, and may well remain there for the duration of his Test career.\u201d I take all your points, but \u2026 Victor Trumper averaged 39. \u201cI had virtually the same experience as Jack Jarvis in the 14th over,\u201d says Dan Leach. \u201cFriends of mine were getting married in Ireland in the grounds of Castle Ward (AKA Winterfell in Game of Thrones). I was entrusted with the iPad for the music. To this day, I don\u2019t know how it happened, but instead of the classical music they had chosen as they walked down the tree-lined grove I managed to blast out \u2018Murder She Wrote\u2019 by Chaka Demus &amp; Pliers.\u201d The start of the evening session has been delayed. The covers are on, the players aren\u2019t. Pulitzer, please! \u201cWotcha, Rob,\u201d breathes Mac Millings. \u201cI\u2019ve had the odd wedding mishap, myself. The first wedding reception I ever went to that didn\u2019t end in a fistfight was my own, although I did manage to drop my bride on the ground during our wedding dance. Also, back in 2011, I asked the OBO community for some jokes, ahead of giving a speech at my sister\u2019s wedding later that evening. A certain Stuart Wilson suggested that I open my speech with \u2018Fornication ... Oh sorry, I mean for an occasion...\u2019 As my sister was heavily pregnant at the time, I decided to go for it. How did it go down? I\u2019ll allow your readers to decide.\u201d Yep, we\u2019ve finally gone interactive. Welcome to the OBO: Bantersnatch, a unique choose-your-own-misadventure story devised by and starring Mac Millings. \u201cMorning Rob,\u201d says Phil Withall. \u201cSeems like the umpires are on a hiding to nothing today and I feel it\u2019s more than a little unfair. Most of us wouldn\u2019t be able to tell if a car had drifted slightly out of its lane when traveling at 70 miles an hour on the motorway. Imagine trying to judge where a ball is going at 90? God help us when the outrage machine clicks into gear when VAR hits the Premier League. We all need to cut the officials a little slack and expect that mistakes are part of sport, on all sides.\u201d Aye. We should also remember that the standard is the highest it\u2019s ever been. I\u2019m not sure we can say that of the actual cricket, apart from fielding and range-hitting. That Woakes over was the last of a fine session for England, who took five wickets for 23 in a giddy 12-over spell. We may have an extended tea break, because the lights are on and it may be about to hose it down at Edgbaston. 53rd over: Australia 154-8 (Smith 66, Siddle 7) Woakes replaces Moeen, who replaced Woakes for the previous over at this end. It\u2019s Perth 1997 all over again! Siddle, feeling tentatively for an outswinger, is well beaten outside off stump. He\u2019s beaten again later in the over, this time by a snorter that lifts and straightens. A fine over from Woakes, who is such a threat in these conditions. In fact, of all the England bowlers to take at least 50 Test wickets at home, Woakes\u2019 average is the best since Fred Trueman was knocking \u2018em off out there. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says John Mackay. \u201cWith DRS, umpire assessment, professional pride and full media scrutiny \u2013 is there any need for neutral umpires at the Ashes? For example, if Richard Kettlebrough and Bruce Oxenford are the two best umpires available and the two teams agree, should they not be umpiring?\u201d Are you familiar with a thing called \u2018Twitter\u2019? I don\u2019t disagree with the principle, but can you imagine the state of absolutely everything if some of today\u2019s decisions had been made by a home umpire? 52nd over: Australia 153-8 (Smith 66, Siddle 6) A short ball from Stokes is pulled through mid-on for four by Smith. As Nasser Hussain says on Sky, Smith\u2019s stance means his hands are already high and in position for that shot. Stokes, who\u2019s sick of the high hands, pitches it up thereafter. \u201cSmith averages 62 in Test cricket,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cI think he\u2019s the best I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Gary, you saw Viv in his prime. Go and stand in the corner for 15 minutes; I don\u2019t want to hear a peep out of you. 51st over: Australia 147-8 (Smith 60, Siddle 6) Moeen replaces Woakes and is swept nicely for four by Siddle. I doubt Root wants to use Moeen at this stage, but Broad and Woakes have bowled 14 overs each and need a breather. \u201cTim Paine says he can name 15 more intimidating grounds, but the stats say something different,\u201d says Matt Emerson. \u201cIf you aggregate across all three international formats, it\u2019s his second least favourite ground (three innings, six runs), beaten only by the Sheikh Zayed Stadium, Abu Dhabi (two innings, three runs)...\u201d If only you\u2019d been at the press conference yesterday. \u2018Just one thing, Tim, Statsguru suggests you go a big rubbery one every time you play at Edgbaston.\u2019 50th over: Australia 142-8 (Smith 59, Siddle 2) Siddle has looked comfortable so far. He\u2019s a very good No10, who has two Test fifties and one first-class century. The moment I type that, he is beaten by a spectacular delivery from Stokes that is angled in and then snaps away off the pitch. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d says Ian Copestake, \u201cthe final two scheduled days of this Test could be donated to charity.\u201d You think it\u2019ll go to a third day? Tell you what, sunshine, you just wait till England bat. 49th over: Australia 141-8 (Smith 58, Siddle 2) This innings will give Smith a lot of satisfaction. In 2015, though he was the highest scorer in the series, most of his runs came when the going was good. He\u2019s an even better player now, I\u2019d say, perhaps even better than Virat Kohli in this form of the game. 48th over: Australia 136-8 (Smith 55, Siddle 0) Smith clearly trusts Siddle\u2019s defence, as he\u2019s playing normally - no big shots, no farming the strike. I suspect that will change if he\u2019s left with Nathan Lyon. \u201cI\u2019m wonder if there\u2019s such a thing as being \u2018in\u2019 for an umpire,\u201d says Chris Lingwood. \u201cThey certainly aren\u2019t seeing it like a beachball today! Must be mortifying.\u201d Definitely. I can remember two purple patches in particular, one from Simon Taufel around 2003 and another from Aleem Dar maybe eight or nine years ago, when they were even more reliable than technology. 47th over: Australia 131-8 (Smith 50, Siddle 1) Siddle steers a bump ball to gully - think Sanath Jayasuriya in Kandy - and the umpires go upstairs to make sure. That\u2019s a sign of low confidence, I suppose. An eventful over continues when Siddle survives another LBW appeal; that looked like it might have been high and wide. Replays confirm it was. Smith, alone on the burning deck as he was in the World Cup semi-final, works a single to reach a masterful half-century from 119 balls. For some reason the Edgbaston crowd respond to his achievement by singing Joe Root\u2019s name. \u201cCricket themed song-based wedding mishaps,\u201d says Tom Wooldridge. \u201cAt a friend\u2019s recent wedding, the best man (Matt, if he\u2019s reading) took the beautiful bride-to-be\u2019s toenail fully off with a toe-crushing yorker, two days before the ceremony. I\u2019m not sure what music was playing at the time but it stopped her wearing open-toed stilettos for the occasion.\u201d I\u2019ll be honest, Tom, I\u2019ve got one or two follow-up questions here. Joel Wilson\u2019s Day Off continues. He gives Peter Siddle out LBW to the new bowler Woakes despite an inside-edge that I could see from Orkney. Siddle reviews instantly and the decision is overturned. Poor Wilson is having a nightmare. 46th over: Australia 129-8 (Smith 49, Siddle 0) Smith survives a huge caught behind appeal from Stokes, who is making the ball talk like he did when he demolished Australia at Trent Bridge in 2015. No review from England, and replays show it was a brilliant decision from Aleem Dar. There was a noise, but it was bat on pad. Earlier in the over Smith flicked Stokes down the leg side for four, just wide of the diving Bairstow. It would have been a simple catch for leg slip. 45th over: Australia 123-8 (Smith 43, Siddle 0) You know what they say: you should never judge a pitch until both ropey batting sides have had a go on it. Australia bat deeper than usual today, with the inclusion of Pattinson and also Siddle, who plays out the last few deliveries of Moeen\u2019s over. \u201cFollowing here in Greece with a Sri Lankan and about 35 hairy Scots,\u201d boasts Benjie Goodhart. \u201cLoving your work!\u201d It\u2019s not my work: it\u2019s Broad\u2019s, and Woakes\u2019, and Stokes\u2019, and umpire Wilson\u2019s. 44th over: Australia 122-8 (Smith 42, Siddle 0) \u201cLet\u2019s not get on the backs of the umpires,\u201d says Mike Daniels. \u201cUmpires are probably now making more out decisions after subsequently seeing how so many not outs would have been shaving the stumps and therefore being \u2018out\u2019, with the proviso that the review system is there for players to use if they ask for it. If the players don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t blame the umpires.\u201d Yes, you\u2019re right \u2013 days like this stand out because they are usually so good. It\u2019s incredible how few howlers they make. Minor mistakes, which all of today\u2019s decisions have been, are unavoidable. I suspect that if any of us tried umpiring we\u2019d be off to Specsavers, in floods of tears, before the first drinks break. Stokes does come on - but it\u2019s for Broad rather than Moeen. Not that it matters, because he has struck straight away! Cummins, set up by a few outswingers, offered no stroke to a huge inswinger and was trapped LBW. That was brilliant from Stokes. 43rd over: Australia 121-7 (Smith 41, Cummins 5) Smith drives Moeen through extra cover for three. Root retrieves the ball and then signals for the crowd to make more noise. I\u2019d be tempted to get Stokes on at this end, with Moeen looking a little flat. Stokes bowled like a drain earlier but the ball has started to do a bit, and he can be deadly when it hoops. \u201cTim Paine may think Edgbaston is not in the top 15 most intimidating grounds in the world,\u201d says Gary Naylor, \u201cbut I\u2019m not sure that the umpires would agree!\u201d In their defence, some of their abysmal cock-ups were in Australia\u2019s favour! 42nd over: Australia 112-7 (Smith 37, Cummins 4) Broad usually does the biggest damage at the business end of a series against Australia. Nobody, not even Lord Beef, can match his three Man of the Match awards in Ashes-winning victories. But he has bowled with the same end-of-series intensity and precision today. Pat Cummins somehow survives a torrid over that includes a thick edge for four, another edge on the bounce to slip and two plays and misses. This, meanwhile, is a sensational spot from the OBO\u2019s own Tim de Lisle. Memo to Joe Root: If it is Broakes, don\u2019t fix it. 41st over: Australia 112-7 (Smith 37, Cummins 0) It turns out that Pattinson LBW was missing leg stump. He didn\u2019t even discuss a review with Steve Smith, but replays showed it was sliding down from around the wicket. That also happened with David Warner\u2019s wicket earlier in the day. The umpires, Aleem Dar and Joel Wilson, have had a bit of a beast. Meanwhile, in the time it took me to type the above, Moeen Ali bowled a maiden to Steve Smith. Thanks Adam, hello everyone. Yes, yes, enough of the pleasantries, it\u2019s all going off out there! SECOND BALL! Broad has picked up two in an over! Around the wicket to Pattinson, it is full and fast. He plays all around it. THE COLLAPSE IS ON. Broad has four. What an hour for England! And with that crazy over dealt with... over to Rob! SCENES! 40th over: Australia 112-7 (Smith 37) What. A. Shocking. Shot. In what is surely Broad\u2019s last over of the spell, the Australian captain pops him straight down the throat of Burns at deep square. It got big on him, the contact was dreadful and Paine is walking off, desolate. Australia have lost three in an hour. 39th over: Australia 109-5 (Smith 36, Paine 3) Right, so Moeen is on from the Birmingham City End. He has a big job ahead of him now, having to hold up an end to let Woakes, Broad and Stokes rotate through the Pavilion End in the absence of Anderson. Smith takes one to midwicket but the name of the game is blunting the spin. 38th over: Australia 108-5 (Smith 35, Paine 3) Oh my, that is a ridiculous leg-cutter from Broad to Paine to start his fresh over, pitching middle and missing off, bypassing the outside edge by a centimetre between times. It\u2019s another fantastic set, Broad giving the Australian captain absolutely nothing early on here. With it now very dark at Edgbaston, the ground staff gather to my left. Hmm. \u201cGreat position for England,\u201d says Steve Hudson. \u201cChris is so Woakes.\u201d I assume we all saw the banner at Glastonbury? 37th over: Australia 108-5 (Smith 35, Paine 3) Warne is getting stuck into Paine already. He\u2019ll be calling for his head at some stage this month, make no mistake. The captain is off the mark with a nice shot, pushing Woakes down the ground with a minimum of fuss, coming back for three. With Anderson out of the attack, they need to get through the rest of this spell and back into Stokes and Moeen. 36th over: Australia 105-5 (Smith 35, Paine 0) 2/22 from eight overs after lunch before this over and it\u2019s ever so close to a third with Broad beating Smith with a delivery that straightens beautifully. A rare bumper follows, Smith getting in behind the rest. This is proper. BRILLIANT review, Woakes talking Root into it, the captain backing his bowler. Pitching middle, shaping back, hitting in line with off-stump... striking off-stump. Edgbaston goes WILD once again. 35th over: Australia 105-5 (Smith 35) ANOTHER REVIEW! Has Woakes trapped Wade? He thinks so, challenging the not out decision of Joel Wilson. Here we go again! 34th over: Australia 103-4 (Smith 34, Wade 0) Just when England needed to hold their nerve they have created chances in consecutive overs and Australia have to start again. NOT OUT! Over the top! Just! \u201cYou\u2019re going to cry in a minute!\u201d roars the Hollies Stand but the technology supports the decision of the former captain to review. \u201cTalk about knowing where your off-stump is,\u201d says Kumar Sangakkara on telly. Too right. DRAMA! HAS BROAD GOT SMITH LBW SHOULDERING ARMS? Aleem Dar has given it. Smith has sent it upstairs too! Here we go. Stand by. 33rd over: Australia 99-4 (Smith 29, Wade 0) So nearly two in three balls! Wade, the man who has forced his way into this side, edges his second ball to third slip on the bounce. It\u2019s another super Woaes delivery, the Tasmanian saved by soft hands at the point of contact. He sure has! Nothing wrong with that, coming back just a tad off the seam and catching the South Australian on the crease. Pitching and hitting in line, middle and off stump is the destination of the ball. A big breakthrough from the local lad, just when times looked tough. HAS WOAKES TRAPPED HEAD? Joel Wilson says so! But Head is sending it upstairs, making the DRS sign with one second remaining. This is a big moment. Stand by! 32nd over: Australia 98-3 (Smith 29, Head 35) England are trying to get the ball changed, Broad suggesting to Aleem Dar it is out of shape. But he\u2019s having none of that. The chat comes after Broad floats onto Smith\u2019s pads, the main man taking a couple. The key point: this ball has stopped swinging around. \u201cThese field placings are suggesting to me,\u201d says David Lloyd, \u201cthat England think this is a flat pitch.\u201d Patience is everything, then. Who has more of it? 31st over: Australia 95-3 (Smith 26, Head 35) Very similar to Woakes\u2019 previous set, giving both set men a chance to rotate the strike with balls on the line of their body. England have to keep their cool here. \u201cThe idea of \u201cgetting funky\u201d with the batting order recalls for me one classic example from one day cricket\u2014a Benson and Hedges Cup match at Hobart in 1990,\u201d says Edmund King. \u201cAustralia decided to reverse their batting order facing a seemingly substandard target from New Zealand. Let\u2019s just say it did not go according to plan, producing this priceless final over from Chris Pringle with Australia needing 1 run to win (Kiwi cricketing folklore; how was that first ball not a wide?, etc. etc.): Good times.\u201d This is my kinda content. And how do I not remember it? 30th over: Australia 92-3 (Smith 25, Head 33) Broad beats Head outside the off stump and the crowd wake up to make some noise for the first time since the break, encouraged by Root at slip to make some noise ala Virat Kohli. But it his Head who reponds best, stroking Broad beautifully back past his boots for four. We also have the Women\u2019s British Open blog running today. 29th over: Australia 87-3 (Smith 24, Head 29) Head is defending well and calling loudly, well replaced to clip a couple away when Woakes angles into his pads. He\u2019s now faced 50 deliveries. A big day for him. 28th over: Australia 85-3 (Smith 24, Head 27) A steady re-start for Broad, both batsmen collecting easy singles to long leg moving their partnership to 50. England, of course, have Stokes to help out and bowl plenty of overs with Anderson injured. But still, tough yards. The players are back on the field! I\u2019m going to commit to pulling the rest of these countries together when Rob takes over at the drinks break. For now, I\u2019m back into the saddle with Stuart Broad, who is bowling to Steve Smith. PLAY! This might be too much to do before we return, but here goes... Ghana - Chris Holden Norway - John Muncey Netherlands - David and Arwen Ankers, Martin Lloyd France - Michael Robinson, Tim Stappart Lundy Island (counting it) - John Cox Italy - Johnny Milles (Bergamo Airport, to be precise), Finbar Anslow Hong Kong - Jason Ali South Korea - Johnny Healy on the free Seoull wifi Palau (!) - Mark Nunn Somalia - John Arran (love this) Myanmar - David Melody, Chris Hughes Thailand - Piers Smith Spain - James Lupton Switzerland - Albert Gubler, who is a newcomer to the game. Welcome! Israel - Daniel Barnett Slovenia - Karen Thorne Indonesia - Nicholas House, Gary Scattergood Poland - Matthew Joseph Ireland - Martin Gilbert, David Mills Antarctica (!) - Jerry Gillham (THIS IS GREAT) Portugal - Matthew Wikeley Belguim - Matt Haultain-Gall Turkey - Robert Lewis USA - Marie Meyer And it\u2019s not good. From the England camp at lunch. \u201cJimmy Anderson has tightness to his right calf and will have a scan this afternoon. A further update will be given later today. He felt tightness at the end of his fourth over.\u201d Difficult to know whether that means he will be able to field in the middle session; he was out there before lunch. That certainly feels like he\u2019s cooked for the day, doesn\u2019t it? Let me be the 100th person in the lunch room to say... Glenn McGrath, 2005, this very ground. Speaking of 2005, the Ashes-winning squad from that year are doing a lap of honour. 27th over: Australia 83-3 (Smith 23, Head 26) Moeen to Head for the final over of this eventful session. He plays it out without concern. A maiden it is as they leave the field for lunch. Still England\u2019s morning after three early wickets but an excellent little fightback from these two, putting on 48 in 76 balls through the second hour. Broad was brilliant early on, pinning Warner (albeit from a delivery missing leg stump) then finding Bancroft\u2019s edge. Woakes did his bit too, sending down a beauty to Khawaja who looked the part until that point. Smith and Head both took their time before settling then scoring freely in the lead up to the break. They look good. Perhaps most conerning for England is that we haven\u2019t seen Anderson at the bowling crease since his fourth over. It was a lovely, if brief, spell but ended prematurely when leaving the field. He was back after a few overs but didn\u2019t come back on. There are reports of blood seen on the veteran\u2019s hand - I\u2019ll keep an eye on that. Righto, I need a break for a bit. I suggest you do the same. I\u2019ll be back in about 20 minutes to plough through my very busy inbox. Thanks for your company through the first session. Back shortly. 26th over: Australia 83-3 (Smith 23, Head 26) It is Woakes to replace Stokes, in which will probably be the penultimate over of the session provided he can get it bowled inside four minutes. He\u2019s straighter to Smith than Stokes, playing with a straight bat in response. A bit shorter, with the pentultimate ball, he nearly squares him up but the No4 successfully deflects from high on his blade to third man with soft hands. A bouncer to finish - we haven\u2019t seen many of those. 25th over: Australia 81-3 (Smith 21, Head 26) Smith is solid and patient in defence, seeing off Moeen. Overpitching to finish, he strokes nicely through the gap at cover for three. Into the 20s from 51 deliveries. I can\u2019t remember Smith\u2019s exact average when reaching 50 balls in Test cricket but, if I recall correctly, it is 100-plus. 24th over: Australia 78-3 (Smith 18, Head 26) Five more runs off Stokes, who has been patchy in this spell. Smith plays a pull that we were so familiar with from his first stint in the Test team, holding his pose after completing the shot. After picking up another single in that direction, Head flicks another misdirected delivery for two. Broad or Woakes for a quick one before lunch at this end? \u201cWhy\u2019s Jonny Bairstow behind the stumps for the tests rather than Jos Buttler?\u201d asks Theo. \u201cI know YJB wants the gloves, but is there no consensus on who is the better wicketkeeper?\u201d A great curiosity of mine the extent to which YJB\u2019s insistence has made it so. I\u2019d have Foakes there to allow him to just bat. Not to be. 23rd over: Australia 73-3 (Smith 15, Head 24) Smith won\u2019t be doing anything before lunch to risk his wicket against Moeen, getting on the front foot time and again to play him cautiously to fielders in front of the wicket. When the spinner drops his length back, the former captain responds by going deep to to clip one. Clever batting. An idea I\u2019ve been pushing around on the podcast lately. Thoughts? 22nd over: Australia 72-3 (Smith 14, Head 24) Another busy over, seven more added - Smith glancing Stokes then Head doing the same, albeit off his backside, for another batch of four leg byes. If it ends up being another low-scoring scrap, this counterattacking period won\u2019t be for nothing. Smith will have a good handle on that. A massive response to the country call out. I might have knocked off a quarter of the globe in the space of one stint. We\u2019ll see at lunch. 21st over: Australia 65-3 (Smith 11, Head 24) Moeen Ali gets a chance with about 22 minutes remaining until they can grab a bite. He was so important in Australia\u2019s first innings of the 2015 Ashes in Cardiff, ripping through the middle order that day. Head wants a piece of him early though, leaning back in the crease to punch through cover for another boundary - shot - then making it two in a row off the edge. Nothing convincing about that second stroke but the board keeps ticking. Isa Guha notes a bit of variable bounce. Hmm. 20th over: Australia 57-3 (Smith 11, Head 16) Right, ignore what I said about Head having a good old look. Not so much here against Stokes, pulling him through midwicket for four then steering him through point for another. There is plenty of movement from the latter offering away from the bat but he watched it all the way onto his blade. He gets three more to finish, behind point off the edge but without risk because he has made contact with soft hands. And just like that, he has overtaken Steve Smith. 19th over: Australia 46-3 (Smith 11, Head 5) Head is off the mark after a solid half an hour at the crease, driving a couple off Woakes to mid-off then clipping three through midwicket from the delivery that follows. Once again missing his line, Smith\u2019s pad deflects the final ball down to the fine leg rope for leg byes. Ian Botham is getting stuck into the Australian fans, saying they have one song: \u201cGo Aussie Go.\u201d Um, no. That\u2019s not it. For your viewing pleasure at lunch. 18th over: Australia 37-3 (Smith 11, Head 0) Stokes to Smith is a tasty contest, the former beating the bat with the first of his fresh over as the clouds completely shut out the sun here at Edgbaston. It\u2019s a much better set from the all-rounder, Smith leaving by default. \u201cThis is great,\u201d writes Yvonne Beddow. \u201cEvery time I come back to the OBO tab and refresh the page, England have taken a wicket!\u201d And from Stuart MacKenzie. \u201cOk, not cricket but rugby. I persuaded my wife to agree to Jupiter from the Planets (which she didn\u2019t know) as our song for exiting the church after our wedding. Unfortunately my rugby pals told her later that it\u2019s also the tune for the \u2018World In Union\u2019 song that gets trotted out for every Rugby World Cup, and so she thinks I chose it deliberately to sneak rugby (of which she\u2019s not a fan) into the service. I genuinely didn\u2019t think about this in advance (I like Jupiter but not World in Union) but she doesn\u2019t believe me, and has never forgiven me for not telling her!\u201d I had a plan to name a child Dermott, on the basis that my girlfriend is English, but she now knows me (and his stories) too well. No way. 17th over: Australia 37-3 (Smith 11, Head 0) I\u2019m going to compile the list of nations at the lunch break, as I\u2019ve created a (lovely) monster with the aim of ticking off every UN nation. Every email is appreciated, trust me, but I best get back to the cricket. Woakes to Smith and the former captain is again off strike early in the over with one, this time to square leg. Head has started well, showing no signs of aggressive against balls that are designed to tempt him outside his off-stump. As James Vince knows, it is a blessing and a curse when you are known for punishing bowlers through extra cover. 16th over: Australia 36-3 (Smith 10, Head 0) Smith gets off strike from the first ball of Stokes\u2019 new over, past mid-off. Head is leaving and evading but the all-rounder\u2019s radar is off, so he can watch a few balls in a row drift down the legside to finish. Stay away from those. 15th over: Australia 35-3 (Smith 9, Head 0) England will know that Head was far from convincing combating during their last home summer, the South Australian routinely messed up by Bumrah and co. Woakes is asking the right questions, Head making contact a couple of times and leaving very close to his off-stump. Nothing wrong with that. A wicket maiden for Birmingham\u2019s favourite son. \u201cNo wedding day misshaps but this was the music we walked out of the long room at Trent Bridge too last year after we got married,\u201d tweets @Berdo7. Speaking of twitter, @stalin_great (??) says he is in \u201cthe Soviet Socialist Republic of Bali, where Mrs Stalina has just understood the real reason why I have cried off from taking her out to eat tonight - OBO! Has any Leader of the Masses made a greater sacrifice for cricket?\u201d More conventionally: @Markzip is in South West Ireland, Stephen Cooke in Spain, John Allen South Korea and @ehjchess is waiting his turn at the dentist. And Ibiza for @jw1789 - with wine. A tiny outside edge! Given not out on the field but there was no way that England weren\u2019t reviewing that. Technology quickly confirms the feather. There was just enough movement from a full length; perfect bowling in these conditions with the still new-ish ball. 14th over: Australia 35-2 (Khawaja 13, Smith 9) Stokes is into the attack and gives Khawaja something gentle on the pads, which he clips away with ease for four. Happy batting. A quicker ball follows, beating his blade and thumpsinginto his pad, but it has pitched outside leg so there is nothing to worry about. Going well, he is. \u201cMorning Collo, great to have you on the tools.\u201d Nick Toovey! The loosest man on all the internet. \u201cNow that that first hour\u2019s nerves have settled, are you also noticing that ball isn\u2019t carrying through very well? Could just be me (and I\u2019m sneaking in a few balls here and there after an office move has situated the MD right behind my desk \u2013 the same MD who has begged me to do some work over the course of the next 6 weeks), but the catch to slip dropped low, the keeper and slips aren\u2019t standing that far back, and balls are being taken at knee height. Could be a fourth-innings sponge?\u201d Sound. Broad was hitting 90mph or near enough but wasn\u2019t exactly pinging them through at shoulder height. That will suit Khawaja. \u201cJack Jarvis here \u2013 long time reader, first time emailer.\u201d Jack, I love a first-time-caller. Good on you. \u201cI\u2019m quite nervous, I hope this story is good enough to make the grade on the first day of the actual Ashes.\u201d Don\u2019t be. This is a nice place - especially when England are doing well in a Test Match. Okay, to your tale. \u201cA bloke in my office got married and left it to his soon-to-be-brother-in-law to press play on the ipod to start the music for his soon-to-be-wife to walk down the aisle. He panicked and just pressed \u201cplay\u201d without selecting anything and it played the first thing in the list \u2013 Dreadlock Holiday by 10CC. Does anyone else have any similar cricket themed song based wedding mishaps?\u201d Niche request! I like it. But if you\u2019re going to find anyone in this very specific boat, I suspect they will be reading on here. 13th over: Australia 30-2 (Khawaja 8, Smith 9) After nearly beating cover with a nice drive, Khawaja goes down the ground off Woakes for three along the carpet. Nice shot. He\u2019s looked very tidy so far. Smith defends the rest, getting Australia to the end of the first hour. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that TMS managed (by one means or another) to get a listener in every (UN) country in the world over the course of the World Cup,\u201d says Graeme Thorn. \u201cI wonder if you (that is, the Guardian) are planning onattempting something similar for the Ashes OBO this year?\u201d Well, what a fine idea! We have some help already. To Felix Sch\u00e4fer in Germany, who has found the sport in his 30s, thank you for joining the fam. Phil Sawyer in Malaysia from a club lounge, great to see you as always. Simon Thomas ticks the Croatian box \u201cfrom a yacht in the Adriatic, being shouted at by the skipper for not listening to his instructions and getting sun burned to a crisp.\u201d Milo Dodd in Stuttgart. Jonathan Harding is Big in Japan. Ciaron Murphy is in Manly at dinner with his wife hiding his phone. DRINKS! 12th over: Australia 27-2 (Khawaja 5, Smith 9) After causing Smith so much trouble in his previous over, Broad gives him another full ball to deal with, this time timing it behind point for four. That\u2019ll help build the confidence. As will the fact that Broad must be nearly done for now. Perhaps Anderson will follow him from this end? 11th over: Australia 23-2 (Khawaja 5, Smith 5) That\u2019s Smith at his most confident, getting across his stumps to whip Woakes through midwicket - off the mark with the stroke, racing down to the rope. He grabs another single around the corner to keep the strike, again after shuffling across his woodwork. You do you, Steve. You do you. \u201cMoved to New Zealand six years ago from the UK but currently on a tiny island off the coast of mainland Fiji with very dicey mobile reception so unfortunately no TMS for me but as ever enjoying the OBO and one of my brothers what\u2019s apping the important bits to me in real time,\u201d reports Ian Rinn. \u201cWill be with you for another hour or so before sleep but keep up the great work and look forward to reading the full OBO over breakfast. Same to my brother Chris and it seems the England bowling attack!\u201d Emails in from all over the world this morning, the OBO bringing us all together. Thanks for your company. To Adrian Goldman, too, in Kuopio in Finland and Andrew Denton (not the Australian one, he tells me) who is stuck on a tarmac in Rome. As the over ends, Jimmy Anderson returns to the field from beneath me in the pavilion. 10th over: Australia 17-2 (Khawaja 4, Smith 0) Broad is up again! There\u2019s a sound when the ball passes Smith but it is off the pad - they don\u2019t go upstairs. A near carbon-copy of the first ball later on, again clipping Smith on the pad flap before ending up with Bairstow. The TV tells us that Broad has never bowled fuller in a spell than he has so far this morning, according to CricViz. He finishes by beating Smith with a beauty. Of course, he\u2019s been at the bowling crease for the defining spell of the last three Ashes series in this county. 9th over: Australia 17-2 (Khawaja 4, Smith 0) Woakes is into the attack because Anderson left the field at the end of his previous over. We\u2019re asking for an update from the England camp - stand by for that. Of course, this is Jimmy\u2019s first game back after the calf injury that he picked a month ago. The Brummy Botham is right on the mark to Khawaja, who plays him very watchfully to begin. 8th over: Australia 17-2 (Khawaja 4, Smith 0) There is a man at short point for Smith, a position they had for the former Australian captain in Brisbane 18 months ago when he went on to make one of the best tons of his career. And he immediately picks him out. It\u2019s on the bounce; an old-fashioned crowd catch. This is fantastic stuff. \u201cAs probably one of your younger OBOers at 17 entranced by \u2018Is It Cowardly To Pray For Rain\u2019 and \u2018766 And All That\u2019 I\u2019m following from Napier, NZ on a rugby tour,\u201d writes Bertie Heaver. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly 10:30 here and I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d Bertie, thanks for being part of it. Napier is a lovely spot. Enjoy. \u201cFollowing on OBO and listening to TMS here in Nigeria,\u201d writes Seth Levine. \u201cIt took 23 minutes of this game to reinforce the point that Test Match cricket is the superior format, however much fun the World Cup was. Just the murmur between balls, sans hideous music and forced jollity, makes me feel better about the world.\u201d Classic Stuart Broad dismissal! Bancroft hangs the bat at a delivery just short of a length, nipping away enough to collect the outside edge. Joe Root does the rest at slip. The crowd once again give it big with Bancroft leaving and Smith replacing him. England are flying. 7th over: Australia 13-1 (Bancroft 4, Khawaja 4) Bancroft is more at home against Anderson this time around, making good contact in defence then keeping the strike with the third leg bye so far. Merv Hughes is in the crowd, Adam Hirst tells me. I had the great pleasure of spending a night in the pub with him before the World Cup semi-final. I worked out very quickly that the key was sitting back, strapping in and enjoying the ride. \u201cStill at work at solicitor\u2019s office here in Sydney at almost 8:30pm Thursday evening,\u201d reports Philip Sutherland. Great to have your company, wherever this is finding you around the cricket world. 6th over: Australia 12-1 (Bancroft 4, Khawaja 4) Nice. Bancroft is off the mark with a defensive stroke that\u2019s timed so well that it runs away for four down to long-off. A leg-bye is added when Broad misses his line. One to finish and Khawaja is off the mark with a delightful clip through midwicket, making two fours from the over. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d Hi, Harry O\u2019Brien. \u201cDuring Edgbaston Ashes 2005, I was seated next to a huge swathe of Aussie fans, so the closest bar was a sea of yellow every day. The nearest loo was an Aussie stronghold too. During Australia\u2019s 2nd innings when things were getting tense, Gilchrist came to the crease as I headed to the loo, keeping in touch with the goings on through my ear-piece and transistor radio. Surrounded by 30 or 40 Aussies and struggling to hear my radio over the noise of water hitting stainless steel, excited voices in my ear- piece said Gilchrist was out!! For one run!! My excited shout of \u2018Gilly\u2019s gone!!\u2019 was greeted with sudden silence. The sound of water on steel had instantly stopped as the shock news interrupted 35 flows. It remains the most satisfying moment of my life. Thanks for your brilliant OBO.\u201d What an image. We should be so lucky to have anything like the 2005 (or 2009!) series over the next six weeks. Is 2009 is the most underrated Ashes contest of the modern era? Forever drawfed by its older brother four years earlier. 5th over: Australia 3-1 (Bancroft 0, Khawaja 0) Anderson\u2019s turn, bowling with five slips from his favoured Birmingham City End. Bancroft gets out of the frying pan from the second ball of the set, acquring a leg bye from his thigh pad. Khawaja defends and leaves well until the final delivery, which evades his outside edge after doing plenty off the track. Jimmy turned 37 this week. So good. \u201cFirst impressions of seeing the names and numbers on the shirts are mixed,\u201d writes Hugh Molloy. \u201cI unexpectedly like being able to sport who\u2019s where\u2019s on the field and even the batsmen being highlighted. However, the numbers, which take up 80% of the real estate, are a pointless and useless abomination. Also, the font could be a bit more sympathetic. It looks like it was chosen by the chap who did Carpetright and SportsDirect\u2019s signage.\u201d 4th over: Australia 2-1 (Bancroft 0, Khawaja 0) IT WAS MISSING! Just going down the legside! What a HUGE early moment in this game. Khawaja defends the one delivery left in the successful Broad over. I\u2019ve been asked a lot about the handshakes. I can confirm, via the England camp, that they were not asked to participate by Australia. He\u2019s gone this time! Warner misses a far fuller deliver that is only going one place from around the wicket. Aleem Dar raises his finger and England are UP AND ABOUT. No review considered. Warner looks straight ahead as the Hollies Stand send him off - loudly. BROAD THINKS HE HAS WARNER LBW! Root lets him go upstairs to challenge the Aleem Dar\u2019s decision but it is shown to be going well over the top of leg stump. England give up a referral. 3rd over: Australia 2-0 (Bancroft 0, Warner 2) Anderson beats Warner to begin this time, angling away in that dreamy Jimmy fashion. Later in in the over, he finds an inside edge with one that goes the other way, deflecting back onto his pad. That gives Bancroft one ball to see out and he beats him again with a beauty. Great start. \u201cDid they handshake?\u201d asks Damian Walsh from a meeting room in Madrid. Evidently not. Spicy. Posting the TMS overseas link again for those who missed it the first time around. Fun fact: 62 per cent of emails we get on the OBO in the morning session are asking for the TMS links. 2nd over: Australia 1-0 (Bancroft 0, Warner 1) Broad is down the legside to begin but both he and Bairstow are fairly interested in the caught behind down the legside? I tell you what, the the technology suggests it was... off the toe of the bat? Blimey. Imagine that went upstairs; Warner would have been out first ball! Instead, he\u2019s off the mark later in the over with a push through cover. It gives Bancroft a couple of deliveries to negotiate and he\u2019s beaten by the first, again in that channel just outside the off-stump. That\u2019s his spot. Lovely. 1st over: Australia 0-0 (Bancroft 0, Warner 0) Jimmy Anderson: set and forget. He beats Bancroft with the third ball of the series, the first that the opener elected to play at. The swing, the shape, the oohs and aahs from the crowd. Delicious. The West Australian makes contact with the last couple, which will feel good. Welcome! The players are on the field! Here we go! Anderson vs Bancroft. The crowd do their thing as the controversial pair make their way to the middle. PLAY! Now for the anthems. This choir, bring them everywhere! Let\u2019s get a few emails in here. My apologies in advance for missing many of these during this morning stint; it going to be that kind of OBO. But I\u2019ll do my best to manage the inbox and the updates. \u201cI\u2019ve just had my pre-series hair cut and beard trim so definitely ready for action now,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cGoing along to watch tomorrow for my first Ashes expedition to Edgbaston in about 20 odd years. Can\u2019t wait - like a kid on Christmas Eve who\u2019s really not sure whether Santa will decide if I\u2019ve been naughty or nice.\u201d Be sure to find us when you get here, Brian. Have a great time. \u201cEnjoyed the Tim Paine presser you linked to,\u201d writes James Walsh. \u201cDid he have time to list the fifteen Test venues he finds more scary than Edgbaston? I\u2019d be fascinated to know which ones they are. I guess Chester-le-Street, due to the Shane Watson ghost incident, but the other fourteen are a spooky mystery.\u201d He\u2019s only played international cricket at 18! Was lovely trolling work from Paine, I thought. Means nothing now, of course. \u201cHaving not watched Australia play much Test cricket since the last Ashes, and even then in an often sleep deprived state, I was thinking I didn\u2019t have too much knowledge of Travis Head, or indeed of Tim Paine the keeper/batsman (I\u2019ve read plenty on his captaincy),\u201d says Matthew Potter. \u201cI know a fair bit about the battle for number six due to your discussions on your pod. Care to fill me in? Head likely to make some match winning knocks? Is Paine\u2019s captaincy and glovework worth his one first class hundred?\u201d Okay, let\u2019s do Trav Head. He was made captain of South Australia at 21; they love his leadership skills. He is no-nonsense but quite Gen-Y in the way he will happily have a lash at anything outside the off-stump, where he is very strong. But he did get caught at third man twice in a Test last summer. Made a ton to finish the home season against Sri Lanka, securing his spot. That he\u2019s vice-captain suggests they see him as a potential long-term skipper. Nice fella, too. Jerusalem is being sung, rather beautifully, by a choir beneath me in front of the pavilion. This is really cool. Interested in the history of the hymn as it relates to English cricket? I wrote an essay on it. \u201cGoing on a tangent here,\u201d as is your right as an OBO emailer, Abhinav Dutta. \u201cSo I am sat at work, fuming at my bosses and squinting for some corner to catch the cricket in without unnecessary supervision. Anyway had to ask, how does one channel Mitchell Johnson like ferocity while retaining the easy going flow of Ice Cube? Would so love to give them bosses a Mitch Johnson death stare before hollering \u2018Chickity-check yo self before you wreck yourself\u2019 at their faces.\u201d Gosh, how I loved watching the Ashes when I shouldn\u2019t have been as a kid at school then later when I had a proper job. Lovely memories. \u201cImagine saying six months ago Hazelwood and Starc would be fully fit and left out,\u201d says Adrian from Melbourne on twitter in response to the Pattinson/Siddle love. Quite right. This is a complete shift in thinking from the dogmatic approach in 2015 where there was a pecking order and That Was That. This is very Tim Paine. He explained it well when talking to us a couple of days ago. That TMS link I put up was the non-UK one, to avoid any confusion. If you are in the UK, pick it up at the usual BBC places. \u201cJust wondering,\u201d asks Peter da Silva. \u201cHas the fusion of his spine changed his bowling style, would have thought it would have to? Vague memory of him being a bit of an all rounder in the 2013 series in England before getting injured.\u201d He changed his bowling acting for a time after the 2013 injury but doesn\u2019t look that different to when he arrived. For comparison purposes as we move through the Test, was his debut in 2011. Shane Warne is happy with the attack. Not surprising, given his long-held views on Mitch Starc. Those teams as named. England: Rory Burns, Jason Roy, Joe Root (c), Joe Denly, Jos Buttler, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow (wk), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Stuart Broad, James Anderson. Australia: David Warner, Cameron Bancroft, Usman Khawaja, Steven Smith, Travis Head, Matthew Wade, Tim Paine (c &amp; wk), James Pattinson, Pat Cummins, Peter Siddle, Nathan Lyon. An easy decision, he says. \u201cIt looks better than we were expecting it. It looks hard and dry.\u201d He then talks about having Nathan Lyon at his disposal later in the game. As for the team... Pete Siddle is IN! Six changes from the last Test Australia played in. As expected, no Starc and Hazlewood; Cummins and Pattinson are the other two seamers. A big, bold call from the Australian camp. \u201cWe think Pete Siddle in this match complements the other two very nicely.\u201d Joe Root is \u201cnot disappointed at all\u201d to be bowling first. \u201cWe have a very strong bowling attack for these conditions.\u201d They are as named at the press conference yesterday with Anderson, Broad, Woakes, Stokes and Moeen his bowling attack. \u201cOf course,\u201d it is a boost to the team, he says, that they get to play the First Test at Edgbaston. Just quickly before I\u2019m asked... the TMS link, thanks to Alastair Ferguson. Enjoy! Norcross is in fine form, I can assure you of that. \u201cGood morning.\u201d Hello Tom Marlow. He then makes about 17 jokes about the Newslands saga. I\u2019m going to publish them all, unedited, and that\u2019ll be that in terms of today\u2019s OBO, I reckon. Sound good? \u201cAustralia look good on paper but with the suspended players all back can it still be called a scratch side? I wonder if their tactics will go with the grain or will they have some well-polished new drills? Roughly speaking it might be a grind playing five tests after the WC but I\u2019m sure Smith is looking forward to getting his pads on, Warner will be buffed up for the contest and Bancroft will want a smooth transition back into the fold even if the reception might be abrasive. Anyway, I\u2019m sure the only DIY cricket we\u2019ll see is the kind of improvised not-in-the-manual brilliance all these Test players are capable of. Shine on you cricketing diamonds. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d Very good. Thanks, Tom. But yes, let\u2019s talk cricket - not sandpaper. Steve Smith is on Sky Cricket with Nasser. He has him in the nets in a pre-filmed feature, going through his strange set-up and so on. If this were any other series, Smith and Warner\u2019s return would be the only story - but this is no normal series. \u201cI don\u2019t particularly like watching that much,\u201d Smith said in relation to his batting obsession. He\u2019s now got Nas throwing balls at him! He can\u2019t be stopped! I saw a senior Barmy Army member in the lift in this morning who told me they have 500 members ready to roll this morning in the Hollies Stand. It\u2019ll be fun to watch but I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll mean much. The track is \u201cvery dry and very hard\u201d according to Shane Warne. \u201cThis toss is a lot bigger than people think.\u201d Andrew Strauss agrees: \u201cThis is a massive bat-first wicket.\u201d Interesting. Toss in five! Steve Waugh is here with the Australian team. Just as it was during the World Cup when Justin Langer had Ricky Ponting in a tracksuit, the former captain is serving as a mentor. Here he was pre-Test. Nice bit from Ian Ward on Sky Cricket then. \u201cAthers, what would you do if you won the toss?\u201d He replies: \u201cBat.\u201d Ward again, looking at Nasser: \u201cActually, I\u2019m not going to ask you.\u201d Very good. What do we think of the World Test Championship? It begins today as well, don\u2019t you know. The main thing you will notice this morning is that there are numbers on the players\u2019 shirts. But there is more to it than that. The WTC, in short: The top nine ICC Test nations play six bilateral series against each other over two years before a final at Lord\u2019s. Correct, that means each team won\u2019t play two others. It\u2019s not elegant. India don\u2019t play Pakistan, for instance. 120 points available per series, divided between the Tests - minimum two, maximum five. Yes, that means Tests don\u2019t carry the same weight. When Australia play Bangladesh (over two rubbers) they are worth 60 each. But in an Ashes Test, 24 are on the line in every game. That\u2019s probably all we need to know for now. Better than the alternative? Of course. Room to improve after this first two-year cycle? Absolutely. I\u2019m looking forward to it. Some highlights from Joe Root\u2019s presser, too. Speaking of Tim Paine. His press conference yesterday provided plenty of fresh meat. Is Edgbaston the most intimidating venue where he has played? Naaaah, not in the top 15, champ. The Churchill non-quote was good craic too. All fun and games. To shake or not to shake? Lovely little exclusive for the first morning of the Ashes via Guardian scoop master Ali Martin. Had a funny old time last night. From Birmingham to Bristol for the final Women\u2019s Ashes T20 then back to where we started. I\u2019m not entirely sure where Geoff Lemon ended up sleeping, but that\u2019s the way these things go sometimes. On the park, Katherine Brunt turned the clock back (29 not out and 3/21) and England found a good\u2019un, Mady Villiers, who combined with fellow 20-year-old tweaker Sophie Ecclestone for five matchwinning wickets between them. But it was a consolation win, the trophy very much going back to Australia - retained at the earliest possible opportunity; finishing the multi-format series with a points triumph of 12 to 4. Ellyse Perry was magnificent throughout (finishing 60 not out in the failed chase last night), leading the tournament for both runs and wickets. Of course. After play, Charlotte Edwards declared that there has never been a better women\u2019s player in the history of the game than Perry. James Pattinson is speaking on Channel Nine in Australia. He is very excited, as you would expect. Acknowledges the nerves in the rooms but the positive vibes as well. Happy with the preparation down in Southampton last week. Day one is about setting the tone. Have you see Patto bowl recently? If not, get your eyes on this from the Sheffield Shield final in March. It\u2019s hard to believe that only this time last year, after having his spine fused together in an operation over in New Zealand, there was no guarantee he\u2019d bowl in long-form cricket again. At last, at age 29, he is back in business. Big time. Oh boy, here it is. Morning one. So much build up, so much phony war, so much Ashez Bantz. But it means not a jot when the clock strikes 11 here at Edgbaston this morning. You know it\u2019s a Big Day on the cricket calendar when we fire up the OBO this far out from the first ball and days don\u2019t come much bigger than this for us here. The news from the ground is that the weather is a image directly from Jimmy Anderson\u2019s dreams: muggy and cloudy. The track is brown, but I am told the grass that was there yesterday will still be present when the first ball is bowled. Surely this also means that Pete Siddle will win the final spot in the Australian side - a great story. Those comeback tales are everywhere in the away dressing room: James Pattinson\u2019s fused spine, Matt Wade\u2019s return from nowhere, Tim Paine\u2019s remarkable career arc. That\u2019s before even thinking about the return of the Sandpaper trio, all available today for their first outing in the baggy green since that fateful day at Newlands. For the hosts, their side contrasts nicely in terms of the volume of all-rounders they will be picking. Jofra Archer won\u2019t be in the XI - so Joe Root told us yesterday - but with Anderson, Stuart Broad and Chris Woakes they have the combination they want for this ground. Of course, it is a venue where England haven\u2019t lost a Test Match for 11 years; where Australia haven\u2019t saluted for 19. Back then, it was routine for those dominant sides to win in this country - doing so four times on the trot - but they haven\u2019t retained the urn here since. Urgh! So many storylines! So much to think about. With this much time up my sleeve, I\u2019ll leave it here for now and simply encourage you to drop me a line. How are you feeling? Good morning to you all.",

      "body": "<p>Sport is a fine arena to watch truisms develop in real time. Take this: one side of a cricket ground in Birmingham gets more rowdy than other venues. People start to reference it, so others pay it more attention. People who hear about it want to get involved. They dress up and come down and are paid more attention in turn. In time the Eric Hollies Stand is known not as a place but a phenomenon. So the legend feeds itself, getting high on its own supply.</p> <p>After a few wins at Edgbaston against Australia, the legend has grown. English cricket is exceedingly keen to have a mythological reference point to rival the Gabba for Australia: a fortress, a name to make visiting teams quail. Of course, many people refer to Birmingham as the Brisbane of the North; or that\u2019s what I would write if newspapers had a sarcasm font. The fortress comparison doesn\u2019t stack up either: a decade unbeaten at Edgbaston for England, three decades for Australia at the Gabba.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/01/england-australia-ashes-2019-first-test-day-one-report\">Smith\u2019s century rescues Australia on first day of Ashes despite Broad\u2019s burst</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Hollies, though, does inject life and energy into Test cricket in its own way.

      "bodyText": "Sport is a fine arena to watch truisms develop in real time. Take this: one side of a cricket ground in Birmingham gets more rowdy than other venues. People start to reference it, so others pay it more attention. People who hear about it want to get involved. They dress up and come down and are paid more attention in turn. In time the Eric Hollies Stand is known not as a place but a phenomenon. So the legend feeds itself, getting high on its own supply. After a few wins at Edgbaston against Australia, the legend has grown. English cricket is exceedingly keen to have a mythological reference point to rival the Gabba for Australia: a fortress, a name to make visiting teams quail. Of course, many people refer to Birmingham as the Brisbane of the North; or that\u2019s what I would write if newspapers had a sarcasm font. The fortress comparison doesn\u2019t stack up either: a decade unbeaten at Edgbaston for England, three decades for Australia at the Gabba. The Hollies, though, does inject life and energy into Test cricket in its own way. Wander down there on the opening day of the Ashes, and even before the hundreds of man-hours spent queuing at the bars have had their full effect, the atmosphere is febrile. The costumes are loud, flags draped, masks and banners waved. The usual songs ring out but it\u2019s not just Barmy Army stalwarts. David Warner and Cameron Bancroft are almost carried aloft to the crease on a wave of jeers. When Stuart Broad gets each of them out there is a detonation of sound. With each wicket the departing batsman gets a rousing swell of \u201ccheerio, cheerio, cheerio\u201d. Dotted among the union jacks and techno-Hawaiian prints and horse costumes are occasional blotches of bright yellow, not of security stewards but Australian shirts. Of all the gin joints in all the world, what brings a parochial cricket fan from that side of the world into these heaving depths? Shane looks at his friend Mikkel and laughs broadly. \u201cWe turned 40 this year and got two weeks to come over to the cricket. So we went in the ballot and these were the tickets we were allocated. We had no idea. I\u2019d never even heard of the Eric Hollies Stand until today.\u201d By this point Australia were four down with England swarming. \u201cAll the cricket I\u2019ve been to, nothing compares to the atmosphere at this. It\u2019s worth it, even though we\u2019re being pumped. I find myself singing along now. It\u2019s fantastic, we\u2019ll always remember it. It\u2019s hostile but it\u2019s not personal or anything.\u201d Soon afterwards, the Australia captain, Tim Paine, hooks Broad to a catch at deep midwicket, right in front of the Hollies. The day before he had brushed off a question about whether the ground was intimidating, saying he could think of about 15 others. The response to his exit could definitely be described as hostile. Amy and her husband, draped in various kangaroos and flags and covered in insignia, landed here by accident too. \u201cGreg\u2019s 50th birthday is coming up and these were the tickets that we got. I had no idea. We were a little intimidated but everyone\u2019s so nice and it\u2019s all in good fun.\u201d Andrew was having a ball, draped in a singlet and XXXX hat that paid homage to his upbringing in Townsville, and attending with his English friend Charlie in similar kit. \u201cWe had a bet from the previous Ashes that whoever wins it, you have to dress in their attire next time. I would have been in a tweed suit, but he\u2019s here in a bluey and board shorts and a pair of double pluggers.\u201d British readers, feel free to Google Translate that. \u201cWe bought eight beach balls off Amazon, we\u2019ve already left half of them go,\u201d said Andrew, who had just covered a St George\u2019s Cross from Polesworth with a boxing kangaroo. \u201cThis is my first Ashes anywhere. I bought tickets in November last year. To be in England, at the Ashes \u2013 oh, mate. I\u2019m coming again tomorrow.\u201d Rohit, an obvious superfan wearing the new Australian one-day kit, picked his tickets deliberately. \u201cIt\u2019s like Bay 13 at the MCG, good atmosphere.

      "bodyText": "Police in New South Wales are told to film people being strip searched, internal documents reveal. Amid growing concern about the increasing and sometimes unauthorised use of strip-search powers by police in the state, documents obtained under freedom of information reveal that officers routinely film searches while they are being conducted. Standard operating procedures for body-worn cameras in NSW state that while an officer conducting a strip search should turn the camera off, \u201cthe support officer is to record the search using a [body-worn video] camera\u201d. While the document states that officers should \u201ctake particular care to ensure the person\u2019s privacy is adequately protected\u201d by ensuring footage cannot be viewed by anyone \u201cwithout a lawful reason to do so\u201d, the searches should still be filmed. \u201cA person\u2019s privacy is not a sufficient reason to cease filming a strip search conducted in the lawful execution of an officer\u2019s duty,\u201d it states. The standard operating procedures \u2013 which govern the way police use the cameras \u2013 were obtained by the Redfern Legal Centre. The centre\u2019s police accountability lawyer, Sam Lee, said there were \u201cenormous privacy considerations\u201d involved that should have been \u201cpublicly explored\u201d before giving police that power. However, there could be some benefits for the subject of a search, particularly in the case where it was conducted unlawfully. \u201cNo doubt there would be members of the public who would be absolutely horrified to know that police are able to use body-worn video to document the humiliating and invasive process of a strip search,\u201d she said. \u201c[However], there will also be members of the public who would benefit from access to such a recording in the event that a strip search may have been conducted unlawfully. \u201cAn alternative could be to only allow the activation of audio to document the reasons for conducting a strip search as well as the conversation carried out during the search.\u201d In a response, a spokesman for the NSW Police said police using body-worn cameras were required to balance access to \u201cthe best possible evidence available\u201d with \u201cthe need for police to ensure the protection of rights and dignity of people with whom they interact\u201d. \u201cStandard operating procedures also ensure resulting footage cannot be seen by people without a lawful right to do so and that there is no unnecessary recording of a person\u2019s private parts,\u201d the spokesman said. Strip searches by police have been under increased scrutiny amid criticism at the lack of clarity about when they can be conducted. Last year the police watchdog, the law enforcement conduct commission, announced it was holding an inquiry into allegations police had abused their strip-search powers. Evidence showed the number conducted by police had doubled. In June the Sydney Morning Herald revealed that an internal report from the force\u2019s lessons learned unit found there was no clear definition of a strip-search in state legislation. The 2018 report found it was left to individual officers to interpret the law, and that police had applied their powers inconsistently at different music festivals. Last month at an inquest into drug-related deaths at music festivals it was revealed that the NSW coroner is pushing for the release of police strip search protocols. \u201cThat issue is something that, in my respectful submission, should be clearly understood by the families of the young people who are involved in the inquest and by the general public at large, under what circumstances are police entitled to strip search patrons who are entering,\u201d counsel assisting the inquest Peggy Dwyer said. The operating procedures for body-worn cameras also state that it is up to the discretion of police to use the technology, something critics say limits their usefulness. The document says officers \u201cshould\u201d be turned on \u201cwhen police would normally use their notebook to record information\u201d, when \u201cperforming a police function\u201d, \u201cwhen the use of force is anticipated\u201d, and a number of other circumstances. However, Lee said that when pursuing police complaint matters she was \u201cregularly informed that no footage exists\u201d. \u201c[The Redfern Legal Centre] believes police discretion to activate [the cameras] should be removed and for there to be robust operational guidelines around activation, tagging, retention and release to promote greater police accountability and transparency,\u201d she said. The \u201crelease and retainment\u201d of footage was \u201chighly weighted towards whether it will be of any assistance to the prosecution\u2019s case\u201d. For example, footage captured by the cameras is deleted after six months unless an officer \u201ctags\u201d it as relevant as evidence or for an investigation. NSW police spent $4m rolling out body-worn cameras in 2015 and 2016. Last year Victoria issued them to police in Melbourne\u2019s north as part of statewide rollout expected to be complete by 2020. The Victorian government and police force said the cameras will function as an accountability tool, and help to \u201cde-escalate violence in interactions between the police and criminals\u201d.",

It was a blessed day, a benediction. I could have been badly injured and I wasn\u2019t. Someone could have nicked off with my wallet. It was returned. The bruises would be epic, I could feel pressure under my skin, and that afternoon, back in my flat in Neuk\u00f6lln, I fell into a deep afternoon sleep that felt dense and knotted with dreams. There was in all this a feeling that something potentially terrible had happened but I had \u2013 for once \u2013 averted catastrophe. # A month later in Sydney. My knee hurts. I\u2019m at the physio and she\u2019s playing with my kneecap, wobbling it around like someone moving a computer\u2019s mouse. \u201cIt\u2019s small,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have a small knee cap.\u201d \u201cOh. That\u2019s good?\u201d I\u2019ve never really given my kneecap much thought. The physio doesn\u2019t answer. \u201cOr is that bad?\u201d I once knew a girl who got an eating disorder because she thought she had fat knees. She ended up losing a lot of weight but her knees stayed the same size. I think about telling the physio this story while she keeps moving my teeny, tiny kneecap and tapping its surface until I let out a yelp. She presses down again \u2013 the bad spot that has been annoying me for weeks since the accident. \u201cYou have a condition known as Handmaid\u2019s knee,\u201d she says. I\u2019ve never heard of this affliction. It sounds \u2026 medieval. \u201cHandmaid\u2019s knee? Like the TV show?\u201d \u201cYou get it if you kneel a lot. In your case, it was the bike accident. You have to avoid kneeling.\u201d A few lame jokes cross my mind \u2013 about being sent to the colonies and injured Under His Eye, jokes about praying and blow jobs and scrubbing floors. I go to buy some frozen peas for the purposes of icing it. As it turns out there\u2019s no such thing as walking away unscathed. \u2022 Brigid Delaney is a Guardian Australia columnist",

The result is the worst of nine auctions using the fund, under which landowners and businesses bid for taxpayers\u2019 support for projects to reduce emissions at lowest cost. The Clean Energy Regulator, the government agency that runs the fund, said the auction marked an important milestone \u201cas the carbon market gears up\u201d. The three contracts it signed will cost $840,000, at an average of $14.17 a tonne of carbon dioxide reduction. Richie Merzian, from progressive thinktank the Australia Institute, said the result \u201clooked like a joke\u201d. \u201cThis is the central mechanism for reducing Australia\u2019s emissions and it purchases a minuscule amount. What\u2019s the point of topping it up with $2bn?\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing the climate solutions fund solved was the government\u2019s re-election. It sure won\u2019t solve Australia\u2019s rising emissions with this miserly effort.\u201d The minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, said across nine auctions the government had signed contracts for 780 projects that would deliver 192m tonnes in cuts over a decade. He suggested the result of the latest auction, held on 24 and 25 July, was affected by Labor promising to abolish the fund if it won power at the election. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labor\u2019s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, said the fund \u201cwas never anything but a fig leaf\u201d. \u201cThis shows Scott Morrison and the Liberals have a disastrous climate change policy,\u201d he said. The Carbon Market Institute, representing businesses holding contracts for 70% of the emissions cuts contracted under the fund, said the auction result highlighted the need to reboot Australia\u2019s climate policies. The institute\u2019s chief executive, John Connor, said it was a \u201csurprisingly small\u201d result even after factoring in uncertainties about the fund\u2019s operation and an expectation that Labor would win the election and change national climate policy. He said the government was trying to improve and expand the fund but it should create a better carbon market by strengthening the \u201csafeguard mechanism\u201d, which was promised to limit emissions from big industry but under which companies have largely been allowed to nominate their own pollution level, leading to increases. In a statement, the Clean Energy Regulator said it had rejected several bids of more than $15 a tonne of emissions reduction as they were not considered \u201cvalue for money in the current environment\u201d. Bret Harper, the director of research at analyst firm RepuTex, said the regulator had faced a choice: to either pay more per tonne of carbon dioxide and make deeper cuts, or to maintain the current price. He said it should have paid more. \u201cThe price point is wrong,\u201d Harper said. \u201cAt this rate they are in danger of having more abatement cancelled [through contracts from earlier auction rounds not being fulfilled] than they are contracting.\u201d Taxpayers have so far paid out $564m and committed another $1.74bn, with $237m of historic funding yet to be spent. In February, Morrison promised an additional $2bn funding over 10 years, but that was stretched to 15 years in the pre-election budget. Just $149m has been allocated over the next four years. A Guardian investigation last year found while projects supported by the fund have merit, particularly those that restore native vegetation, it is difficult to know what taxpayers are getting for their money. Some methodologies paid for cuts that would have happened anyway. Others have had any cuts more than wiped out by increases in pollution allowed elsewhere. The government says it will cut emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2030. The independent Climate Change Authority recommended Australia should make a cut of 45% to 63% over this period. David Parker, the regulator\u2019s chairman, said the agency looked \u201cforward to working closely with participants and industry to explore new and innovative ways to implement the climate solutions fund\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The German utility giant RWE will close its last UK coal plant after the coming winter, leaving only four remaining coal plants powering British homes. RWE will close the Aberthaw B power station in south Wales at the end of March 2020 after half a century generating electricity from coal. The energy company, which runs one of the largest portfolios of gas power plants, said it had been clear for some time that the UK was a challenging market for coal generators. The UK used coal for less than 5% of its electricity last year, and went without coal-generated power altogether for over a week earlier this year, which was the longest coal-free period since the Industrial Revolution. Coal has been driven out of the electricity system due to rising taxes on carbon emissions, and will be banned by the government from 2025 to help the UK meet its climate targets. The shutdown of Aberthaw B comes after SSE said in June it would close the Fiddler\u2019s Ferry coal plant near Warrington in Cheshire by the end of March 2020 because it cannot compete with the economics of gas and renewable energy. EDF Energy said in February that it would shutter the Cottam coal plant in September. The string of shutdowns means that by next spring just four coal plants will remain in the UK: the West Burton A and Ratcliffe-on-Soar plants in Nottinghamshire, Kilroot in Northern Ireland and two generation units at the Drax site in North Yorkshire, which are earmarked for conversion to burn gas. Roger Miesen, the chief executive of RWE\u2019s generation business, said: \u201cThis is a difficult time for everyone at Aberthaw power station. However, market conditions made this decision necessary.\u201d He added the company would complete a consultation process with the 170 people directly employed by the plant in the coming months. The Unite trade union called for an urgent meeting with the company to explain why the plant will close earlier than the expected 2021 shutdown. \u201cThe reasons given for the closure are economic \u2013 the plant has rarely run over the last few months,\u201d said Kelvin Mawer, a regional officer at Unite. \u201cHowever, the decision to close has come a lot earlier than expected.\u201d Tom Glover, RWE\u2019s UK country chair, said: \u201cFor nearly 50 years the plant has played an invaluable role in helping to secure the energy supplies across the UK electricity system and we are very proud of its flexibility and resilience.\u201d The decline of coal in the UK\u2019s energy mix has left space for the growth of renewable energy sources, which generated a third of all electricity used last year. The government\u2019s official annual energy report revealed that low-carbon electricity \u2013 which includes nuclear power and renewables \u2013 was used to generate more than half of the electricity used in the UK for the first time last year. Doug Parr, the chief scientist and policy director at Greenpeace UK, said the shutdown of Aberthaw should encourage more government support for renewables to help meet the UK\u2019s energy needs. Greenpeace has often criticised the government for blocking onshore windfarms from competing for government subsidies against other energy technologies after the Conservative manifesto ruled out more windfarms for England. Parr said ministers should \u201ctake the brakes off wind and solar power, which will be doing all the heavy lifting in the job of getting the UK to a clean power system\u201d.",

Boris Johnson\u2019s blustering openness to no-deal derives from many things.

Partly it derives from the fear that only a decisive break will puncture the threat from the nationalist Brexit party. Partly it follows from the fact that he and many like him do not ultimately care about the Northern Ireland peace process, and are not bothered about the concerns of the devolved nations either.

The most instantly destabilising is the fall in the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies\" title=\"\">value of the pound</a>, which has dropped from $1.26 a month ago to just above $1.20 on Thursday.

      "bodyText": "And with that, the television coverage is brought to a close. No more live pictures. Bah. So that\u2019s how we leave things for the first day. The late-blooming South African Ashleigh Buhai leads the way. Thanks for reading and we hope to see you again tomorrow at 11am for the second round of what already promises to be one hell of a scrap for the final major title of the year. -7: Buhai -6: Shibuno, Kang -5: SH Park, Hull, M Jutanugarn, Khang -4: Lee6, A Jutanugarn, JY Ko Megan Khang curls in a big left-to-right breaker on 14 for birdie. That moves her into a share for fourth at -5. Up on 18, Chun In-gee pars for a 69, while Lizette Salas makes her first bogey of the day after taking an interminable amount of time over a 15-foot putt. Much good it did her. She ends up with a 69 as well. They\u2019re both -3. It looks like Carlota Ciganda will be in contention in yet another major this week. She birdies 16 after whipping a lovely second shot from the trees down the left to 12 feet, then nearly makes another at 17 by going close with a 30-foot putt. Par will do, and she\u2019s -3 with just 18 to traverse. Ewan Murray is our man at Woburn. Here\u2019s his first take on a fine round for Charley Hull, a Woburn member who has responded to the pressure of playing on her home course rather better than a couple of Portrush local heroes did two weeks ago. Chun In-gee\u2019s round is threatening to unravel towards the end. She drops another shot, this time at 17, the result of charging a long birdie putt well past the hole, then prodding with great uncertainty at the one coming back. She\u2019s -2. Meanwhile up on 18, Nelly Korda pars for a 70. At -2, she\u2019s a couple of shots better off than her sister Jessica. But her playing partner Ko trundles in a confident birdie putt, and she\u2019s signing for a 68. That\u2019s a great putt. How on earth did she end up taking four putts on 14?! -7: Buhai (F) -6: Shibuno (F), Kang (F) -5: SH Park (F), Hull (F), M Jutanugarn (F) -4: Lee6 (F), A Jutanugarn (F), JY Ko (F), Salas (17), Pressel (15), Khang (12) Ko Jin-young cracks her second at 18 straight at the flag. If the stick wasn\u2019t in, that would have dropped into the cup after a couple of bounces. But instead it clips off the flag and rolls ten feet past. She\u2019s nearly holed out from the fairway for eagle twice now. Barring that egregious three-putt from two feet at 14, she\u2019s been astonishingly good today. Ko Jin-young\u2019s tee shot into 17 is pin high, but a good 50 feet left of the flag. A pull that she\u2019s none too impressed with. But two putts rescue a par, and she remains at -3. Chun In-gee finds a greenside bunker to the right of 16 and drops her first shot of the day; she\u2019s back to -3. Henderson and Hall both find the 18th green with their second shots. Neither go particularly close, but then both had to draw around some overhanging branches. They both make two-putt pars from distance, and both sign for excellent three-under 69s. Hall looks exceptionally happy, or perhaps relieved, as she\u2019s launched the defence of her title in fine fashion, after a year of distinctly average form. Meanwhile Nelly Korda yips from a couple of feet at 17 and slips back to -2. Chun In-gee already has a couple of majors to her name. She tasted victory at the 2015 US Open and the 2016 Evian Championship, winning the latter with a total of -21, the lowest in any major tournament, women or men. She\u2019s still only 24, but she\u2019s not really featured in the majors since tying for eighth at the 2016 British Open. She might be in the mood to finally compete again, having birdied 3, 4, 10 and now 15. She\u2019s -4. Ariya Jutanugarn makes her birdie at the last. It\u2019s what her second shot deserved. Out in 34, back in 34, and after Jeongeun Lee6 she\u2019s the second player of the day to card 68. She\u2019s -4. But it\u2019s a bogey-bogey finish for Ayako Uehara, a tiddler missed, and that\u2019s a two-under 70. Georgia Hall is alongside Brooke Henderson on the 18th fairway. As she waits for the green up ahead to clear, she may be contemplating the fact that England\u2019s two other big hopes, Charley Hull and Bronte Law, have made it round without making a single bogey. Can she match their feat? Hull signed for a five-under 67, Law a two-under 70. A par for Hall will get her round in a three-under 69. Ko Jin-young sends her second at 16 pin high to 12 feet, but doesn\u2019t quite hit the birdie putt. It dies off to the right and that\u2019s just par. Up on 18, Ariya Jutanugarn swishes her second straight at the flag, and sets up a four-footer for birdie. Meanwhile back on the tee, Brooke Henderson sends a huge hook into the gallery, and gets an outrageous break when her ball smacks some poor bugger on the back and rebounds onto the fairway! Hall makes her par saver! Still no blemishes on her card. She really got out of jail there after a couple of extremely poor shots. But it was a fine putt. She remains at -3. Ko Jin-young makes her birdie putt on 15 to return to -3. And on the par-three 14th, Maria Torres of Puerto Rico, playing in the British Open for the first time, nearly dunks her hybrid straight into the cup! The ball ends up a couple of inches from the flag, and she\u2019ll be tapping in to move to level par. A closing par for Jeongeun Lee6. The US Open champion therefore posts the first 68 of the day. She\u2019s in the clubhouse at -4. Back on 17, trouble for Georgia Hall, who mishits her tee shot into the par-three. She only reaches the fringe, and the flag\u2019s tucked towards the back of a deep green. Out comes the wedge, and it\u2019s another poor shot, landing 20 feet short of the flag and hardly rolling on at all. A first bogey of the day looks likely. A three-putt bogey for Ayako Uehara on 17. The fault of a tee shot sent left and long onto a large green. She\u2019s -3. Going the other way, Nelly Korda, who rolls in a 30-footer on 15 to rise up to -3. And Morgan Pressel, who won her only major to date in 2007, at the Kraft Nabisco (now the ANA Inspiration) when just 18 years old, birdies 12 to move to -4. Ko Jin-young bounced back from her first bogey of the day with a birdie. Now she very nearly bounces back from double-bogey with an eagle! She wedges into 15, her ball landing six feet past the flag and spinning back, lipping out and rolling three feet away. You\u2019d normally say she\u2019s almost certain to make her birdie, but we\u2019ve just seen her take three putts from a similar distance on 14, so nothing\u2019s certain. Brooke Henderson is on it now! She creams her second into 16 straight at the flag. As the ball serenely glides through the air, she smacks her lips in satisfaction. She knows how good it is. The ball lands softly just before the cup, and she\u2019ll be knocking that one in from 18 inches to move to -3. An absolute shocker from the world number one Ko Jin-young at 14! She shoves a two-foot par putt right of the cup at 14. She then tugs the one coming back from similar distance! Two shots frittered away for nothing, and she walks off with double bogey, a look of utter shock across her face. Stunned silence in the gallery. Oh my word. She\u2019s back down to -2. Jeongeun Lee6 knocks her tee shot at 17 to six feet, and it\u2019s her fourth birdie of the day. Megan Khang, who finished tied for eighth at the Evian last week, birdies 9 to hit the turn in 32, following shots picked up at 2, 5 and 7. -7: Buhai (F) -6: Shibuno (F), Kang (F) -5: SH Park (F), Hull (F), Jutanugarn (F) -4: Lee6 (17), Uehara (15), JY Ko (13), Khang (13) Scrub that! Hall gets a big break, her ball snaffled by the thick rough just before the sand. That allows her to whip a gorgeous lob into the air, nearly slam-dunking home for an outrageous birdie. The ball dribbles five feet past, but she makes the putt and par will more than suffice after that miserable wedge in. She remains at -3! Birdie for Brooke Henderson, meanwhile. Her third into 15 wasn\u2019t particularly great, but she guides in a 20-footer to rise to -2. The 2016 PGA champion hasn\u2019t been on it at all today, but she\u2019s battled hard to scramble a couple of pars and suddenly, having fought her way through a tough patch, things are looking a lot rosier. A big error on the par-five 15th by Georgia Hall. She\u2019s wedging in from 50 yards ... and fails to commit to her stroke, the ball slumping weakly into the bunker guarding the front of the green. For the first time today, she allows her head to drop. She\u2019ll need a sandy save to remain at -3. Ayako Uehara has a modest record in the majors. A top-ten finish at the 2017 Evian, another at the 2018 ANA Inspiration, and not much else from the 35-year-old from Japan. She\u2019s missed the cut at the last three majors this season. But this week promises so much more. Birdies at 3, 4, 10, 12 and now 15, with just one bogey at 11, have sent her up the standings to -4. Uehara and Ko Jin-young are the ones to watch out on the course right now. -7: Buhai (F) -6: Shibuno (F), Kang (F) -5: SH Park (F), Hull (F), M Jutanugarn -4: Uehara (15), JY Ko (13) Ko Jin-young rediscovers her mojo in short order! From 157 yards, she arrows her second straight at the flag, her ball rolling softly towards the cup, stopping 18 inches short. Bounce-back birdie\u2019s a-comin\u2019. She\u2019ll rise back to -4. Such a controlled iron in. So close to a sensational eagle. Meanwhile Lizette Salas, who tied for fifth at the PGA this year, continues to go along nicely. Having turned in 33, she\u2019s parred the first three holes of the back nine. The 30-year-old Californian remains at -3. Bronte Law won her first LPGA Tour title back in May, at the Pure Silk Championship in Virginia. That had been coming, because only three weeks earlier she\u2019d lost a play-off for the Mediheal Championship in California. Now the in-form 24-year-old from Stockport is ticking along very nicely, following up birdie at 4 with another at 14. Otherwise it\u2019s been pars. Linnea Strom leaves a straight 15-foot uphill birdie putt short on 18. Par for a 70. The 22-year-old Swede would have been more than happy with that at the start of the day, but having risen as high as -5 at one point, that triple-bogey six at 14 is going to sting. She ends the day at -2. A couple of big putts from a couple of big names. The US Open champion Jeongeun Lee6 rolls in a 25-foot tramliner on 15 to rise to -3. Meanwhile Ariya Jutanugarn, who won the British Open here three years ago, rakes in an absolute monster from the front of the par-three 14th. She\u2019s -3 too. Ko Jin-young\u2019s wedge is seriously misbehaving now. She trundles an overly fierce chip back up the bank and 12 feet past the hole. Trouble for the winner of two majors already this season. And the putt coming back lips out. Her first birdie of the day and she\u2019s -3. Meanwhile Henderson manages to get up and down from the back yet again, this time at 13, even though she left her chip up a good 12 feet short. Determined work by the Canadian. Ko Jin-young\u2019s radar is suddenly all out of whack. After that chunked chip into 11, she now sends a flyer from 80 yards over the back of the green at 12. The ball comes careering back off the bottom of a stand. That\u2019s going to be a tricky up and down. Meanwhile it\u2019s just par for Hall on 13 and the champion remains at -3. Georgia Hall is beginning to enjoy her defence now. A lovely second into 13, a gentle draw, and she\u2019ll have a look at birdie from 15 feet or so. Brooke Henderson is hanging on a bit, though. Having sent a hot one through the back at 12, she made it up and down for par with a little help from a bag of bottles. Now she\u2019s sent another approach through the green, and faces another par scramble. To be fair, her drive was wild as you like, sliced deep into the trees. When she was watching that sail towards the forest, she\u2019d have taken the position she\u2019s in after two strokes. A lucky bounce back towards the fairway saved the day there. Thanks John. Back just in time for Georgia Hall\u2019s third birdie of the day. An approach into 12 knocked to three feet, and in goes the putt. She\u2019s -3. Meanwhile Ko Jin-young regroups after that clumpish chip into 11, lagging up from distance to a couple of feet. She\u2019ll escape with par. By all accounts, her short-game coach films her behaviour on the greens, as opposed to the putting stroke itself. In other words, carry yourself with confidence, it\u2019s half the battle. Note to all amateur golfers: try the putt strut next time you\u2019re out and about. It seems to be working for Ko. She remains at -4. And her playing partner Nelly Korda stays at -2, having spurned a six-footer for birdie. Lydia Ko misses her bogey putt and has to settle for a double. She goes to +3, and that spells danger. If the conditions stay the same there will be problems making the cut at that rate of scoring. The other Ko duffs her approach shot to 12, and while she fashions a smile, that\u2019s an untimely and unlikely mistake. And with that, this duffer steps aside, and the real deal in Scott Murray returns. Salas might have gone to -4 on the ninth but her birdie putt was beaten by the ridges and riddles of this Milton Keynesian surface. She looks a little befuddled by the failure of her downhill effort. Ko\u2019s tee shot on the 11th is true enough, and her second is decent too. Up ahead, near namesake Lydia Ko, of New Zealand, is struggling to land putts and around the greens. Brooke Henderson meanwhile played a shot to the 12th that was overhit, and ran on. She got lucky, in that her ball came off a bag of water bottles. A stroke of luck. The second-best player on the course at the moment is the American Lizette Salas, on -3. Ko looks as though she will drop down to that level after a birdie putt that falls short. But..no, her eye is fully in and that is sunk. Georgia Hall\u2019s putt lays her herself up to make a smooth par. Korda\u2019s knees bend in frustration as her birdie chance goes awry. Georgia Hall\u2019s tee shot on the tenth is healthy enough, driven to the correct position on the right-hand side of the fairway. She can target the pin from there. Ko Jin-young\u2019s is far less secure and lands in the sand. Korda chose to whack hers to the left and lands a far better lie. How does Ko deal with the bunker? She lofts a shot on to the green and it\u2019s safe, but with a considerable distance to the hole. Korda\u2019s is a pearler and it sits solid and close to the hole. A beauty. Hall snaps hers halfway between Ko\u2019s and Korda\u2019s, wity the latter the favourite to take a birdie. Up ahead, Jenny Shin falls short on a birdie putt and signs for 69. BREAKING NEWS: Ko Jin-young is not perfect. She pulls her birdie putt on 9 to the left, and has to settle for par. Still, she\u2019s turning in 32, equalling the best front nine of the day. She remains at -4. Meanwhile Carlota Ciganda has been a constant feature in the majors for a few years now. The 29-year-old from Pamplona tied for fourth at the ANA this year, and finished in the top ten at the Evian last week. Throw in a third-placed spot at last year\u2019s US Open, plus a tie for seventh last year at Lytham, and she\u2019s due a big one. Birdies at 2 and 5 have whisked her up the leaderboard to -2. And with that, I\u2019m off for a quick bite to eat. John Brewin will slip seamlessly into the hotseat. See you again soon! Not sure what fate befell Linnea Strom on the par-three 14th. We didn\u2019t get to see her tee shot. But she must have hoicked it into serious bother, because she\u2019s just run up a triple-bogey six. That\u2019s crashed her all the way back down to -2. But Ko Jin-young keeps on keepin\u2019 on. At the 9th she creams such a fine drive down the middle that she runs out of fairway. It matters little, because she lifts a careful wedge pin high to 12 feet. If she makes the next putt, it\u2019ll be five birdies in a row, and she\u2019ll be turning in 31 strokes. Georgia Hall nearly drains a birdie putt from the fringe at 9. But it\u2019s a kick-in par. She turns in 34. She\u2019s -2. Brooke Henderson fails to hit a birdie effort from 12 feet, and she\u2019s not half as happy as she turns in 35. Meanwhile back at the par-three 8th, Ko Jin-young swings with such grace and timing that you could almost think she\u2019s doing nothing at all. Her ball lands eight feet short of the flag as she twirls her club contentedly. She\u2019ll have that to move to -4. And in it goes! No more than her exquisite tee shot deserved. Four birdies in a row! Meanwhile belated news of Linnea Strom, who having turned in 32 birdied 12. Time to update the leaderboard. -7: Buhai (F) -6: Shibuno (F), Kang (F) -5: SH Park (F), Hull (F), M Jutanugarn (F), Strom (13) -4: JY Ko (8) Watch out, field! Ko Jin-young is on the move. She curls in a huge left-to-right breaker on 7, and the smooth-swinging ANA and Evian champion is already -3. When you\u2019re hot, you\u2019re hot. Meanwhile may I offer many apologies to the exciting Maria Fassi, who fails to get up and down from a swale to the side of the par-three 8th, and drops to +1. I\u2019ll keep quiet next time. Bah. Such a thin line between -2 and +1. The majesty of golf, right there. Maria Fassi came second at the inaugural Augusta Women\u2019s Amateur event this year. She was four shots shy of winner Jennifer Kupcho, but four clear of the rest of the field. The pair were sensational that week in Georgia, and both are now beginning to make their mark on the professional game. Kupcho came second at the Evian last week, and now it\u2019s Fassi\u2019s turn to shine. The 21-year-old Mexican is so unlucky at the par-five 7th. Having been one of the few competitors so far to go for the green in two, she finds herself shortsided behind a bunker, but flops majestically high over the sand and down towards the cup. If there was no flagstick, it was slam-dunking in for eagle. But it hits the pin and twangs out to six feet. So unfortunate, and you know how these things so often go. The birdie putt\u2019s missed, the ball lipping out when it was surely due to drop. She remains at level par. Ashleigh Buhai\u2019s tee shot at 18 leaks a little bit to the right. But from the semi-rough she sends her second to the fringe at the back of the green. She very nearly drains a 35-footer for her eighth birdie of the day, but what looked a great putt goes whistling five feet past. But she nails the one coming back, and that\u2019s a 65 that gives her the new clubhouse lead. According to Laura Davies, who is in the Sky commentary box (yes!), she\u2019s a \u201csolid and steady\u201d performer whose early career was blighted by injury. But now she\u2019s finally delivering on her teenage promise. A sensational round of golf by the 30-year-old from Johannesburg. -7: Buhai (F) -6: Shibuno (F), Kang (F) -5: SH Park (F), Hull (F), M Jutanugarn (F), Strom (12) When a bounce goes your way, you\u2019ve got to take advantage of the break. And on 7, Georgia Hall does exactly that, sending her third to 15 feet and making the birdie putt. She\u2019s -2. Birdie too for her partner Brooke Henderson, who returns to -1. And both of them are now on the dancefloor at the par-three 8th. Back-to-back birdies for the new world number one! Ko Jin-young comes off the back of picking up a shot at 5 by caressing an iron to six feet at the par-three 6th. The ANA and Evian champ is -2. She\u2019s going round with Nelly Korda, who finished in a tie for third at the PGA a couple of months ago. She birdies 6 as well, following the stroke she\u2019d picked up at 2. And to tie up a loose end from earlier: PGA champion Hannah Green finished with a highly average 73. A huge break for the reigning champ on the par-five 7th. Hall flays her drive into trees down the right, and smacks into one of the big trunks. But a lucky bounce sends her ball into a clearing in the thicket, and she\u2019s able to whip a wedge over some smaller trees and back onto the fairway. That should keep her going. It\u2019s not been a great year for Hall, though: just the one top-ten finish in 15 starts, her best showing in the majors a tie for 26th at the PGA. A couple of wild tee shots today that confirm she\u2019s not quite at the top of her form. But if she can get round today with a score - and conditions are favourable - it could light a fire for the rest of the week. We have a new leader! Ashleigh Buhai makes it three birdies in a row, the latest coming at 16. The 30-year-old South African has done absolutely nothing in the majors: a tie for 27th at the US Open two years ago, a tie for 30th at this event, also in 2017. Until now, that is. Buhai has won the South African Open three times, mind you. Throw in wins on the European Tour at the Catalonia Masters in 2007 and the Portugal Open in 2011; she\u2019s a big star back home. But this is an announcement on the world stage. Par on 17 keeps it going. -7: Buhai (17) -6: Shibuno (F), Kang (F) -5: SH Park (F), Hull (F), M Jutanugarn (F) -4: Strom (10) Hall\u2019s tee shot at the par-three 6th is straight at the flag. About 12 feet short. One that looks just fine to the lay-hacker, but the defending champ looks disgusted with herself. The birdie putt stays high on the left, a slight misread. But it\u2019s a par that keeps her at -1. Her partner Brooke Henderson sends her tee shot long, then fluffs a chip from the thick stuff she\u2019s sent her ball into. She can\u2019t scramble par from the fringe, and that slips the Canadian back to level par. The US Open champion Jeongeun Lee6 missed the cut last week at the Evian. It looks as though the extra rest over the weekend has done her some good. Birdies at 2 and 4, and she\u2019s -2. And Ashleigh Buhai has certainly recovered her poise: another birdie, this time at 15, and she joins the clubhouse leaders Hinako Shibuno and Danielle Kang at -6! -6: Shibuno (F), Kang (F), Buhai (15) -5: SH Park (F), Hull (F), M Jutanugarn (F) -4: Strom (9) The 2016 PGA champion Brooke Henderson has started steadily. She\u2019s -1 through the first five holes, having birdied 2. Meanwhile for the second time today, her playing partner Georgia Hall leaves a birdie putt one turn short. She\u2019s -1 too, but it could be so much better defending champion. And a second birdie for the pre-tournament favourite Ariya Jutanugarn; having picked up a shot at 2, she now rattles in a 20-footer across 6. She\u2019s -2. Caroline Masson is in with a 69. Pars all the way back home, and the 30-year-old German, who finished in a tie for third in this event a couple of years ago, looks pretty content with that. Almost as happy as these folk popping the lids on their Californian carafes. It\u2019s a careful two-putt par for Hall. She looks a little disappointed, having left a fairly straight 25-foot birdie putt from the fringe a good three feet short. But she tidies up, and would surely have taken par when watching her tee shot sail towards the trees. Meanwhile the 22-year-old Swede Linnea Strom, a LPGA Tour rookie this season, is out in 32, having just birdied 9. She\u2019s -4. Georgia Hall is in a little spot of bother down the left of 4, having whistled her drive into the trees. No matter! Even though her backswing is slightly impeded, she whip-cracks a low iron out under the branches, drawing the ball into the heart of the green. That\u2019s a sublime escape, and though her ball scampers past the hole and settles on the fringe at the back, she allows herself a little grin anyway. A perfectly planned and near-on-perfectly executed shot, and it\u2019ll have felt good. From a position of trouble, par now looks likely. Meanwhile birdie at 14 for Ashleigh Buhai, who has indeed rediscovered the forward momentum of earlier. She joins the group in second spot at -5. A real comedown for Jennifer Kupcho, whose 66 lit up the rainy final day at the Evian. The inaugural Augusta champ stumbled to a 77, four days after that coming-of-age second place. All part of the learning curve for the 22-year-old from Colorado. A miserable 77 for Mel Reid, who came so close at the PGA a couple of months ago with a final day 66. Reid came into this week as a dark horse, her big-hitting style perfect for Woburn. But she\u2019s got work to do now to avoid the cut. Meanwhile Moriya Jutanugarn pars the last and signs for a 67. The top of the leaderboard looks locked down for a while, until some of the later starters make a run anyway. Or perhaps Ashleigh Buhai will get going again. -6: Shibuno (F), Kang (F) -5: SH Park (F), Hull (F), Jutanugarn (F) -4: Buhai (13) Par for Danielle Kang up the last, and she joins Hinako Shibuno in the clubhouse lead. A 66, and she\u2019s -6. A disappointing day for seven-time major winner Inbee Park, who never quite got going in the last round at the Evian, and has shot 75 today. Shanshan Feng had performed much better at the business end of the Evian, but it\u2019s a 75 for her as well. They\u2019re both +3. That\u2019s Feng\u2019s first card over 69 in her last nine rounds. The run had to end sometime. The defending champ Georgia Hall makes up for that oh-so-close birdie effort on 1, with a garden-variety birdie at the accommodating par-five 2nd. That\u2019ll settle the nerves that are bound to be jangling away right now. Meanwhile a closing bogey for Lexi Thompson, who walks off the green with her shoulders slumped. A one-under 71. The 2017 British Open provided one of golf\u2019s great feelgood moments, as IK Kim finally broke her major duck at Kingsbarns. Few begrudged her victory, as it was Kim who suffered perhaps golf\u2019s most infamous yip, missing from 12 inches when the 2012 ANA Inspiration was hers for the taking. The ANA caused her some more grief this year when, in contention on the final day, she sent a drive into trees, the ball snagging and refusing to drop back down. A double-bogey seven, a right old karmic outrage. She ended tied for fourth. Anyway, she\u2019s looking good for some better fortune this week, opening with a 69. She\u2019s -3. Georgia Hall begins her title defence with a bir ... argh. She was this close. A perfect opening drive, a second shot to 15 feet, then a putt that looked to be dropping before it died to the left on the final turn. A couple of blades of grass away from the dream start. Meanwhile up on 17, Danielle Kang\u2019s hot streak continues with yet another birdie, as she swishes her tee shot at 17 to six feet and joins Hinako Shibuno at the top. Birdie for Moriya Jutanugarn, thanks to a trundle from 30 feet across 16. And a dropped shot for Ashleigh Buhai, at 11, the first blemish on her card today. -6: Shibuno (F), Kang (17) -5: SH Park (F), Hull (F), M Jutanugarn (16) -4: Buhai (11) Back-to-back birdies for Danielle Kang. She follows her kick-in birdie at 15 by teasing the gallery with a right-to-left 20-foot curler on 16. Her ball threatens to stop one dimple short of the cup, but topples in eventually. She\u2019s just a shot off the lead. As is Ashleigh Buhai, the 30-year-old from Johannesburg who has done very little in the majors to date: her best performance is a tie for 30th in this event two years ago. But she\u2019s birdied 2, 3, 6, 7 and now 10. And then there\u2019s Charley Hull, who nails a 20-footer on the last and signs for an excellent opening-day 67! -6: Shibuno (F) -5: SH Park (F), Hall (F), Kang (16), Buhai (10) -4: M Jutanugarn (15) What a major debut for Hinako Shibuno! The young Japanese sensation - I think we\u2019re already allowed to call her that - sends her second at 18 to 12 feet, then curls in a right-to-left putt for her seventh birdie in 11 holes! She comes back in 30 strokes, signs for a 66, and now at -6 leads the British Open after her first round in major-championship golf. Wow. You\u2019ll not see a broader grin all week ... unless she goes on to win this, of course. And don\u2019t put it past the 20-year-old, either. One of the two titles she\u2019s already secured at home is the Salonpas Cup, one of the four major titles in the LPGA of Japan Tour. So she\u2019s already racked up some valuable experience when the pressure is on. Danielle Kang is about to move to -4. The 26-year-old from San Francisco sends a wedge over the flag at the par-five 15th to 12 inches. The 2017 PGA champion has enjoyed a curious year in the majors: a couple of top-six finishes, plus two missed cuts, in a pleasing alternate pattern. If that continues, she\u2019ll be challenging come the business end of this tournament. Meanwhile it\u2019s back-to-back birdies for Lexi Thompson, at 15 and 16. The putter seems to work a lot better from distance, it\u2019s the tiddlers that mess with her mind. She\u2019s -2, and allows herself a smile for the first time in a difficult week for her. Hinako Shibuno grabs a share of the lead on her major championship debut! The 20-year-old Japanese prodigy has been talked up by those in the know back at home, having already won twice this year on her home tour. She\u2019s been ripping it up since the turn: birdies at 10, 11, 12 and 15, and now a wonderful iron smoothly sent towards the flag at the par-three 17th. It stops three feet short, and in goes the birdie putt that takes her to the top of the tree. How\u2019s that for your first ever round in a major?! -5: SH Park (F), Shibuno (17) -4: Hull (16), M Jutanugarn (14) Ariya Jutanugarn is the joint favourite to win this week, along with the reigning ANA and Evian champion Ko Jin-young. She\u2019s already won the British Open here at Woburn, back in 2016. She\u2019s not out yet, but her older sister Moriya is keeping up appearances for the family. Back-to-back birdies at 13 and 14, to follow front-nine birdies at 2 and 4, whizz her up the standings to -4. Both the Jutanugarns are in hot form, Ariya finishing fifth at the Evian last week, Moriya a shot behind in sixth. What a story it would be if Thailand\u2019s second major champion came from the same family, in the same championship, on the same course. Only in sport, huh. Park Sung-hyun is in with a 67. She\u2019d sent her approach to 18 pin high, ten feet from the flag, but her putter slipped back into Evian Mode and she had to settle for par. But that\u2019s a magnificent response to that hugely disappointing 75 on Sunday at the Evian, when she couldn\u2019t find a fairway or make a putt. A blistering return to form, to borrow a phrase from will-this-do music journalism. Laura Davies is playing in her 39th consecutive British Open. There was a dream start for the Dame this morning, as she birdied 2. But since then it\u2019s been a miserable day for the four-time major-winning veteran. Seven bogeys and two doubles, and she walks off the 18th in a grim mood, having shot 82. Davies won the British in 1986, but never after it was upgraded to a major, her best performance coming at Sunningdale back in 2004, when compatriot Karen Stupples took the prize while Davies tied for eighth. She\u2019s +10, and most likely will be missing the cut. I do hope she\u2019s in the commentary box over the weekend. She was magnificent at the Open a couple of weeks ago, explaining the shots on option in an easy-going and informative manner, wearing her expertise lightly. Also at one point she took a righteous sideswipe at the advent of VAR in football, calling it out as the pointless fiasco it most certainly is. Preach on, sister. But what of Border Control\u2019s Lexi Thompson? She\u2019s level par through 14, having just missed a par putt from two feet. Thompson is sensational from tee to green, but misses so many short putts. A new grip this week, but it\u2019s making little difference. She should have more than just the one major to her name, but the 2014 ANA Inspiration is all she\u2019s got. Park fails to hit her birdie putt on 16, the ball dying to the left. A great chance to pull two clear at the top spurned. She stays at -5. Meanwhile Hinako Shibuno, who has already won twice on the Japanese tour this season, birdies 15 to join Charley Hull in second place at -4. And Jennifer Kupcho, the brilliant young American who won this years inaugural Augusta Women\u2019s Amateur, and having since turned pro came second in last week\u2019s Evian, drains a monster across 13 for birdie. That must have been the best part of 80 feet! Sadly she\u2019s been struggling today, perhaps understandably so after such a huge effort on Sunday in shooting 66. And the birdie only takes her back to +3. But Kupcho has game. She\u2019s a really exciting player to watch. Park Sung-hyun steps on the gas again. She rolls in a straight 30-foot birdie putt on the par-five 15th, then sends her second at the 16th pin high to eight feet. She\u2019s -5, and will have that to take a two-shot lead. It\u2019s been a relatively disappointing year in the majors for Park, the 2017 US Open and 2018 PGA winner. She nearly snatched the PGA from under the nose of Hannah Green, and was in the mix at the Evian before fading very badly indeed in the final round, driving and putting extremely erratically. But it would seem she\u2019s shrugged off that disappointment quicksmart. -5: SH Park (15) -4: Hull (14) -3: IK Kim (17), Shibuno (14), Kang (12), Masson (9), Buhai (7), Lopez (7) Hull is out in a superstar threeball this morning. She\u2019s playing alongside the reigning PGA champion Hannah Green, who secured her first major at Hazeltine in June by holding off a charge from Park Sung-hyun, and Shanshan Feng, the 2012 PGA winner. Feng came into this tournament in hot form, having finished in a tie for second last week at the Evian, and won the Thornberry Creek Classic in her previous outing. Her last eight rounds of tournament golf: 64, 67, 65, 63, 69, 66, 68, 68. That run could come to an end today, sadly. She\u2019s +2, having just pulled a par tiddler left at the par-three 14th. Green also three putts the hole to bogey. It\u2019s her first bogey of the day ... but she\u2019s had two doubles as well. And five birdies! So she\u2019s level par. The dictionary definition of a rollercoaster ride, right there. And it\u2019s already bubbling up nicely at Woburn! Park Sung-hyun, deposed last Sunday as world number one by ANA Inspiration and Evian champion Ko Jin-young, has responded in the fashion you\u2019d expect. Out in 32 this morning, she also birdied 10 to take the early lead at -5. But she\u2019s since dropped a stroke at 11. And now she\u2019s been joined at the top by Charley Hull, who had been long tipped as the woman most likely to end England\u2019s wait for a major, since Karen Stupples won this tournament in 2004, only for Georgia Hall to beat her to it last year. Out in a relatively quiet 35, the 23-year-old from Kettering has exploded since the turn, with birdies at 10, 11 and 12. -4: Park Sung-hyun (14), Charley Hull (12) -3: Kim In-kyung (15), Hinako Shibuno (13), Danielle Kang (11), Caroline Masson (7), Gaby Lopez (6) Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live hole-by-hole coverage of the 2019 Women\u2019s British Open from Woburn. It\u2019s the fifth and last major of the year, coming a whopping four days after the dramatic conclusion of the fourth, the Evian Championship in France. Georgia Hall, on her home course, will defend a title won last year in swashbuckling fashion, pipping Pornanong Phatlum in a head-to-head battle with some heat-seeking approaches over the closing stretch at Lytham.

      "body": "<p>Relief, however profound, can be quickly replaced by complacency. It is hard to remember how omnipresent the fear of nuclear war once was. Most teenagers <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK219180/\" title=\"\">surveyed in the UK and US</a> in the early 1980s thought they were likely to see a nuclear war, and a third of American high school seniors agreed with the statement that \u201cnuclear or biological annihilation will probably be the fate of all mankind in my lifetime\u201d. The threat of Armageddon suffused even pop songs. The television dramas Threads and The Day After terrified British and American audiences with their depiction of nuclear strikes and the aftermath.</p> <p>Even Ronald Reagan privately confessed that he was \u201cvery depressed\u201d by the latter film and one biographer <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/ronald-reagans-disarmament-dream/422244/\" title=\"\">suggested</a> it played a small part in shaping the US president\u2019s pursuit of arms control deals. In 1987, he and Mikhail Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The cruise missiles <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/01/death-of-the-treaty-that-removed-missiles-from-greenham-common\" title=\"\">were removed</a> from western Europe, including Greenham Common.</p> <p>Yet on Friday this key plank of arms control <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/01/inf-treaty-us-russia-arms-control-to-end\" title=\"\">is due to fall</a>. The US announced in January that it would pull out, due to Russian breaches. One danger is that the US could decide to deploy previously banned missiles to Europe \u2013 and that Russia would respond. The bigger danger is that the remaining plank will soon be jettisoned too: New Start, which limits the number of strategic warheads held by the US and Russia, expires in 2021. It could be extended by another five years, but the national security adviser John Bolton, who despises any constraints on the US, has already said that is unlikely. His boss has suggested that the US and Russia could end up with a new deal drawing in China. That looks unlikelier still: while China has invested huge sums in upgrading its military, its stockpile of warheads is a fraction of the size of Washington or Moscow\u2019s.</p> <p>Some think Mr Trump might override Mr Bolton if Russia, which would like to extend the treaty, offers token amendments, allowing him to claim that he improved on his predecessor\u2019s deal (which replaced an earlier treaty). Others look to Congress. On Wednesday,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/01/us-senate-pushes-trump-to-safeguard-last-russian-nuclear-arms-control-treaty\" title=\"\"> bipartisan Senate legislation</a> was introduced, calling for the extension of New Start unless the administration provides clear evidence of Russian breaches justifying its expiry, or a new agreement is signed. Adam Smith, the Democrat chair of the House armed services committee, is proving a compelling opponent of unrestrained nuclear spending: without treaties, the only controls are financial.</p> <p>It is true that <a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/NewSTART\" title=\"\">New Start</a> is limited and born of another era: it controls only nuclear weaponry and covers only two countries, albeit those with over 90% of the nuclear stockpile. This is an age of nuclear proliferation (the US approved exports of nuclear technology <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/04/trump-saudi-arabia-nuclear-jamal-khashoggi-murder\" title=\"\">to Saudi Arabia</a> late last year; North Korea has been busy testing missiles this week). There is a growing threat from cyberweapons and other new technologies.</p> <p>But many experts <a href=\"https://www.russiamatters.org/analysis/expert-survey-nuclear-arms-control-dead-or-can-new-principles-guide-it\" title=\"\">fear</a> that without it, a new arms race is inevitable. Even if the loss of transparency and predictability \u2013 due to an end to verification \u2013 might be a bigger issue than proliferation in the short term, that in time would be likely to lead to the growth of armouries. The best-case scenario might be an eventual return to some form of arms control agreements \u2013 after time has been lost, money squandered and risks have grown exponentially. The ideal, of a comprehensive multilateral deal, is not currently on offer, and a separate nuclear deal still makes sense. And it is hard to see why others should sign up when the two biggest players are reneging on or trashing existing agreements. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Relief, however profound, can be quickly replaced by complacency. It is hard to remember how omnipresent the fear of nuclear war once was. Most teenagers surveyed in the UK and US in the early 1980s thought they were likely to see a nuclear war, and a third of American high school seniors agreed with the statement that \u201cnuclear or biological annihilation will probably be the fate of all mankind in my lifetime\u201d. The threat of Armageddon suffused even pop songs. The television dramas Threads and The Day After terrified British and American audiences with their depiction of nuclear strikes and the aftermath. Even Ronald Reagan privately confessed that he was \u201cvery depressed\u201d by the latter film and one biographer suggested it played a small part in shaping the US president\u2019s pursuit of arms control deals. In 1987, he and Mikhail Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The cruise missiles were removed from western Europe, including Greenham Common. Yet on Friday this key plank of arms control is due to fall. The US announced in January that it would pull out, due to Russian breaches. One danger is that the US could decide to deploy previously banned missiles to Europe \u2013 and that Russia would respond. The bigger danger is that the remaining plank will soon be jettisoned too: New Start, which limits the number of strategic warheads held by the US and Russia, expires in 2021. It could be extended by another five years, but the national security adviser John Bolton, who despises any constraints on the US, has already said that is unlikely. His boss has suggested that the US and Russia could end up with a new deal drawing in China. That looks unlikelier still: while China has invested huge sums in upgrading its military, its stockpile of warheads is a fraction of the size of Washington or Moscow\u2019s. Some think Mr Trump might override Mr Bolton if Russia, which would like to extend the treaty, offers token amendments, allowing him to claim that he improved on his predecessor\u2019s deal (which replaced an earlier treaty). Others look to Congress. On Wednesday, bipartisan Senate legislation was introduced, calling for the extension of New Start unless the administration provides clear evidence of Russian breaches justifying its expiry, or a new agreement is signed. Adam Smith, the Democrat chair of the House armed services committee, is proving a compelling opponent of unrestrained nuclear spending: without treaties, the only controls are financial. It is true that New Start is limited and born of another era: it controls only nuclear weaponry and covers only two countries, albeit those with over 90% of the nuclear stockpile. This is an age of nuclear proliferation (the US approved exports of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia late last year; North Korea has been busy testing missiles this week). There is a growing threat from cyberweapons and other new technologies. But many experts fear that without it, a new arms race is inevitable. Even if the loss of transparency and predictability \u2013 due to an end to verification \u2013 might be a bigger issue than proliferation in the short term, that in time would be likely to lead to the growth of armouries. The best-case scenario might be an eventual return to some form of arms control agreements \u2013 after time has been lost, money squandered and risks have grown exponentially. The ideal, of a comprehensive multilateral deal, is not currently on offer, and a separate nuclear deal still makes sense. And it is hard to see why others should sign up when the two biggest players are reneging on or trashing existing agreements.",

The situation in the gulf is complex, fast-moving and hugely dangerous. Johnson did not cover himself in glory as foreign secretary, especially over Iran. It will be his task to prove he has learned.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Managing parliament and Tory MPs</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Johnson will start as PM with a working Commons majority of four, thanks to the DUP, but within weeks it is likely to be down to three if as expected the Liberal Democrats win in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection. If this wasn\u2019t tricky enough, a small but significant section of Tory MPs openly detest Johnson, and will not want to help him out - and with his cabinet sackings, the \u2018Gaukward squad\u2019 of former senior cabinet members set on blocking a no-deal Brexit swelled in ranks.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Loosening the purse strings</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Such was the fiscal largesse on display from both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt during the hustings process that much as he will seek to kick any decisions towards an autumn budget, voters \u2013 especially Tory members \u2013 will be expecting both tax cuts and more spending on areas such as education and the police.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Everything non-Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This might sound glib, but there is a lot to consider \u2013 during the three-plus years of Brexit introversion May\u2019s government failed to properly grasp any of a series of long-term, pressing national problems: the crisis in social care; the future of the NHS; a climate emergency; the increasingly insecure future of work; a broken housing market; rampant poverty, including among many working people. This is a huge workload for any new administration.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Being prime ministerial</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Critics might say this is Johnson\u2019s single biggest challenge.

Johnson has a tendency to ignore advice, pluck statistics out of the air and rely on sudden, cheap glibness. Curbing these long habits will be a daily struggle - his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jul/24/meet-the-new-dude-at-no-10-papers-greet-boris-johnsons-victory\">adopting the acronym 'Dude' in his victory speech</a> shows just how hard it is for him.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterwalker\"><b>Peter Walker</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Political correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The more positive noises from Davidson\u2019s camp, after their meeting on Monday, suggest the pair have struck an uneasy accord.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson pledged his commitment to the \u201cawesome foursome\u201d of the UK when he was elected Conservative leader, and has since embarked on a whistlestop tour taking in the north of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But how successful were the trips? Visits that involved keeping the prime minister away from booing protesters and, in some cases, journalists? Have they allayed fears that Johnson\u2019s hardline Brexit strategy and the continuation of the union could be mutually exclusive? Scotland Johnson\u2019s visit to Scotland began behind the razor wire at Faslane nuclear base, at Gare Loch, less than 30 miles from Glasgow. Downing Street may have been hoping that a photo op on a submarine would project strength and solidarity, but that was unlikely to chime with the 50% of Scots who, along with the Scottish government, oppose the renewal of Trident. During the Tory leadership campaign, a Panelbase poll found support for independence would jump to 53% if Johnson became prime minister, prompting senior Scottish Tories to warn his election would be a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d for the union. On the eve of Johnson\u2019s visit, the Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, issued a defiant challenge to him, pledging to oppose a no-deal Brexit. She was said to be livid that he had ignored her advice in sacking her ally David Mundell, who was the Scottish secretary. The more positive noises from Davidson\u2019s camp, after their meeting on Monday, suggest the pair have struck an uneasy accord. But Davidson has built her Conservative revival in Scotland upon her fierce defence of the union. How does she sell Johnson and his \u201cwar cabinet\u201d to those centrist voters who signed up to her more liberal reframing of the Scottish Tories? Johnson is still causing tensions within the Scottish party, with Davidson\u2019s previous leadership rival, Murdo Fraser, floating the idea on Wednesday of a breakaway Scottish Conservative party as the only way to beat the nationalists at Holyrood. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said she had enjoyed a \u201clively\u201d exchange of views with the prime minister when they met later on Monday at Bute House. But the optics of the visit were far from ideal: Johnson greeted by booing protesters, leaving by the back door, and the much-shared clip of Sturgeon instinctively batting away his hand as he attempted to usher her into her own residence. In 2016, 62% of Scottish voters chose to remain in the EU, and that percentage has grown since. No polling on support for Scottish independence since Johnson became prime minister has been released yet, but it is fair to assume that Scottish National party strategists are waiting eagerly to discover whether support for independence reveals a Boris bounce. LB Wales The prime minister\u2019s visit to Wales on Tuesday did not go well. He was accused of keeping a distance from the Welsh media and avoiding the public, leaving more than 100 people waiting vainly in the rain for him in Brecon town centre. All of which plays into the hands of the Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru. Asked if Johnson might break up the union, the Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts said: \u201cHe seems to be doing his best.\u201d Saville Roberts said there was a sense of momentum in Wales regarding the idea of leaving the union. \u201cI\u2019ve never known anything like it,\u201d she said.

Just a few more choruses of Rule Britannia and an extra supply of union jacks is not going to cut it.\u201d SM Northern Ireland The trip to Belfast on Wednesday was sold as the fourth leg of Johnson\u2019s tour to strengthen the ties of the union, but in Northern Ireland it was always going to be largely about the Democratic Unionist party. The DUP had a slavishly good relationship with Theresa May following their confidence and supply deal with the Conservatives in 2017. But they were never on the same page in relation to the solution to the Irish border question and the threat to the union they felt her Brexit plans caused. Johnson reversed that at a stroke within hours of succeeding May with his demand for the abolition of the backstop as a pre-condition to new negotiations with the EU. In doing that he turbo-charged the relationship with the DUP, with an agreement that delivers the 10 DUP votes the Tory party needs for its wafer-thin majority expected to be officially renewed in the coming weeks. The appointment of the former chief whip Julian Smith as the new Northern Ireland secretary, with whom the DUP has had almost a daily relationship, should also help keep the party on-side. After Johnson\u2019s private dinner in Belfast with key DUP MPs including Nigel Dodds and Jeffrey Donaldson, the party\u2019s leader, Arlene Foster, made it clear there was a meeting of minds with the new prime minister. Out was May\u2019s hallmark caution and in was a united aim in seeing off the EU. She told how she and Johnson had discussed how a \u201cvery belligerent EU\u201d wanted to \u201cbreak up the United Kingdom\u201d. Foster and the DUP were already smarting over remarks made on Friday by the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar; and they were delighted to have, in Johnson, a less emollient prime minister in town to fight their corner.

She said a no-deal Brexit would ultimately trigger a referendum on a united Ireland and accused Johnson of being the DUP\u2019s \u201cgofer\u201d. Johnson batted away suggestions of a border poll, saying it was not something he was entertaining and declared he would \u201cnever be neutral\u201d on keeping the UK together. For the DUP the union with Johnson is the one to nurture right now, in its goal of keeping the UK together post-Brexit. The risk on the horizon for Foster is a general election, which could end her party\u2019s lynchpin role in Westminster. LOC",

      "body": "<p>You\u2019re running late, you need to pee, but arriving at the toilet turnstiles, you realise that the lack of a shiny 50p piece prevents you from carrying out a basic bodily function. You join the cash machine queue, staring daggers at the guy who is in no rush to find his bank card. With a \u00a310 note finally in the palm of your hand, you join another queue \u2013 to buy a KitKat, a Mars bar, whatever. After minutes of this palaver, you\u2019re through the barrier, finally able to find relief. Annoying, sure: but what if you were a pensioner or disabled, and caught short? According to a report by the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) \u2013 appropriately titled <a href=\"https://www.rsph.org.uk/our-work/policy/healthy-places/taking-the-p.html\" title=\"\">Taking the P***</a> \u2013 a fifth of Britons don\u2019t leave their home as often as they\u2019d like because they know they\u2019ll struggle to find facilities, a phenomenon known as \u201cloo leash\u201d. For those with medical conditions, this affects more than four in 10. Ever found yourself deliberately not drinking in case you get caught short? Over half the public intentionally dehydrate themselves for fear of not finding a loo, according to the report.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>By next year, 60% of government funding for local authority services will have vanished compared with 2010</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The people must take to the urinals, conveniences and the cubicles, or what remains of them, because the right to pee is under threat. The decline of the public toilet \u2013 leaving us creeping into pubs and hoping to avoid the disapproving glare of the bartender \u2013 is just one symptom of the assault on the public realm. By next year, 60% of government funding for local authority services will have <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/council-leaders-spending-budgets_uk_5c503229e4b0f43e410acaa1\" title=\"\">vanished compared </a><a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/council-leaders-spending-budgets_uk_5c503229e4b0f43e410acaa1\" title=\"\">with 2010</a>. Toilets are not statutory services \u2013 that is, councils are not legally obliged to provide them \u2013 and so hundreds have been axed. The <a href=\"http://www.btaloos.co.uk/\" title=\"\">British Toilet Association</a> tells me that up to half of public loos may have been closed over the last decade. In Cornwall, the council has stopped maintaining <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45009337\" title=\"\">94%</a> of its toilets. Three in four Britons polled think there are not enough facilities within their communities. But why should we be resigned to this, legs firmly crossed, as a fact of life? Why is removing waste from our doorsteps regarded as an essential, universal service, but allowing us to remove waste from our bodies is not?</p> <p>The public realm has been subordinated to the whims of the market and profit for over a generation, and toilets are no exception. You\u2019ll often need to spend considerably more than a penny to have a pee. While Network Rail thankfully <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/toilet-charges-railway-stations-kings-cross-liverpool-street-a8847876.html\" title=\"\">scrapped</a> toilet charges in busy stations such as King\u2019s Cross and Edinburgh Waverley earlier this year, they remain in place \u2013 or are <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-33848414\" title=\"\">expanding</a> \u2013 in parks, stations and public squares across the country.

What should sufferers of Crohn\u2019s disease or irritable bowel syndrome do? Up to 43% of people have conditions requiring the <a href=\"https://www.rsph.org.uk/about-us/news/taking-the-p-the-decline-of-the-great-british-public-toilet.html\" title=\"\">frequent use</a> of a toilet. Do the 3.4 million over-65s who experience <a href=\"https://www.ageuk.org.uk/globalassets/age-uk/documents/information-guides/ageukig15_managing_incontinence.inf.pdf\" title=\"\">urinary incontinence</a> not have the right to take part in their community, or to travel the country with ease? What of heavily pregnant women being <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/pregnant-woman-desperate-use-toilet-6417020\" title=\"\">turned away</a> from cafe toilets because they\u2019re not customers? With public urination treated as a potential public order offence, why leave many with no option but to break the law? And, as Toby Green, policy executive at the RSPH tells me: \u201cAt a time when we\u2019re seeing obesity levels rising and we\u2019re trying to encourage physical activity, and we\u2019re trying to row back on social isolation among vulnerable elderly people, seeing fewer and fewer toilets encouraging people to go outside and relate to their environments flies in the face of all that.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a gendered element too: women are resigned to regularly queueing for a toilet in a way that men \u2013 for whom an excursion to a urinal can take just seconds \u2013 aren\u2019t. While, as the RSPH notes, \u201cpotty parity\u201d legislation in North America has stated that a fair ratio for toilet facilities would be at least 2:1 in favour of women, the British standard is a mere 1:1. Twenty-first-century toilet provision must cater for gender-neutral spaces and ensure that the rights of trans people are protected too.</p> <p>What to do about the national toilet scandal? Here is another reason why cuts to local authorities must be reversed in their entirety, and toilets made a statutory service. The \u201cbladder tax\u201d should be ended: it should be made illegal to charge people to exercise basic bodily functions. Perhaps councils could enforce a rule for all high-street businesses: no one who needs to go should be turned away. For a nation supposedly obsessed with toilet humour, we are remarkably embarrassed talking about our national loo scandal. But the privatisers of public space have taken the piss for too long, and the great toilet fightback should start here.</p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "You\u2019re running late, you need to pee, but arriving at the toilet turnstiles, you realise that the lack of a shiny 50p piece prevents you from carrying out a basic bodily function. You join the cash machine queue, staring daggers at the guy who is in no rush to find his bank card. With a \u00a310 note finally in the palm of your hand, you join another queue \u2013 to buy a KitKat, a Mars bar, whatever. After minutes of this palaver, you\u2019re through the barrier, finally able to find relief. Annoying, sure: but what if you were a pensioner or disabled, and caught short? According to a report by the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) \u2013 appropriately titled Taking the P*** \u2013 a fifth of Britons don\u2019t leave their home as often as they\u2019d like because they know they\u2019ll struggle to find facilities, a phenomenon known as \u201cloo leash\u201d. For those with medical conditions, this affects more than four in 10. Ever found yourself deliberately not drinking in case you get caught short? Over half the public intentionally dehydrate themselves for fear of not finding a loo, according to the report. The people must take to the urinals, conveniences and the cubicles, or what remains of them, because the right to pee is under threat. The decline of the public toilet \u2013 leaving us creeping into pubs and hoping to avoid the disapproving glare of the bartender \u2013 is just one symptom of the assault on the public realm. By next year, 60% of government funding for local authority services will have vanished compared with 2010. Toilets are not statutory services \u2013 that is, councils are not legally obliged to provide them \u2013 and so hundreds have been axed. The British Toilet Association tells me that up to half of public loos may have been closed over the last decade. In Cornwall, the council has stopped maintaining 94% of its toilets. Three in four Britons polled think there are not enough facilities within their communities. But why should we be resigned to this, legs firmly crossed, as a fact of life? Why is removing waste from our doorsteps regarded as an essential, universal service, but allowing us to remove waste from our bodies is not? The public realm has been subordinated to the whims of the market and profit for over a generation, and toilets are no exception. You\u2019ll often need to spend considerably more than a penny to have a pee. While Network Rail thankfully scrapped toilet charges in busy stations such as King\u2019s Cross and Edinburgh Waverley earlier this year, they remain in place \u2013 or are expanding \u2013 in parks, stations and public squares across the country. You are, bluntly, being ripped off by what should be described as a bladder tax. This is about dignity and public health. What should sufferers of Crohn\u2019s disease or irritable bowel syndrome do? Up to 43% of people have conditions requiring the frequent use of a toilet. Do the 3.4 million over-65s who experience urinary incontinence not have the right to take part in their community, or to travel the country with ease? What of heavily pregnant women being turned away from cafe toilets because they\u2019re not customers? With public urination treated as a potential public order offence, why leave many with no option but to break the law? And, as Toby Green, policy executive at the RSPH tells me: \u201cAt a time when we\u2019re seeing obesity levels rising and we\u2019re trying to encourage physical activity, and we\u2019re trying to row back on social isolation among vulnerable elderly people, seeing fewer and fewer toilets encouraging people to go outside and relate to their environments flies in the face of all that.\u201d There\u2019s a gendered element too: women are resigned to regularly queueing for a toilet in a way that men \u2013 for whom an excursion to a urinal can take just seconds \u2013 aren\u2019t. While, as the RSPH notes, \u201cpotty parity\u201d legislation in North America has stated that a fair ratio for toilet facilities would be at least 2:1 in favour of women, the British standard is a mere 1:1. Twenty-first-century toilet provision must cater for gender-neutral spaces and ensure that the rights of trans people are protected too. What to do about the national toilet scandal? Here is another reason why cuts to local authorities must be reversed in their entirety, and toilets made a statutory service. The \u201cbladder tax\u201d should be ended: it should be made illegal to charge people to exercise basic bodily functions. Perhaps councils could enforce a rule for all high-street businesses: no one who needs to go should be turned away. For a nation supposedly obsessed with toilet humour, we are remarkably embarrassed talking about our national loo scandal. But the privatisers of public space have taken the piss for too long, and the great toilet fightback should start here. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

CTF gave Johnson an interest-free loan to cover office and staffing costs earlier this year, while Crosby\u2019s partners in the business are Mark Textor and Mark Fullbrook, with Fullbrook taking a leave of absence to run Johnson\u2019s campaign for the Tory party leadership along with David Canzini.</p> <p>The news follows the Guardian\u2019s April report that Crosby\u2019s company was behind a series of hugely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/03/grassroots-facebook-brexit-ads-secretly-run-by-staff-of-lynton-crosby-firm\">influential pro-Brexit Facebook groups</a>, which spent as much as \u00a31m seeding the idea of a no-deal exit from the EU in the minds of the British public.</p> <p>But the latest revelations reveal that the company has pursued that approach more broadly, in the service of previously unreported corporate interests and foreign governments.</p> <p>And they expose a major flaw in Facebook\u2019s political transparency tools, which make it possible for Crosby\u2019s company \u2013 which boasts on its website that it deploys \u201cthe latest tools in digital engagement\u201d \u2013 to use the social network to run professional-looking \u201cnews\u201d pages reaching tens of millions of people on highly contentious topics, without apparently disclosing that they are being overseen by CTF Partners on behalf of paying clients.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/graphic1-zip/giv-39026E2wAIwcBCyk/\" data-alt=\"How they did it\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/graphic1-zip/giv-39026E2wAIwcBCyk/\">How they did it</a> </figure>  <p>Based on discussions with the current and former employees and examination of a large number of internal documents, the Guardian can reveal the extent of the astroturfing campaign:</p> <ul> <li><p>How the company took millions of pounds from the Saudi Arabian government in 2018 to burnish the reputation of crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has subsequently been implicated in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. <br></p></li> <li><p>How the company worked with the party of former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak, who has since been implicated in one of the world\u2019s biggest-ever corruption scandals, in the run-up to the country\u2019s last general election.

      "bodyText": "The lobbying firm run by Boris Johnson\u2019s close ally Sir Lynton Crosby has secretly built a network of unbranded \u201cnews\u201d pages on Facebook for dozens of clients ranging from the Saudi government to major polluters, a Guardian investigation has found. In the most complete account yet of CTF Partners\u2019 outlook and strategy, current and former employees of the campaign consultancy have painted a picture of a business that appears to have professionalised online disinformation, taken on a series of controversial clients and faced incidents of misogynistic bullying in its headquarters. They said that such was the culture of secrecy within the firm that staff working on online disinformation campaigns, which selectively promoted their clients\u2019 viewpoints on anonymised Facebook pages that followed a common formula, used initials rather than full names on internal systems and often relied on personal email accounts to avoid their work being traced back to CTF and its clients. The disclosures will raise pressure on the prime minister to distance himself from CTF, with former staff members warning that the company might wield substantial influence in the new administration. CTF gave Johnson an interest-free loan to cover office and staffing costs earlier this year, while Crosby\u2019s partners in the business are Mark Textor and Mark Fullbrook, with Fullbrook taking a leave of absence to run Johnson\u2019s campaign for the Tory party leadership along with David Canzini. The news follows the Guardian\u2019s April report that Crosby\u2019s company was behind a series of hugely influential pro-Brexit Facebook groups, which spent as much as \u00a31m seeding the idea of a no-deal exit from the EU in the minds of the British public. But the latest revelations reveal that the company has pursued that approach more broadly, in the service of previously unreported corporate interests and foreign governments. And they expose a major flaw in Facebook\u2019s political transparency tools, which make it possible for Crosby\u2019s company \u2013 which boasts on its website that it deploys \u201cthe latest tools in digital engagement\u201d \u2013 to use the social network to run professional-looking \u201cnews\u201d pages reaching tens of millions of people on highly contentious topics, without apparently disclosing that they are being overseen by CTF Partners on behalf of paying clients. Based on discussions with the current and former employees and examination of a large number of internal documents, the Guardian can reveal the extent of the astroturfing campaign: How the company took millions of pounds from the Saudi Arabian government in 2018 to burnish the reputation of crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has subsequently been implicated in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. How the company worked with the party of former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak, who has since been implicated in one of the world\u2019s biggest-ever corruption scandals, in the run-up to the country\u2019s last general election. Razak has denied any wrongdoing. CTF\u2019s role in political campaigns in countries criticised for their human rights records, ranging from Zimbabwe to Sri Lanka to war-torn Yemen. How CTF specialises in fighting regulation by seeking to influence key politicians, with campaigns in support of coal power, tobacco, and against cyclists. CTF declined to comment on their methods or clients but said they operated within the law and accused the Guardian of relying on \u201cfalse or distorted facts\u201d. They dismissed the idea that the company or Crosby could exercise any influence on the prime minister. The company\u2019s approach is a sophisticated application of the well worn communications technique of astroturfing, where political campaigners attempt to create the perception of an upswell of grassroots support for a cause. One former employee described how Crosby\u2019s business created Facebook pages on specific topics to spread disinformation to interested members of the public in the UK and abroad. \u201cIt would all be anonymised and made to look as though they are a news aggregator with a specialist angle,\u201d the employee said. \u201cFor instance, if we were working to promote the use of coal, it would be an anti-environmental page. You might make a page designed to attract pro-Trump types and get them revved up about green subsidies.\u201d Staff members said that they created websites and Facebook pages which appeared to be independent online news sources with names such as Why Electricity Matters, Reporting Yemen and Londoners for Transport, but instead could be used to distribute highly selective information which reached tens of millions of readers. Multiple supposedly independent pages on behalf of different clients could then be managed by Crosby employees through a single high-level \u201cbusiness manager\u201d account, which sidesteps Facebook\u2019s transparency tools. The connection between the pages is not visible to normal Facebook users. Secrecy was a paramount consideration in the communications strategy, the staffers said, leading to instances of the careful use of initials instead of full names on Facebook\u2019s internal systems and the occasional reliance on non-corporate email accounts. Some resorted to using ProtonMail, an encrypted email service, to avoid being traced.

This phenomenon of dimming and brightening is the key to creating the maps.</p> \n<p>While a star might be fainter because it is further away, it could also be because it is less luminous. For Cepheids, the maximum brightness of the star is related to the length of time the cycle of brightening and dimming takes, with brighter Cepheids having longer cycles. By comparing this intrinsic brightness with how bright the star appears to be, researchers can work out how far away a Cepheid is. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/milkyway-zip/giv-3902BFGSk52CtIx7/\" data-alt=\"milky way graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/milkyway-zip/giv-3902BFGSk52CtIx7/\">milky way graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The new study, <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aau3181\">published in the journal </a><a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aau3181\">Science</a>, encompasses data from more than 2,400 Cepheids, allowing the team to build the most detailed three-dimensional map yet of the Milky Way.</p> \n<p><em>\u201c</em>Cepheids are relatively young \u2013 younger than 200m years \u2013 whereas the Milky Way is believed to be about 10bn years old. This means that we can use Cepheids to study the relatively recent history of our galaxy,\u201d said Skowron.</p> \n<p>The new research shows our galaxy, which Skowron notes has a radius of about 70,000 light years and four spiral arms, is \u201cwarped\u201d, with the outer regions of one side bent \u201cup\u201d from the galactic plane towards the north galactic pole, and the other bent \u201cdown\u201d. The thickness of the disc is not the same all the way across \u2013 it flares towards the edges, like a pair of 1970s jeans.</p> \n<p>These findings also tally with other work showing a warp and flare, including studies of the distribution of hydrogen atoms across the Milky Way, although Skowron notes that uncertain distances mean the shape of the warp could not be unpicked from those studies.</p> \n<p>Prof Richard de Grijs of Macquarie University, who co-authored the earlier Cepheid study, said there were a number of explanations for our galaxy\u2019s warp. These include mergers with smaller galaxies, or the gravitational pull of the Milky Way being weaker in its outer regions meaning bodies there might be deflected out of the galactic plane by the tug of other stars. Alternatively, he said, \u201cgravitational interactions with nearby galaxies \u2026 could distort the gravitationally weakly bound outer regions into a warp-like structure\u201d.</p> \n<p> Skowron said warping was not seen in the central regions of the Milky Way because gravitational forces there were so strong that it was hard to deflect stars and gas out of the galactic plane.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/04/milky-way-is-warped-and-twisted-not-flat\">Milky Way is warped and twisted, not flat</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The new study suggests the bending away from the plane of the galaxy begins about 26,000 light years from the centre of the galaxy \u2013 roughly where our solar system lies \u2013 but becomes steeper from about 32,000 light years.</p> \n<p>A warped galaxy was not unusual, said Skowron. \u201cIn fact, it is estimated that about half of the galaxies could have some detectable warping. However the warp of our galaxy is quite substantial in comparison with others.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cc019c4b-5f5b-4957-8050-004257d534f4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pb4v_em1-0Y?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As with the previous work, the new study shows the Cepheids disproportionately lie on one side of the warped galaxy, forming an arc-shaped spread.</p> \n<p>The Polish team also found younger Cepheids lie nearer the centre of the Milky Way, while older Cepheids are further out. A computer simulation revealed there would need to have been star-forming events 64m, 113m and 175m years ago to produce the distribution of Cepheids seen today.</p> \n<p>Dr Vivienne Wild, an expert on galaxies from the University of St Andrews said it was much more difficult to explore the structure of our own galaxy than that of others.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is because we are inside it, and determining the distances to stars is really difficult,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Wild welcomed the exploration of how and why the Cepheids are bunched up on one side of the galaxy. \u201cBy measuring the ages of the stars and plotting their 3D positions in the Milky Way\u2019s disc,\u201d she said, \u201cwe can see how they initially formed in the Milky Way\u2019s spiral arms up to 175m years ago.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The most detailed three-dimensional map yet of the Milky Way has been revealed, showing that our galaxy is not a flat disc but has a \u201cwarped\u201d shape like a fascinator hat or a vinyl record that has been left in the sun. \u201cThe stars 60,000 light years away from the Milky Way\u2019s centre are as far as 4,500 [light years] above or below the galactic plane \u2013 this is a big percentage,\u201d said Dr Dorota Skowron of the University of Warsaw, first author of the latest research. Both the new study and an earlier one published in February, which found a similar shape, are based on the distribution across the galaxy of stars known as Cepheids \u2013 bodies whose brightness varies in a regular cycle over time. This phenomenon of dimming and brightening is the key to creating the maps. While a star might be fainter because it is further away, it could also be because it is less luminous. For Cepheids, the maximum brightness of the star is related to the length of time the cycle of brightening and dimming takes, with brighter Cepheids having longer cycles. By comparing this intrinsic brightness with how bright the star appears to be, researchers can work out how far away a Cepheid is. The new study, published in the journal Science, encompasses data from more than 2,400 Cepheids, allowing the team to build the most detailed three-dimensional map yet of the Milky Way. \u201cCepheids are relatively young \u2013 younger than 200m years \u2013 whereas the Milky Way is believed to be about 10bn years old. This means that we can use Cepheids to study the relatively recent history of our galaxy,\u201d said Skowron. The new research shows our galaxy, which Skowron notes has a radius of about 70,000 light years and four spiral arms, is \u201cwarped\u201d, with the outer regions of one side bent \u201cup\u201d from the galactic plane towards the north galactic pole, and the other bent \u201cdown\u201d. The thickness of the disc is not the same all the way across \u2013 it flares towards the edges, like a pair of 1970s jeans. These findings also tally with other work showing a warp and flare, including studies of the distribution of hydrogen atoms across the Milky Way, although Skowron notes that uncertain distances mean the shape of the warp could not be unpicked from those studies. Prof Richard de Grijs of Macquarie University, who co-authored the earlier Cepheid study, said there were a number of explanations for our galaxy\u2019s warp. These include mergers with smaller galaxies, or the gravitational pull of the Milky Way being weaker in its outer regions meaning bodies there might be deflected out of the galactic plane by the tug of other stars. Alternatively, he said, \u201cgravitational interactions with nearby galaxies \u2026 could distort the gravitationally weakly bound outer regions into a warp-like structure\u201d. Skowron said warping was not seen in the central regions of the Milky Way because gravitational forces there were so strong that it was hard to deflect stars and gas out of the galactic plane. The new study suggests the bending away from the plane of the galaxy begins about 26,000 light years from the centre of the galaxy \u2013 roughly where our solar system lies \u2013 but becomes steeper from about 32,000 light years. A warped galaxy was not unusual, said Skowron. \u201cIn fact, it is estimated that about half of the galaxies could have some detectable warping. However the warp of our galaxy is quite substantial in comparison with others.\u201d As with the previous work, the new study shows the Cepheids disproportionately lie on one side of the warped galaxy, forming an arc-shaped spread. The Polish team also found younger Cepheids lie nearer the centre of the Milky Way, while older Cepheids are further out. A computer simulation revealed there would need to have been star-forming events 64m, 113m and 175m years ago to produce the distribution of Cepheids seen today. Dr Vivienne Wild, an expert on galaxies from the University of St Andrews said it was much more difficult to explore the structure of our own galaxy than that of others. \u201cThis is because we are inside it, and determining the distances to stars is really difficult,\u201d she said. Wild welcomed the exploration of how and why the Cepheids are bunched up on one side of the galaxy. \u201cBy measuring the ages of the stars and plotting their 3D positions in the Milky Way\u2019s disc,\u201d she said, \u201cwe can see how they initially formed in the Milky Way\u2019s spiral arms up to 175m years ago.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Your report (Ministers urged to scrap \u2018nasty\u2019 two-child limit on benefits, 1 August) rightly warns of the likely impact on overall levels of child poverty. However, given that the majority of children affected are already in poverty, perhaps even more worrying is the Child Poverty Action Group\u2019s estimate that a million children (over half of those concerned) will be pushed deeper below the poverty line. From the research you cite, it would seem that the two-child limit is undermining the government\u2019s own policies, including on domestic abuse, refugee integration and family conflict. Yet it is doing nothing to monitor its impact. This betrays the kind of irresponsible indifference to the effects of its policies on the wellbeing of some of the poorest children and families in our society, lambasted recently by the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights. Ruth Lister Labour, House of Lords \u2022 Yet again ministers wheel out nonsense and denial to justify the inhuman policy of denying a third child a benefit income. \u201cThis policy ensures fairness by asking families receiving benefits to face the same financial choices as families supporting themselves solely through work,\u201d says a government spokesperson. It all depends on whether you own or rent your home. Most homeowners, with increased, unearned, untaxed equity in their property, have many more financial choices to make in employment and unemployment than renters with none. The very rich can even pass land on to their three or four children tax free. It is only in the UK that renters are paying the landlords\u2019 property tax, which we call council tax, while the landlords bask in their villas in the south of France.

      "body": "<p>Early in 1986, a gallery opened on Charlotte Street in Fitzrovia, London, across from the advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. Its 25-year-old owner seemed the picture of a certain kind of Englishman: small, solid, with unruly fair hair and gold-rimmed spectacles. He wore, as such Englishmen do, well-cut tweeds; it being the Thatcher era, there was no surprise to hear him say that he meant to have a million pounds in his pocket by his 30th birthday. Despite appearances to the contrary, the gallerist was neither British nor a yuppie.</p> <p>Karsten Schubert, who has died of thyroid cancer at the age of 57, was German; and he played an unparalleled part in promoting the group that would come to be known as the Young British Artists (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2015/feb/28/young-british-artists-at-play-in-the-1990s-in-pictures\" title=\"\">YBAs</a>).</p> <p>Until setting up on his own, Schubert had been at the Lisson Gallery \u2013 an institution which, as he was later to say, \u201cwas where British art of the 80s happened\u201d. This was no exaggeration. In the years before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/damienhirst\" title=\"\">Damien Hirst</a>\u2019s 1988 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/jun/01/art\" title=\"\">Freeze</a> exhibition, the Lisson was the only London gallery open to the work of young and as yet undiscovered artists.</p> <p>Sensing the need for another, and convincing the dealer Richard Salmon to back him, Schubert set about filling his stable. His first exhibition was of the sculptor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/22/alison-wilding-review-sculpture-de-la-warr-pavilion-bexhill-on-sea\" title=\"\">Alison Wilding</a>, whose work he continued to show until his death. It was in 1988, though, that he met the group with which his name would become most closely associated. Through the artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/michael-craig-martin\" title=\"\">Michael Craig-Martin</a>, Schubert visited the degree show at Goldsmiths College (now Goldsmiths, University of London). That November, three of the art school\u2019s new graduates \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gary-hume\" title=\"\">Gary Hume</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/michael-landy\" title=\"\">Michael Landy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/sep/20/guide-to-painting-ian-davenport\" title=\"\">Ian Davenport</a> \u2013 had their first West End exhibition at Karsten Schubert Limited.</p> <p>This was followed by a series of shows that helped both to put the YBAs on the map and to define their aesthetic. In October 1991 came <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gallaccio-preserve-beauty-t11829\" title=\"\">the event entitled preserve \u2018beauty\u2019</a>, in which another young Goldsmiths artist, Anya Gallaccio, filled Schubert\u2019s Charlotte Street window with 800 gerberas, whose rotting red slime slowly oozed down the glass. The following year came Landy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thomasdanegallery.com/artists/43-michael-landy/works/3281/\" title=\"\">Closing Down Sale</a>, the artist converting the gallery into a pound shop complete with cheap consumer goods, shopping trolleys and day-glo signs that read \u201cGoing Out of Business\u201d.</p> <p>These last proved unhappily prophetic. In part due to Schubert\u2019s own energy, the market for new art overheated and collapsed. Far from having made a million pounds, he had, by the age of 30, lost it. So, too, had Salmon. The pair parted company in 1993, Schubert reopening his business in smaller premises in nearby Foley Street.</p> <p>By this time the YBAs he had helped to invent had begun to desert him. Tact was not always Schubert\u2019s strong point: shortly after Landy\u2019s last show, he had sent a letter around the gallery\u2019s artists outlining the need to trim \u201cdead wood\u201d. This resulted in a number of wounded departures. When, in 1993, Schubert criticised Hume\u2019s new work as lacking in abstract rigour, Hume, too, took himself elsewhere. Rachel Whiteread followed suit in 1996, at which point the second gallery closed.</p> <p>It did so with typical \u00e9clat. The year before, Schubert, with the gallerist Thomas Dane and the publisher Charles Asprey, had opened a space called Ridinghouse to the rear of Foley Street. There they showed works such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/chapman\" title=\"\">Jake and Dinos Chapman</a>\u2019s Bring Me the Head of \u2026 (1995): a video in which a pair of local prostitutes pleasured themselves with the nose of the mask of an Italian dealer to whom the Chapmans had taken a dislike.</p> <p>The Ridinghouse name carries on in a publishing house, producing high-end works of art history and criticism, and artists\u2019 monographs. Schubert was perhaps proudest of this. For all his love of Britain and English tailoring \u2013 he became a British citizen not long before his death \u2013 he had a depth of culture and historical understanding that remained admirably German.</p> <p>Born in Berlin, to Ruth (nee Herberer) and Gottfried Schubert, Karsten was educated at a classical Gymnasium at Helmstedt in Lower Saxony. (His parents divorced when Karsten was two, his mother remarrying, to Max Stecher, a businessman.) After this he studied theology at the Humboldt University of Berlin, before taking a job with an art dealer in Cologne.</p> <p>With his mother, a teacher and social worker, the young Karsten had haunted museums. He recalled an early trip to the Pergamon, in what was then East Berlin: \u201cSuddenly a train would rumble past the windows, disconcertingly high and close, its lights momentarily swaying the forest of sculptures, and then silence and darkness again.\u201d When he wrote his own history of museology, The Curator\u2019s Egg (2000), it was with the easy assurance of one who could quote Marcus Aurelius from memory.</p> <p>It was this same sense of history that had allowed Schubert to spot what was happening in British art before most British gallerists did. \u201cThe classic pattern had been that you were watched by dealers for a while and got an occasional studio visit and pat on the back,\u201d he said of the YBAs. \u201cThese artists were not willing to play the game that way. They wanted to change the rules and take the initiative.\u201d</p> <p>It was an outsider\u2019s eye, too, that enabled him to see British art in an international, rather than a local, context. In between giving exhibitions to artists such as Landy and Hume, Schubert would show Americans such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/ed-ruscha\" title=\"\">Ed Ruscha</a> and Germans such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gerhard-richter\" title=\"\">Gerhard Richter</a>. This lent the YBAs an international exposure \u2013 and status \u2013 that a previous generation of British artists had lacked.</p> <p>It is the fate of pioneers often to be sidelined by history. Although Schubert did more than any London gallerist to bring the YBAs to fame, it was the next generation of dealers who made money out of them and were credited with their discovery. From the mid-1990s on, Schubert concentrated on artists the rigour of whose art he particularly liked, most famously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/bridget-riley\" title=\"\">Bridget Riley</a>. Having her work shown alongside that of artists 30 years her junior re-energised Riley\u2019s late career. Schubert\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.karstenschubert.com/\" title=\"\">last gallery</a>, in Lexington Street, Soho, favoured artists with a strong formal sense, Tess Jaray notable among them.</p> <p>Schubert\u2019s taste was perhaps best shown by his own collection. In his flat in north London were drawings by C\u00e9zanne and Mondrian, hung side by side with works by Jaray and Picasso and a Roman bust bought from the estate of the critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/jun/20/guardianobituaries.arts\" title=\"\">David Sylvester</a>. Its bookshelves were lined with Proust, for whom he had an almost obsessional fondness. When he found a book he admired, Schubert would buy 20 copies of it and send them to people he liked.</p> <p>This generosity was repaid. Diagnosed with cancer in 2015, he recuperated from treatment at Claridge\u2019s, his hotel bills paid by two friends. The experience was recorded by Schubert in a novel, <a href=\"https://www.ridinghouse.co.uk/publications/125\" title=\"\">Room 225-6</a>, the proceeds of which help fund a charity doing research into robotic surgery.</p> <p>He is survived by his two half-sisters, Anja Kirstein and Clarissa Stecher.</p> <p>\u2022 Karsten Andreas Schubert, art dealer and gallerist, born 12 August 1961; died 30 July 2019</p>",

The Ridinghouse name carries on in a publishing house, producing high-end works of art history and criticism, and artists\u2019 monographs. Schubert was perhaps proudest of this. For all his love of Britain and English tailoring \u2013 he became a British citizen not long before his death \u2013 he had a depth of culture and historical understanding that remained admirably German. Born in Berlin, to Ruth (nee Herberer) and Gottfried Schubert, Karsten was educated at a classical Gymnasium at Helmstedt in Lower Saxony. (His parents divorced when Karsten was two, his mother remarrying, to Max Stecher, a businessman.) After this he studied theology at the Humboldt University of Berlin, before taking a job with an art dealer in Cologne. With his mother, a teacher and social worker, the young Karsten had haunted museums. He recalled an early trip to the Pergamon, in what was then East Berlin: \u201cSuddenly a train would rumble past the windows, disconcertingly high and close, its lights momentarily swaying the forest of sculptures, and then silence and darkness again.\u201d When he wrote his own history of museology, The Curator\u2019s Egg (2000), it was with the easy assurance of one who could quote Marcus Aurelius from memory. It was this same sense of history that had allowed Schubert to spot what was happening in British art before most British gallerists did. \u201cThe classic pattern had been that you were watched by dealers for a while and got an occasional studio visit and pat on the back,\u201d he said of the YBAs. \u201cThese artists were not willing to play the game that way. They wanted to change the rules and take the initiative.\u201d It was an outsider\u2019s eye, too, that enabled him to see British art in an international, rather than a local, context. In between giving exhibitions to artists such as Landy and Hume, Schubert would show Americans such as Ed Ruscha and Germans such as Gerhard Richter. This lent the YBAs an international exposure \u2013 and status \u2013 that a previous generation of British artists had lacked. It is the fate of pioneers often to be sidelined by history. Although Schubert did more than any London gallerist to bring the YBAs to fame, it was the next generation of dealers who made money out of them and were credited with their discovery. From the mid-1990s on, Schubert concentrated on artists the rigour of whose art he particularly liked, most famously Bridget Riley. Having her work shown alongside that of artists 30 years her junior re-energised Riley\u2019s late career. Schubert\u2019s last gallery, in Lexington Street, Soho, favoured artists with a strong formal sense, Tess Jaray notable among them. Schubert\u2019s taste was perhaps best shown by his own collection. In his flat in north London were drawings by C\u00e9zanne and Mondrian, hung side by side with works by Jaray and Picasso and a Roman bust bought from the estate of the critic David Sylvester. Its bookshelves were lined with Proust, for whom he had an almost obsessional fondness. When he found a book he admired, Schubert would buy 20 copies of it and send them to people he liked. This generosity was repaid. Diagnosed with cancer in 2015, he recuperated from treatment at Claridge\u2019s, his hotel bills paid by two friends. The experience was recorded by Schubert in a novel, Room 225-6, the proceeds of which help fund a charity doing research into robotic surgery. He is survived by his two half-sisters, Anja Kirstein and Clarissa Stecher. \u2022 Karsten Andreas Schubert, art dealer and gallerist, born 12 August 1961; died 30 July 2019",

We must expand the language to encompass her.</p> <p>Anyway, the meeting. This week Cardi joined Senator Bernie Sanders in Detroit to talk about the potential of \u201ceconomic, racial and social justice for all\u201d (according to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B0hWEaKAa1x/\" title=\"\">the Instagram post about their meeting</a>) and to record one of those outreach videos aimed at young people to get them to vote and which never, ever work.</p> <p>This happens like clockwork once every four years, to be fair. Who will be our celebrity presidential outreach in 2023? Will the Stranger Things kids still be a thing, or will a rush of puberty have made them wonky and unlikable? Will JoJo Siwa still be about or will a younger, even more cheerful YouTuber have risen up and drunk the blood straight out of her veins? There are more famous children now than at any time in history.

Like, this man was suffering from polio at the time of his presidency, and yet all he was worried about was trying to make America great \u2013 make America great again for real. He\u2019s the real \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019, because if it wasn\u2019t for him, old people wouldn\u2019t even get social security.\u201d When the quote went viral, it moved Sanders to tweet four words that have never left me in the intervening 15 months, because I get an unshakable chill when I try to imagine a 77-year-old man saying them out loud: \u201cCardi B is right.\u201d And lo, we get a woman who once told Fader magazine she always carries a razor blade <a href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2017/06/22/cardi-b-cover-story-interview\" title=\"\">in her ass crack</a> meeting an independent Democratic socialist to ask questions she crowdsourced from her fans on Instagram. Truly, 2019 is brilliant and I love every second of it.</p> <p>I reckon the meeting is broadly a good thing. US politics is, of course, a war zone \u2013 a scheduled Cardi B concert was cancelled in Indianapolis the day after the Instagram post went up, due to an \u201cunverified threat\u201d, and it\u2019s not a great stretch to imagine someone with just slightly too many bumper stickers on their car deciding to call something in after learning the singer leaned left \u2013 and you can understand why the bigger pop stars tend to shy away from it. Taylor Swift, of course \u2013 enigmatic siren, platinum-selling artist, potentially the first singer to ever medically transform herself into a cat \u2013 remained tight-lipped about her own politics throughout the \u201cHillary yas!\u201d era of 2016, only breaking omert\u00e0 and using Instagram to endorse two Democratic candidates in late 2018 (which, predictably, resulted in outrage). To be fair: if my career was predicated on keeping angry people happy enough to stream Apple Music so I can pay for a mansion, I would probably avoid coming down too hard on the side of human rights, too.</p> <p>Still, I have a troubling vision of this becoming a trend in British politics, which we can all agree is \u201cjust like American politics, but worse\u201d.

      "bodyText": "This great summer of golf homecomings has led to nervous times. Rory McIlroy said his hands trembled when gripping a club after the ovation he received on the 1st tee at the Open Championship; the eight shots that followed played a crucial role in the Northern Irishman lasting only 36 holes at Portrush. Anguish was writ large over the face of Darren Clarke after his triple bogey at the 18th afforded him the same fate at his home club. With familiarity comes pressure. Enter Charley Hull. Back at Woburn, where she became a member aged nine, the 23-year-old admitted to the same sensation as McIlroy on the opening hole of the Women\u2019s British Open. There was no upcoming damage though; Hull did not post a single bogey en route to a 67. \u201cWith that first tee shot, you feel silly if you miss the fairway because it\u2019s so wide,\u201d Hull said. \u201cIt was not the best but I got it down there.

The move, <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/news/franchise-for-shetland-by-election-to-be-aligned-with-court-ruling/\">announced by the Scottish government,</a> will ensure compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights. A European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruling in 2005 said the UK government\u2019s blanket ban on prisoner voting breached human rights laws. However, successive UK governments resisted changing the law in order to allow prisoners the right to vote. A dispute between the UK and the European court on the issue finally ended in 2017 when voting rights were given to around 100 inmates in England and Wales released on \u201ctemporary licence\u201d. Powers over the franchise for Scottish parliament elections were devolved in 2017, with Holyrood and the Scottish government legally obliged to comply with the ECHR. </p> <p>As the Press Association reports, the Shetland by-election will be held on August 29, having been triggered by the resignation of Scottish Liberal Democrat MSP Tavish Scott. Ahead of the vote, Scottish constitutional relations Secretary <strong>Michael Russell</strong> said he will make a remedial order to bring the franchise for the by-election into line with the ECHR ruling. It will allow prisoners who meet the wider franchise criteria, and who are serving sentences of 12 months or less, to register for a vote in the byelection in time for the August 13 deadline. It is estimated the order will extend the franchise to fewer than five people. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d42fdd58f0896be8f8f1725\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-01T15:13:53.594Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Brexit party bus has been out in Brecon and Radnorshire, where a byelection is taking place today.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In terms of fear, I think we should be afraid of a no-deal Brexit ...</p> <p>A no-deal Brexit would have very serious impacts on the economy, north and south, and on Britain. It could have security implications as well and it could have constitutional implications. It\u2019s something that we have to prepare for nonetheless. It is something we should be afraid about.</p> </blockquote> <p>Varadkar also said that he had invited Boris Johnson to visit him in Dublin for talks \u201cwithout any preconditions\u201d.</p> <p>Asked about claims <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/31/boris-johnson-holds-talks-in-belfast-as-sinn-fein-says-border-poll-must-follow-no-deal-brexit-live-news?page=with:block-5d415fad8f08cf92bb77a507#block-5d415fad8f08cf92bb77a507\">(made by Sinn Fein in particular)</a> that Johnson was incapable of being impartial when mediating between Sinn Fein and the DUP on the issue of power-sharing in Northern Ireland, Varadkar implied he was not yet convinced Johnson would be neutral. He replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think that remains to be seen. </p> <p>He\u2019s only just started in the job and I think we need to give him a fair wind and a decent chance. </p> <p>But you know we shouldn\u2019t also ignore what\u2019s there in the Good Friday agreement and I hear a lot of talk about the Good Friday Agreement in recent weeks and months and often wonder if some of the people who quote the Good Friday agreement have actually read it. </p> <p>The Good Friday agreement is very explicit that the sovereign government, the UK Government must be rigorously impartial in how it administers Northern Ireland and we all need to respect the fact that the aspirations about unionist people and nationalist people are equal.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7258e115f3728d3217b98bc454f3120eebfc8ff2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7258e115f3728d3217b98bc454f3120eebfc8ff2/0_149_5274_3165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leo Varadkar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leo Varadkar</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tommy Dickson/INPHO/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d42d0768f08c7e177d42a54\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-01T13:07:18.435Z\">2.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In an interview with BBC News about the Treasury\u2019s \u00a32.1bn no deal planning announcement,<strong> Paul Johnson</strong>, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said this was relatively small sum compared to what a no deal Brexit could cost the economy.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If some of that is spent on things which are only needed in the event of no deal, and we don\u2019t end up with no deal, then of course it will be wasted money. But I think we should probably see it, and the government would see it, as a form of insurance policy.

Last week he was made leader of the Commons, but he plans to continue and the latest Moggcast went up on <a href=\"https://www.conservativehome.com/highlights/2019/08/the-moggcast-can-we-trust-boris-yes-hes-deeply-trustworthy.html\">the ConHome website this morning. </a>Mark Wallace was interviewing Rees-Mogg. It\u2019s not exactly Newsnight or the Today programme, but there were some half-decent lines nevertheless. Here are the main points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Rees-Mogg claimed that Boris Johnson was \u201cdeeply trustworthy\u201d on Brexit. </strong>Johnson\u2019s opponents, of course, would say the opposite (a standard criticism of Johnson is that people who trust him regularly end up being let down), but Rees-Mogg was speaking in the context of leaving the EU. He said that when he was speaking in support of Johnson during the Tory leadership campaign, people often asked if Johnson would do what he was promising.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They said to me: Can we trust Boris? To which my answer is, yes, and personally, I do. I think he is deeply trustworthy, strongly believes in what he\u2019s going to do, and recognises the political risk of not doing it. And therefore everything comes together for us to leave on the 31 October. </p> </blockquote> <p>Rees-Mogg said that he was \u201cgulled\u201d by Theresa May because he believed her when she said the UK would leave the EU by 29 March. \u201cHer statements were very clear. And it turned out that she didn\u2019t mean what she said, and asked for an extension.\u201d Rees-Mogg went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it is inconceivable that Boris would do the same. I just don\u2019t think that is what he wants to do.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Rees-Mogg said he did not think Johnson\u2019s decision to hire Dominic Cummings as an adviser would cause a problem for the parliamentary party, even though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2019/jul/24/boris-johnson-prepares-to-enter-downing-st-and-name-cabinet-theresa-may-prime-minister-live-news?page=with:block-5d38189b8f08d0b6ca536a81#block-5d38189b8f08d0b6ca536a81\">Cummings in the past has been brutally rude about some Brexiter Tory MPs. </a></strong>Rees-Mogg explained:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Politicians are a thick-skinned lot. They don\u2019t worry about these sorts of things. The question is, are we getting the right policy direction? And I\u2019m very, very confident that we are getting the right policy direction.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Rees-Mogg said he did not think John Bercow, the Speaker, was biased against Brexiters.</strong> Many Tory MPs believe Bercow is actively working to frustrate Brexit. But Rees-Mogg said he thought the Speaker was acting as \u201ca fair-minded umpire\u201d. He explained:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Had the situation been reversed, had we had a strong remain government, and I as a leaver had found a parliamentary mechanism to do something that hadn\u2019t recently been done, Mr Speaker would have been open to me to do that, as he has been to them to do what they have done. </p> <p>I think Mr Speaker is genuinely fair-minded in what he seeks to do. And I think that his aim is to ensure House of Commons has the say that it wants.</p> <p>There is in fact only one ruling of his that I disagreed with, and I raised a point of order at the time, and that\u2019s <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/01/10/bercow-causes-fury-over-brexit\">on the question of forthwith.</a> I think forthwith has a different meeting from the one Mr Speaker determined. But I think he would have done the same had the boot been on the other foot. I think people miss this. Mr Speaker is in favour of the House of Commons and the authority of the House of Commons. In that sense, he is not impartial, he is pro the House of Commons. But that is as Mr Speaker should be. In terms of the political arguments, I think he is a fair-minded umpire. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Rees-Mogg said he thought the EU should realise Britain is serious about leaving on 31 October without a deal if Brussels does not agree to abandon the backstop. </strong>Asked why the EU should think the UK was serious, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, they should believe us because of our new leader. The new prime minister is somebody of considerable force of personality who is not going to be browbeaten by them. They should believe us because of the appointment of Dominic Cummings, which seems to me to be exceptionally important as a statement as to what is going to happen.

If you think the European Union Work could work out how to find hard to find 600 billion euros in contradiction of the treaties to bail out the euro, and got it done half an hour before the New Zealand markets opened, the EU can move quickly when it wants to, and so can the UK. So the fact that the the work has been concertinaed isn\u2019t that much of a problem.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He refused to say he if he would resign if Brexit did not happen by 31 October.</strong> He said, having just been appointed, he said it was \u201ca bit premature\u201d to start answering questions about resigning.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said it was \u201cnot true\u201d to say parliament would block a no deal Brexit.</strong> He said that 31 October was set down in law as the date for leaving, and that that would only change if the UK asked for an extension or if it revoked article 50.

This is the six-strong committee that is expected to take all the key decisions on Brexit. And they are all men. Along with Johnson, the other members are: Michael Gove, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the deputy chair of the committee; Sajid Javid, the chancellor; Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary; Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary; and Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general.</p> <p>Overnight the Treasury announced that it was setting aside an extra \u00a32.1bn for no deal planning. In <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-announces-billions-to-turbo-charge-no-deal-preparations\">its press release</a>, the Treasury says this will \u201cturbo-charge no deal preparations\u201d. With language like that, you can tell the government is now being run by a former motoring correspondent for GQ. <strong>Andrew Neil</strong> wouldn\u2019t approve; \u201cyou keep on saying turbo-charge, which is a meaningless phrase,\u201d he told Jeremy Hunt, in one of his many effective put-downs when he interviewed him during the leadership campaign.</p> <p>Here is our story about the announcement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/31/labour-attacks-appalling-waste-as-johnson-adds-2bn-no-deal-brexit-fund\">Brexit: Labour attacks 'appalling waste' as Johnson adds \u00a32.1bn to no-deal fund</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Opposition parties and anti-Brexit groups have been damning.</p> <p>For Labour, the shadow chancellor <strong>John McDonnell </strong>said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is an appalling waste of tax-payers\u2019 cash, all for the sake of Boris Johnson\u2019s drive towards a totally avoidable no deal.</p> <p>This government could have ruled out no deal, and spent these billions on our schools, hospitals, and people.</p> <p>Labour is a party for the whole of the UK, so we\u2019ll do all we can to block a no deal, crash-out Brexit \u2013 and we\u2019ll deliver a transformative economic policy that delivers for the many, not the few.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Lib Dem Treasury spokesman<strong> Chuka Umunna</strong> said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This extra money is a drop in the ocean when compared to the huge hit to the exchequer of at least \u00a390bn \u2013 according to the chancellor\u2019s predecessor \u2013 of a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p>They promised us an extra \u00a3350m each week for the NHS, now they are making more money available just to ensure access to medicine.</p> <p>This is a political choice made by an irresponsible government. The Liberal Democrats are the only party that can get into government which is committed to stopping Brexit \u2013 so we can use public monies to tackle the real problems the country faces.</p> </blockquote> <p>And Naomi Smith, CEO of the anti-Brexit group <strong>Best for Britain</strong>, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is a colossal waste of money for something both parliament and the country don\u2019t want. </p> <p>We know a no-deal Brexit will mean shortages of foods and medicines, and we know it\u2019ll cost the country a fortune. Now the new chancellor wants to throw billions more at the problem his government is responsible for creating. </p> <p>Wasting money like this when we have so many other priorities is exactly why the country has turned against Brexit.

      "bodyText": "Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (prime minister) has escalated his warning about a no deal Brexit, saying everyone in the UK and Ireland should be \u201cafraid\u201d of this outcome. (See 2.46pm.) Britain has a one in three chance of plunging into recession as uncertainty over Brexit drags down the economy, the Bank of England has warned. Mark Francois, a leading Tory rebel who voted down Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, has warned Boris Johnson that he and dozens of colleagues will block any attempt to pass the agreement again \u2013 even if the Irish backstop is removed. The boss of BMW has urged Boris Johnson to respond to calls from business to find a compromise on Brexit \u2013 and offered to travel to the UK to deliver the message to the prime minister in person. The new justice secretary, Robert Buckland, has received an extraordinary rebuff from Downing Street after saying he believed there was merit in allowing people accused of serious crimes to remain anonymous until they were charged \u2013 provided they had reputations to protect. That\u2019s all from me for today - and probably for the rest of the month. Have a good August everyone. Thanks for the comments. Ipsos MORI has published its latest Political Monitor polling round-up. You can read the whole thing here, but Keiran Pedley has posted a good summary on Twitter. And, on the subject of byelections, prisoners are to be given the right to vote in the Shetland byelection, the Press Association reports. The move, announced by the Scottish government, will ensure compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights. A European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruling in 2005 said the UK government\u2019s blanket ban on prisoner voting breached human rights laws. However, successive UK governments resisted changing the law in order to allow prisoners the right to vote. A dispute between the UK and the European court on the issue finally ended in 2017 when voting rights were given to around 100 inmates in England and Wales released on \u201ctemporary licence\u201d. Powers over the franchise for Scottish parliament elections were devolved in 2017, with Holyrood and the Scottish government legally obliged to comply with the ECHR. As the Press Association reports, the Shetland by-election will be held on August 29, having been triggered by the resignation of Scottish Liberal Democrat MSP Tavish Scott. Ahead of the vote, Scottish constitutional relations Secretary Michael Russell said he will make a remedial order to bring the franchise for the by-election into line with the ECHR ruling. It will allow prisoners who meet the wider franchise criteria, and who are serving sentences of 12 months or less, to register for a vote in the byelection in time for the August 13 deadline. It is estimated the order will extend the franchise to fewer than five people. The Brexit party bus has been out in Brecon and Radnorshire, where a byelection is taking place today. The bus hit the headlines at the weekend when it broke down. But it will probably take more than an engine repair to help the party because it is not seen as a contender in this seat where, as my colleague Jessica Elgot explained in an article on Monday, the Liberal Democrats are expected to win. The byelection was triggered after the sitting MP, the Conservative Chris Davies, was convicted of expenses fraud. Davies is standing again, saying that his conviction related to an administrative error from which he made no financial gain and that constituents had urged him to stand again. A poll in the constituency conducted by the Number Cruncher Politics consultancy last month suggested the Lib Dems were well ahead. These are from the BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam on one of the lines to emerge from the Mark Carney press conference. Note to readers: I\u2019ll be wrapping up the blog in about an hour or so, and then after that Politics Live will probably be closed for the next four weeks. I will be back on Monday 2 September. At the moment there is no plan to run a daily politics blog over August, but if something particularly newsy or dramatic happens, it may come back. I hope you all get some holiday too. In the absence of the blog you can find lots of excellent political reporting at Guardian politics. And if you miss the minute by minute updates, then do feel free to take a break, read a book, ring your mum, or just generally tune out from the Brexit horror show for a while. You will probably feel much better as a result - and you can pick up again in September, when it will (almost certainly) all still remain unresolved. Yesterday Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, accused the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, of engaging in \u201cproject fear mark two\u201d because he has suggested a no deal Brexit could lead to the break-up of the UK. Asked about her comment today, Varadkar said that he did not accept the criticism at all, and that in fact everyone should fear a no deal Brexit. He said: In terms of fear, I think we should be afraid of a no-deal Brexit ... A no-deal Brexit would have very serious impacts on the economy, north and south, and on Britain. It could have security implications as well and it could have constitutional implications. It\u2019s something that we have to prepare for nonetheless. It is something we should be afraid about. Varadkar also said that he had invited Boris Johnson to visit him in Dublin for talks \u201cwithout any preconditions\u201d. Asked about claims (made by Sinn Fein in particular) that Johnson was incapable of being impartial when mediating between Sinn Fein and the DUP on the issue of power-sharing in Northern Ireland, Varadkar implied he was not yet convinced Johnson would be neutral. He replied: I think that remains to be seen. He\u2019s only just started in the job and I think we need to give him a fair wind and a decent chance. But you know we shouldn\u2019t also ignore what\u2019s there in the Good Friday agreement and I hear a lot of talk about the Good Friday Agreement in recent weeks and months and often wonder if some of the people who quote the Good Friday agreement have actually read it. The Good Friday agreement is very explicit that the sovereign government, the UK Government must be rigorously impartial in how it administers Northern Ireland and we all need to respect the fact that the aspirations about unionist people and nationalist people are equal. In an interview with BBC News about the Treasury\u2019s \u00a32.1bn no deal planning announcement, Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said this was relatively small sum compared to what a no deal Brexit could cost the economy. If some of that is spent on things which are only needed in the event of no deal, and we don\u2019t end up with no deal, then of course it will be wasted money. But I think we should probably see it, and the government would see it, as a form of insurance policy. If in the end it is not needed, it is not wasted, because it has at least insured us to some extent against what might happen. The important thing is, in the context of what the impact on the public finances overall would be of a no deal Brexit, and they would be very significantly negative, as the Office of Budget Responsibility said just a couple of weeks ago, actually a couple of billion is rather little compared with the tens of billions we would probably lose as a result of a smaller economy. Johnson also claimed there was \u201ccomplete consensus, including among Brexit supporters\u201d that the economy was about \u00a340bn smaller today than it would have been had the UK voted remain in 2016. There was also consensus that, in the short and medium term, a no deal Brexit would shrink the economy further, he said. Here is the Evening Standard\u2019s take on the Bank of England\u2019s inflation report. In an interview with BBC Sajid Javid, the chancellor, was asked if he was comfortable spending so much money on no deal planning, and potentially increasing the deficit, when previously he was part of a Cameron/Osborne government that worked hard to cut borrowing. Javid suggested that was not a problem because the economy was now robust. He replied: Well, our economy is very strong. The effects of the hard work of the British people [have been] incredibly strong. In fact, this year we are forecast by the IMF to grow faster than France, than Germany, than Italy, and we want to make sure we use the strength of the economy to meet the needs of the British people. And we can afford to make many choices. Eventually, at some point, we will have a budget and we will set out exactly how we\u2019re going to do that. But Javid refused to say when the budget would be. Talking of the Financial Times, it has published a useful report today (paywall) about how prepared the EU and the UK are for a no deal Brexit. It includes this telling graphic. This is from Lionel Barber, editor of the Financial Times. At its regular press conference this morning the European commission said that \u201cboth sides reiterated their positions\u201d when David Frost, Boris Johnson\u2019s chief Brexit adviser, met EU officials for talks in Brussels this week. The commission\u2019s spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said: We will continue our contacts and, at the latest, the G7 in Biarritz will be an opportunity for the two leaders - president [Jean-Claude] Juncker and Prime Minister Johnson - to meet. Asked if the UK put forward any ideas to break the Brexit deadlock, Andreeva said: This question is best addressed to the UK authorities, if they have other proposals in mind. From the commission\u2019s side the EU position is clear because it has been provided by the European council. The withdrawal agreement is not up for reopening while we are open to work on the political declaration should the UK wish so. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, is now holding his press conference. Julia Kollewe is covering it on the business live blog. Britain has a one in three chance of plunging into recession as uncertainty over Brexit drags down the economy, the Bank of England has warned. As my colleague Richard Partington reports, keeping interest rates on hold as the risks to the economy mount, the central bank said business investment was stalling, while heightened international trade tensions and a slowdown in the global economy was also having an impact on UK growth. A countdown clock, reported to have cost at least \u00a3500, has been delivered to Downing Street, with just three months to go until the UK is due to leave the EU, the Press Association reports. The package arrived at Number 10 a day after Tory party chairman James Cleverly unveiled a countdown clock at Conservative campaign headquarters (CCHQ). The clock in Matthew Parker Street is displayed below a message which reads: \u201cWe will have delivered Brexit and left the EU by\u201d. No \u201csensible\u201d government would try to legislate for a Brexit deal before 31 October, the leading Tory Brexiter Mark Francois has claimed. Although the government is stepping up preparations for a no deal Brexit at the end of that month, officially Boris Johnson thinks this will turn out to be unnecessary because he says the EU will back down over the backstop, allowing a deal to be struck. But Francois, the vice chair of the European Research Group, which represents Tory MPs pushing for a harder Brexit, told the Telegraph\u2019s Chopper\u2019s Brexit podcast that it would be pointless trying to get legislation for a deal through parliament before the end of October because there would be too much opposition. As the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope (the eponymous \u201cChopper\u201d) and Theodore Louloudis report in their story (paywall), Francois said: Even if you took the backstop element out of the bill you are still talking about a very substantial bill. You\u2019d have to spend weeks in parliament [\u2026] and you\u2019d have weeks and weeks of people like [Dominic] Grieve and [Oliver] Letwin and co tabling wrecking amendments. You\u2019d have a running parliamentary war probably for at least a month and I don\u2019t think that any sensible government would want that in the run up to 31st October, so in practical terms I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea. Francois also said that, even if the backstop were removed, he would still oppose the withdrawal agreement as it stands because there were \u201ctoo many other things that are wrong with it\u201d. The Telegraph claims that up to 60 Tory MPs would vote against a revived version of the withdrawal agreement with the backstop removed. Yet only 34 Tories voted against it when Theresa May tried to get her deal, including the backstop, through the Commons at the third attempt at the end of March. As a backbencher the Tory Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg started recording his own podcasts for the ConservativeHome website, under the title \u201cMoggcast\u201d. Last week he was made leader of the Commons, but he plans to continue and the latest Moggcast went up on the ConHome website this morning. Mark Wallace was interviewing Rees-Mogg. It\u2019s not exactly Newsnight or the Today programme, but there were some half-decent lines nevertheless. Here are the main points. Rees-Mogg claimed that Boris Johnson was \u201cdeeply trustworthy\u201d on Brexit. Johnson\u2019s opponents, of course, would say the opposite (a standard criticism of Johnson is that people who trust him regularly end up being let down), but Rees-Mogg was speaking in the context of leaving the EU. He said that when he was speaking in support of Johnson during the Tory leadership campaign, people often asked if Johnson would do what he was promising. They said to me: Can we trust Boris? To which my answer is, yes, and personally, I do. I think he is deeply trustworthy, strongly believes in what he\u2019s going to do, and recognises the political risk of not doing it. And therefore everything comes together for us to leave on the 31 October. Rees-Mogg said that he was \u201cgulled\u201d by Theresa May because he believed her when she said the UK would leave the EU by 29 March. \u201cHer statements were very clear. And it turned out that she didn\u2019t mean what she said, and asked for an extension.\u201d Rees-Mogg went on: I think it is inconceivable that Boris would do the same. I just don\u2019t think that is what he wants to do. Rees-Mogg said he did not think Johnson\u2019s decision to hire Dominic Cummings as an adviser would cause a problem for the parliamentary party, even though Cummings in the past has been brutally rude about some Brexiter Tory MPs. Rees-Mogg explained: Politicians are a thick-skinned lot. They don\u2019t worry about these sorts of things. The question is, are we getting the right policy direction? And I\u2019m very, very confident that we are getting the right policy direction. Rees-Mogg said he did not think John Bercow, the Speaker, was biased against Brexiters. Many Tory MPs believe Bercow is actively working to frustrate Brexit. But Rees-Mogg said he thought the Speaker was acting as \u201ca fair-minded umpire\u201d. He explained: Had the situation been reversed, had we had a strong remain government, and I as a leaver had found a parliamentary mechanism to do something that hadn\u2019t recently been done, Mr Speaker would have been open to me to do that, as he has been to them to do what they have done. I think Mr Speaker is genuinely fair-minded in what he seeks to do. And I think that his aim is to ensure House of Commons has the say that it wants. There is in fact only one ruling of his that I disagreed with, and I raised a point of order at the time, and that\u2019s on the question of forthwith. I think forthwith has a different meeting from the one Mr Speaker determined. But I think he would have done the same had the boot been on the other foot. I think people miss this. Mr Speaker is in favour of the House of Commons and the authority of the House of Commons. In that sense, he is not impartial, he is pro the House of Commons. But that is as Mr Speaker should be. In terms of the political arguments, I think he is a fair-minded umpire. Rees-Mogg said he thought the EU should realise Britain is serious about leaving on 31 October without a deal if Brussels does not agree to abandon the backstop. Asked why the EU should think the UK was serious, he replied: Well, they should believe us because of our new leader. The new prime minister is somebody of considerable force of personality who is not going to be browbeaten by them. They should believe us because of the appointment of Dominic Cummings, which seems to me to be exceptionally important as a statement as to what is going to happen. That ought to make the EU realise that it is not business as usual. It isn\u2019t a sort of wet establishment that will go along with Brino [Brexit in name only]. It is a tough-minded, clear-sighted government that will accept a decent deal, a fair deal, but will not accept a bad deal, and isn\u2019t frightened of leaving. He said the problem in the past was that Brussels did not realise there were people in the UK who believe that life will be \u201cunquestionably better\u201d outside the EU. But that is now the view of the government, he said. He said he believed a new deal with the EU could be agreed before the end of October because the EU could act very quickly when it wanted to. He explained: I think work expands to fill the time available, and you\u2019ve seen that with the European Union again and again. If you think the European Union Work could work out how to find hard to find 600 billion euros in contradiction of the treaties to bail out the euro, and got it done half an hour before the New Zealand markets opened, the EU can move quickly when it wants to, and so can the UK. So the fact that the the work has been concertinaed isn\u2019t that much of a problem. He refused to say he if he would resign if Brexit did not happen by 31 October. He said, having just been appointed, he said it was \u201ca bit premature\u201d to start answering questions about resigning. He said it was \u201cnot true\u201d to say parliament would block a no deal Brexit. He said that 31 October was set down in law as the date for leaving, and that that would only change if the UK asked for an extension or if it revoked article 50. And both of these outcomes would require a new prime minister, he said. He said that, although he is still chair of the European Research Group, which represents Tory MPs pushing for a harder Brexit, he would be standing down at its next meeting, after the summer recess, because it was not appropriate for it to be led by a cabinet minister. The SNP has also joined those criticising the Treasury\u2019s \u00a32.1bn no deal planning announcement. In a statement, its Europe spokesman Stephen Gethins said: Rather than working to avert a catastrophic no-deal exit, Boris Johnson is accelerating over the economic cliff-edge. With just three months to go before the revised Brexit date, Boris Johnson should be ruling out a no-deal exit and instead working towards bringing the Brexit chaos to an end - not pursuing an avoidable and purely ideological policy that lays bare the shameful priorities of this Tory government. The staggering \u00a36bn for a no-deal Brexit is a shameful waste of money at the same time as Tory welfare cuts are increasingly driving people to food banks and public services are still bearing the pain of Tory austerity. The People\u2019s Vote campaign, which wants a second referendum, has also criticised the Treasury\u2019s decision to announce an extra \u00a32.1bn may be spent on no deal planning. It put out this statement from Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons business committee. She said: The government is spending \u00a3130m on a no deal propaganda campaign but no one should be fooled into thinking crashing out of Europe is anything other than a disaster for our economy and a humiliation for our country. The slump in the value of the pound as the government ramped up its no deal rhetoric this week says it all \u2013 no deal will be bad for the UK. The extra government spending announced today might be necessary but no amount can ever be sufficient to clear up the mess no deal will make. And this is all money that could be better spent on the NHS, schools or reversing cuts to benefits. Boris Johnson and his hard Brexit cabinet only mentioned no deal in 2016 to dismiss the idea. Now they are trying to force it on the country. They have no right and their behaviour is an outrage against democracy. More evidence of \u201cturbo-charging\u201d in Westminster. (See 9.17am.) Last night the Department for International Trade sent out a press notice picture of the international trade secretary, Liz Truss, having a call with the Australian trade minister, Simon Birmingham. The department has just recirculated it, with a bit of extra information about what was said on the call. It says Truss told her Australian counterpart \u201cthat the UK government is turbo-charging work on securing new free trade agreements which was welcomed by Minister Birmingham who said that Australia is ready to match the fast pace set by the British government\u201d. Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, was doing a media round this morning talking about the Treasury\u2019s \u00a32.1bn no deal planning announcement. He claimed that a lot of this money would have to be spent anyway, because it related to changes that would have to be implemented even if the UK left the EU with a deal and, in his interview on the Today programme, he phrased it like this. At some point we will be leaving the European Union - hopefully by the end of October is our clear desire - so we would at some point have to do that campaign to get traders ready for the changes they\u2019ll have to do. But \u201chopefully\u201d leaving by 31 October is not the absolute commitment to be out by then come what may that Boris Johnson has promised and, as the Daily Mail\u2019s John Stevens points out, in subsequent interviews Sunak flipped back to \u201cdo or die\u201d mode. Boris Johnson is back in London today after completing the tour of the UK he embarked on to mark his appointment as prime minister and for the first time he will be chairing XS, the cabinet\u2019s EU exit strategy committee which may turn out to be the most important decision-making body in government. This is the six-strong committee that is expected to take all the key decisions on Brexit. And they are all men. Along with Johnson, the other members are: Michael Gove, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the deputy chair of the committee; Sajid Javid, the chancellor; Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary; Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary; and Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general. Overnight the Treasury announced that it was setting aside an extra \u00a32.1bn for no deal planning. In its press release, the Treasury says this will \u201cturbo-charge no deal preparations\u201d. With language like that, you can tell the government is now being run by a former motoring correspondent for GQ. Andrew Neil wouldn\u2019t approve; \u201cyou keep on saying turbo-charge, which is a meaningless phrase,\u201d he told Jeremy Hunt, in one of his many effective put-downs when he interviewed him during the leadership campaign. Here is our story about the announcement. Opposition parties and anti-Brexit groups have been damning. For Labour, the shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: This is an appalling waste of tax-payers\u2019 cash, all for the sake of Boris Johnson\u2019s drive towards a totally avoidable no deal. This government could have ruled out no deal, and spent these billions on our schools, hospitals, and people. Labour is a party for the whole of the UK, so we\u2019ll do all we can to block a no deal, crash-out Brexit \u2013 and we\u2019ll deliver a transformative economic policy that delivers for the many, not the few. The Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Chuka Umunna said: This extra money is a drop in the ocean when compared to the huge hit to the exchequer of at least \u00a390bn \u2013 according to the chancellor\u2019s predecessor \u2013 of a no-deal Brexit. They promised us an extra \u00a3350m each week for the NHS, now they are making more money available just to ensure access to medicine. This is a political choice made by an irresponsible government. The Liberal Democrats are the only party that can get into government which is committed to stopping Brexit \u2013 so we can use public monies to tackle the real problems the country faces. And Naomi Smith, CEO of the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: This is a colossal waste of money for something both parliament and the country don\u2019t want. We know a no-deal Brexit will mean shortages of foods and medicines, and we know it\u2019ll cost the country a fortune. Now the new chancellor wants to throw billions more at the problem his government is responsible for creating. Wasting money like this when we have so many other priorities is exactly why the country has turned against Brexit. We need to stop fixating on it so that we can fix the country. We are not expecting to hear much about what happens at the XS cabinet committee today. But we will hear from the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, who is holding a press conference at 12.30pm. My colleague Julia Kollewe will be leading the coverage of that on the business blog, but I will be keeping an eye on what is said too. Otherwise, it looks quiet. The Brecon and Radnorshire byelection is taking place, but we won\u2019t get the result until the early hours of tomorrow morning. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news.

I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone.

Friends of 20-year-old Cian Daly \u2013 who volunteered helping teach disabled children to fish \u2013 have set up a fundraising page to pay for a memorial bench at a nature reserve. His family described Daly, from Leigh-on-Sea, as a \u201cfree spirit\u201d in an emotional tribute. \u201cCian was very loving and always everyone\u2019s best mate,\u201d they said. \u201cHe was cheeky and popular, and everyone liked him.\u201d A keen sportsman, as well as a bike and car enthusiast, Daly will be honoured by friends later this month when they hold a \u201cride out\u201d along Southend seafront in his memory. He is the first to be named after a spate of deaths within a six-mile radius between Sunday and Tuesday. The deaths have prompted urgent warnings about the use of illegal substances. The three men and three women were found dead in their own homes. Essex police are investigating which substance was responsible but have warned against speculation about a bad batch of drugs. Daly, who went to Darlinghurst academy in Leigh-on-Sea and The Deanes school in Thundersley, was \u201creally good\u201d at athletics as a boy and played for a local football team, as well as attending cadets and a boxing club. In a statement, his family said: \u201cAs he got older, he had a passion for motorbikes, cars and fishing. On his 16th birthday he got a moped \u2026 When his friends used to have problems with their bikes, they used to bring them round to the house and he would help fix them. \u201cCian put 100% into everything and he could have done anything. He was the type of person who always had to be doing something, he wouldn\u2019t just sit around. \u201cHe lived a full and varied life, and he did that to the end. He was a bit of a free spirit and just wanted to help people. If anyone had a problem, he would drop everything for them.\u201d Daly\u2019s friend Oliver Harwood, 23, posted a tribute on Facebook in which he described him as \u201cone of the kindest people I know\u201d. Harwood said he felt numb after hearing the news that Daly \u2013 whom he nicknamed C-Dog \u2013 had died on Monday. \u201cNot only was he one of the most clever people I know (he could strip a bike engine up and down for fun when he was 16) he was also one of the kindest people I know. \u201cHe helped teach young and disabled children fishing, as well as be there for his friends 24/7.

The beneficiary in this case is Smart Works, an organisation supporting unemployed women in dressing and preparing for job interviews, of which the duchess is the royal patron.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen time and time again how finding the right clothes for women when they come for their first interview outfit makes a huge difference \u2013 you see the shoulders go back, the head held high, the huge smile on their face,\u201d says Kate Stephens, the CEO of Smart Works. \u201cWe are hugely grateful to the duchess for driving this capsule collection, and to the generosity of the brands involved. It will make a huge difference to thousands of women\u2019s lives across the UK.\u201d</p> <p>The one-to-one model was popularised by the canvas shoe brand Toms, which promised, when it launched in 2006, that for every pair it sold, it would deliver a pair of free shoes to a child in need. The approach came in for some criticism from the international development community, which argued that it did more to make consumers feel good than it did for those in poverty in Ethiopia, Haiti, Mexico and the other countries to which shoes were going. In May this year, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90344987/toms-made-buy-one-give-one-famous-now-its-updating-the-model\" title=\"\">the company changed tack</a>, instead opting to give customers the choice between giving shoes or financial grants to their cause of choice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/shortcuts/2019/jul/29/why-meghan-markles-vogue-is-bang-on-trend\">Why Meghan Markle\u2019s Vogue is bang on trend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The duchess may sidestep that criticism, with Smart Works helping women into work in the UK, which means that the initiative is less likely to have an impact on small, local businesses which offer a similar product. At the moment, Smart Works relies on donations in order to dress its clients for job interviews, as well as for their first month of work, resulting in what the Duchess describes as \u201ca potpourri of mismatched sizes and colours, not always the right stylistic choices\u201d.</p> <p>The introduction of her own range, launching next month, will combat that \u2013 although there are no suggestions yet as to what those \u201cright stylistic choices\u201d may be. No matter what the collection entails, Smart Works is sure to benefit from the \u201cMeghan effect\u201d. The fashion search engine Lyst reports that the duchess\u2019s outfits lead to an average <a href=\"https://www.lyst.com/news/kate-or-meghan-who-really-has-the-most-influence-on-fashion/\">216% increase in online searches</a> in the week after a public appearance, and it is reasonable to assume that her own collection will prompt a similar reaction \u2013 meaning plenty of smart new clothes for women seeking to enter the workplace.</p>",

The duchess teamed up with her friend, the designer Misha Nonoo, Marks &amp; Spencer, John Lewis and Jigsaw for the collection, with \u201cmany of the brands\u201d agreeing to the \u201cone-to-one model\u201d, whereby an item is donated to charity for every item that is bought. The beneficiary in this case is Smart Works, an organisation supporting unemployed women in dressing and preparing for job interviews, of which the duchess is the royal patron. \u201cWe have seen time and time again how finding the right clothes for women when they come for their first interview outfit makes a huge difference \u2013 you see the shoulders go back, the head held high, the huge smile on their face,\u201d says Kate Stephens, the CEO of Smart Works. \u201cWe are hugely grateful to the duchess for driving this capsule collection, and to the generosity of the brands involved. It will make a huge difference to thousands of women\u2019s lives across the UK.\u201d The one-to-one model was popularised by the canvas shoe brand Toms, which promised, when it launched in 2006, that for every pair it sold, it would deliver a pair of free shoes to a child in need. The approach came in for some criticism from the international development community, which argued that it did more to make consumers feel good than it did for those in poverty in Ethiopia, Haiti, Mexico and the other countries to which shoes were going. In May this year, the company changed tack, instead opting to give customers the choice between giving shoes or financial grants to their cause of choice. The duchess may sidestep that criticism, with Smart Works helping women into work in the UK, which means that the initiative is less likely to have an impact on small, local businesses which offer a similar product. At the moment, Smart Works relies on donations in order to dress its clients for job interviews, as well as for their first month of work, resulting in what the Duchess describes as \u201ca potpourri of mismatched sizes and colours, not always the right stylistic choices\u201d. The introduction of her own range, launching next month, will combat that \u2013 although there are no suggestions yet as to what those \u201cright stylistic choices\u201d may be. No matter what the collection entails, Smart Works is sure to benefit from the \u201cMeghan effect\u201d. The fashion search engine Lyst reports that the duchess\u2019s outfits lead to an average 216% increase in online searches in the week after a public appearance, and it is reasonable to assume that her own collection will prompt a similar reaction \u2013 meaning plenty of smart new clothes for women seeking to enter the workplace.",

      "bodyText": "Longtime US figure skating star Ashley Wagner said she was sexually assaulted by John Coughlin in a first-person essay published in USA Today on Thursday. The three-time US champion and 2014 Olympic bronze medalist wrote that former American skater John Coughlin climbed into bed with her when she was 17 and he was 22, then kissed and groped her without her permission. The incident took place after a house party during the US team\u2019s training camp in Colorado Springs in June 2008. Wagner, 28, is the latest figure skater to make an accusation against Coughlin, the two-time US pairs champion who killed himself in January, a day after he received an interim coaching suspension from the US Center for SafeSport and US Figure Skating for unspecified conduct. He was 33. \u201cI now know that regardless of the events of that night, I got into that bed thinking I was safe to just fall asleep,\u201d Wagner wrote. \u201cHe was the one who took away that safety.

      "body": "<p>After finishing his 2017 album Purgatory, Tyler Childers was talking to his producer, Sturgill Simpson. \u201cHe said: \u2018This might do something,\u2019\u201d Childers recalls. \u201c\u2018You might be able to make a land payment. You\u2019ll never see the land, but it\u2019ll be there!\u2019 And we just laughed about it a little. And then he was right.\u201d</p> <p>Purgatory, Childers\u2019s second album, proved to be his first big success. It reached No 17 on the US country chart, and Childers was named emerging artist of the year at the 2018 Americana awards. He made that land payment, too, with his wife, the singer-songwriter Senora May, for a plot a decent drive outside the small Kentucky town of Irvine.</p> <p>I met Childers in Kentucky in June, a few days shy of his 28th birthday. Bouncing along mountain roads in a beautifully weathered sky-blue 1979 Jeep truck that he says he got cheap from a spendthrift guy a few towns away (\u201cI got the angry-girlfriend discount,\u201d Childers says), he pulls over at a local petrol station where men in the parking lot greet him as if it has been a while. The clerk compliments his haircut. His long, fiery curls have been trimmed short \u2013 it\u2019s hot out, Childers says. He is wearing a Wrangler jacket and Rustler jeans, through which a belt is hooked that reads BEYONC\u00c9.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrHd3nkCIz4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DrHd3nkCIz4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Last year, Childers was on the road so often that he considered himself lucky if he got back home long enough to mow the grass. This year, he is just back from 10 straight weeks of touring, including dates opening for Willie Nelson and for John Prine, with whom he released a limited-edition cover of Paradise, Prine\u2019s famous 1971 Kentucky-set song about the devastation of strip mining.</p> <p>Childers is the son of a strip miner and vocal about its environmental impact, but with an insider\u2019s respect for its workers. \u201cWe can be positive participants, or we can hold on to this extraction behaviour,\u201d he says. Miners are among the people who populate his songs, alongside fox hunters, millworkers and barroom regulars. On Peace of Mind, from his new album Country Squire, a menthol-smoking, Avon makeup-selling mother of a cheerleader distractedly burns frozen waffles as she works over what went wrong in her life. Childers is partial, he once told an interviewer, to characters that are led astray.</p> <p>Musically, the \u201cancient\u201d quality that people mention in Childers\u2019s songs owes to an allegiance to Kentucky\u2019s deep country and bluegrass roots. From where we stand now, it is another two hours to where Childers was born and raised, between Paintsville and Louisa \u2013 so close to West Virginia that when the chef Anthony Bourdain did an episode of his travelogue Parts Unknown in that state, he featured Childers\u2019s songs. \u201cStraight as the crow flies, I grew up 20 minutes from 23,\u201d Childers says. The US Route 23 is also known as Kentucky\u2019s Country Music Highway, the road near which Dwight Yoakam, Chris Stapleton, Tom T Hall, Loretta Lynn and Ricky Skaggs have lived.</p> <p>As a kid, Childers owned three cassettes, two of them by Skaggs, and he listened on repeat, hooked by the fusion of country and bluegrass. He absorbed his dad\u2019s Creedence Clearwater Revival, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Alabama records, using a coat rack to mime the guitar riffs, until he realised it would be a lot cooler to actually learn to play. Teenage Childers fell for Bob Dylan and Jack Kerouac; meanwhile, an English teacher was feeding his head with Kentucky writers, such as Jesse Stuart and Silas House, who struck him as both revelatory and knowable. \u201cIt was like, why am I trying to find my voice?\u201d Childers says. \u201cI am blessed to be in a place that has its own.\u201d</p> <p>This takes on greater importance when you hail from one of the most misunderstood regions of the country. \u201cBourdain got it right,\u201d he says. \u201cHe laid out the good, bad and the ugly. But so many don\u2019t.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9592c1d3fc1ec13b020fbc6e1597603d2e6942e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9592c1d3fc1ec13b020fbc6e1597603d2e6942e1/0_29_1140_684/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tyler Childers: \u2018The problem with country is we\u2019ve turned the props into the play.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tyler Childers: \u2018The problem with country is we\u2019ve turned the props into the play.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David McClister</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I tell him I grew up in western North Carolina, also part of Appalachia. The endless mountain road construction, the paper mill and fox hides that Childers sings of on Country Squire ring familiar to me, but Childers\u2019s landscape is also highly specific, a counternarrative to the outsiders who seek to perpetuate stereotypes of backwardness and poverty. \u201cPiss-poor anthropology,\u201d as Childers puts it.</p> <p>\u201cThere are different pockets of the rural US and each one of those has their own colour, their own language, the things they\u2019re worried about,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re so different.\u201d It\u2019s hard to think of a great country singer who isn\u2019t also a poet of place, but those singers are becoming hard to find. As Childers says of Nashville: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to move to one of the biggest-growing cities in the nation to sit in a room with 12 people and write a country song. They\u2019re all singing songs about \u2018the place down the road\u2019, but what is that place now?\u201d</p> <p>Childers released his first album when he was 19 and for years worked in landscaping jobs, couch-surfing and playing regional gigs. Miles Miller, Sturgill Simpson\u2019s drummer, happened to catch one of those, making sure Simpson was in the audience the next time Childers played Nashville. \u201cCall me when you\u2019re ready,\u201d Simpson said. When he heard a demo of Childers\u2019s second album, Simpson told him: \u201cThe songwriting is there, but this doesn\u2019t do justice to what I saw you do on stage.\u201d That\u2019s how Childers found himself in the studio with Simpson and David Ferguson, Johnny Cash\u2019s engineer, for the recording of Purgatory. And when it came time to record Country Squire, Childers went back to them. This time around, he had been endlessly listening to Allen Touissant\u2019s Southern Nights \u2013 the great 1975 psychedelic soul ode to Touissant\u2019s Louisiana creole evenings. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect song cycle,\u201d Childers says. He wanted Country Squire to have the same seamless-feeling structure, but set in Kentucky.</p> <p>At the Americana awards, when Childers stepped up in a Colonel Sanders-style suit to accept the emerging artist award, he voiced his frustration with the genre. \u201cAmericana ain\u2019t no part of nothin\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a distraction from the issues that we are facing on a bigger level as country music singers.\u201d</p> <p>Defined by Merriam-Webster as \u201ca genre of American music having roots in early folk and country music\u201d, Americana, Childers says, started as \u201ca place to recognise people being ignored by their own genres, but now it\u2019s a hindrance. The stuff we used to call \u2018good country\u2019 is now getting called Americana. We\u2019ve not fixed the problem of bad country.\u201d</p> <p>Country, Childers says, became vague and commercial. \u201cThe problem with country is we\u2019ve turned the props into the play,\u201d he says of the commercialisation of the songs. \u201cLet\u2019s not just <a href=\"https://www.solocup.com/\" title=\"\">Solo cup</a> and pickup truck it to death. Let\u2019s handle this in a smart way. Nobody is thinking about lyrical content, or how we\u2019re moving people, or what\u2019s going on in the background of their minds.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Americana ain\u2019t no part of nothin' \u2013 it's a distraction from the issues we face as country music singers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I had wanted to hear Country Squire in the place it came from, and Childers obliges. The location of his land is a secret he would like to keep, but he drives us in so many circles it would be near-impossible to find again anyway. He plays his phone through the stereo, and the Jeep charges along switchback roads and through deep dappled woods as Childers and the band launch into the title song, which chimes in with Childers\u2019s life on the road and his yearning to settle down \u2013 before that land payment, he and Senora May considered living full-time in a camper van.</p> <p>There is an obvious kinship with Simpson, Yoakam, Prine and Skaggs in these songs, along with the shimmery imprint of Touissant\u2019s starlit nights and traces of Gram Parsons\u2019s cosmic country. But they are grounded in real life, whether it is songs of nightshift railmen or the innuendo-laden lament of a singer on the road that is Everlovin\u2019 Hand. When the pedal steel shows up on songs such as Country Squire and Creeker, it is a reverent presence.</p> <p>Childers quit church by his teens, but he absorbed the music of the primitive Baptist church, where the pedal steel was often the only instrument played. \u201cSome of that church music, it\u2019s like this pure, raw, unfiltered emotion,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted these songs to have a little of that Baptist bounce.\u201d</p> <p>Occasionally and perhaps deliberately as we drive, Childers drifts the other lane. \u201cMy dad always said, I pay taxes on both sides,\u201d he jokes and shifts into low gear to make the next ascent. The songs fuse into the landscape, blend into each other around the disappearing curves. I don\u2019t know the name of the road we\u2019re on, but this music has a place on US 23.</p> <p><em>Country Squire is released on 2 August</em></p>",

At the Americana awards, when Childers stepped up in a Colonel Sanders-style suit to accept the emerging artist award, he voiced his frustration with the genre. \u201cAmericana ain\u2019t no part of nothin\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a distraction from the issues that we are facing on a bigger level as country music singers.\u201d Defined by Merriam-Webster as \u201ca genre of American music having roots in early folk and country music\u201d, Americana, Childers says, started as \u201ca place to recognise people being ignored by their own genres, but now it\u2019s a hindrance. The stuff we used to call \u2018good country\u2019 is now getting called Americana. We\u2019ve not fixed the problem of bad country.\u201d Country, Childers says, became vague and commercial. \u201cThe problem with country is we\u2019ve turned the props into the play,\u201d he says of the commercialisation of the songs. \u201cLet\u2019s not just Solo cup and pickup truck it to death. Let\u2019s handle this in a smart way. Nobody is thinking about lyrical content, or how we\u2019re moving people, or what\u2019s going on in the background of their minds.\u201d I had wanted to hear Country Squire in the place it came from, and Childers obliges. The location of his land is a secret he would like to keep, but he drives us in so many circles it would be near-impossible to find again anyway. He plays his phone through the stereo, and the Jeep charges along switchback roads and through deep dappled woods as Childers and the band launch into the title song, which chimes in with Childers\u2019s life on the road and his yearning to settle down \u2013 before that land payment, he and Senora May considered living full-time in a camper van. There is an obvious kinship with Simpson, Yoakam, Prine and Skaggs in these songs, along with the shimmery imprint of Touissant\u2019s starlit nights and traces of Gram Parsons\u2019s cosmic country. But they are grounded in real life, whether it is songs of nightshift railmen or the innuendo-laden lament of a singer on the road that is Everlovin\u2019 Hand. When the pedal steel shows up on songs such as Country Squire and Creeker, it is a reverent presence. Childers quit church by his teens, but he absorbed the music of the primitive Baptist church, where the pedal steel was often the only instrument played. \u201cSome of that church music, it\u2019s like this pure, raw, unfiltered emotion,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted these songs to have a little of that Baptist bounce.\u201d Occasionally and perhaps deliberately as we drive, Childers drifts the other lane. \u201cMy dad always said, I pay taxes on both sides,\u201d he jokes and shifts into low gear to make the next ascent. The songs fuse into the landscape, blend into each other around the disappearing curves. I don\u2019t know the name of the road we\u2019re on, but this music has a place on US 23. Country Squire is released on 2 August",

In total, there were 657,076 live births in England and Wales last year \u2013 a fall of 3.2% from the previous year and down by 10% from 2012. The number of live births fell from 11.6 per 1,000 people to 11.1, the lowest since records started in 1938. The figures, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), also showed that the percentage of live babies with mothers not born in the UK also fell for the first time since 1990, from 28.4% to 28.2%. Since 1947, the rate has dropped by 45.9%, when the number of babies being born was at its ultimate peak. Although Britain\u2019s ageing population means the proportion of older people compared with women of childbearing age is increasing, the record low in crude birthrates is mostly being driven by falling fertility rates. Except for 1977 and the period between 1999 and 2002, total fertility rates are also lower than all previous years since records began. ONS figures show that overall fertility rates stood at 1.7 children per woman in 2018, a 3.4% decrease from the year before, when the rate was 1.76. While crude birthrates are calculated per 1,000 of the entire population, regardless of sex or age, total fertility rates refer only to women between 15 and 44 years old, who are deemed to be of childbearing age. Although women aged 40 and over were the only demographic for whom the rate of fertility did not fall, in 2018 the rate stalled for the first time since the 1970s, at 16.1 per 1,000.

Uncertainty in the UK economy remains acute, given the multiple different Brexit scenarios that are still in play. We expect the Bank to keep rates on hold until a clear outcome on Brexit has been determined. Lower interest rates are likely in the event of a no-deal scenario, while if a deal is struck and economic growth is maintained, the Bank would be likely to pursue its previous course of raising interest rates slowly. For now, inflation is not a major issue, as it remains close to the Bank\u2019s target of 2%. </p> \n   <p>The Bank noted that Brexit uncertainty has become entrenched in the economy in 2019 and that this has pulled down the rate of economic growth to below trend. Our view on the economy is similar: we expect growth of 1.4% this year and 1.3% in 2020, on the assumption that a no deal Brexit is avoided. The Bank reduced its forecasts in its accompanying inflation report to 1.3% in both years. Subdued growth is likely to continue until businesses are provided with clarity on Brexit.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England kept interest rates unchanged as it cut its growth forecast for this year and next to 1.3%, in its last set of projections before the official Brexit date of 31 October. The central bank warned that Britain has a one in three chance of plunging into recession as uncertainty over Brexit drags down the economy. Its forecasts assume an orderly Brexit. Most major stock markets are trading lower, as traders digest the US Federal Reserve\u2019s rate cut and the message that there won\u2019t be many more to come as the economy is in pretty good shape \u2013 disappointing markets (and Donald Trump). Following yesterday\u2019s bounce, the pound resumed its downward path and fell 0.6% on the day to below $1.21 \u2013 the first time it has been below this level since January 2017. The main reason for this decline is the dollar\u2019s strength in the wake of the Fed remarks, but sterling is generally under pressure amid mounting fears of a no-deal Brexit under the new prime minister, Boris Johnson. Against the euro, sterling is down 0.28% at \u20ac1.0950. Closely-watched PMI surveys out this morning painted a bleak picture of the manufacturing sectors in the UK and main eurozone countries, including Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Good-bye and have a great weekend \u2013 we\u2019ll be back on Monday. Wall Street is trading higher after the opening bell. Dow Jones up 21.4 points, or 0.08%, at 26,885 S&amp;P 500 up 1.96 points, or 0.07%, at 2,982 Nasdaq up 20.57 points, or 0.25%, at 8,195 Here is our economics editor Larry Elliott\u2019s take on the Bank of England\u2019s projections. Here is our full story on the pound sinking to a fresh 2 1/12 year low against the US dollar today, below $1.21. It is currently hovering just above $1.21, down 0.4% on the day, and is largely flat against the euro at \u20ac1.0973. The main reason is the strengthening of the dollar after the Fed made clear that yesterday\u2019s rate reduction was not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts, while the pound is also under pressure from growing nervousness around a no-deal Brexit. That was the last question at the Bank of England\u2019s press conference. Question: You are just a bunch of gloomsters, talking the economy down? Carney appears unfazed. (It\u2019s not the first time he has faced this question.) He replies: We give our best view of where we expect the economy to go. He then notes that uncertainty has increased due to Brexit. It\u2019s also clear that there has been a substantial shortfall in investment. The trade response to lower sterling has begun to fade, in part due to weaker global [demand]. He adds that the Bank sets policy in a way that supports the economy, and took appropriate action after the 2016 referendum. Carney says that markets functioned well after the shock 2016 Brexit vote \u2013 \u201cheavy volumes, big moves in sterling but the markets functioned well\u201d. He says it is \u201chighly, highly unlikely\u201d that the Bank will need to take action to stabilise markets if there is a no-deal Brexit. What one wants when you have a big economic shock and we\u2019ve learned this, and we are a firm believer in it, is that markets adjust. Carney says the Bank will publish an updated version of its worst-case Brexit scenario after the Treasury select committee reconvenes in September, after receiving a request from the parliamentary committee. Here are some of the Bank of England governor\u2019s earlier comments on no-deal Brexit in full. In the event of no-deal, no-transition Brexit, sterling would likely fall, the risk premiums on UK assets would rise and volatility would spike higher. Similarly preparations by governments and businesses for no deal are vital to reduce the potentially damaging transition costs to a WTO [World Trade Organisation] relationship with the EU. But those preparations cannot eliminate the fundamental economic adjustments to a new trading arrangement that a no-deal Brexit would entail. Question: what would a no-deal Brexit mean for the global economy? Carny replies that it would be \u201can unwelcome development for the global economy\u201d and that multilateralism is already under some strain. This would be part of that narrative and it\u2019s creeping into the way businesses organise themselves, in particular how they organise their supply chains. You can watch the press conference live here. Asked if there would be a massive stimulus after a no deal, Carney responds that it depends on the situation, and that the Bank \u201cwill do what we can\u201d but \u201cthere are limits\u201d \u2013 as the Bank would still need to achieve its inflation target. He says there could be trade disruption \u2013 problems at ports \u2013 and supply disruption. We will have to take a judgement in that event whether on balance the inflationary pressures ... whether we can look through those and provide support to the economy as it adjusts. We will do what we can in those circumstances to support jobs and activity but there are limits. UK households at the moment are acting prudently, spending within their means, Carney says. He notes that there is a strong labour market and wages are growing at the fastest pace since before the financial crisis in 2008. Here is a chart illustrating the central growth forecast from the Bank of England\u2019s inflation report. Question: What is the probability of no-deal at the end of October? The financial policy committee at the Bank of England has assumed the possibility of no deal all along, says Carney, and the core financial sector is ready for no deal. He says the prime minister has been clear that his policy is to get a Brexit deal. The Institute of Directors said the Bank was right to keep rates unchanged, but must not shy from taking pre-emptive action in the shape of a pre-Brexit cut, if a no-deal outcome looks likely. Tej Parikh, the IoD\u2019s chief economist, said: With limited visibility, the Bank of England is right to err on the side of caution today by holding interest rates steady. As it stands, the MPC still needs further clarity on the nature of Brexit and the effectiveness of the new Government\u2019s preparations before wading into what are now critical changes in monetary policy. Though the recent decline in sterling could lead to higher inflation down the line, right now uncertainty and hiccups in global growth are pinching economic activity and elevating the risk of a downturn. All eyes will be on the MPC\u2019s September meeting. If a disorderly exit from the EU is on the cards, the Bank must not shy away from lowering interest rates in advance to support businesses and households through the turbulence. Waiting until after the fact could lower the impact of any action taken. While inflation is set to rise over the next two to three years due to the weaker pound, it will initially fall, by half a percentage point below the 2% target in coming months as lower energy bills feed through, Carney says at the press conference. Here is some reaction from economists. Mike Jakeman, senior economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers, says: It was no surprise that the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold. Uncertainty in the UK economy remains acute, given the multiple different Brexit scenarios that are still in play. We expect the Bank to keep rates on hold until a clear outcome on Brexit has been determined. Lower interest rates are likely in the event of a no-deal scenario, while if a deal is struck and economic growth is maintained, the Bank would be likely to pursue its previous course of raising interest rates slowly. For now, inflation is not a major issue, as it remains close to the Bank\u2019s target of 2%. The Bank noted that Brexit uncertainty has become entrenched in the economy in 2019 and that this has pulled down the rate of economic growth to below trend. Our view on the economy is similar: we expect growth of 1.4% this year and 1.3% in 2020, on the assumption that a no deal Brexit is avoided. The Bank reduced its forecasts in its accompanying inflation report to 1.3% in both years. Subdued growth is likely to continue until businesses are provided with clarity on Brexit. Thereafter, a very wide range of outcomes are possible, depending on the access granted to the UK\u2019s main trading partners in Europe. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has kicked off the press conference. He is reading out his opening remarks. The pound is trading at $1.2115 now, down 0.37% on the day \u2013 similar to where it was just before the Bank of England rate decision and economic projections were released. It has firmed slightly against the euro to \u20ac1.0982. The FTSE 100 index is also still down \u2013 by some 20 points at 7,567.42, a 0.25% drop. On the other hand, if there is a downturn due to Brexit, the Bank could cut rates or take other action, it hinted: Increased uncertainty about the nature of EU withdrawal means that the economy could follow a wide range of paths over coming years. The appropriate path of monetary policy will depend on the balance of the effects of Brexit on demand, supply and the exchange rate. The monetary policy response to Brexit, whatever form it takes, will not be automatic and could be in either direction. In all circumstances, the committee will set monetary policy appropriately to achieve the 2% inflation target. If there is a smooth Brexit and the economy holds up, interest rates may well rise, the Bank of England said in its quarterly inflation report. Assuming a smooth Brexit and some recovery in global growth, a significant margin of excess demand is likely to build in the medium term. Were that to occur, the Committee judges that increases in interest rates, at a gradual pace and to a limited extent, would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to the 2% target. Here is our story, from the Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent Richard Partington stationed at the Bank of England. He writes: Despite the growing risks to the economy, the Bank said it continued to assume a smooth Brexit deal with Brussels can be reached \u2013 a position it acknowledged was increasingly inconsistent with the market reaction. Should Britain crash out without a deal, the Bank warned the pound could drop sharply and inflation would rise and GDP growth would slow further. The Bank of England is now forecasting GDP growth of 1.3% for 2019 and 2020, down from 1.5% and 1.6% respectively in its previous projections in May. The forecasts assume Britain avoids a disorderly Brexit. The Bank expects inflation, which is currently on target at 2%, to exceed its target in two and three years\u2019 time, and by a greater margin than it predicted in May. The Bank of England also warned that Britain has a one in three chance of plunging into recession as uncertainty over Brexit drags down the economy, writes our economics correspondent Richard Partington. Threadneedle Street pencilled in zero growth for GDP in the second quarter even before Britain leaves the EU. The central bank said: Underlying growth appears to have slowed since 2018 to a rate below potential, reflecting both the impact of intensifying Brexit-related uncertainties on business investment and weaker global growth on net trade. The Bank noted that the increased risk of a disorderly Brexit had led to a \u201cmarked depreciation of the sterling exchange rate\u201d \u2013 which is near a three-year low against a basket of major currencies \u2013 and that since mid-July, business uncertainty about Brexit had become \u201cmore entrenched\u201d. Bank of England policymakers voted 9-0 to hold the key interest rate at 0.75%. Breaking: The Bank of England has held interest rates at 0.75%, as expected, and cut its economic growth forecasts. It is the central bank\u2019s last set of economic forecasts before the UK is due to leave the EU at the end of October. Sterling is now 0.6% lower against the dollar at $1.2086, and has fallen 0.23% against the euro to \u20ac1.0955. The pound has just gone below $1.21, falling 0.53% to $1.2096. It has fallen below $1.21 for the first time since January 2017. The Bank of England is in a difficult position. On the one hand, the sharp fall in the pound threatens to push up inflation, which would normally warrant high interest rates, but on the other hand the UK teeters on the brink of a cliff-edge Brexit, which could plunge the economy into recession. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at trading platform London Capital Group, has looked at this dilemma more closely: The significantly cheaper pound is a rising threat for inflation in Britain. Increasingly expensive imported product prices should translate into a higher consumer price inflation sooner rather than later. Henceforward, the BoE policymakers have a hard task. In one hand, they should give the necessary support to the UK\u2019s economy threatened by a messy Brexit and a kneejerk economic shock in the immediate aftermath of the separation that could happen as early as October 31st. On the other hand, the stiff depreciation in pound gives them a tight manoeuvre margin for setting up a dovish monetary policy given that the annual inflation is already at the 2% level and the pound continues bleeding. Although a BoE rate cut is unimaginable right now, the heavy sell-off in sterling could invigorate the BoE hawks. And if Boris Johnson lets the pound fall free, then Mark Carney may have no choice but to open the parachute. Here is a summary of the action in markets so far today, while we wait for the main event \u2013 the Bank of England\u2019s latest interest rate decision and economic forecasts. Stock markets have been rattled by US Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell\u2019s remarks that yesterday\u2019s interest rate cut \u2013 the first since December 2008, which reversed last year\u2019s tightening \u2013 was not the start of long series of rate cuts. Donald Trump was not impressed. The comments have given the US dollar a big boost. It has hit two-year highs against the euro and a basket of six major currencies. Against the pound, the dollar rose to a 2 1/2 year high of $1.2101 and is still trading near that rate. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 0.2% Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.26% France\u2019s CAC 40 down 0.04% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.75% Spain\u2019s Ibex 35 up 0.18% Closely watched surveys for the UK and eurozone have pained a bleak picture of manufacturing. In the UK, manufacturers cut production at the fastest pace since 2012, while the eurozone\u2019s factories recorded their biggest overall decline in 6 1/2 years. In other news: the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Paul Johnson, has slammed the government\u2019s plans for an emergency budget in October as an \u201cextraordinarily bad idea\u201d. The think-tank director\u2019s stark warning comes after Kit Malthouse, a junior minister in Boris Johnson\u2019s government, suggested on national television there would be an emergency budget in the autumn. Johnson told Public Finance: My view is that having an early budget in anticipation of a no deal Brexit is an extraordinarily bad idea. It\u2019s hard to come up with a very good reason for doing it. Having a budget which presumes the outcome [of Brexit] would seem a little odd frankly \u2013 why go out of the gate before you know where you are headed? By holding a Budget in the first week of October \u201cyou can\u2019t do anything very much that\u2019s going to make any difference by the first week of November,\u201d Johnson said. I am sure that Treasury officials will be advising against it, but I have no sense as to how big the political impetus behind planning for it is. He tweeted: \u201cMake the decisions after, not before, the most crucial piece of information is available.\u201d Reuters have spoken to Gary Lacey, who was buying euros at a money exchange shop in London\u2019s Canary Wharf ahead of a four-day trip to Austria. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed rather than surprised,\u201d he said of the pound\u2019s latest move lower. He recalled the strong euro-sterling rates of the early 2000s, before the pound was pummelled by the global financial crisis and Brexit. The days of \u20ac1.60 are probably long gone. But you have to pay or you just don\u2019t go on holiday. UK holiday makers heading abroad in August will be feeling the effect of the weaker pound, which lurched lower again today. Sterling is currently trading close to a 2 1/2-year low of $1.2101 hit overnight. It is off 0.38% at $1.2112. The main reason behind the latest decline is the Fed \u2013 its chairman Jerome Powell made clear that yesterday\u2019s interest rate cut was not the beginning of a lengthy easing cycle, which lifted the dollar to two-year highs against the euro and other major currencies. But sterling has been under pressure for some time as fears of a no-deal Brexit have intensified in recent days, given the rhetoric from new British prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s government. The weak manufacturing survey is not helping either. The pound has lost about 7% of its value against the euro since mid-May. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, believes UK consumers will continue to offset weak manufacturing production through their spending. The manufacturing sector is reeling from the twin hits of the global slowdown and the shift in the timing of orders due to the original Brexit deadline in March. Manufacturers, however, remained relatively optimistic about the outlook, with 46% expecting output to be higher in a year\u2019s time and only 10% anticipating contraction. In addition, demand should start to ramp up soon as manufacturers\u2019 customers rebuild their stocks again ahead of the October Brexit deadline, though many appear to have maintained unusually high inventory levels over the summer. Looking through the volatility created by the October Brexit deadline, manufacturing likely will drag modestly on growth even if a no-deal Brexit is avoided, due to weak global demand. But with consumers set to enjoy a burst from strong real disposable income growth, thanks partly to a renewed fall in inflation, we continue to expect GDP growth to be close to its trend rate in the second half of this year, persuading the Bank of England to keep Bank Rate on hold, rather than follow other central banks with more stimulus. Seamus Nevin, chief economist at Make UK, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said this bodes badly for the UK economy as a whole. Today\u2019s numbers prove that the UK economy is undeniably on a downward trajectory with output, new orders, and employment all falling again. Companies are cutting back on both day-to-day spending and capital investment as the downturn in activity continues, reflecting growing fears of a crash out Brexit and worrying global trade conditions. This is not a good time for our economy to be preparing to go it alone. Eurozone Manufacturing PMI also fell, signalling the quickest decline in the region\u2019s manufacturing sector since the peak of the global financial crisis in 2012. This came off the back of the two major economies of France and Germany each suffering a renewed decline. The downturn experienced by the UK\u2019s main trading partners, and slower world economic growth, combined with foreign customers routing supply chains away from the UK in advance of Brexit has hit British business hard in recent months. Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, added: A killer combination of economic uncertainty and the weakest production levels for seven years, battered the manufacturing sector into contraction for the third consecutive month in July. New orders fell as businesses used up stockpiled materials, EU businesses moved supply chains out of the UK and weakness in the global economy stifled demand from both domestic and export markets. Unsurprisingly the decline in employment levels followed suit with one of the sharpest cuts to jobs for more than six years as businesses hesitated to keep calm and carry on and build staff levels. However, optimism for the future stayed relatively buoyant, he noted, in the hope that certainty will once again return to UK shores soon and in spite of the increase in no-deal Brexit rhetoric. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said: July saw the UK manufacturing sector suffocating under the choke-hold of slower global economic growth, political uncertainty and the unwinding of earlier Brexit stockpiling activity. Production volumes fell at the fastest pace in seven years as clients delayed, cancelled or re-routed orders away from the UK, leading to a further decline in new work intakes from both domestic and overseas markets. The British manufacturing survey also paints a bleak picture. Manufacturers cut production at the fastest pace in seven years. The headline index stayed at 48.0 in July, the joint-lowest since February 2013. The sub-index measuring output fell to 47 from 47.2 in June, the lowest since July 2012. The headline manufacturing index has signalled a contraction in the eurozone for six months in a row. The reading of 46.5 pointed to the sharpest deterioration in operating conditions since December 2012, IHS Markit said. Factory output and orders are both down markedly as confidence hit its lowest level since December 2012. Firms are also hiring less, with employment recording its sharpest reduction in more than six years. IHS Markit said: Germany remained a source of weakness, with its manufacturing economy recording its sharpest deterioration in operating conditions for seven years. Austria recorded its lowest PMI level in just under five years, whilst there were also below 50.0 readings seen in France, Ireland, Italy and Spain. In contrast, the Netherlands and Greece continued to expand, although growth in the former was only marginal and unmoved on June\u2019s six-year low. In the eurozone as a whole, the manufacturing sector is declining at the fastest pace since the end of 2012, according to the closely-watched purchasing managers\u2019 index from IHS Markit. In Germany, manufacturers are struggling even more. Its PMI headline reading has dropped to a seven-year low of 43.2 in July from 45 in June. Export orders are the worst since the height of the financial crisis. Turning to France, the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy after Germany: Its manufacturing sector has gone into decline, according to the latest PMI survey, with the headline reading falling from 51.9 to 49.7 in July \u2013 below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. In Spain, manufacturing is also still declining despite a slight improvement. The closely-watched PMI manufacturing surveys have started to come out. The Italian survey signals a further decline in manufacturing in July, although there has been a slight improvement. A reading below 50 indicates contraction; a reading above points to expansion. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, noted that the Fed \u201cnever cuts rates just once\u201d. He said how the US-China trade war pans out will be critical. We characterise this as an early pre-emptive move to help ensure the longest US economic expansion on record continues. It will likely ease again, but not by as much as the market is pricing in... Domestic demand is strong, asset prices are high, the labour market is robust and even the manufacturing sector has shown renewed signs of life thanks to the US-China trade truce. Indeed, the strength of the consumer sector can certainly offset some of the headwinds from lingering global growth worries. Nonetheless, the Fed continues to highlight the \u201cuncertainties\u201d and it is the trade story that remains critical to the outlook for policy. This is very firmly in President Trump\u2019s hands. Should tensions escalate once again, tariffs are hiked, markets sell-off and economic weakness spreads then the Federal Reserve will respond with more stimulus given the benign inflation backdrop. Some economists agree with the Fed\u2019s assessment that a series of aggressive rate cuts are not warranted, arguing that the US economy is in pretty good shape. (Some say the Fed should not have cut rates at all.) Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said: Financial markets continue to expect that further easing will be necessary to protect growth, and after today\u2019s move are still pricing in two or three additional 25bps rate cuts by the end of 2020. We believe this is excessive, given the relative resilience of the US economy to-date and recent evidence that suggests inflation may be bottoming out. Barring a marked deterioration in the economic outlook, we expect the Fed to implement at most one more 25bps cut and then to remain on hold through the end of 2020. European stock markets have also opened lower. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 0.2% at 7,570 Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.32% at 12,149 France\u2019s CAC 40 down 0.14% at 5,511 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.7% at 21,554 Spain\u2019s Ibex 35 up 0.18% at 8,987 Asian shares fell to the lowest levels in six weeks while the dollar hit two-year highs after the US central bank ruled out a lengthy easing cycle following yesterday\u2019s interest rate cut, the first since December 2008. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.7% to 519.13. Japan\u2019s Nikkei reversed earlier declines and ended the day a touch higher. The Australian stock market lost 0.35% and the Chinese CSI 300 index, which tracks the top 300 stocks traded in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, dropped 0.8%. Nick Maroutsos, co-head of global bonds at Janus Henderson, said: We believe the Fed is trying to thread the needle, balancing market jitters about slowing global growth with robust consumer spending and a strong job market in the US. In other words, by cutting just 25 basis points, the Fed is trying to bolster market confidence while also keeping some dry powder in reserve in case of an economic shock. The pound is weaker against the US dollar this morning, after a 0.7% bounce yesterday afternoon turned out to be short-lived. This is mainly because the dollar jumped after Fed chief Jerome Powell ruled out a long series of rate cuts following yesterday\u2019s quarter-point reduction, designed to shore up the US economy amid weaker global growth. Traders still expect at least one more interest rate cut this year but do not expect them to continue into next year. The dollar hit a two-year peak against the euro and a two-month high against the yen today. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies rose 0.37% to a two-year high of 98.884. Sterling weakened to $1.2101 overnight in Asian trading \u2013 the lowest since January 2017. It is now trading at $1.2118, down 0.35%. In the past three months, the currency has lost 7.1% due to growing fears that Britain could crash out of the EU at the end of October without an agreement in place. Against the euro, the pound is more or less flat at \u20ac1.0971. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The US Federal Reserve delivered its first interest rate cut in more than a decade yesterday, reducing its target range by a quarter point to of 2%-2.25%. The US central bank also signalled its readiness to provide more support, as Fed chair Jerome Powell talked about the impact of weak global growth and the US-China trade war. But he disappointed markets by saying that this was \u201cnot the beginning of a long series of rate cuts\u201d \u2013 although he added: \u201cI didn\u2019t say it\u2019s just one rate cut.\u201d Donald Trump was not pleased as he had called for a more aggressive cut in interest rates, and tweeted: \u201cPowell let us down.\u201d Markets also did not like it, in particular Powell\u2019s description of the move as a \u201cmid-cycle adjustment to policy\u201d rather than the \u201cthe beginning of a lengthy cutting cycle\u201d. Wall Street sold off, with the Dow Jones losing 1.2% and the S&amp;P 500 down 1.09%. European stocks are set to open flat to slightly higher. At midday today, the Bank of England announces the outcome of its monthly meeting. The City is not expecting any changes to Bank rate, which is set to stay at 0.75%. The Bank\u2019s latest quarterly growth and inflation forecasts will be the main focus. It is the last round of forecasts before Britain is scheduled to leave the EU on 31 October, and the central bank is expected to downgrade its 2019 growth forecast, possibly to 1.3% from 1.5% in May. Until now the Bank has assumed an orderly departure as the basis for its forecasts but with the risks of a no-deal Brexit rising under the new prime minister Boris Johnson, it will be interesting to see what the Bank\u2019s thinking is. Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg Bank, said: The BoE is likely to set out its stall for the various possible Brexit outcomes this week. We expect the BoE to offer two sets of guidance: As its base case, the BoE will signal continued rate hikes over the medium-term, on the assumption that there is an orderly Brexit on October 31 \u2013 or even in another lengthy delay. But more than before, we expect the BoE to emphasise how it may act in the downside scenario of a hard Brexit at the end of October. With pro-Brexit Boris Johnson becoming UK Prime Minister, this has become a much more pertinent issue in recent weeks. Expect the BoE to signal that \u2019more likely than not\u2019 it would ease policy to help buffer the shock of a no deal Brexit outcome.

      "body": "<p>New figures released on Wednesday confirmed what we already knew: homeownership is becoming increasingly out of reach for young people. A survey by Santander found 70% of 18- to 34-year-olds now believe that homeownership is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jul/31/young-britons-believe-dream-of-owning-home-is-over-survey-says\">over for their generation</a>. Our housing system has been allowed to degenerate to such an extent that secure and affordable housing is increasingly unavailable to working-class people, and in many places middle-class people too. But it\u2019s not for a lack of ideas that this has happened. What we are lacking is the political will.</p> <p>Fifty years ago the country had a fairly stable housing system. The need for secure, affordable housing of the middle class was largely met through homeownership, and that of the working class through widely available social housing. But a reliance on the private market to deliver homes since the 1980s, and the loss of millions of social homes over recent decades, has destroyed this system.</p> <p>In the 1980s, after moving to a new town, my parents left their council house and bought a home. They were able to do this because the historic link between house prices and local incomes \u2013 between three and four times average annual income \u2013 was still intact. For my generation, both sides of this move are almost unfathomable. Social housing for young people without children? Homeownership in your 20s? Impossible.</p> <p>When I first moved to London in the early 2010s I spent years paying well over half of my income in rent. Even now, as my income has grown and my employment has become more secure, homeownership remains out of the question: house prices are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jul/29/london-property-crisis-canal-narrowboat-gentrification\">14.5 times the average income</a> in London.</p> <p>When it comes to housing, class intersects with the intergenerational divide, as well as<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/03/housing-crisis-why-worse-for-black-families-social-housing\"> race</a> and<a href=\"https://wbg.org.uk/media/press-releases/exclusive-data-housing-is-unaffordable-for-women-in-every-english-region/\"> gender</a>. Only those whose parents have sufficient money to pay their deposit can access homes to buy, leaving most of the rest of us trapped in the insecure, unaffordable private rented sector.</p> <p>But it needn\u2019t be this way. The housing crisis is the result of policy choices that could be undone in less than a generation. If the government implemented policies that prioritised the provision of secure, affordable housing for everyone \u2013 regardless of age, class, race or gender \u2013 in just 10 years\u2019 time young people\u2019s housing options could look radically different, and a lot more hopeful. </p> <h2>Social housing in 2029</h2> <p>With 200,000 social homes built per year for the last decade, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/19/ministers-urged-halt-right-buy-council-homes-rented\">right to buy halted</a>, the social housing deficit \u2013 estimated by Shelter in 2019 to be <a href=\"https://england.shelter.org.uk/media/press_releases/articles/three_million_new_social_homes_key_to_solving_housing_crisis2\">3.2m</a> homes \u2013 is well on its way to being met in a decade\u2019s time. For young people and the working class, social housing is once again becoming the norm, providing secure, affordable housing outside of homeownership.</p> <p>Targeted initially at those whose needs were most radically unmet by the old system \u2013 homeless people and those living in temporary or overcrowded accommodation \u2013 as the stock of new social housing has increased, access has been broadened. For many young people, key workers and other middle-income earners social housing \u2013 architecturally attractive, and delivered as part of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/11/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-ed-markey\">Green New Deal</a> to carbon-neutral standards \u2013 is becoming their chosen option, either for the long term, or while they save for a deposit.</p> <h2>Private renting in 2029</h2> <p>The old private rented sector, created in 1988, was designed primarily to attract investment, and was among the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/apr/21/renting-property-how-does-it-compare-around-the-world\">most unaffordable and insecure</a> in Europe. But since its overhaul in 2019, bringing the sector in line with many European norms with the introduction of open-ended \u201clifetime\u201d tenancies and <a href=\"https://neweconomics.org/2019/07/rents-in-london-should-be-reduced-and-rent-controls-rolled-out\">rent controls</a>, standards have significantly increased.</p> <p>For young people not yet able to access homeownership or social housing, private renting now provides a more secure and affordable alternative. The size of the sector has shrunk though, as the need for it has lessened, with many of the former private rented homes having been bought and converted to social housing.</p> <h2>Homeownership in 2029</h2> <p>Over the decade to 2029 house prices steadily decreased, slowly bringing homeownership back within reach of many young people.</p> <p>The increased social housing stock reduced the demand for private housing, and helped bring prices down.

      "bodyText": "New figures released on Wednesday confirmed what we already knew: homeownership is becoming increasingly out of reach for young people. A survey by Santander found 70% of 18- to 34-year-olds now believe that homeownership is over for their generation. Our housing system has been allowed to degenerate to such an extent that secure and affordable housing is increasingly unavailable to working-class people, and in many places middle-class people too. But it\u2019s not for a lack of ideas that this has happened. What we are lacking is the political will. Fifty years ago the country had a fairly stable housing system. The need for secure, affordable housing of the middle class was largely met through homeownership, and that of the working class through widely available social housing. But a reliance on the private market to deliver homes since the 1980s, and the loss of millions of social homes over recent decades, has destroyed this system. In the 1980s, after moving to a new town, my parents left their council house and bought a home. They were able to do this because the historic link between house prices and local incomes \u2013 between three and four times average annual income \u2013 was still intact. For my generation, both sides of this move are almost unfathomable. Social housing for young people without children? Homeownership in your 20s? Impossible. When I first moved to London in the early 2010s I spent years paying well over half of my income in rent. Even now, as my income has grown and my employment has become more secure, homeownership remains out of the question: house prices are 14.5 times the average income in London. When it comes to housing, class intersects with the intergenerational divide, as well as race and gender. Only those whose parents have sufficient money to pay their deposit can access homes to buy, leaving most of the rest of us trapped in the insecure, unaffordable private rented sector. But it needn\u2019t be this way. The housing crisis is the result of policy choices that could be undone in less than a generation. If the government implemented policies that prioritised the provision of secure, affordable housing for everyone \u2013 regardless of age, class, race or gender \u2013 in just 10 years\u2019 time young people\u2019s housing options could look radically different, and a lot more hopeful. Social housing in 2029 With 200,000 social homes built per year for the last decade, and the right to buy halted, the social housing deficit \u2013 estimated by Shelter in 2019 to be 3.2m homes \u2013 is well on its way to being met in a decade\u2019s time. For young people and the working class, social housing is once again becoming the norm, providing secure, affordable housing outside of homeownership. Targeted initially at those whose needs were most radically unmet by the old system \u2013 homeless people and those living in temporary or overcrowded accommodation \u2013 as the stock of new social housing has increased, access has been broadened. For many young people, key workers and other middle-income earners social housing \u2013 architecturally attractive, and delivered as part of the Green New Deal to carbon-neutral standards \u2013 is becoming their chosen option, either for the long term, or while they save for a deposit. Private renting in 2029 The old private rented sector, created in 1988, was designed primarily to attract investment, and was among the most unaffordable and insecure in Europe. But since its overhaul in 2019, bringing the sector in line with many European norms with the introduction of open-ended \u201clifetime\u201d tenancies and rent controls, standards have significantly increased. For young people not yet able to access homeownership or social housing, private renting now provides a more secure and affordable alternative. The size of the sector has shrunk though, as the need for it has lessened, with many of the former private rented homes having been bought and converted to social housing. Homeownership in 2029 Over the decade to 2029 house prices steadily decreased, slowly bringing homeownership back within reach of many young people. The increased social housing stock reduced the demand for private housing, and helped bring prices down. At the same time, much of the \u201cunhealthy\u201d demand for homes \u2013 demand from investors, as opposed to demand from people who needed somewhere to live \u2013 disappeared from the housing market, reducing the competition for homes, and so lowering prices. With increased security and affordability in the private rented sector, targeted taxation on housing-as-assets, the clamping down on offshore ownership, and a bolstered pension system, investors \u2013 big and small \u2013 have become less interested in housing as an investment, with more affordable house prices the result. Alongside this, increased public and community ownership of land \u2013 through a People\u2019s Land Trust \u2013 have taken much land and housing outside of the free market, with the memory of the decades-long mistaken reliance on the private market to meet our housing need still looming large. Homes in 2029 are once again valued as places to live, and not primarily as assets, and young people are increasingly finding themselves able to access homeownership irrespective of their parents\u2019 wealth. In 2019, this might sound utopian. But with sufficient political will, it\u2019s eminently achievable. \u2022 Joe Beswick is head of housing and land at the New Economics Foundation",

I was reminded also of the 1982 film adaptation of Agatha Christie\u2019s 1939 novel Murder is Easy in which a computer scientist played by Bill Bixby enters the details of the case into a programme he has coded to give the name of the murderer (the 2008 TV version with Benedict Cumberbatch features no computers, crowbars Miss Marple into the plot and deviates even further from the original).

Bill Bixby\u2019s computer scientist knows that and so does Dan Norcross. When an analytics company tells us before a World Cup that France have a 64% chance of winning, it may provoke a sense of unease at the unpicking of the rainbow but it shouldn\u2019t. Character may be destiny, but data isn\u2019t. And yet analysis still looms for many as some distant unknowable force, a deeper magic underpinning the universe.</p> <p>Don Revie was the first manager in Britain really to take the study of the opposition seriously. When he became England manager the dossiers he prepared on opponents became notorious. His Leeds side were brilliant in their own right but, thanks to Revie\u2019s homework, they were also extremely adept at preventing opponents from playing. Revie was, in a sense, Britain\u2019s first scientific manager.</p> <p>But science alone was not enough. Revie sought whatever assistance he could find. His roommate during his playing days at Sunderland, Stan Anderson, revealed how before going to sleep Revie would kneel by his bedside to pray, a strangely innocent image for somebody who later produced a team notorious for its cynicism. As a manager, Revie was, by his own admission, \u201cthe most superstitious man in the world\u201d: he had \u201clucky\u201d blue suits, insisted his wife wore her \u201clucky\u201d suede coat to games and was terrified of ornamental elephants and birds.</p> <p>That suggests the sort of insecurity that David Peace attributes to Brian Clough in The Damned United. The insistence on leaving as little as possible to chance, meanwhile, is redolent of his latest successor as Leeds manager, Marcelo Bielsa. Far more than the details he revealed about Derby County, what was striking about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/16/marcelo-bielsa-leeds-spied-every-opponent\" title=\"\">Bielsa\u2019s confessional post-spygate press conference</a> was his admission that the long hours he drives himself to work make little practical difference.</p> <p>\u201cThese 20 people create a volume of information,\u201d he said. \u201cAbsolutely not necessary. And it doesn\u2019t define the path of the competition. So why do we do that? Because we feel guilty if we don\u2019t work enough. Because it allows us not to have too much anxiety. And we think that by gathering information we feel we get closer to a win.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bielsa \u2013 who has his own tics, such as the habit he developed in Bilbao of crossing the technical area in 13 steps \u2013 is not unique in this. A point Ed Smith, the chairman of the England cricket selectors, has made repeatedly is the importance of working smart rather than necessarily working long. Anybody who has ever revised for an exam will know the feeling, forcing yourself to an allotted number of hours long after your exhausted brain has stopped absorbing information.</p> <p>Yet Bielsa\u2019s attitude does encapsulate the slightly odd position data holds in football. It is a very detailed record of past performance, no more, within which patterns can be discerned. As a predictive force, it probably is more accurate than the dreams of a cricket commentator. But perhaps what is most telling about sport and those involved in it is how a tool that by its nature is supposed to focus the mind on the factual becomes for many a psychological crutch.</p>",

(That said, it is an intriguing metaphysical question: what if you had all the data, not just ability and fitness, but every detail of players\u2019 diet, relationships and mental state, the angle of blades of grass on the pitch, an assessment of how the breathing of fans affected air flow in the stadium \u2026 would the game\u2019s course then be inevitable?) BT knows that; this is a bit of fun for a marketing campaign. Bill Bixby\u2019s computer scientist knows that and so does Dan Norcross. When an analytics company tells us before a World Cup that France have a 64% chance of winning, it may provoke a sense of unease at the unpicking of the rainbow but it shouldn\u2019t. Character may be destiny, but data isn\u2019t. And yet analysis still looms for many as some distant unknowable force, a deeper magic underpinning the universe. Don Revie was the first manager in Britain really to take the study of the opposition seriously. When he became England manager the dossiers he prepared on opponents became notorious. His Leeds side were brilliant in their own right but, thanks to Revie\u2019s homework, they were also extremely adept at preventing opponents from playing. Revie was, in a sense, Britain\u2019s first scientific manager. But science alone was not enough. Revie sought whatever assistance he could find. His roommate during his playing days at Sunderland, Stan Anderson, revealed how before going to sleep Revie would kneel by his bedside to pray, a strangely innocent image for somebody who later produced a team notorious for its cynicism. As a manager, Revie was, by his own admission, \u201cthe most superstitious man in the world\u201d: he had \u201clucky\u201d blue suits, insisted his wife wore her \u201clucky\u201d suede coat to games and was terrified of ornamental elephants and birds. That suggests the sort of insecurity that David Peace attributes to Brian Clough in The Damned United. The insistence on leaving as little as possible to chance, meanwhile, is redolent of his latest successor as Leeds manager, Marcelo Bielsa. Far more than the details he revealed about Derby County, what was striking about Bielsa\u2019s confessional post-spygate press conference was his admission that the long hours he drives himself to work make little practical difference. \u201cThese 20 people create a volume of information,\u201d he said. \u201cAbsolutely not necessary. And it doesn\u2019t define the path of the competition. So why do we do that? Because we feel guilty if we don\u2019t work enough. Because it allows us not to have too much anxiety. And we think that by gathering information we feel we get closer to a win.\u201d Bielsa \u2013 who has his own tics, such as the habit he developed in Bilbao of crossing the technical area in 13 steps \u2013 is not unique in this. A point Ed Smith, the chairman of the England cricket selectors, has made repeatedly is the importance of working smart rather than necessarily working long. Anybody who has ever revised for an exam will know the feeling, forcing yourself to an allotted number of hours long after your exhausted brain has stopped absorbing information. Yet Bielsa\u2019s attitude does encapsulate the slightly odd position data holds in football. It is a very detailed record of past performance, no more, within which patterns can be discerned. As a predictive force, it probably is more accurate than the dreams of a cricket commentator. But perhaps what is most telling about sport and those involved in it is how a tool that by its nature is supposed to focus the mind on the factual becomes for many a psychological crutch.",

Tabassum Ahmad, founder and managing director of EmployAbility, a not-for-profit set up to help students and graduates with disabilities, says there isn\u2019t always a crossover between a university\u2019s disability service and its careers service. Tuke, who now works at a university, says some university careers services offer tailored support for disabled students about to graduate \u2013 but not all. She thinks some could do more to talk through the process of disclosing a disability, and also advise students on how to talk to an employer about support they\u2019ll likely need. At a policy level, the Department for Education (DfE) and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) need to join up to bridge the gap, says Angela Matthews, head of policy and advice at the Business Disability Forum, a non-profit membership organisation that helps businesses to employ disabled people. Access to Work (ATW), which provides funding and support for disabled people when at work, is owned by DWP, and Disabled Students\u2019 Allowance (DSA) is based within the DfE. They\u2019re different in terms of funding, language used and how individuals are assessed for support, Matthews explains. \u201cSo these policy areas [need to be] more joined up to address the barriers unique to that gap between education and employment. Ultimately, more attention at both policy and university level is needed \u2026 otherwise we\u2019re wasting talent and potentially fuelling the disability employment gap.\u201d Employers must also be better prepared. YouGov research has shown half of businesses believe it\u2019s easier to recruit a non-disabled person over a disabled person. To tackle this, disability employment charity Scope have teamed up with Virgin Media to create the #WorkWithMe campaign, which is a call to action for businesses to create inclusive workplaces. \u201cDisabled graduates can face negative attitudes and inflexible practices when getting into and staying in work,\u201d Jess Leigh, policy and campaigns manager at Scope, says. \u201cBecoming an inclusive employer needs to be a priority for all businesses.\u201d Ahmad emphasises that employing disabled graduates is not about lowering the bar. \u201cIf employers want the best talent they have to look at the widest pool available to them,\u201d she says. For Tuke, unhelpful careers advice meant she wasn\u2019t as prepared to enter the workplace as she could have been. However she didn\u2019t let it defeat her and six months later she found work at her university. \u201cA lot of the time having a disability doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do the job,\u201d she says. \u201cYou might just need some adjustments.\u201d",

Hamza bin Laden, the son of Osama bin Laden, was being groomed as a future leader of the group and most probably died in a US drone strike, possibly somewhere in the rugged borderlands between Pakistan and Afghanistan, two or more years ago.

Mark Francois, one of 28 Tory MPs who repeatedly held out against May\u2019s deal, said Johnson had been very clear at a meeting of European Research Group MPs that the withdrawal agreement in its entirety was \u201cdead\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Les Filles de Illighadad are in their dressing room, listening to music on their phones and scrolling through social media apps. Fatou Seidi Ghali, the band\u2019s lead guitarist and singer, leans in to show me a Snapchat she has just received from a friend: in a hilly desert, a white-robed man is riding a horse at full speed. He tries to stand up in the saddle and falls off into a plume of sand. Fatou looks up at me, laughing.</p> <p>The group are from a small village called Illighadad in the Tuareg region of the Sahara in western Niger. While the region has produced some celebrated guitarists, acts such as Bombino, Mdou Moctar and Tinariwen\u2019s Ibrahim Ag Alhabib, Fatou is the first ever Tuareg woman to play guitar professionally.</p> <p>She started the band in 2016 with her cousin Alamnou Akrouni, who plays percussion and sings. A third member, Mariama Salah Aswan, recently left to start a family and was replaced by Fatimata Ahmadelher, the Tuareg\u2019s second-ever female guitarist, who also contributes vocals and percussion. They are in their late 20s, they say, although they have no birth certificates. Fatou\u2019s brother, Abdoulaye Madassane, joins them on tour, providing rhythm guitar.</p> <p>Another brother, Ahmoudou, introduced Fatou to the instrument, albeit inadvertently, when he brought one home from Libya. Fatou, aged about 10, began teaching herself to play in secret, sneaking off to practise every time her brother was out. The sight of a woman holding the guitar was in itself controversial. \u201cMy father told me to stop wasting my time,\u201d says Fatou, talking through an interpreter. \u201cI should be busy looking after the cows.\u201d But she persisted, and people began to take notice.</p> <p>Among them was Christopher Kirkley, a music fan from Portland, Oregon, who started the record label Sahel Sounds in 2010 as a way of bringing south-Saharan music to a wider audience. He had heard about Fatou playing guitar at weddings, and managed to track her down. After hearing her play at home in the village, Kirkley recorded Les Filles\u2019 eponymous first album, with Alamnou playing tende, a traditional Tuareg goatskin drum, and Fatou playing fingerpicked blues on an acoustic guitar. They play folksongs they have known all their lives \u2013 love songs and odes to nomadic life \u2013 with the sound of local people laughing and singing along in the background.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7d5051ce4aea0f4fe7c070e8a5358de274aed52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7d5051ce4aea0f4fe7c070e8a5358de274aed52/0_0_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fatou Seidi Ghali \u2026 sneaked off to play the guitar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fatou Seidi Ghali \u2026 sneaked off to play the guitar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: A\u0301lvaro Lo\u0301pez</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tende music, named after the drum, is played at traditional Tuareg courting rituals, where all the women in a village sing to each other in a call-and-response style. As they sing, men approach on camelback, trying to catch the eye of a potential suitor while the camels\u2019 hooves move in time with the music.</p> <p>How important is music to the Tuareg? This question elicits quizzical looks. \u201cEveryone listens. Everyone plays,\u201d says Fatimata.</p> <p>\u201cFor love, for pain, for enjoyment,\u201d adds Abdoulaye. \u201cWhen there is tension in the village, musicians come to calm everyone down.\u201d Different occasions require different kinds of music, tende being one and takamba, a faster style built around a three- or four-stringed loot instrument known as the ngoni, is another, often played at weddings.</p> <p>Fatou played the ngoni before she ever picked up a guitar. She created Les Filles\u2019 sound by combining these influences \u2013 tende, takamba and hausa music, a folk style from Nigeria. The band\u2019s success means she is treated \u201clike a queen\u201d when she returns home, with local people asking for photos and offering motorcycle lifts wherever she goes. She is modest when I ask what she hopes to achieve with her band: \u201cHelping the village, buying medicines, supporting my brothers and sisters.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIAOG9nhrt8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HIAOG9nhrt8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Tende.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>We meet shortly after their performance at the Womad festival, and Fatou and Fatimata are arguing heatedly in Tamasheq, their native tongue. The gig didn\u2019t go well, at least not in their view. The sound engineers struggled with the calabash \u2013 a pumpkin-like fruit cut in half and partly submerged in water, drummed to mimic camels\u2019 hooves \u2013 and the band had to swap instruments a few times to try to get rid of the feedback. The crowd was enraptured nonetheless.</p> <p>Like the Guardian, Womad recently removed \u201cworld music\u201d from its lexicon to avoid the inadequacy of grouping together hundreds of geographically disparate genres. The festival\u2019s name recalls another term that may be more fitting for Les Filles: \u201cnomad\u201d is a tag worn proudly by the Sahara-roaming Tuareg people, and an equivalent Tamasheq word, <em>amahegh</em>, meaning a Tuareg of noble heart, translates as \u201cfree man\u201d. As they continue on a world tour that has already taken them to Australia, Israel, Sweden and Canada, Les Filles are giving the words new meaning.</p> <p><em>Les Filles de Illighadad\u2019s world tour continues. Their second album, Eghass Malan (Sahel Sounds), is out now.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Les Filles de Illighadad are in their dressing room, listening to music on their phones and scrolling through social media apps. Fatou Seidi Ghali, the band\u2019s lead guitarist and singer, leans in to show me a Snapchat she has just received from a friend: in a hilly desert, a white-robed man is riding a horse at full speed. He tries to stand up in the saddle and falls off into a plume of sand. Fatou looks up at me, laughing. The group are from a small village called Illighadad in the Tuareg region of the Sahara in western Niger. While the region has produced some celebrated guitarists, acts such as Bombino, Mdou Moctar and Tinariwen\u2019s Ibrahim Ag Alhabib, Fatou is the first ever Tuareg woman to play guitar professionally. She started the band in 2016 with her cousin Alamnou Akrouni, who plays percussion and sings. A third member, Mariama Salah Aswan, recently left to start a family and was replaced by Fatimata Ahmadelher, the Tuareg\u2019s second-ever female guitarist, who also contributes vocals and percussion. They are in their late 20s, they say, although they have no birth certificates. Fatou\u2019s brother, Abdoulaye Madassane, joins them on tour, providing rhythm guitar. Another brother, Ahmoudou, introduced Fatou to the instrument, albeit inadvertently, when he brought one home from Libya. Fatou, aged about 10, began teaching herself to play in secret, sneaking off to practise every time her brother was out. The sight of a woman holding the guitar was in itself controversial. \u201cMy father told me to stop wasting my time,\u201d says Fatou, talking through an interpreter. \u201cI should be busy looking after the cows.\u201d But she persisted, and people began to take notice. Among them was Christopher Kirkley, a music fan from Portland, Oregon, who started the record label Sahel Sounds in 2010 as a way of bringing south-Saharan music to a wider audience. He had heard about Fatou playing guitar at weddings, and managed to track her down. After hearing her play at home in the village, Kirkley recorded Les Filles\u2019 eponymous first album, with Alamnou playing tende, a traditional Tuareg goatskin drum, and Fatou playing fingerpicked blues on an acoustic guitar. They play folksongs they have known all their lives \u2013 love songs and odes to nomadic life \u2013 with the sound of local people laughing and singing along in the background. Tende music, named after the drum, is played at traditional Tuareg courting rituals, where all the women in a village sing to each other in a call-and-response style. As they sing, men approach on camelback, trying to catch the eye of a potential suitor while the camels\u2019 hooves move in time with the music. How important is music to the Tuareg? This question elicits quizzical looks. \u201cEveryone listens. Everyone plays,\u201d says Fatimata. \u201cFor love, for pain, for enjoyment,\u201d adds Abdoulaye. \u201cWhen there is tension in the village, musicians come to calm everyone down.\u201d Different occasions require different kinds of music, tende being one and takamba, a faster style built around a three- or four-stringed loot instrument known as the ngoni, is another, often played at weddings. Fatou played the ngoni before she ever picked up a guitar. She created Les Filles\u2019 sound by combining these influences \u2013 tende, takamba and hausa music, a folk style from Nigeria. The band\u2019s success means she is treated \u201clike a queen\u201d when she returns home, with local people asking for photos and offering motorcycle lifts wherever she goes. She is modest when I ask what she hopes to achieve with her band: \u201cHelping the village, buying medicines, supporting my brothers and sisters.\u201d We meet shortly after their performance at the Womad festival, and Fatou and Fatimata are arguing heatedly in Tamasheq, their native tongue. The gig didn\u2019t go well, at least not in their view. The sound engineers struggled with the calabash \u2013 a pumpkin-like fruit cut in half and partly submerged in water, drummed to mimic camels\u2019 hooves \u2013 and the band had to swap instruments a few times to try to get rid of the feedback. The crowd was enraptured nonetheless. Like the Guardian, Womad recently removed \u201cworld music\u201d from its lexicon to avoid the inadequacy of grouping together hundreds of geographically disparate genres. The festival\u2019s name recalls another term that may be more fitting for Les Filles: \u201cnomad\u201d is a tag worn proudly by the Sahara-roaming Tuareg people, and an equivalent Tamasheq word, amahegh, meaning a Tuareg of noble heart, translates as \u201cfree man\u201d. As they continue on a world tour that has already taken them to Australia, Israel, Sweden and Canada, Les Filles are giving the words new meaning. Les Filles de Illighadad\u2019s world tour continues. Their second album, Eghass Malan (Sahel Sounds), is out now.",

      "bodyText": "India\u2019s ruling party has expelled an official accused of rape, days after a deadly car crash left his alleged victim in critical condition. Investigators are examining possible links between Kuldeep Singh Sengar, a Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) lawmaker, who was accused of raping a teenage girl, and the collision that occurred on Sunday. Two of the girl\u2019s relatives were killed when a truck collided with their vehicle. The girl\u2019s lawyer was also seriously injured. Images from the scene, broadcast on Indian media, showed that the truck\u2019s number plates had been painted over. The authorities in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh, one of India\u2019s poorest states, have been accused of failing to protect the girl or fairly investigate claims made against the powerful official. The BJP has also faced increasing criticism for allowing Singh Sengar to remain in the party, despite being charged under child protection laws last year. Officials said he had previously been suspended, but did not specify when this action was taken. The girl alleged she was raped by Singh Sengar in June 2017 after going to his house looking for a job. For months the police refused to register a complaint, according to the family. In protest at their lack of action, the girl travelled to Lucknow, the state capital of Uttar Pradesh, doused herself in paraffin and attempted to self-immolate. A day later, her father died in police custody. The family claimed he had been beaten by Singh Sengar and his brother. After public outrage, Singh Sengar was arrested last year and has remained in custody. He has denied the allegation of rape and any involvement in the car crash. The girl\u2019s mother said the family had continued to receive constant threats and described Sunday\u2019s collision as \u201ca conspiracy to eliminate all of us\u201d. The police initially said it appeared to be an accident, but federal investigators later said it may have been murder. On Wednesday, the supreme court transferred all cases linked to the alleged rape to Delhi, a damning indictment of the justice system in Uttar Pradesh, which has a reputation for lawlessness. The chief justice of India, Ranjan Gogoi, ruled that the country\u2019s Central Bureau of Investigation, which is investigating the crash, must complete its inquiry in seven days, and the rape case in 45 days, according to reports. He also said compensation should be paid to the girl, and that she could be moved to Delhi for treatment, if the family wished. She remains unconscious and in critical condition with a head injury and multiple leg fractures. The case has caused outrage across India, with many arguing that justice systems offer little protection to vulnerable people who accuse the powerful.

The most maligned components of Georgia\u2019s election systems \u2013 voting machines and online voter registration \u2013 were almost entirely managed by private companies, prompting concerns from election security experts. Voting machine company Elections Systems and Software (ES&amp;S), which has close connections with the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office and Governor Brian Kemp\u2019s staff, had three staff in Georgia building electronic ballots out of their homes through the 2018 midterms. This introduced significant security concerns about both foreign actors attacking the election system with malware or about a \u201cpolitical insider\u201d potentially introducing their own coding that could alter the results of an election without detection, according to the plaintiffs. \u201cIt\u2019s a shock to everyone that the vendor is actually building ballots for state elections,\u201d said David Cross, lead attorney for one of the two groups suing the state. \u201cThat should not be happening.

The contract for server hosting ended on 30 June, and the secretary of state\u2019s office \u2013 which runs elections in Georgia \u2013 is in the process of moving the voter registration system back to its own servers, according to documents produced by the state and the testimony of the secretary of state\u2019s chief information officer, Merritt Beaver. But the state is continuing its contract with PCC to manage the voter registration system and the My Voter Page. \u201cIt\u2019s the selling of a public election,\u201d said Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance and another plaintiff in the case. \u201cThe [election vendor] decides whether or not to mess with the election \u2026 Interestingly enough, [Georgia] wrote them a check to do it.

Beaver failed to mention to the judge that the testing failed, and the cybersecurity firm was able to take over the entire network, which was only revealed when the state was forced to provide those security reports. A second round of testing in November 2018 showed some improvement, though many of the vulnerabilities identified a year before had not been fixed. Georgia announced on Monday it is buying an entirely new voting system from Dominion Voting Systems for nearly $107m, set to be rolled out by next year\u2019s presidential primaries.

      "body": "<h2>20. Bags\u2019 Groove (1957)</h2> \n<p>In the end, Miles Davis would fascinate jazz, rock and classical fans alike. But in the 1940s he had been a teenage trumpet hopeful partnering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/06/miles-davis-interview-rocks-backpages\">Charlie Parker</a> and by 1954, when this session was recorded, he had an understatedly personal version of the revolutionary bebop sound. Alongside Sonny Rollins and Thelonious Monk, he reveals it here.</p> \n<h2>19. Miles In the Sky (1968)</h2> \n<p>A patchily intriguing set from the next decade, flagging the ever-changing Miles\u2019 migration from free-swinging jazz to rock. The saxophonist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/wayne-shorter\">Wayne Shorter</a> broods, the embryonic soul-star George Benson plays terse guitar, Herbie Hancock debuts the formerly unjazzy Fender Rhodes and Tony Williams drums up a perfect storm.</p> \n<h2>18. The Man with the Horn (1981)</h2> \n<p>Miles comprehensively burned out in 1975, but while his comeback six years later was uncertain, his 1970s edginess was now softened by the rediscovery of his early lyricism. Good originals such as Back Seat Betty, with its wistful trumpet and hard-thumbed Marcus Miller bass hooks, entered the repertoire.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"badde08cba775e4af19fad9a38aaa73669ff8a22\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/badde08cba775e4af19fad9a38aaa73669ff8a22/0_361_4059_2434/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miles davis playing the trumpet. Copyright Gai Terrell / Redferns\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<h2>17. Amandla (1989)</h2> \n<p>Marcus Miller, Miles\u2019s 1980s svengali, scored and glossily produced this late-career set dedicated to South Africa\u2019s liberation from apartheid. It\u2019s a bit lightweight for its subject, but the Jaco Pastorius tribute is both swinging and soulful, and the title ballad is bittersweet acoustic Miles at his most poignant.</p> \n<h2>16. Panthalassa: The Music of Miles Davis 1969-1974 (1998)</h2> \n<p>Audacious but sympathetic remixes by imaginative producer/player Bill Laswell, of music from Miles\u2019s heavily experimental 1970s period, including In a Silent Way. While Laswell\u2019s echoey, bass-pumping, beat-swelling treatments sometimes twist the originals way out of shape, their creator\u2019s spirit runs through it all.</p> \n<h2>15. L\u2019Ascenseur Pour L\u2019Echafaud (1958)</h2> \n<p>The director Louis Malle hired a Paris-loving, 31-year-old Miles and a French/US band including the bebop drummer Kenny Clarke to improvise a soundtrack for his noirish 1958 thriller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/06/lift-to-the-scaffold-review\">L\u2019Ascenseur Pour L\u2019Echafaud</a> (Lift to the Scaffold). Going only by the visuals, the trumpeter reflected the movie\u2019s desolate romanticism perfectly.</p> \n<h2>14. On the Corner (1972)</h2> \n<p>Bill Laswell, Miles\u2019s posthumous remixer, called 1972\u2019s On the Corner \u201cmutant hip-hop\u201d \u2013 others have heard dub, pre-punk, drum\u2019n\u2019bass and more in its oceanic, thick-textured, harmony-purged turmoil of multiple keyboards, overdubs, saxes and percussion. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/oct/26/jazz.shopping\">Long ignored</a>, the session is on its way to rehabilitation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46e664dcc1c11f454c5f61236b63449fbe4b31f5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46e664dcc1c11f454c5f61236b63449fbe4b31f5/34_533_2532_1520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miles Davis during rehearsals for an episode of The Robert Herridge Theatre, New York, 1959.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miles Davis during rehearsals for an episode of The Robert Herridge Theatre, New York, 1959.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>13. Miles Davis: Vol 2 (1956)</h2> \n<p>Miles preferred patience, tension, release and expressiveness of tone to the torrents of notes that often characterised bebop. This classy 50s compilation, including the saxophonist Jackie McLean, pianist Horace Silver and drummer Art Blakey, features both his ballad elegance and some of his most surefooted improv over a bop groove.</p> \n<h2>12. Relaxin\u2019 with the Miles Davis Quintet (1958)</h2> \n<p>Miles buffs refer to his \u201cfirst and second great quintets\u201d. The second was the 1960s group including Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams. This, with saxophonist John Coltrane, is the dazzling first. The contrast between the reticent, incisive trumpeter and the unquenchable Coltrane is mesmerising.</p> \n<h2>11. Aura (1989)</h2> \n<p>In 1985, Denmark\u2019s government awarded Miles Davis its normally classical Sonning prize, and Danish trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg wrote an orchestral suite for the star and \u2013 somehow \u2013 persuaded him to play on it. Superb solos from an engaged and attentive Miles, navigating Mikkelborg\u2019s references to all kinds of 20th-century music.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpZHjvFXprk\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FpZHjvFXprk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Time After Time, live in Munich, 1988.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>10. You\u2019re Under Arrest (1985)</h2> \n<p>Miles\u2019s last session for Columbia Records, notably including beautiful interpretations of two pop songs \u2013 Cyndi Lauper\u2019s Time After Time and Michael Jackson\u2019s Human Nature. Also striking is guitar newcomer John Scofield\u2019s fast and convoluted title-track blues, one of the great original compositions for a late-period Miles lineup.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a86b23820186d1d24dbb908f01820041de2b361a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a86b23820186d1d24dbb908f01820041de2b361a/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miles Davis, Bitches Brew (1970)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<h2>9. Bitches Brew (1969)</h2> \n<p>The dense, dark, Latin-fusion epic Bitches Brew was a landmark of production as well as musicianship from a superb band including Wayne Shorter, John McLaughlin, Chick Corea and Jack DeJohnette. The players improvised for hours; the producer, Teo Macero, and Miles cut-and-pasted the results into distinct tracks later.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"31f802793493bc50bc7c8a54ac1c5fd3ecf2afa6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31f802793493bc50bc7c8a54ac1c5fd3ecf2afa6/0_0_1000_995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Milestones by Miles Davis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"995\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<h2>8. Milestones (1958)</h2> \n<p>Along with Kind of Blue, Milestones is a masterpiece from the 1950s quintet including John Coltrane \u2013 expanded to a sextet here by gospel-y alto saxophonist Julian \u201cCannonball\u201d Adderley. The springy, airborne title track is a standout, as is the leader\u2019s incisive improv on Thelonious Monk\u2019s Straight, No Chaser.</p> \n<h2>7. Sketches of Spain (1959-60)</h2> \n<p>Most at ease in small groups, Miles Davis was also a poetic soloist in concerto-like roles with a big band. His long and fruitful relationship with the Canadian composer/arranger Gil Evans gets a spectacular airing on Spanish themes including the smouldering Concierto de Aranjuez, and the quietly conversational Solea.</p> \n<h2>6. The Complete Live at the Plugged Nickel (1995)</h2> \n<p>Maybe the best-ever representation of \u201cthe second great quintet\u201d at work. Superbly recorded live at Chicago\u2019s Plugged Nickel club, the set finds Miles, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams reinventing small-band jazz with an all-but-psychic flexibility of timing and on-the-fly harmonising.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/dec/24/miles-davis-bitches-brew\">50 great moments in jazz: How Miles Davis plugged in and transformed jazz ... all over again</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>5. Birth of the Cool (1957)</h2> \n<p>The young Miles wanted to play bebop\u2019s revolutionary conceptions in a more ethereal, less impatient way than its first pioneers. With likeminded souls including saxophonist Gerry Mulligan and Lee Konitz, and the composer/arranger Gil Evans, he formed this delicately groundbreaking chamber ensemble, an influence on the jazz sound still.</p> \n<h2>4. Porgy and Bess (1959)</h2> \n<p>A beautiful makeover of the Gershwin opera \u2013 give or take a little shaky section playing in the under-rehearsed band \u2013 with Miles\u2019s trumpet soaring over a Gil Evans-arranged orchestra. His exhortations over the shouts of the band on Prayer, and his supple, gliding solo on Summertime are standouts.</p> \n<h2>3. Jack Johnson (1970)</h2> \n<p>From a film-score assignment about boxing legend Jack Johnson, Miles launched a new band (hiring Stevie Wonder bassist Michael Henderson among others) and built a thrillingly hard-rocking sound out of long studio jams and radical editing.

      "bodyText": "20. Bags\u2019 Groove (1957) In the end, Miles Davis would fascinate jazz, rock and classical fans alike. But in the 1940s he had been a teenage trumpet hopeful partnering Charlie Parker and by 1954, when this session was recorded, he had an understatedly personal version of the revolutionary bebop sound. Alongside Sonny Rollins and Thelonious Monk, he reveals it here. 19. Miles In the Sky (1968) A patchily intriguing set from the next decade, flagging the ever-changing Miles\u2019 migration from free-swinging jazz to rock. The saxophonist Wayne Shorter broods, the embryonic soul-star George Benson plays terse guitar, Herbie Hancock debuts the formerly unjazzy Fender Rhodes and Tony Williams drums up a perfect storm. 18. The Man with the Horn (1981) Miles comprehensively burned out in 1975, but while his comeback six years later was uncertain, his 1970s edginess was now softened by the rediscovery of his early lyricism. Good originals such as Back Seat Betty, with its wistful trumpet and hard-thumbed Marcus Miller bass hooks, entered the repertoire. 17. Amandla (1989) Marcus Miller, Miles\u2019s 1980s svengali, scored and glossily produced this late-career set dedicated to South Africa\u2019s liberation from apartheid. It\u2019s a bit lightweight for its subject, but the Jaco Pastorius tribute is both swinging and soulful, and the title ballad is bittersweet acoustic Miles at his most poignant. 16. Panthalassa: The Music of Miles Davis 1969-1974 (1998) Audacious but sympathetic remixes by imaginative producer/player Bill Laswell, of music from Miles\u2019s heavily experimental 1970s period, including In a Silent Way. While Laswell\u2019s echoey, bass-pumping, beat-swelling treatments sometimes twist the originals way out of shape, their creator\u2019s spirit runs through it all. 15. L\u2019Ascenseur Pour L\u2019Echafaud (1958) The director Louis Malle hired a Paris-loving, 31-year-old Miles and a French/US band including the bebop drummer Kenny Clarke to improvise a soundtrack for his noirish 1958 thriller L\u2019Ascenseur Pour L\u2019Echafaud (Lift to the Scaffold). Going only by the visuals, the trumpeter reflected the movie\u2019s desolate romanticism perfectly. 14. On the Corner (1972) Bill Laswell, Miles\u2019s posthumous remixer, called 1972\u2019s On the Corner \u201cmutant hip-hop\u201d \u2013 others have heard dub, pre-punk, drum\u2019n\u2019bass and more in its oceanic, thick-textured, harmony-purged turmoil of multiple keyboards, overdubs, saxes and percussion. Long ignored, the session is on its way to rehabilitation. 13. Miles Davis: Vol 2 (1956) Miles preferred patience, tension, release and expressiveness of tone to the torrents of notes that often characterised bebop. This classy 50s compilation, including the saxophonist Jackie McLean, pianist Horace Silver and drummer Art Blakey, features both his ballad elegance and some of his most surefooted improv over a bop groove. 12. Relaxin\u2019 with the Miles Davis Quintet (1958) Miles buffs refer to his \u201cfirst and second great quintets\u201d. The second was the 1960s group including Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams. This, with saxophonist John Coltrane, is the dazzling first. The contrast between the reticent, incisive trumpeter and the unquenchable Coltrane is mesmerising. 11. Aura (1989) In 1985, Denmark\u2019s government awarded Miles Davis its normally classical Sonning prize, and Danish trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg wrote an orchestral suite for the star and \u2013 somehow \u2013 persuaded him to play on it. Superb solos from an engaged and attentive Miles, navigating Mikkelborg\u2019s references to all kinds of 20th-century music. 10. You\u2019re Under Arrest (1985) Miles\u2019s last session for Columbia Records, notably including beautiful interpretations of two pop songs \u2013 Cyndi Lauper\u2019s Time After Time and Michael Jackson\u2019s Human Nature. Also striking is guitar newcomer John Scofield\u2019s fast and convoluted title-track blues, one of the great original compositions for a late-period Miles lineup. 9. Bitches Brew (1969) The dense, dark, Latin-fusion epic Bitches Brew was a landmark of production as well as musicianship from a superb band including Wayne Shorter, John McLaughlin, Chick Corea and Jack DeJohnette. The players improvised for hours; the producer, Teo Macero, and Miles cut-and-pasted the results into distinct tracks later. 8. Milestones (1958) Along with Kind of Blue, Milestones is a masterpiece from the 1950s quintet including John Coltrane \u2013 expanded to a sextet here by gospel-y alto saxophonist Julian \u201cCannonball\u201d Adderley. The springy, airborne title track is a standout, as is the leader\u2019s incisive improv on Thelonious Monk\u2019s Straight, No Chaser. 7. Sketches of Spain (1959-60) Most at ease in small groups, Miles Davis was also a poetic soloist in concerto-like roles with a big band. His long and fruitful relationship with the Canadian composer/arranger Gil Evans gets a spectacular airing on Spanish themes including the smouldering Concierto de Aranjuez, and the quietly conversational Solea. 6. The Complete Live at the Plugged Nickel (1995) Maybe the best-ever representation of \u201cthe second great quintet\u201d at work. Superbly recorded live at Chicago\u2019s Plugged Nickel club, the set finds Miles, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams reinventing small-band jazz with an all-but-psychic flexibility of timing and on-the-fly harmonising. 5. Birth of the Cool (1957) The young Miles wanted to play bebop\u2019s revolutionary conceptions in a more ethereal, less impatient way than its first pioneers. With likeminded souls including saxophonist Gerry Mulligan and Lee Konitz, and the composer/arranger Gil Evans, he formed this delicately groundbreaking chamber ensemble, an influence on the jazz sound still. 4. Porgy and Bess (1959) A beautiful makeover of the Gershwin opera \u2013 give or take a little shaky section playing in the under-rehearsed band \u2013 with Miles\u2019s trumpet soaring over a Gil Evans-arranged orchestra. His exhortations over the shouts of the band on Prayer, and his supple, gliding solo on Summertime are standouts. 3. Jack Johnson (1970) From a film-score assignment about boxing legend Jack Johnson, Miles launched a new band (hiring Stevie Wonder bassist Michael Henderson among others) and built a thrillingly hard-rocking sound out of long studio jams and radical editing. The seeds of his next five years are in this uncompromising music. 2. In a Silent Way (1969) Time stands still on this 1969 Davis classic. Electric sounds and textures (notably from new guitarist John McLaughlin and keyboardist Joe Zawinul) make clear breaks from the trumpeter\u2019s acoustic bands \u2013 but Miles\u2019s horn and Wayne Shorter\u2019s keening soprano sax sketch passages of an exquisite, irresistible tranquillity. 1. Kind of Blue (1959) Revered by pundits and fans, radiating an enduringly contemporary sound, and with un-jazz-like sales of 4 million plus at the last count, Kind of Blue \u2013 the 1959 session recorded in just a few hours and with minimal rehearsal \u2013 changed the way listeners and practitioners everywhere heard and made music. The Milestones band, with John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley on saxes, was the core, with the graceful pianist Bill Evans added, and the use of modes rather than song chords throughout gave the music an ethereal, free-associative spaciousness that draws new audiences to jazz to this day.",

      "bodyText": "A ban on gambling adverts during televised sport has come into effect, with the Ashes cricket series between England and Australia becoming the first major UK sporting event in more than a decade subject to the restrictions. The gambling industry announced the voluntary measure last year, in an apparent effort to address mounting concern about the volume of gambling adverts on television and their impact on children and vulnerable people. Under the agreement, no gambling ads will be shown during live sport televised before the 9pm watershed for a \u201cwhistle to whistle\u201d period beginning five minutes before the start of a match and ending five minutes after. The curbs exclude horse and greyhound racing, which are seen as intrinsically linked to gambling. The ban was introduced to coincide with the start of the football season next week but the Ashes, which began on Thursday, is the first major sporting event to be subject to the new regime. The change will dramatically reduce the number of gambling adverts seen on television, 12 years after the Gambling Act 2005 came into force, permitting online casinos and bookmakers to advertise on television for the first time. Previously only the National Lottery and bingo companies had been allowed to screen TV adverts. Speaking when the ban was announced, former culture minister Jeremy Wright said: \u201cIt is vital children and vulnerable people are protected from the threat of gambling-related harm. Companies must be socially responsible.\u201d Campaigners pointed out that voluntary curbs on TV advertising do not include football shirt sponsorship or the adverts that run around pitchside hoardings in stadiums, which means gambling firms will still appear prominently during live sport. James Grimes of charity Gambling With Lives\u2019 Big Step project, which asks football clubs to review their relationship with gambling sponsors said: \u201cClubs and gambling sponsors should be addressing much more including pitchside advertising, shirt sponsorship and in ground \u2018gambling harms\u2019 messaging. \u201cWe know that football fans are within the highest risk group of developing major gambling problems - clubs need to help them. You don\u2019t need to have a bet to enjoy a match.\u201d Academic studies have indicated that the prevalence of gambling company logos on shirts and hoardings mean that their branding still features heavily even on non-commercial broadcasters such as the BBC. Half of the Premier League\u2019s shirts will be emblazoned with gambling companies\u2019 logos during the 2019-20 season. The effect of the TV ad ban will also be limited by the fact that the majority of the gambling industry\u2019s spend has shifted online in recent years.",

Shell\u2019s profits were down a quarter to $3.5bn (\u00a32.9bn) in the three months to the end of June, well below City forecasts of almost $5bn. It was the biggest profits miss since the oil price crash in 2016. The Anglo-Dutch company pumped more oil and gas than in the year before but blamed the \u201cchallenging\u201d global macroeconomic environment for its poor quarterly performance. The US-China trade war has put the brakes on Asia\u2019s economic growth, which, in turn, has contributed to weaker global gas markets and has dampened profits made by refineries. Falling gas prices come as a blow to Shell, which has invested heavily in shifting the balance of its portfolio away from oil in recent years. Shell owns one of the biggest new gas export projects, which began operations in Australia this year to supply the Asia market. The price of imported gas in Asia has plummeted to 10-year lows because demand has been unable to keep pace with new supply coming into the market. The market price for gas is already 40% lower than it was last year and analysts say it could keep falling. Ben van Beurden, the chief executive of Shell, said the US-China trade war was having \u201ca very real depressing effect\u201d on the global economy but added that Shell\u2019s strength was \u201cthe ability to see the macro headwinds and respond appropriately\u201d. He said the company vows to increase spending and that dividends from 2020 would remain intact. But Biraj Borkhataria, of RBC Capital Markets, said the \u201cpretty weak set of numbers across the board\u201d may lead analysts to rethink their full-year forecasts. Shell\u2019s quarterly results come amid growing criticism of oil companies\u2019 failure to play a role in tackling the climate crisis. Van Beurden said he welcomed protest that helped move society towards doing more to cut emissions because it could not be undertaken by Shell alone. \u201cIt will require unprecedented collaboration,\u201d he said. He believes Shell must to do more to reach the company\u2019s goal of \u201czero harm to people and zero harm to the environment\u201d. The company was forced to put aside $237m in legal charges after a petrochemical refinery in California contaminated local groundwater. Van Beurden announced, \u201cwith deep sadness\u201d, that two Shell employees had died during a routine mandatory test at one of its projects in the Gulf of Mexico. The news followed four other fatalities this year, which included ones at a site in Nigeria and the US, he said. \u201cIt shows how much further we all need to go.

On this occasion the craving for stability, the appreciation of the mess Silva inherited and the desire to avoid another expensive managerial change prevailed.

      "bodyText": "Guardian writers\u2019 predicted position: 8th (NB: this is not necessarily Andy Hunter\u2019s prediction but the average of our writers\u2019 tips) Last season\u2019s position: 8th Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 150-1 Grand designs for Everton\u2019s proposed stadium have been unveiled 30 months after Bramley Moore dock was identified as the club\u2019s preferred site and decades after the search for a new home began. Now it is a matter of securing planning permission, \u00a3500m of funding and overcoming Unesco world heritage concerns over a derelict location before construction can start on Farhad Moshiri\u2019s plans for Everton\u2019s future. In the meantime, the billionaire majority shareholder will expect to see progress on his substantial investment in Everton\u2019s present. That too is overdue after several false starts. Unlike the stadium impressively envisaged by the architect Dan Meis, the manager Marco Silva has foundations to build on. For a sizeable chunk of last season \u2013 the three months bookended by the two Merseyside derbies, more or less \u2013 Silva appeared at risk of joining Sam Allardyce and Ronald Koeman on a lengthy list of poor appointments made on Moshiri\u2019s watch. On this occasion the craving for stability, the appreciation of the mess Silva inherited and the desire to avoid another expensive managerial change prevailed. Everton were rewarded with a highly impressive finish to the manager\u2019s debut campaign, one that not only showed his methods taking root but helped improve the fractured relationship between crowd and team. They have something to build on together. \u201cThe feeling of our fans and players enjoying what we are doing is everything I want as a manager,\u201d Silva said after Everton\u2019s humiliation of Manchester United in April. He elaborated: \u201cGood goals, quality, solid without the ball and we kept pressing them high and never give them a chance to feel comfortable. We gave a quiet afternoon for our goalkeeper too.\u201d That 4-0 lesson at Goodison Park, Everton\u2019s biggest win over United in 35 years, was undoubtedly the high point of the season but not an isolated performance during the run-in. Everton won five of their final eight matches, keeping six clean sheets, including home victories against Chelsea, Arsenal and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s sorry side. Of the starting XI against United the influential Idrissa Gueye and Kurt Zouma are no longer on Everton\u2019s books, although Silva has not abandoned all hope of re-signing the Chelsea defender on a permanent basis. Gueye is a significant loss, having got his head down and flourished last season when others would have sulked after being denied a dream January move to Paris Saint-Germain. Both need replacing in what may prove a hectic end to the transfer window \u2013 with Mainz\u2019s Jean-Philippe Gbamin earmarked as Gueye\u2019s successor \u2013 and yet there is greater stability within the Everton squad than for several years. With United and Arsenal vulnerable, to say the least, Silva\u2019s side are among those who see Europa League qualification and bridging the gap to the top six as achievable targets. Ending a trophy drought that has reached 24 years \u2013 the joint-longest in the club\u2019s history (and the second world war was a factor in the other) \u2013 is also on the manager\u2019s bonus list. As the imminent deal for the Juventus striker Moise Kean and \u00a350m-plus bid for Wilfried Zaha confirm, there is work to be done beyond filling the gaps left by Zouma and Gueye. Everton ended last season strongly but an upturn that began with a committed draw against Liverpool in March, the last point taken from J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s challengers during the title race, was not without lapses.

      "bodyText": "The pound fell below $1.21 for the first time since January 2017 as concerns mounted that the UK is heading for a no-deal Brexit. Sterling fell to $1.2085 before edging up to $1.2104, down 0.45% against a stronger US dollar. Against the euro the pound fell 0.01% to \u20ac1.0978. The dollar rose on currency markets after the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, cut interest rates on Wednesday but indicated there were fewer cuts to come than expected. The pound has also been under severe pressure because Boris Johnson has pledged that the UK will leave the EU on 31 October with or without a deal. The prime minister has said he will not negotiate with the EU unless it drops backstop arrangements to prevent a hard border in Ireland. He has also announced \u00a32.1bn of extra spending to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. \u201cSterling remains vulnerable to a further escalation in Brexit tensions and we anticipate the market will likely discount higher risks of a no-deal outcome in the weeks ahead,\u201d Roger Hallam, the currency chief investment officer at JP Morgan Asset Management, told Reuters. The pound was also affected by a bleak manufacturing survey that showed factory managers cutting production at the fastest pace since 2012. Sterling\u2019s fall will be felt immediately by holidaymakers abroad. At airports, travellers have been getting less than a euro and little more than a dollar for each \u00a31. In the longer run, a weak pound will increase the price of imports, from foodstuffs to electronic gadgets, pushing up inflation and it indicates a lack of confidence about the UK\u2019s prospects in international markets.",

Aside from the fact that both protagonists were separately married at a time when divorce was only granted on proof of a matrimonial crime, the book became notorious for its explicit descriptions of sex, its use of then-unprintable four-letter words and a reference to anal sex, which was illegal at the time. The book challenged establishment values and, although it had been published elsewhere in Europe in 1928, remained unpublished in the UK for 30 years following Lawrence\u2019s death in 1930, as publishers were fearful of prosecution. Penguin\u2019s co-founder Allen Lane wanted to publish an unabridged cheap paperback version for three shillings and sixpence, the same price as 10 cigarettes, to make it affordable for the \u201cyoung and the hoi polloi\u201d. The previous year had seen the enactment of the Obscene Publications Act 1959, which introduced a defence for publishers if they showed that a work was of literary merit and for the public good. The trial of Penguin Books was a test case of the new law. The defence called 35 professors of literature, authors, journalists, editors, critics, publishers and child education experts, and four Anglican churchmen, who each declared that the book had sufficient literary merit to deserve publication for the public good. The jury returned in three hours and on 2 November 1960 delivered a verdict of not guilty. Within three months, Penguin had sold more than 3m copies.

The central bank said business investment was stalling, with trade tensions and slowing demand in the global economy also having an impact on UK growth. Britain has a 33% probability of falling into recession by the end of the first quarter of 2020 even if a Brexit deal is reached, the bank said, because of the impact from heightened uncertainty.

The pound was also knocked on Thursday by a closely watched manufacturing survey, which showed that output in the sector fell at the fastest pace in nearly seven years in July. Against the deteriorating UK backdrop, the Bank\u2019s nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) voted unanimously to leave interest rates on hold at 0.75% on Thursday.

Don\u2019t Call Me Up has been a hit not just in the UK but the US, hence the Dua Lipa comparisons. So smooth, in fact, that McVey has been at pains to point out that nepotism has nothing to do with it. She certainly comes from hip music industry stock \u2013 her mum is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/neneh-cherry\">Neneh Cherry</a>, her father Cameron McVey was the executive producer of Massive Attack\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/dec/06/massive-attack-blue-lines-review\">Blue Lines</a> \u2013 but anyone searching for sonic evidence of her lineage on High Expectations is going to go home disappointed. It goes fangs-out for the 2019 pop jugular, with a host of familiar names on hand to help ensure its success is as much of a foregone conclusion as possible: Steve Mac, whose hit-making career stretches back to mid-90s boybands Damage and 5ive and whose recent songwriting successes include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ed-sheeran\">Ed Sheeran</a>\u2019s Shape of You and Clean Bandit\u2019s Rockabye and Symphony; Fraser T Smith of Adele and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/stormzy\">Stormzy</a> fame; MNEK, co-author of Dua Lipa\u2019s IDGAF among others and Jimmy Napes, whose fingerprints are on huge chunks of both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/sam-smith\">Sam Smith</a> albums.</p> <p>On the plus side, that helps ensure the songs are uniformly well turned. There\u2019s a certain bullish confidence about the fact that most of McVey\u2019s previous hits are confined to bonus-track status, and if nothing leaps out in quite the same way as Don\u2019t Call Me Up, nor is there much in the way of obvious filler: there\u2019s a lot of hooky razzle-dazzle about the choruses of Bad Behaviour and Selfish Love; it\u2019s no stretch of the imagination to picture even the relatively low-key We Don\u2019t Say or Trouble taking up residence in the Top 40. In the debit column, however, playlist-fuelled 2019 pop prizes a certain homogeneity: a scan of the singles chart over the 27 weeks that Don\u2019t Call Me Up has been hanging around strongly suggests that no mainstream pop artist other than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/29/lil-nas-xs-old-town-road-sets-new-record-for-most-weeks-at-no-1\">Lil Nas X</a> is currently making it big as a result of their devastating originality and penchant for recklessly tearing up the rules. There\u2019s a weird disjunction between McVey\u2019s lyrics, which are big on telling you what a caution-to-the-winds handful she is, and the music that supports them, which sticks pretty fast to the well-made pop-R&amp;B playbook: \u201cI\u2019m not a people pleaser,\u201d she sings on Bad Behaviour, over a backing that\u2019s clearly intent on pleasing as many people as possible.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY1tULEr4-4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hY1tULEr4-4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Mabel: Mad Love \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Occasionally, though, something of the person who made it does make herself felt amid the Auto-Tuned vocals, tropical house synths and reggaeton-inspired rhythm tracks. OK details her struggles with anxiety, which, judging by her interviews, are very real, but alas are expressed via cliches: \u201cIt\u2019s OK not to be OK.\u201d The really interesting thing about the track, however, has nothing to do with the lyrics: it\u2019s the slight, but detectable, jazzy lilt to the chorus melody, which doesn\u2019t quite take the route you expect it to. Interlude Stckhlm [sic] Syndrome is better still. By some distance the most interesting track on the album, it takes as its starting point a mid-90s R&amp;B slow-jam, suggesting the presence of influences from outside the standard 2019 pop catchment area. It says something about how narrow said catchment area is that a track influenced by mid-90s R&amp;B gives the listener a jolt, but you can\u2019t argue with the end result, which is really well done, a blissful electronic drift that avoids sounding like an obvious pastiche.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/mar/06/sign-up-for-the-sleeve-notes-email\">Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras</a> </p> </aside>  <p>High Expectations could use a couple more moments like that, although it probably doesn\u2019t need them to be a huge success: it\u2019s got the big killer pop hit and a tracklist thick with potential follow-ups.

In the debit column, however, playlist-fuelled 2019 pop prizes a certain homogeneity: a scan of the singles chart over the 27 weeks that Don\u2019t Call Me Up has been hanging around strongly suggests that no mainstream pop artist other than Lil Nas X is currently making it big as a result of their devastating originality and penchant for recklessly tearing up the rules. There\u2019s a weird disjunction between McVey\u2019s lyrics, which are big on telling you what a caution-to-the-winds handful she is, and the music that supports them, which sticks pretty fast to the well-made pop-R&amp;B playbook: \u201cI\u2019m not a people pleaser,\u201d she sings on Bad Behaviour, over a backing that\u2019s clearly intent on pleasing as many people as possible. Occasionally, though, something of the person who made it does make herself felt amid the Auto-Tuned vocals, tropical house synths and reggaeton-inspired rhythm tracks. OK details her struggles with anxiety, which, judging by her interviews, are very real, but alas are expressed via cliches: \u201cIt\u2019s OK not to be OK.\u201d The really interesting thing about the track, however, has nothing to do with the lyrics: it\u2019s the slight, but detectable, jazzy lilt to the chorus melody, which doesn\u2019t quite take the route you expect it to. Interlude Stckhlm [sic] Syndrome is better still. By some distance the most interesting track on the album, it takes as its starting point a mid-90s R&amp;B slow-jam, suggesting the presence of influences from outside the standard 2019 pop catchment area. It says something about how narrow said catchment area is that a track influenced by mid-90s R&amp;B gives the listener a jolt, but you can\u2019t argue with the end result, which is really well done, a blissful electronic drift that avoids sounding like an obvious pastiche. High Expectations could use a couple more moments like that, although it probably doesn\u2019t need them to be a huge success: it\u2019s got the big killer pop hit and a tracklist thick with potential follow-ups. As it is, you\u2019re left with a solid, well-made pop album that occasionally hints its maker might be more interesting and individual: time will show if that\u2019s the case, but the immediate future seems secure.

      "body": "<p>On 20 January 1981, in his inaugural address as 40th president of the United States, Ronald Reagan declared: \u201cGovernment is not the solution to our problem, government <em>is</em> the problem.\u201d It was the soundbite that defined the end of the 20th century. \u201cRolling back the state\u201d became the mission of the \u201cmarket revolution\u201d spearheaded by Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.</p> <p>In fact, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/donald-sassoon\" title=\"\">Donald Sassoon</a> argues in <em>The Anxious Triumph</em>, the idea that the state and the capitalist economy can thrive apart is nonsense. The modern state and economy are twins born together in the 17th century. Through the age of absolutism and the great 18th-century revolutions, their relationship matured into one of ever-greater interdependence. This was most evident in the newcomer nations of the 19th century, like Meiji Japan or Bismarckian Germany. But it was every bit as true of a \u201cliberal\u201d power like Victorian Britain.</p> <p>How precisely economic and political interests are articulated varies across the world and depends very much on a nation\u2019s place in the international order. Part of the reason classical liberalism could acquire such a hold on Victorian Britain was that the UK moved first. Having constructed a powerful combination of a centralised fiscal state and a global empire, the UK didn\u2019t flesh out its nation state apparatus or articulate a strong vision of a national economy until the 20th century. But then, as the historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/16/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-british-nation-and-these-islands-review\" title=\"\">David Edgerton</a> has recently shown, it did so with a vengeance.</p> <p>When you say that you want to roll back the state, what you really mean is that you want to reconfigure the relationship. Libertarians, down to today\u2019s advocates of cryptocurrency, may dream. But the divorce they fantasise about is not a utopia but a nightmare. Insofar as it has ever existed, anarcho-capitalism is a product of disastrous state failure. Its life is nasty, brutish and short.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem</p> <footer> <cite>Ronald Reagan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If the problem of the relationship of government and the economy is nevertheless posed over and over again, it is because on both sides it is fraught with tension. In order to function, as Sassoon stresses, states need politics, and that involves squabbling elites and more or less mobilised masses. Mass politics and modern ideologies, above all nationalism, have explosive potential. Indeed, if taken seriously, the very notion of politics as a process of collective choice and self-empowerment is antithetical to an economic system based on binding contracts between entrenched private interests that have no regard for the political collectivity.</p> <p>A long line of liberals down to the neoliberals of our own age draw the conclusion that the solution is to tame politics: through law, international treaties, independent central banks and so on. That, not surprisingly, draws political opposition, both from the left and the right. But even more destabilising is the fact that liberals are on the whole hopelessly unrealistic about what actually makes the economy tick.</p> <p>The arcadia of self-equilibrating markets, falsely attributed to Adam Smith, was one such fantasy. As Sassoon shows, even in the 19th century, not many people really believed in it. The 20th-century version was the macroeconomic idea of the national economy that could be governed like a machine. That, as we now realise, was in large part an artefact of national economic statistics. Numbers like GDP gave us a false sense of common interest in enlarging the collective pie.</p> <p>Neither the utopian notion of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/07/economics-invisible-hand-adam-smith\" title=\"\">invisible hand</a>\u201d nor the Lego-brick conception of the national economy captures the dynamic, disruptive, creative destruction that is the reality of actually existing capitalism. It is a protean force perpetually generating inequality, crises and the all-pervasive anxiety that gives Sassoon\u2019s book its title.</p> <p>There have been periods in which the tensions in this fraught relationship have been highly contained. The mid-20th century, the moment of the Beveridgean welfare state, was one when the state and economy were held in a fine balance. The periods before 1945 and from the 1970s onwards have been more unstable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ea7d7ba5f2c584b00ce8ac39e880b62a2f1f358\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ea7d7ba5f2c584b00ce8ac39e880b62a2f1f358/0_287_4287_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher with Ronald reagan, 1981.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Thatcher with Reagan in 1981.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sassoon\u2019s book speaks to the present by conjuring up the era between the 1850s and 1914, in which the tensions between global capitalism and modern politics came clearly to the fore. This was the first age of modern politics, if not of democracy \u2013 the age of Gladstone, Disraeli, Lincoln and Bismarck. It was the age of imperialism and early experiments in social insurance. It was the age of railways, steamships and the boom and bust of the global cotton industry.</p> <p>Sassoon offers us a sprawling map, studded with fascinating details. Curious about the urban poor in 19th-century Naples? Want to know why liberalism was stunted in late-19th-century Romania? Sassoon is your man. Ever heard of the city of Elkader, Iowa, founded in 1846? No, neither had I. It was named, it turns out, in honour of the Emir Abd el-Kader, leader of the resistance against the French occupation of Algeria.</p> <p>As one is thrown from cameo to improbable cameo, reading Sassoon becomes a hallucinatory experience. Insights are proffered and then repeated, sometimes several times. Familiar facts mingle with jaw-dropping novelties. The chronology drifts, at times roaring into the present before retracting not just to the 19th century, but deep into the 18th.</p> <p>Is there some artful design at work behind the apparent confusion? Is the book\u2019s swirling disorder meant to mirror its subject? If, as Sassoon remarks, capitalism moves \u201cwithout a goal or a project\u201d, would it be misleading for a historian to impose too much order or narrative coherence? If so, it is a pitfall Sassoon triumphantly avoids. But in a book of 758 pages, the effect is mind-boggling, and not in a good way.</p> <p>Those craving order may do better to approach Sassoon\u2019s book chapter by chapter. Skip over the preface in which he impatiently refuses to define capitalism and the first chapters in which he meanders through the history of 19th-century state formation. Home in, instead, on his detailed discussion of the role of the Japanese elite in industrialisation, or savour his classically Gramscian reading of the failure of the Italian bourgeoisie. Even better is Sassoon\u2019s discussion of the global spread of democratic political practice before 1914. Skip the chapter that narrates the history of colonialism as a rather moth-eaten house of horrors. Others do anti-imperialism more convincingly. Instead, enjoy Sassoon\u2019s opinionated treatment of French and British parliamentary debates about the rationale of empire.</p> <p>Or, you could start near the end, where one of Sassoon\u2019s best chapters describes how the great recession of 1873 sparked an awareness of globalisation and triggered a wave of protectionism. He surveys the French debate with real flair but is far too dismissive of protectionism in Britain. It was never \u201cfashionable\u201d he blithely tells us, waving Joe Chamberlain aside.</p> <p>But read on from there and you are in for a final surprise. Suddenly and without warning, just short of 1914 Sassoon calls a halt. From the trade wars of the early 20th century he jumps into the future. Vaulting over the first and second world wars, he takes us on a sweeping overview of pro- and anti-capitalist politics, complete with nods to Venezuela\u2019s die-hard Chavistas, and Hyman Minsky, the prophet of the 2008 crisis. It is quirkily brilliant. But it is also a diversion. A history of gilded-age capitalism that rightly insists on the inextricable entanglement of the economy and state power, but which does not address the first world war, lapses into nostalgia.

Tens of thousands of protesters demonstrated against the US president in London before he attended a D-day commemoration service in Portsmouth. The total cost to the Met for policing the visit was \u00a33,419,905, with more than 6,300 officers deployed during the three-day UK trip, according to figures released under the Freedom of Information Act. The Met spent just under \u00a33m policing the president\u2019s previous visit to the UK in 2018, although the total cost of that four-day trip came in at more than \u00a314.2m to forces across the UK. A breakdown of costs for the state visit shows more than \u00a3800,000 was spent on overtime, \u00a3215,000 on infrastructure, \u00a331,385 on fleet costs, \u00a323,000 on hotels, \u00a334,481 on catering and \u00a341,000 on mutual aid. Trump\u2019s first official state visit to the UK began on 3 June and included a state banquet with the Queen at Buckingham Palace. He subsequently spent two nights in Ireland. Jeremy Corbyn addressed crowds of protesters from a stage in Whitehall during the second day of the president\u2019s visit, while Trump dismissed reports of demonstrations as \u201cfake news\u201d. Scotland Yard said four arrests were made: one for possession of pepper spray and a class B drug, one for criminal damage and two for outraging public decency. Before Trump\u2019s visit, a Met spokeswoman said: \u201cA very experienced command team is preparing the multi-faceted policing and security operation for the president\u2019s visit and, whilst the Met has a responsibility to ensure the right to lawful protest, this needs to be balanced with the complex requirements of this policing plan.\u201d The data released by the force shows more than 6,300 police officers were deployed during Trump\u2019s visit, with the majority on the streets during his two days in London. On 3 June, the day the president flew into Stansted on Air Force One, there were 2,714 police, ranking from PC to deputy assistant commissioner, on duty, as well as 14 other police staff. The following day, when the largest protests took place, 3,249 police officers were on duty, along with 30 other police staff. There were 411 officers deployed in London as Trump attended the D-day event in Portsmouth, and 306 were in place on 2 June, as the force prepared for the president\u2019s arrival, while just 38 were on duty on 6 June when he visited Ireland. Hampshire police deployed their own officers during his visit to the commemoration event at the Portsmouth naval museum but will not publish figures until later in the year.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In a July 2016 <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/borisjohnson/posts/you-know-when-someone-is-losing-an-argument-because-they-suddenly-get-all-rattle/10153755801946317/\">Facebook post</a> backing comments made by billionaire Brexit-backer James Dyson, who recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/22/dyson-to-move-company-hq-to-singapore\">moved his company to Singapore</a>, Johnson wrote: \u201cAs Dyson points out, tariffs would mean the Germans would be cutting their own throats.

Armisen and Hader are both playing women here, and the subject matter has to be pushed into an uncharacteristically absurd area to top the genuine batshittery of the source material.

And this makes Juan Likes Rice &amp; Chicken my personal favourite. The action is transplanted from Tokyo to Colombia, and the subject now only serves chicken, rice, a cup of coffee and half a banana to his diners, each produced only after a million identical rituals are performed.

      "body": "<p>Carrie Symonds is not some ingenue blond playmate of a rich and powerful older man. It is almost worse than that. As the partner of the new prime minister, she has become the visible authentication of the Boris Johnson brand: that\u2019s Boris the priapic, convention-busting, law-unto-himself, human bulldozer; a man of as many conflicting opinions as wives and mistresses and more children than principles. For him, moving his girlfriend into Downing Street while he is still married to someone else is one more way of saying that the normal rules don\u2019t apply.</p> <p>I\u2019m only guessing, but it seems realistic to assume that Symonds knows all this and is ready for the role as the first ever live-in girlfriend at No 10. She is in the communications business herself, after all. She did eight years at Conservative party headquarters, peaking with a year as boss of party communications. Hardly a role she\u2019s likely to submit for the public affairs category of <a href=\"https://www.prweek.com/article/1591909/prweek-uk-awards-2019-shortlist-revealed\" title=\"\">PR Week\u2019s 2019</a> awards, but then, in the lipstick-on-a-pig challenge, selling the Tories after the catastrophe of the 2017 general election must come pretty near the top.</p> <p>She is used to hanging out with senior politicians. She first met Johnson when she was seconded to his mayoral re-election campaign. She knows her way round Downing Street. Last summer, about the time gossip surfaced about her relationship with Johnson, she moved on from the Tory party to an entirely different and strikingly unpolitical role as an adviser for <a href=\"https://eu.oceana.org/en/home\" title=\"\">Oceana</a>, a global marine protection charity.</p> <p>Yet, of all the dramatic changes of tone Johnson has brought with him as prime minister, perhaps the most remarkable and the least observed aspect of the handover of power is that the traditional role of Downing Street as the arbiter of public respectability has been, well, redefined. The gap between Theresa May, a prime minister of unimpeachable moral uprightness, whose worst acknowledged sin was to run through a field of standing wheat and whose idea of a good time is to act as steward at a constituency fun run, to Johnson \u2013 a serial adulterer, a man who has been sacked by at least two bosses for lying and who is openly attacked by former colleagues as a charlatan? In its own way, it represents a reversal as startling, if not as significant, as the US turn from Obama to Trump.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3f662292f69a0802ce82f129df1978398cf7147e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f662292f69a0802ce82f129df1978398cf7147e/0_552_3000_3749/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Socially liberal, greenish, economically on the right\u2019: Symonds at an anti-whaling protest.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Socially liberal, greenish, economically on the right\u2019: Symonds at an anti-whaling protest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All Downing Street wives find they have a role that the media requires them to inhabit. Carrie Symonds has the thankless role of embodying this transformation to the age of Johnson. More, she has to lend it a kind of cover: she has to put it beyond question. For it is important to remember that Johnson\u2019s bid for power only once looked fragile. It faltered in the aftermath of reports that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/21/police-called-to-loud-altercation-at-boris-johnsons-home\" title=\"\">police had been called</a> to the home he shared with Symonds after neighbours became alarmed by a late-night dispute \u2013 the police took no action \u2013 and it only regained momentum after a media campaign backing a reversal of the traditional model: the idea that even a prime minister is entitled to privacy. A readers\u2019 poll in the <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1144350/boris-johnson-latest-tory-leader-private-life-carrie-symonds-questions\" title=\"\">Daily Express</a> enthusiastically confirmed that Johnson\u2019s private life was his own. In his favour, on this Johnson has the merit of consistency. He could never be accused of hypocrisy.</p> <p>There is nothing new about politicians having extramarital affairs, nor their partners doing the same. The list of prime ministerial philandering is long and almost certainly far from complete. David Lloyd George was a notorious womaniser, once allegedly interviewed while in bed with two women (although a decade after he had left Downing Street), who finally married his mistress after 30 years. Herbert Asquith wrote passionate letters to Venetia Stanley, a friend of his daughter\u2019s, during a ministerial argument over the carnage on the western front. Labour prime ministers were no more uxorious, merely more discreet. Ramsay MacDonald allegedly had a long relationship with a Vietnamese woman in a house a short walk from Westminster.</p> <p>But, in the face of stories this weekend involving the arrangements for the traditional prime ministerial visit to Balmoral in August \u2013 and whether it would break royal protocol for Symonds to accompany Johnson before his divorced is finalised \u2013 the Downing Street line is that this isn\u2019t the 1920s, but 2019. There is no such thing, by implication, as respectability, a word redefined in a special Johnsonian way so that it smothers its underlying reference to problematic ideas such as morality.</p> <p>Obviously, ideas have changed since the mid-20th century, when Dorothy, the wife of the Tory prime minister Harold Macmillan \u2013 and a daughter of the ducal Devonshire family \u2013 had a long relationship with another Conservative MP, Bob Boothby, a fact that her husband reluctantly accommodated for 30 years. Throughout her life, the affair remained both widely known at Westminster and entirely unreported. Unsurprisingly, when Macmillan\u2019s defence minister, John Profumo, was found in 1963 to have lied to the House of Commons about his intimate relationship with Christine Keeler, conducted while she was having an affair with the Russian military attache, raising genuine issues of security, the prime minister was ready to dismiss it as a private matter. His misjudgment marked the moment where British morality forked: one group saw what 1963 Philip Larkin poem Annus Mirabilis, about the affair, called the \u201cinvention of sex\u201d. The others saw a decline in standards.</p> <p>The Profumo affair was the first modern sex scandal. Ever since, policing politicians\u2019 private lives has been a media staple, and what goes on behind the glossy black door of No 10 is treated with as much hypocritical reverence as if it was a template for the times.</p> <p>From John Major\u2019s misinterpreted attempt to return to basics (despite his infidelity) to May\u2019s #MeToo crisis, in which a series of ministers were sacked for predatory sexual conduct, the history of Downing Street politics could be summed up as one unending contest between respectability and scandal. The prime minister\u2019s role, according to the writer and Johnson biographer Andrew Gimson is \u201cto marshall the forces of respectability ... to uphold, both in his or her own person and as leader of the government, the standards of behaviour which command the support of respectable people\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"83e44dbfc1446a114b7ca57abb553626ec1a18b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83e44dbfc1446a114b7ca57abb553626ec1a18b7/51_212_3367_2020/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cherie Blair with her husband Tony as they moved into Downing Street in May 1997.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cherie Blair with her husband Tony as they moved into Downing Street in May 1997.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The question now is whether asking a media grown rich on prurience to accept Symonds as first girlfriend is just another appeal for tolerance of Johnson exceptionalism or something more. Could it be that his fans in the media-owning classes see him not as the admirable epitome of the new norm of social liberalism, but rather as the vehicle for the restoration of a status quo in which the private morality of powerful politicians is a matter only for them?</p> <p>That might depend on where the bar for this particular type of \u201crespectability\u201d really lies. To most people, cohabitation is the new normal; it just hasn\u2019t been tried at No 10 before. The <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/bulletins/populationestimatesbymaritalstatusandlivingarrangements/2002to2017\" title=\"\">statistics</a> show that it is creeping up on marriage as the preferred form of coupledom. It is true that most couples still choose marriage, and less than a fifth cohabit, but that tots up to nearly 5 million people living together without any formal legal status. Another million cohabit with new partners after divorce. Many of them will be of the same generation as Symonds. And, if there are enough Tory millennials for there to be a type, then Symonds appears to be it: socially liberal, greenish, economically to the right. Johnson has a partner who is recognisable to younger voters, and it is clear from his early pronouncements as PM that he recognises the value of her brand, too. In each speech, there were nods to the green agenda sitting uneasily alongside less green pledges such as ending the ban on genetically modified organisms and the party\u2019s commitment to a free vote on fox hunting.</p> <p>In the end, it will likely be the weight of small-c conservative attitudes to marriage against the weight of attitudes to Johnson himself that decide.

      "bodyText": "Carrie Symonds is not some ingenue blond playmate of a rich and powerful older man. It is almost worse than that. As the partner of the new prime minister, she has become the visible authentication of the Boris Johnson brand: that\u2019s Boris the priapic, convention-busting, law-unto-himself, human bulldozer; a man of as many conflicting opinions as wives and mistresses and more children than principles. For him, moving his girlfriend into Downing Street while he is still married to someone else is one more way of saying that the normal rules don\u2019t apply. I\u2019m only guessing, but it seems realistic to assume that Symonds knows all this and is ready for the role as the first ever live-in girlfriend at No 10. She is in the communications business herself, after all. She did eight years at Conservative party headquarters, peaking with a year as boss of party communications. Hardly a role she\u2019s likely to submit for the public affairs category of PR Week\u2019s 2019 awards, but then, in the lipstick-on-a-pig challenge, selling the Tories after the catastrophe of the 2017 general election must come pretty near the top. She is used to hanging out with senior politicians. She first met Johnson when she was seconded to his mayoral re-election campaign. She knows her way round Downing Street. Last summer, about the time gossip surfaced about her relationship with Johnson, she moved on from the Tory party to an entirely different and strikingly unpolitical role as an adviser for Oceana, a global marine protection charity. Yet, of all the dramatic changes of tone Johnson has brought with him as prime minister, perhaps the most remarkable and the least observed aspect of the handover of power is that the traditional role of Downing Street as the arbiter of public respectability has been, well, redefined. The gap between Theresa May, a prime minister of unimpeachable moral uprightness, whose worst acknowledged sin was to run through a field of standing wheat and whose idea of a good time is to act as steward at a constituency fun run, to Johnson \u2013 a serial adulterer, a man who has been sacked by at least two bosses for lying and who is openly attacked by former colleagues as a charlatan? In its own way, it represents a reversal as startling, if not as significant, as the US turn from Obama to Trump. All Downing Street wives find they have a role that the media requires them to inhabit. Carrie Symonds has the thankless role of embodying this transformation to the age of Johnson. More, she has to lend it a kind of cover: she has to put it beyond question. For it is important to remember that Johnson\u2019s bid for power only once looked fragile. It faltered in the aftermath of reports that the police had been called to the home he shared with Symonds after neighbours became alarmed by a late-night dispute \u2013 the police took no action \u2013 and it only regained momentum after a media campaign backing a reversal of the traditional model: the idea that even a prime minister is entitled to privacy. A readers\u2019 poll in the Daily Express enthusiastically confirmed that Johnson\u2019s private life was his own. In his favour, on this Johnson has the merit of consistency. He could never be accused of hypocrisy. There is nothing new about politicians having extramarital affairs, nor their partners doing the same. The list of prime ministerial philandering is long and almost certainly far from complete. David Lloyd George was a notorious womaniser, once allegedly interviewed while in bed with two women (although a decade after he had left Downing Street), who finally married his mistress after 30 years. Herbert Asquith wrote passionate letters to Venetia Stanley, a friend of his daughter\u2019s, during a ministerial argument over the carnage on the western front. Labour prime ministers were no more uxorious, merely more discreet. Ramsay MacDonald allegedly had a long relationship with a Vietnamese woman in a house a short walk from Westminster. But, in the face of stories this weekend involving the arrangements for the traditional prime ministerial visit to Balmoral in August \u2013 and whether it would break royal protocol for Symonds to accompany Johnson before his divorced is finalised \u2013 the Downing Street line is that this isn\u2019t the 1920s, but 2019. There is no such thing, by implication, as respectability, a word redefined in a special Johnsonian way so that it smothers its underlying reference to problematic ideas such as morality. Obviously, ideas have changed since the mid-20th century, when Dorothy, the wife of the Tory prime minister Harold Macmillan \u2013 and a daughter of the ducal Devonshire family \u2013 had a long relationship with another Conservative MP, Bob Boothby, a fact that her husband reluctantly accommodated for 30 years. Throughout her life, the affair remained both widely known at Westminster and entirely unreported. Unsurprisingly, when Macmillan\u2019s defence minister, John Profumo, was found in 1963 to have lied to the House of Commons about his intimate relationship with Christine Keeler, conducted while she was having an affair with the Russian military attache, raising genuine issues of security, the prime minister was ready to dismiss it as a private matter. His misjudgment marked the moment where British morality forked: one group saw what 1963 Philip Larkin poem Annus Mirabilis, about the affair, called the \u201cinvention of sex\u201d. The others saw a decline in standards. The Profumo affair was the first modern sex scandal. Ever since, policing politicians\u2019 private lives has been a media staple, and what goes on behind the glossy black door of No 10 is treated with as much hypocritical reverence as if it was a template for the times. From John Major\u2019s misinterpreted attempt to return to basics (despite his infidelity) to May\u2019s #MeToo crisis, in which a series of ministers were sacked for predatory sexual conduct, the history of Downing Street politics could be summed up as one unending contest between respectability and scandal. The prime minister\u2019s role, according to the writer and Johnson biographer Andrew Gimson is \u201cto marshall the forces of respectability ... to uphold, both in his or her own person and as leader of the government, the standards of behaviour which command the support of respectable people\u201d. The question now is whether asking a media grown rich on prurience to accept Symonds as first girlfriend is just another appeal for tolerance of Johnson exceptionalism or something more. Could it be that his fans in the media-owning classes see him not as the admirable epitome of the new norm of social liberalism, but rather as the vehicle for the restoration of a status quo in which the private morality of powerful politicians is a matter only for them? That might depend on where the bar for this particular type of \u201crespectability\u201d really lies. To most people, cohabitation is the new normal; it just hasn\u2019t been tried at No 10 before. The statistics show that it is creeping up on marriage as the preferred form of coupledom. It is true that most couples still choose marriage, and less than a fifth cohabit, but that tots up to nearly 5 million people living together without any formal legal status. Another million cohabit with new partners after divorce. Many of them will be of the same generation as Symonds. And, if there are enough Tory millennials for there to be a type, then Symonds appears to be it: socially liberal, greenish, economically to the right. Johnson has a partner who is recognisable to younger voters, and it is clear from his early pronouncements as PM that he recognises the value of her brand, too. In each speech, there were nods to the green agenda sitting uneasily alongside less green pledges such as ending the ban on genetically modified organisms and the party\u2019s commitment to a free vote on fox hunting. In the end, it will likely be the weight of small-c conservative attitudes to marriage against the weight of attitudes to Johnson himself that decide. He is such a profoundly divisive character that those who love him do so in the face of his record and, probably, regardless of his personal life. For those who don\u2019t, the list of reasons to dislike him stretches too far for his private arrangements to be decisive. But evidence suggests that the Brexit divide is a values divide and the latest YouGov polling shows that women are much less impressed with Johnson than men. And while the question of Symonds\u2019 status might be the most revealing of the dilemmas faced by female partners on the threshold of Downing Street, it is not the only one. Last week, she stood expressionless among Downing Street staff in a mirror image of Philip May at earlier prime ministerial lectern moments, although more strikingly dressed in pink. But, even if she wants to, she will struggle to stay invisible. Being the prime ministerial wife (in very distinct opposition to being the PM\u2019s husband) has probably always been a performance art, and the challenge is how to escape it.

It\u2019s 1973 in Chandannagar, a small bustling city in West Bengal, 30-odd miles upstream from Kolkata on the banks of the Hooghly River. I\u2019m sitting on the high cushioned seat, enjoying the breeze blowing my hair back on a hot, humid day. The rickshaw-wallah weaves through the narrow lanes; we go past one of the larger ponds, the curved trunks of coconut trees loom over its edges. He swerves, narrowly avoiding the rows of clay goddesses laid out to dry on the ground by people preparing for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/gallery/2018/aug/28/bengals-durga-puja-a-hindu-festival-in-full-flow-in-pictures\" title=\"\">the festival of Durga Puja</a>.

Prime minister Indira Gandhi\u2019s Soviet-style protectionism means that there has been no influx of cheap foreign imports \u2013 and there\u2019s a waiting list of several years to buy the only Indian-made vehicle, the Ambassador, a lugubrious old-fashioned car that looks like it has come straight out of a 1940s film. In any case, the narrow roads make it difficult to drive in Chandannagar. We pass other rickshaws, cyclists, cows and piles of rubbish on the roadside. It is a dirty, messy place but beautiful, too. I will live here for a few more months before we return to England, where I will spend the rest of my life.</p> <p>I\u2019ve always been obsessed by those rickshaw rides of my childhood: the large wheels, the driver, the antiquated silvery carriage reminding me of Cinderella\u2019s coach.

And the rickshaws that plied the small roads, requiring no petrol.</p> <p>I wanted to go back to Chandannagar for a holiday with my husband and daughter. It would be a first visit in six years. But, recently, I\u2019ve been filled with dread about the turbocharged growth in India: the increase in the number of cars, the levels of pollution in the cities, the effects of climate change, the McDonald\u2019s restaurants and Vodafone stores. Someone reported that there may even be a KFC in the bazaar in Chandannagar. I worried, that, like an unstoppable plague, the city would be altered by the advances of capitalism. In particular, I worried that Chandannagar\u2019s narrow roads, its trees and ponds, would be overrun with cars \u2013 metal junk, spewing smoke and pollution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a20a968d1727ad0d39fa8ffb3458059ca62f0f68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a20a968d1727ad0d39fa8ffb3458059ca62f0f68/0_0_5138_3418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chandannagar and the Hooghly River, West Bengal, India.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chandannagar and the Hooghly River.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tuul and Bruno Morandi/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I took the plunge, though, and off we went.</p> <p>We arrive, and to my relief it all looks kind of the same. I go with my aunt and daughter to visit the bazaar \u2013 there\u2019s no KFC. There are still myriad dark little shops selling spices, gaudy plastic mugs, gleaming piles of wet fish and mounds of okra, onions and aubergines. We stop at the Banerjee Tea shop, where I buy loose darjeeling tea, weighed out by the shopkeeper on old handheld metal scales with small dark weights. As we walk out onto the busy road outside, stepping round a goat lying on the pavement, I look around \u2013 there are still hardly any cars and it\u2019s the same chaotic mix of pedestrians, cycles and scooters. But I suddenly realise that cycle rickshaws seem to have disappeared. Instead, there are small three-wheeled e-rickshaws everywhere.</p> <p>My daughter doesn\u2019t want to walk back so my aunt says: \u201cCho, Toto nee-ay nee.\u201d (Come on, let\u2019s get a Toto).</p> <p>Ah, so that\u2019s what these electric vehicles are called: Totos. We clamber onto one: the driver is in the front and we are on cushioned benches facing one another at the back. My daughter loves it. Soon we are weaving through the streets, just like I used to as a child on an old-fashioned rickshaw. She loves the open sides and we look out onto the wide expanse of the brown-grey Hooghly River, go past fuchka-wallahs selling snacks of puffed wheat balls and spiced chickpeas. We hang on with a sense of fairground thrill, as the driver rides perilously close to some open drains at our side.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b848336b2b1eb036f26a9ef6d755c02f1a4404b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b848336b2b1eb036f26a9ef6d755c02f1a4404b/0_275_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Street vendor by the river hooghly, India.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Street vendor by the river.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rafal Cichawa/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I start to notice that everyone uses them: commuters, shoppers, schoolchildren. They\u2019re cheap to ride and perfect for little trips here and there. I\u2019m not usually interested in transport but I\u2019m excited when I start to think about the fact that Totos are battery-powered \u2013 they are not disgorging petrol or diesel fumes. Some even have solar panels on the roofs. There are thousands of bustling small cities in India like Chandannagar \u2013 where a huge proportion of India\u2019s 1.3 billion people actually live. The small-scale Toto suits these places, and people like them. Could they, I wonder, be a tantalising step forward in the fight against climate crisis?</p> <p>I find out more about how Totos have become part of the economic setup of a place such as Chandannagar. I\u2019m staying with my aunt, in an impoverished area called Chuna Goli \u2013 a long, narrow winding lane, with people washing themselves at communal pumps, and goats tethered to rudimentary brick houses. It used to be a slum area but, over the years, people have managed to earn a living as street vendors or rickshaw-wallahs and send their children to school. And now many of the young men are Toto drivers.</p> <p>Everyone congregates in the early evening by the <em>maidan</em> \u2013 the dusty playing field at the end of the lane \u2013 watching the sun go down by the river. I chat to locals Rahul and Paswan, young men who drive Totos. With their gelled hair, buzzing mobile phones and jokey nature, they are ambitious, but earning a living is hard as many in the area left school with no qualifications. Rahul tells me that several of his friends in Chuna Goli have scraped together the money to buy a Toto (for around \u00a31,500 each) and now hire them out to the others by the week or day, or even for a few hours. Paswan points to a couple of Totos parked at one end of the maidan that are being charged, telling me that he\u2019ll go off later to do a couple of hours in one of them, when the bazaar is busy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"49c3a7956cf6fdb929e572ee904c7c3b4374a536\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49c3a7956cf6fdb929e572ee904c7c3b4374a536/0_60_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Toto on the streets of Chandannagar, India\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Toto on the streets of Chandannagar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sheela Banerjee</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As I write, I\u2019m back in England and there are yet more headlines (and shocks) about the climate emergency: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/04/a-third-of-himalayan-ice-cap-doomed-finds-shocking-report\" title=\"\">A third of the Himalayan ice cap is doomed</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/02/the-devastation-of-human-life-is-in-view-what-a-burning-world-tells-us-about-climate-change-global-warming\" title=\"\">The devastation of human life is in view</a>. It\u2019s hard not to feel powerless and depressed.</p> <p>And yet \u2026 I feel the Toto is a small signal, emblematic of what could be done if only the will were there. My feeling of fragile optimism could well be justified. One news website describes Totos as the new <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/auto/car-news/electric-vehicle-revolution-india-is-ahead-of-china-but-not-because-of-electric-cars/1362031/\" title=\"\">electric-vehicle revolution</a> in India; another reports how <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-25/india-s-rickshaws-outnumber-china-s-electric-vehicles\" title=\"\">11,000 of them are hitting the streets of India every month</a>. I can\u2019t help but think what could be achieved if this eco-friendly form of transport was promoted across India, and if infrastructure such as solar-powered charging stations were introduced everywhere. In the second most populous country in the world, the humble Toto could make a significant impact in terms of climate crisis. I even wonder if e-rickshaws could be exported to the west, especially to our cities?</p> <p>At the end of our stay in Chandannagar my daughter and I take a Toto from Chuna Goli to my grandparents\u2019 old house where I used to live as a child. We come to their road, still too narrow for two cars to pass, still with the open drains at either side. \u201cAh there\u2019s the Shiva temple,\u201d I remember, \u201cat the top of the road.\u201d Where there used to be a rickshaw stand next to it there is now a block of flats. We are approaching my grandparents\u2019 house. I think I see it, and I crane my head from the Toto. But no, I realise with sadness that it\u2019s been knocked down and a new house built there instead. The mildewed stone walls, the huge carved wooden door, have all gone. The new owners have just kept the old sign. Most of the ponds in the area are gone and there are many more flats everywhere. We take a few pictures, our Toto moves on and we carry on enjoying our ride.</p> <p><strong>Looking for a holiday with a difference?

      "body": "<p>The Netherlands\u2019 so-called burqa ban has been rendered largely unworkable on its first day in law after both the police and Dutch transport companies signalled an unwillingness to enforce it.</p> <p>Under the terms of the Partial Ban on Face-Covering Clothing Act, the wearing of ski masks, full-face helmets, balaclavas, niqabs and burqas is prohibited in public buildings including schools and hospitals and on public transport.</p> <p>Wearers of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/14/headscarves-and-muslim-veil-ban-debate-timeline\">banned clothing</a> are to be given the option to remove the offending item or face a police fine of between \u20ac150 and \u20ac415. There is no prohibition on wearing such garments in the street.</p> <p>But the law appears to have been fatally undermined after police said its enforcement was not a priority and signalled their discomfort with the idea that veiled women could be put off from entering a police station to make unrelated complaints.</p> <p>Transport companies said in a response to the police position that they would not ask their staff on trains, metros, trams or buses to take on an enforcement role in the absence of officers.</p> <p>Pedro Peters, a spokesman for the RET transport network, said the law was unworkable. \u201cThe police have told us the ban is not a priority and that therefore they will not be able to respond inside the usual 30 minutes, if at all,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThis means that if a person wearing a burqa or a niqab is challenged trying to use a service, our staff will have no police backup to adjudicate on what they should do. It is not up to transport workers to impose the law and hand out fines.\u201d</p> <p>Staff have been instructed to advise women wearing face-covering clothing of the law but to allow entry.</p> <p>With confusion reigning, an editorial in the conservative Algemeen Dagblad newspaper caused an uproar by suggesting that those \u201cbothered\u201d by the wearing of the prohibited clothing could make a citizen\u2019s arrest, a position confirmed by the national police on Twitter.</p> <p>The exact number of women who wear burqas or niqabs in the Netherlands is unknown. A study in 2009 by an University of Amsterdam professor, Annelies Moors, estimated that just 100 women regularly wore a face veil and no more than 400 occasionally did so.</p> <p>The law was passed in 2016 by Mark Rutte\u2019s coalition government, largely in response to the growing popularity of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/geert-wilders\">Geert Wilders</a>\u2019 anti-Islam Freedom party.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/10/france-burqa-law-kenza-drider\">Why I will defy France's 'burqa law'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Netherlands is the sixth EU country to prohibit face-covering clothing in public buildings, a trend that was started by France in 2011 after the then president, Nicolas Sarkozy, said full-face veils were \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/22/islamic-veils-sarkozy-speech-france\">not welcome</a>\u201d.</p> <p>The Nida party in Rotterdam has said it will pay fines enforced on niqab wearers and has opened an account where people can deposit money. Rachid Nekkaz, an Algerian entrepreneur and activist, also said he would cover the costs of fines imposed in the Netherlands.</p> <p>Amsterdam\u2019s mayor, Femke Halsema, has expressed her dismay at the law and the city\u2019s authorities are expected to ignore it.</p> <p>Amnesty International has said the ban is an infringement of women\u2019s right to choose what they wear. But the European court of human rights ruled in 2014 that such bans were not in violation of the European convention on human rights.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Netherlands\u2019 so-called burqa ban has been rendered largely unworkable on its first day in law after both the police and Dutch transport companies signalled an unwillingness to enforce it. Under the terms of the Partial Ban on Face-Covering Clothing Act, the wearing of ski masks, full-face helmets, balaclavas, niqabs and burqas is prohibited in public buildings including schools and hospitals and on public transport. Wearers of the banned clothing are to be given the option to remove the offending item or face a police fine of between \u20ac150 and \u20ac415. There is no prohibition on wearing such garments in the street. But the law appears to have been fatally undermined after police said its enforcement was not a priority and signalled their discomfort with the idea that veiled women could be put off from entering a police station to make unrelated complaints. Transport companies said in a response to the police position that they would not ask their staff on trains, metros, trams or buses to take on an enforcement role in the absence of officers. Pedro Peters, a spokesman for the RET transport network, said the law was unworkable. \u201cThe police have told us the ban is not a priority and that therefore they will not be able to respond inside the usual 30 minutes, if at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThis means that if a person wearing a burqa or a niqab is challenged trying to use a service, our staff will have no police backup to adjudicate on what they should do. It is not up to transport workers to impose the law and hand out fines.\u201d Staff have been instructed to advise women wearing face-covering clothing of the law but to allow entry. With confusion reigning, an editorial in the conservative Algemeen Dagblad newspaper caused an uproar by suggesting that those \u201cbothered\u201d by the wearing of the prohibited clothing could make a citizen\u2019s arrest, a position confirmed by the national police on Twitter. The exact number of women who wear burqas or niqabs in the Netherlands is unknown. A study in 2009 by an University of Amsterdam professor, Annelies Moors, estimated that just 100 women regularly wore a face veil and no more than 400 occasionally did so. The law was passed in 2016 by Mark Rutte\u2019s coalition government, largely in response to the growing popularity of Geert Wilders\u2019 anti-Islam Freedom party. The Netherlands is the sixth EU country to prohibit face-covering clothing in public buildings, a trend that was started by France in 2011 after the then president, Nicolas Sarkozy, said full-face veils were \u201cnot welcome\u201d. The Nida party in Rotterdam has said it will pay fines enforced on niqab wearers and has opened an account where people can deposit money. Rachid Nekkaz, an Algerian entrepreneur and activist, also said he would cover the costs of fines imposed in the Netherlands. Amsterdam\u2019s mayor, Femke Halsema, has expressed her dismay at the law and the city\u2019s authorities are expected to ignore it. Amnesty International has said the ban is an infringement of women\u2019s right to choose what they wear. But the European court of human rights ruled in 2014 that such bans were not in violation of the European convention on human rights.",

It has a 67% fatality rate and 11 months after it began, the case numbers are still escalating. It is disproportionately affecting women (55% of cases) and children (28%).</p>\n    <p>The WHO declared the outbreak an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/17/drc-ebola-epidemic-is-international-emergency-says-who\">international public health emergency</a>&nbsp;in July 2019. The same month saw the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/15/ebola-virus-reaches-congolese-city-of-goma\">the first diagnosis of a case in Goma</a>, a city of 2 million people, which is a transport hub on the border with Rwanda. In early August Rwanda&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/aug/01/rwanda-closes-border-with-dr-congo-over-deadly-ebola-outbreak-goma\">announced that it was closing its border with DRC</a>.</p>\n    <p>The WHO has long said that the national and regional risk levels are very high and containment of the spread to North Kivu and Ituri provinces was unlikely, unless a break in the fighting made it safe for health workers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is Ebola and how do you treat it?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola\">Ebola</a>&nbsp;hemorrhagic fever is caused by a virus that has a reservoir among forest animals, including monkeys and bats. It is spread through body fluids, which is why carers \u2013 mostly female relatives and nursing staff \u2013 are particularly at risk. It causes fever, aches and diarrhoea and attacks the immune system, causing blood clotting cells to malfunction so that victims bleed extensively and die if their immune system cannot fight off the viral infection.</p>\n    <p>Drugs are still experimental. Patients are isolated and treated by nurses wearing full protective body suits and masks who try to boost their immune response. Friends and relatives are quarantined for 21 days. Prevention measures include washing hands at every opportunity and safe burial practices, with no touching or washing of the body, as is traditional in some cultures.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How does this compare with other outbreaks?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The 2013 and 2016 outbreak in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea spread for months through forest regions in west&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa\">Africa</a>&nbsp;where Ebola was unknown before the emergency was recognised. It escalated when it emerged in towns and cities, with 28,600 cases and 11,300 deaths.</p>\n    <p>DRC successfully stamped out nine previous Ebola outbreaks in rural areas within a matter of a few months.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/aid\">Aid</a>&nbsp;agencies, infectious disease experts and the WHO say it will be very hard to bring this outbreak under control, even though they have had vaccines and experimental drugs from the outset.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the contributing factors to this outbreak?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There is almost no functioning state in much of eastern DRC. There is an almost total lack of basic services such as power, education, roads, healthcare, and the authority of the government only extends to the edges of urban areas.</p>\n    <p>Police are corrupt, predatory and violent. In rural zones, militia and armed bands provide security and employment opportunities but also steal, rape and kill at will. It is one of the most hostile environments faced by aid and health workers anywhere in the world.</p>\n    <p>Mistrust of officials and foreigners is harming efforts to tackle the disease and conspiracy theories are rampant. Some believe the outbreak is fake news spread by rapacious NGOs and the UN to justify their presence in the country and allow the extraction of valuable mineral resources.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\"><b>Sarah Boseley</b></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jasonburke\"><b>Jason Burke</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Rwandan government faced intense pressure from international agencies to keep the border open, the Guardian learned.</p> \n<p>In July, the World Health Organization declared the Ebola outbreak in DRC an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/17/drc-ebola-epidemic-is-international-emergency-says-who\">international public health emergency</a>.

      "bodyText": "Ten years ago, when she was being held as a slave in a family house in Bedfordshire, beaten and working without pay, the only thing that kept Nancy Esiovwa from despair was the belief that she would one day be free. Now she is. But her life since gaining freedom has, she says, been as traumatic and desperate as her experience at the hands of her traffickers. Shortly after she was identified by the Home Office as a victim of modern slavery in 2014, Esiovwa was left without any kind of support. She ended up on the streets, homeless and destitute and facing violence and assault. The Home Office has turned down her application for asylum and refused to grant her leave to remain. She now lives in daily fear of facing immigration detention or being sent back to Nigeria \u2013 the same country to which her traffickers, who have threatened to kill her, have returned. Her story is not unique. The Home Office has been under increasing pressure to improve their treatment of slavery victims. Frontline agencies say people are being abandoned and failed in their thousands by a system that is supposed to protect and support them. Esiovwa has decided to fight back. She is taking the Home Office to court over its decision to deny her leave to remain, arguing that it failed in its legal obligation to consider her trafficking status and right to access ongoing counselling and mental health services. The case follows a landmark ruling in 2018 that forced the government to lower the threshold for allowing trafficking victims leave to remain; currently, only 12% of victims who apply get a positive decision. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that my trafficking status, or my very urgent need to get mental health support to recover from what I\u2019ve been through, both at the hands of my traffickers and at the hands of the Home Office, have been considered,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone thinks that when you escape from slavery it is a happy ending, but that\u2019s not true. Even though the government has accepted I\u2019ve been a victim of slavery, they have just seen me as an immigration problem that they want to get rid of.\u201d If successful, her judicial review could pave the way for others to force the Home Office to reconsider their cases. The isolation that Esiovwa has experienced has also led her to launch a network of modern slavery survivors in West Yorkshire, where she is now based. \u201cFor years I could find nobody to help me,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I thought that we survivors need to start helping each other.\u201d Hers is the first local chapter of a groundbreaking national Survivor Alliance programme, funded and supported by the Rights Lab, a department researching modern slavery at the University of Nottingham.

The parliament is officially on winter break and won\u2019t return until 9 September. That is not to say that there won\u2019t be news. <strong>Mike Pompeo</strong> is coming to town, ahead of <strong>Scott Morrison\u2019s </strong>visit to the US next month, where he will be treated to a state dinner. The Liberal executive will be meeting tomorrow, where it will discuss how it has dealt with bullying complaints, and worst, in the past. </p> <p>And there\u2019s also the small matter of building a legislative agenda. </p> <p>Labor\u2019s review into what went wrong with the election is ongoing, with the final report to be handed down in October. But those talks and meetings are happening now, so stay tuned on that.</p> <p>And the court of disputed returns will hear the petitions against the Kooyong and Chisholm elections \u2013 at least directions. The high court will be sitting for three of the next five weeks, which makes it a very strong chance you\u2019ll hear something.</p> <p>So we hope you will keep popping back and checking the site for all your usual political news.</p> <p>A very, very big thank you to <strong>Mike Bowers</strong>, who you\u2019ll find on Talking Pictures each Sunday, and cameo-ing on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/pyjamapolitics/\">Pyjama Politics</a>, <strong>Katharine Murphy</strong>, <strong>Paul Karp </strong>and <strong>Sarah Martin</strong> for all their work this last sitting, as well as the rest of the Guardian\u2019s brains trust, who you don\u2019t hear from, but stop me from setting my desk on fire each and every day. </p> <p>As always, the biggest thank you goes to you all. I\u2019ll miss you over the next month, but I hope you take a bit of time to cocoon yourselves.

We will do that whilst maintaining a strong economy, in contrast to those opposite. <br></p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cWhat a disgraceful smear,\u201d the Coalition side yells.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-01T04:34:55.746Z\">at 5.34am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d4268c78f084f687f34e742\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-01T04:24:17.941Z\">5.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The new member for Mallee inflicts <strong>Michael McCormack </strong>onto the chamber, with the phrase \u201cMorrison-McCormack government\u201d which I am pretty sure was banned last year, for obvious reasons.</p> <p>McCormack attempts to tell you how much the Morrison-McCormack government is on your side, but as the political equivalent of parsnip, it\u2019s all just a bit blah.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-01T04:28:47.066Z\">at 5.28am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d4268668f0896be8f8f11c8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-01T04:21:22.024Z\">5.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> to<strong> Scott Morrison:</strong></p> <p>My question is addressed to the Prime minister and follows my previous question: Is the prime minister comfortable with members of his government sharing a platform at a conference with Mr <strong>Matt Gates, </strong>who invited a Holocaust denier to the 2018 State of the the Union address by the President of the United States? <br></p> <p><strong>Morrison</strong> (after going through his papers for what looks like the letter <strong>Mathias Cormann </strong>tabled in the Senate):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I concur with the statements made by the leader of the government in the Senate, which I\u2019m happy to table.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s side are you on,\u201d yells <strong>Ed Husic.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-01T04:27:26.397Z\">at 5.27am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d4267de8f084f687f34e736\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-01T04:18:46.489Z\">5.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The government is on the side of Australians who back themselves.

The amount charged when a consumer misses the bill due date can result in a high penalty which can significantly hurt the hip pocket.</p> <p>This practice impacts a large number of Australians, with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission finding, on average, one in four customers did not meet the conditions of their discount. This was even higher for customers in financial hardship, with around 60% missing out on these discounts.</p> <p>The rule proposed by this government would limit the conditional discount only to the retailer\u2019s reasonable costs. Retailers would also be prevented from penalising customers twice, with both a late payment fee and withdrawal of a pay-on-time discount.</p> <p>This proposed rule change builds on action already taken to protect customers and reduce power prices for families and small businesses, including:</p> <p>\u00b7 Implementing the Default Market Offer\u2014or price cap\u2014which places a limit on what retailers can charge their electricity standing offer customers;</p> <p>\u00b7 Introducing a reference price mechanism, which ensures consumers are able to compare electricity offers against a standard benchmark price; and</p> <p>\u00b7 Ensuring vulnerable customers who are experiencing financial hardship get the help they need to pay their power bills.</p> <p><strong>The government\u2019s Big Stick legislation</strong> to prohibit energy market misconduct is also an important reform that aims to end customer ripoffs, hold the big energy companies to account, and drive competition in the market and lower prices for consumers.</p> <p>The AEMC is seeking responses to the consultation paper by 19 September 2019, with the view to finalising a rule change determination by the end of February 2020.</p> <p>For further information see: <a href=\"http://www.aemc.gov.au/\">aemc.gov.au</a>. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-01T02:36:44.106Z\">at 3.36am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d424d668f08c7e177d4267f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-01T02:24:48.142Z\">3.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The motion requires the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee to inquire into:</p> <p><em>(a) the privatisation of Australia\u2019s visa and citizenship program, including:</em></p> <p><em> (i) the integrity of Australia\u2019s visa and citizenship system,</em></p> <p><em> (ii) the commercial implications and increased costs to industry, with particular regard for the tourism and higher education sectors,</em></p> <p><em> (iii) the implications to national security, data security and privacy, and</em></p> <p><em> (iv) the risk to public sector employment \u2013 especially rural and regional employment \u2013 through service delivery model changes;

On one view parliament has decided to confer jurisdiction on the court, and limited its own jurisdiction. But on the other hand, Twomey points to some observations by three justices in <em>Sue v Hill </em>which suggest it could be possible that the court and parliament could come into conflict, offering contradictory views on the eligibility of a member or senator.</p> <p>Twomey: \u201c<em>Even if the House did retain jurisdiction to decide the issue, there is also the convention of \u2018sub judice\u2019 in parliament. That is that the Houses should not debate things that are currently before the courts. It would hence be most inappropriate for a House to decide on a Member\u2019s qualification or disqualification once proceedings have been initiated in the court of disputed returns. It would also show a lack of respect for the judicial process.

Keneally told the Senate on Wednesday night:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is a $5m piece of paper.

The community has the right to know how one of our largest government departments \u2013 and one that is so fundamental to our national security \u2013 is being administered.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, the government is pushing new legislation to keep \u201chigh-risk terrorist offenders\u201d in prison, beyond any sentence they may be handed \u201cif they pose an ongoing threat to public safety\u201d.</p> <p>There\u2019s no information yet on who judges who is an ongoing threat, or what constitutes that ongoing threat. From <strong>Christian Porter\u2019s</strong> office: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> The changes were recommended by the Council of Australian Governments following a deadly 2017 terror attack in Victoria, which involved an offender who was on bail and had previously been charged with a terrorism offence.</p> <p>The community was rightly outraged by <strong>Yacqub Khayre\u2019s</strong> case and I believe the changes we are introducing today strike the right balance between protecting individual rights and freedoms, and protecting the community.</p> </blockquote> <p>Plus, there is the ensuring integrity bill heading to the Senate. But that doesn\u2019t have the numbers with the crossbench as yet, so it is doubtful it will go anywhere before the break.</p> <p>You have <strong>Mike Bowers</strong>, <strong>Katharine Murphy</strong>, <strong>Paul Karp</strong> and me, who is at least at 15% capacity, so huzzah for that. </p> <p>Also \u2013 happy horse birthday.</p> <p>Ready?</p> <p>Let\u2019s get into it.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-31T22:04:20.190Z\">at 11.04pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

That\u2019s it for the next five weeks. The parliament is officially on winter break and won\u2019t return until 9 September. That is not to say that there won\u2019t be news. Mike Pompeo is coming to town, ahead of Scott Morrison\u2019s visit to the US next month, where he will be treated to a state dinner. The Liberal executive will be meeting tomorrow, where it will discuss how it has dealt with bullying complaints, and worst, in the past. And there\u2019s also the small matter of building a legislative agenda. Labor\u2019s review into what went wrong with the election is ongoing, with the final report to be handed down in October. But those talks and meetings are happening now, so stay tuned on that. And the court of disputed returns will hear the petitions against the Kooyong and Chisholm elections \u2013 at least directions. The high court will be sitting for three of the next five weeks, which makes it a very strong chance you\u2019ll hear something. So we hope you will keep popping back and checking the site for all your usual political news. A very, very big thank you to Mike Bowers, who you\u2019ll find on Talking Pictures each Sunday, and cameo-ing on Pyjama Politics, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Sarah Martin for all their work this last sitting, as well as the rest of the Guardian\u2019s brains trust, who you don\u2019t hear from, but stop me from setting my desk on fire each and every day. As always, the biggest thank you goes to you all. I\u2019ll miss you over the next month, but I hope you take a bit of time to cocoon yourselves. The new normal seems to be settling in and soon we are going to be at the end of the year, wondering how we got to 2020 quite so quickly. Stay warm, even those of you in the greatest nation of earth, Queensland, where I know the Ekka Westerlies are about to start blowing. See you soon. In the mean time \u2013 take care of you. From Mike Bowers\u2019s eyeball to your eyeball. The House has just adjourned and the Senate looks close. The rush to the airport has begun. After question time, Mathias Cormann gave a brief and un-illuminating statement about the Crown casino matter. He said the government takes \u201callegations of illegal activity very seriously\u201d which is why the attorney general has referred \u201callegations of corruption involving the Home Affairs Department and Crown casino to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity\u201d. \u201cI can also advise \u2013 the prime minister is not aware of any of his ministers breaching ministerial standards in relation to this matter.\u201d Greens senator Nick McKim said that Cormann had failed to answer the question of whether the prime minister has investigated the claims that two ministers lobbied Home Affairs to \u201cgrease the wheels\u201d for Crown casino high-rollers. \u201cAll we got was the insulting platitude that the PM is \u2018not aware\u2019,\u201d he said. Greens senator Larissa Waters also had a swing, but no Labor senators did the same. Christian Porter has also responded to Labor\u2019s calls to bring forward the federal integrity commission. His statement: Hypocrisy and double standards are what we have come to expect from the Labor party. But Mark Dreyfus sunk to new lows even for himself today when he accused the government of dragging its heels on the delivery of a Commonwealth Integrity Commission (CIC). To set the record straight, the Coalition \u2013 unlike Labor \u2013 has actually been doing the hard work necessary to deliver a carefully considered and properly funded watchdog since we first committed to establishing a CIC in December last year. Attorney general Christian Porter said a draft bill was already being finalised, which would form the basis of public consultation and the final Bill would be completed by the end of the year. \u2018Our CIC will be properly designed and subject to a robust consultation phase,\u201d Mr Porter said. \u2018It has $106.7m of new money allocated to it in the current budget over the forward estimates, plus: $40.7m in existing funding for the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, which will work alongside the CIC. \u2018In contrast, Labor has released what amounts to little more than a press release containing a vague set of design principles and a suggestion that $58.7 million would be enough to cover the costs. That is $89 million less than we have committed. \u2018But what is most hypocritical is that Labor was willing to allow itself a full year to draft their CIC legislation, had they won the election. \u2018Now all of a sudden they are attacking in the parliament their own reasonable time frame for properly developing and consulting on complex legislation in this important area of law. \u2018The reason why this legislation cannot be rushed should be obvious to Mr Dreyfus given the many examples of injustices and damage done to personal and professional reputations when the necessary time and care was not taken to properly design state-based integrity commissions. \u2018Labor might not care about hurting innocent people but the Morrison government does and we will not be lectured by hypocrites seeking to waste the parliament\u2019s time to score cheap political points. The Law Council is not overly impressed with the passage of the latest national security bill, given the concerns that have been raised over it. From its statement: The Law Council has grave concerns Asio\u2019s Questioning and Detention Warrant (QDW) powers have been extended for a further 12 months without clear justification. These are some of the most far-reaching and extraordinary powers granted to any intelligence organisation in a western democracy and should be repealed. They give Asio the power to secretly and immediately detain persons whether or not they are suspected of terrorism-related activities. While the Law Council understands and supports our national security agencies possessing the necessary powers required to prevent threats and keep the community safe, these must always be reasonable and proportionate in order to safeguard the rights of innocent Australians if such powers are mistakenly used or abused. The QDW powers have never been exercised. It is not clear to the Law Council why these laws remain [afoot] when there are other wide-ranging powers that Asio and other agencies possess. The Law Council is concerned these provisions may be unconstitutional and a breach of Australia\u2019s international human rights obligations. Anthony Albanese concludes his speech with: We on this side of the House are united. We know exactly what the values of the Labor party are, we know what they stand for: a strong economy and jobs. We know we stand for social justice. We know we stand for lifting people up, not leaving people behind. We know we stand for engagement on the environment. Australians don\u2019t want that much and they don\u2019t ask that much from the government, but they expect a bit of respect. They expect that the government will actually have a plan. And a third-term government should have developed that plan into a coherent narrative. Yet what we see is more and more scare campaigns. The fact is that Labor\u2019s values are shared not just by people who have a common interest, who are united not just because we happen to be in parliament, and not just because we happen to be in the Labor party, but because it is our shared values that [brought us to the] Labor party, a party that has been in existence since 1891, a party that has proud origins and a proud history, a party that will continue to contribute to this nation\u2019s history into the future. So I say to the prime minister: you ask the question, consider it answered. We on this side of the House know exactly who side we are on. On that side of the House, they are so divided that they can\u2019t even get an answer from a prime minister about senior members of the Liberal party and the National party appearing on the same platform with extreme rightwing ideologues in order to promote division in this country, allowing the sort of talk that will just divide us. I will conclude with the prime minister\u2019s question. We know exactly who we are and we know whose side we are on. We are the Australian Labor party, and we are on the side of Australia\u2019s national interests. It\u2019s a pity that there is a government that isn\u2019t, that is just on the side of its own selfish political interests, and [which] seeks to divide people, promote fear and engage in negative politics because they don\u2019t have a positive agenda for the third term. Albanese: We on this side of the House to support a voice for First Nations people in our Constitution. Those opposite have roadblocks in their cabinet like the Minister for Home Affairs, who walked out on the apology. We on this side of the House understand that you can protect your borders without losing your humanity; those opposite have engaged in dehumanising people in our care for political gain. We on the side of the House appeal to hope; those on that side of the House rely upon fear. We want to shape the future in the interests of all Australians; those opposite are frightened of the present and terrified of the future. Nowhere is that better characterised than in the NBN: we understand that fibre is the technology of the 21st century; those opposite rely on copper to go forward. We on this side one genuine support for our farmers who are struggling in the drought, who need action on climate change, who need real funding; those opposite want legislation that gives them some money in the following financial year\u2014$100 million rather than the $5 billion that they talk about. We on this side of House are absolutely determined to bring the nation together. We reject those who seek to divide us. And the fact that in their No. 1 talking point, from the Prime Minister, to the Treasurer and to the Minister opposite, they talk about \u2018Whose side are you on?\u2019 Shows exactly what they are about. They don\u2019t have a positive agenda, they rely upon negative politics and they seek to divide at every single opportunity. Albanese continued: We support those who are struggling and who need a helping hand. Those opposite say that people have never been better off, in spite of the reports just this week. We understand that free markets left alone, because they have no conscience, entrench existing relationships of power, both economic and social. Those opposite still support trickle-down economics. They say it will all be okay if government just gets out of the way. We understand that unions have a critical role in a democratic society. Those opposite just want to attack them. We understand the importance of holding business to account, which is why we supported the banking royal commission at the same time as they voted against it 26 times. We support building infrastructure; they support talking about building infrastructure. We respect public servants; they cut public servants. We respect the science of climate change; those opposite want equal time for climate sceptics to teach in the classroom. We regard education as being about creating opportunity; those opposite see it as just entrenching privilege. We support Medicare being at the heart of the health system. Those opposite undermine it at every opportunity. We support increasing Newstart. Those opposite regard that as just \u2018unfunded empathy\u2019. We support addressing homelessness. They want more positive spin about homelessness, to talk about the 99 per cent who are in homes rather than the one per cent who are homeless. We support pensioners. Those opposite say that the pension is too generous. We support aged care that looks after our vulnerable older Australians. Those opposite want to get rid of regulation and just let the market rip. We support superannuation as being critical for our nation. Those opposite undermine it. We support a free media. Those opposite have engaged in cynical, politically motivated raids and intimidation against journalists. Anthony Albanese: Just a few weeks ago we all stood in this House and debated the passing of Bob Hawke, a great Australian who stood for all Australians. Bob Hawke\u2019s prime ministership was characterised by an understanding that together we are stronger. He looked for common ground. Nothing could stand in more contrast with that than what we\u2019ve seen from this government in its three-week self-indulgent vanity project, this victory lap where it has brought parliament back in July. The fact is that the prime minister is in search of an agenda. In place of that, he\u2019s chosen division. He characterises that himself when he stands in parliament and has the talking points for all the ministers about, \u2018Whose side are you on?\u2019 Billy Bragg, at the beginning of the year, said about international democratic politics at the moment, that: This is a time of dismissive demagogues promoting a know-nothing politics of swaggering arrogance driven by scorn and spite. I\u2019m reminded of that comment every time I see this prime minister \u2014 the hubris of a government overcome with arrogance, where no one is too right-wing or extreme to share a platform with. This is the first time I\u2019ve seen a prime minister stand in this parliament and refer to the statement of a senator, as this one did when asked his view about some of those opposite sharing a platform with Raheem Kassam and Matt Gaetz. The fact is that those opposite have a hide to ask, \u2018Whose side are you on?\u2019 But, in response, let me give them exactly which side Labor is on. We\u2019re on the side of unity, not division. We\u2019re on the side of equality, not inequality. We\u2019re on the side of political conviction, not political expediency. We understand that we need to promote what we are for, not just what we are against, unlike those opposite. We understand that we want an economy that works for people, not people who work for the economy. We understand aspiration, but we understand that that\u2019s not just about individuals. That is about the better life that working Australians want for their family, neighbours, community and country. I\u2019ll bring you parts of Anthony Albanese\u2019s speech when I get a chance to transcribe it. It is mostly off the cuff \u2013 the only piece of paper he has is a small piece of note paper with a few notes handwritten on it. \u201cWe know exactly who we are, and we know exactly whose side we\u2019re on. We are the Australian Labor party and we are on the side of the Australian national interest\u201d. The matter of public interest is now on, with Anthony Albanese leading. The official topic is: \u201cThe failure of the government to represent the interests of all Australians.\u201d Most of the government, including Barnaby Joyce and his sacred sperm, have left the chamber. The MPs give David Elder a standing ovation. \u201cSee you in Queenstown, David,\u201d someone from Labor says. Tony Smith, in delivering a heartfelt thank you to David Elder, points out that he is only the 16th clerk since federation. In that same time, we\u2019ve had 36 prime ministers. Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese are delivering their own statements of thanks. Elder became the deputy clerk in 2010, and was elevated to the clerk position in 2014. (He\u2019s been in parliament for 36 years, which Christian Porter says is about one-third of his life listening to Philip Ruddock\u2019s valedictory speech). Claressa Surtees, the current deputy clerk, will become the first female clerk, when parliament resumes. The Morrison government is on the side of Australians. It is so on the side of Australians, Scott Morrison will yell at Labor for voting for one of its bills (that actually just happened), it is so on the side of Australians, it will give every Australian a pet kangaroo to ride to school in, and set up a World Series of Cricket that only involves Australian teams. It is so on the side of Australians, it will send a quokka out with every single birth certificate and force any country that wants us to go to war with them to accept Vegemite as its national food. It is so on the side of Australians, it is working on cloning Steve Irwin and keeping Hugh Jackman alive forever. Meanwhile, here is Barnaby Joyce, being Barnaby Joyce The dixers have managed to piss off Michelle Grattan. That\u2019s how far they have fallen. Grattan is one of the most level headed and experienced among us. It\u2019s like Beyonc\u00e9 telling you to go get changed because you\u2019re embarrassing her. Mark Butler to Angus Taylor: I refer to the minister\u2019s statement that all disclosures have been made in accordance with the rules. I also refer to the minister\u2019s obligation under ministerial standards to disclose private interests to the parliament and not to mislead this House. Why in this latest statement of member\u2019s interests did the minister disclose Gufee\u2019s interest in McLachlan pastoral company but not Jam Land? Christian Porter tries to stop this one as well, with the help of his phone, so shout out to whoever sent him that message. But Tony Smith allows it. \u201cGive him the answer, Scotty,\u201d Anthony Albanese says, as Taylor approaches the dispatch box. Taylor: The answer is because I have declared my interests in accordance with the rules. Now, if Labor is proposing to change the rules, it would require many changes in disclosures, including on \u2013 from those opposite. The Morrison government is on the side of Australians who want to keep the lights on. It is so on the side of Australians who want to keep the lights on, it will follow you around with its phone torch on the moment the sun sets, even when it\u2019s on 5%. It is so on the side of Australians who like light, it will fly around the world so fast, it will reverse the earth\u2019s rotation and never allow the sun to set. Mark Butler to Angus Taylor: I refer to the minister\u2019s previous answer in relation to his disclosure. Why in his latest statement of members\u2019 interests did the minister disclose Gufee\u2019s interest in McLachlan pastoral company but not Jam Land? Christian Porter: The second part is with respect to matters outside the portfolio responsibilities. It is an effort to link back a very, very straight answer, which is that the minister has disclosed interests in accordance with the rules, to try and create a linkage to matters not inside his responsibility. The minister\u2019s answers he\u2019s disclosed in accordance with the rules is to state that he discloses trusts and nominee companies in exactly the same way that all the members opposite do, that everyone else over here does, even the one I\u2019m looking at right now, which is not the minister\u2019s. Tony Burke: Mr Speaker, on your previous ruling, where you have said that we are allowed to refer and question a statement that has been made in the House, what we\u2019ve done here is this question refers very specifically to a statement that the minister has made repeatedly in the House, concerning his disclosures. And then challenges it very specifically by referring to the exact disclosure he is referring to. Yes. Where one company has been included, and another company that the same Gufee invested in is not mentioned. There is no other way for us to test a statement made in the House other than to put forward evidence that we don\u2019t believe it is true. Tony Smith: I will come there. Whilst you\u2019re referring to the previous answer, the second part of the question is referring to his responsibilities as a member of the House of Representatives. Not as a minister. Burke tries again, but Smith rules it out of order. The Morrison government is on the side of women. It is so on your side it always has a tampon in its bag, just in case you need one. It is so on your side, it will hand you its last hairband, even the one on its wrist. It is so on your side, it will listen to your rant about Karen at work, without telling you how to solve problems you are perfectly capable of solving yourself. It is so on the side of women, it will never question the trashy reality TV you watch, and ask you to explain how you can still call yourself a feminist. The Morrison government is so on the side of women, it will legislate to ban the phrase \u2018well, actually...\u2019. Mark Butler to Angus Taylor: \u201cI refer to the previous answer and a report dated May 11, which says, \u2018He, Mr Taylor, acknowledged JRAT was not among the companies listed on his register of parliamentary interests, and goes on to say, and I quote, \u201cIt should have been.\u201d Does the minister stand by his previous answer? Taylor: \u201cI do. All my interests are declared in accordance with the rules.\u201d The government is on the side of Australians who made the quiet choice to support national security. It is so on your side it will come and slowly rub your back until you fall asleep. It is so on the side of quiet Australians, it will record all of your favourite shows in Amsr. It is so on the side of quiet Australians, it will not only keep a light on, it will sleep outside your door to make sure the monsters can\u2019t get in. Mark Butler to Angus Taylor: I refer to the previous answers and his statement that he has disclosed interests in accordance with the rules. [ the minister confirm that he has never disclosed his interest in an entity called [I missed the name but it sounds like JRAT] to the parliament? Taylor (after looking to see if the question is out of order) All my interests are declared in accordance with the rules\u201d Butler tries to table a media report which says he didn\u2019t declare this interest, but Smith says he\u2019s not allowing things which are widely available. \u201cWell, he hasn\u2019t seen it,\u201d says Anthony Albanese I can\u2019t even come up with a joke for this one. The government is on the side of workers who want their workers\u2019 entitlements and not militant unions. This. Is. Terminal. Every single person involved in drafting these questions should seriously question how they got to this point in life. Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: I refer to the previous answers and his statement in this House that he has disclosed interests in accordance with the rules. Does he stand by that statement and has he disclosed any income or other benefit derived from consultancy fees to Eastern Australian Agriculture or Eastern Australia Irrigation or any of their associated entities? Christian Porter says the second part of the question is too similar to the previous ruling Tony Smith made, in that it is not relevant to his responsibilities. Tony Burke says that the question goes to actual answers Taylor has delivered. Tony Smith says he thinks the second part is out of order, but the first part may be answered. Taylor: \u201cAll my interests are declared, in accordance to the rules.\u201d Labor is also asking about the CPAC speakers in Senate question time, this time targeting the minister representing the minister for women Anne Ruston. Ruston tells the Senate she agrees with Mathias Cormann\u2019s on Raheem Kussam\u2019s comments about Nicola Sturgeon that they are \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and \u201cobjectionable\u201d. Ruston then starts quoting Cormann\u2019s letter claiming \u201cthe best way to defeat bad ideas, bad arguments and unacceptable views is through debate\u201d. That letter is the same one Scott Morrison tabled in the lower house: Penny Wong interjects, arguing that Cormann knows \u201cthere is a difference between bad ideas and hate speech, this is about vilification\u201d. The government is on the side of Australians who choose to buy their own home. It is so on the side of Australians who choose to buy their own home, it will not only help you move, it will pack up your previous one as well. It is so on the side of Australians who choose their own home, it will do your bond clean for you, while you sip rose on your new deck. It is so on the side of Australians who choose to buy their own home, it will not only show up for your painting party, it will spend it\u2019s nights setting up every piece of Ikea furniture you\u2019ve just bought, and even bring their own allen key. Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: I refer to his previous answers. Did the minister or any of this associated entities or indirect interests receive any payments, income or benefit from the 18 immigration department water buybacks from eastern Australian agricultural? Christian Porter says it is not in his portfolio, or matters he is responsible for. Tony Burke says Labor is relying on previous answers Taylor has given. \u201cToo long that bow,\u201d someone in the government benches yells. Tony Smith now goes to precedent and rules it out of order. The government is still on the side of Australians who voted for it. (That is the actual breakdown of this new question template, which starts off \u2018can the minister tell us how the government is on the side of Australians who chose [insert Coalition policy here]) The government is so on the side of Australians who voted for it, it will eat the meal you prepared for it, even though you can\u2019t cook and it\u2019s burnt and full of onion. It\u2019s so on the side of Australians who voted for it, it will carry your child just to save you from the stretch marks. It is so on the side of people who voted for it, it will wait until you are all caught up with Game of Thrones before watching the finale. Stephen Jones to Angus Taylor: Why did he register \u2013 why did he register Eastern Australia Irrigation in the Cayman Islands? Tony Smith rules it out of order, but Labor got its point across. Tony Smith puts a stop to \u201cSir Tax-A-Lot\u201d, after Josh Frydenberg once again tries to make fetch happen. It is probably not helped by the fact that, once again, the treasurer has forgotten how microphones work. The government is on the side of people who voted for them. It is so on the side of people who voted for them, it will pick up their kids from school, even though it\u2019s not their carpool day. They are so on the side of people who voted for them, they will mow their lawn for them, pick up the dog poo without complaining, and stop all parties at 10pm. I hope every single MP who has asked a question about how the government is on the side of ... is embarrassed. You\u2019re the government. You are actually meant to be on the side of Australia. THAT\u2019S YOUR JOB. Helen Haines gets her first question, after delivering her first speech earlier today. It\u2019s to Paul Fletcher: My question is to the minister representing the minister for families and social services: The Newstart allowance paid to more than 4,400 people in Indi is indexed to the CPI with inflation now 1.6%. Since 2000, the cost of essential goods and services has increased far greater than CPI. I, like many in this place, including a growing number from those on the government side, support an increase to the Newstart allowance. When will the government increase the Newstart allowance and will the government consider using a fairer index for future payments that better reflects the cost of essential goods and services? Fletcher talks about the government\u2019s job record. Haines tries to interrupt to say she asked about the CPI, but Tony Smith points out that was just one part of the question and the minister can answer how he likes. Mark Butler to Angus Taylor: Does the minister agree with the member for Longman that children should taught that climate change is not real? That is related to these comments, as reported by AAP: Terry Young won the Brisbane-based seat of Longman from Labor at the recent election. The small business owner says the greatest gift of being human is free choice, arguing \u2018indoctrination of any type robs our children of this gift\u2019. \u2018We want our children and grandchildren to hear the theories of evolution and creation, different religions, climate change advocates and climate change sceptics,\u2019 he told parliament in his first speech. \u2018What we don\u2019t want for our kids is to be brainwashed with extreme left or right ideologies. \u2018When I hear a school principal stand up at school in assembly and say: \u201cIf this government doesn\u2019t do anything about climate change the world will end in 2030\u201d, I get angry.\u2019 Mr Young says children should not be indoctrinated by \u2018fear-mongering\u2019 over the climate. \u2018We (conservatives) simply believe that we need to look after this magnificent planet because it\u2019s the right thing to do, not because a scientist or extremist scared us into it,\u2019 he said on Wednesday. He claims conservatives simply \u2018get on\u2019 with protecting the planet while others just talk about it. \u2018Actions speak louder than words,\u2019 he said. \u2018There are greater two-word phases than global warming, climate change or climate emergency \u2013 and those two-word phrases are environmental stewardship, personal responsibility and common sense.\u2019 Taylor: We heard from the member for Longman \u2013 a fabulous, fabulous first speech... ! First speech, this week. Now, climate change is real. And we are taking practical action to deliver emissions reduction, to deliver emissions reduction. We know we are on track to meet our 2030 targets. The Climate Solutions Package is doing exactly that for us. $3.5 billion committed to ensure we will meet our targets. We will do that whilst maintaining a strong economy, in contrast to those opposite. \u201cWhat a disgraceful smear,\u201d the Coalition side yells. The new member for Mallee inflicts Michael McCormack onto the chamber, with the phrase \u201cMorrison-McCormack government\u201d which I am pretty sure was banned last year, for obvious reasons. McCormack attempts to tell you how much the Morrison-McCormack government is on your side, but as the political equivalent of parsnip, it\u2019s all just a bit blah. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is addressed to the Prime minister and follows my previous question: Is the prime minister comfortable with members of his government sharing a platform at a conference with Mr Matt Gates, who invited a Holocaust denier to the 2018 State of the the Union address by the President of the United States? Morrison (after going through his papers for what looks like the letter Mathias Cormann tabled in the Senate): I concur with the statements made by the leader of the government in the Senate, which I\u2019m happy to table.\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s side are you on,\u201d yells Ed Husic. The government is on the side of Australians who back themselves. It is so on your side, it will buy you another round of drinks, even though it\u2019s the day before pay day. It\u2019s so on your side, it will get up off the couch to find the remote. It\u2019s so on your side, it will stand in your bathroom and tell you you\u2019re strong and beautiful as you get ready in the morning. After a to and fro over who has to move the motion to have any other speeches on the Cowra breakout anniversary to the Federation Chamber (it\u2019s the job of Christian Porter, but he\u2019s still learning), we get to the questions. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: \u201cIs the prime minister comfortable with the government\u2019s decision to both permit Mr Raheem Kassam to enter Australia and allow government members to share a public platform with him, when Mr Kassam has made many extreme comments, including remarks about the Scottish first minister that I\u2019m certain he would agree are both misogynistic and completely unacceptable?\u201d David Coleman gets the nod. Coleman: In relation to the question, of course, all the applications to enter Australia are dealt with under the provisions of the Migration Act. And all non-citizens must meet the character test. Of course, for people who may hold controversial views, any impact of those views must always be balanced against Australia\u2019s well-established principles of freedom of speech, but I won\u2019t be making any comments about specific applications or cases. Albanese calls for a point of order, given the question was on whether or not Morrison was comfortable with the decision. Morrison says nothing. \u201cSo that\u2019s a yes,\u201d Albanese says across the table. \u201c... It doesn\u2019t matter, we got our answer.\u201d Morrison checks his phone. Linda Burney and Pat Dodson are leading Labor\u2019s call for an inquiry into the abuse survivors\u2019 redress scheme: Labor is calling on the government to support a proposed joint select committee on the implementation of the national redress scheme. The committee will examine, among other things, the government\u2019s excruciatingly slow rollout of redress for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. Labor senator Patrick Dodson has tabled the notice of motion to establish the inquiry in the Senate today. The scheme is projected to provide redress to 60,000 survivors. And yet, the latest data shows that only 4,100 applications have been made and only 229 redress payments have been made. This is not acceptable. Survivors have already waited too long. One minute before question time, MP Barnaby Joyce has made an explosive contribution to the debate in the NSW parliament about decriminalising abortion. Joyce: On the first of June, Vicky\u2019s and my son Tom took his first breath. This was not the start of his life, the reality was he was part of this world for some time and was merely passing from one room to another. Joyce said that Tom \u201cwas a person \u2013 long before he was born\u201d and \u201chad rights even though he was not conscious of them\u201d which \u201cno parliament can take away\u201d. The hour of birth is an arbitrary point in modern medicine ... it didn\u2019t endow him with greater rights as a person ... To say he didn\u2019t have the rights of other human life is to say he is sub-human. Historically that concept is not unusual. Joyce appears to be using the rhetoric of anti-abortion philosophers who make an analogy between abortion and slavery, by arguing that he and Vicky have obligations to Tom as a person, not \u201cmerely a property right\u201d. Joyce then accuses the NSW parliament of seeking to declassify foetuses in the womb as humans, at which point he is shouted down by Labor and his time expires. Ahead of question time, both Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese are acknowledging the 75th anniversary of the Cowra breakout. Barnaby Joyce was making an anti decrimalise abortion statement in the House ahead of question time, during the 90 second members\u2019 statements. As the time clicked over to 2pm, Labor began to yell at him to \u201csit down\u201d. The NSW Greens want the state\u2019s Liberal government, led by premier Gladys Berejiklian, to review Crown Resorts\u2019 licence to run a gargantuan gambling pit at Barangaroo in light of the rolling storm of allegations against the casino operator aired in the past few days. Jamie Parker, the Greens spokesman on anti-corruption, said that \u201callegations of money laundering, links to organised crime and their handling of foreign visitors should raise issues with their licence here in NSW\u201d. \u201cThe government must show that they are willing and able to hold this corporation to account. \u201cIt\u2019s alarming that the NSW government was fast-tracking Crown\u2019s Barangaroo casino licence at the same time as the AFP was investigating links between Crown tour operators and international organised crime.\u201d The party\u2019s spokeswoman on liquor and gambling, Cate Faehrmann, said the $100m licensing fee Crown agreed to pay for the Barangaroo casino, together with a pledge to pay at least $1bn in gaming taxes over 15 years, \u201ccreates a fundamental conflict of interest and given the government\u2019s track record of giving special treatment to gambling interests in NSW, it\u2019s a cause for serious concern\u201d. Crown is also under pressure in Victoria, the home of its most important casino. As the Guardian reported this morning, Crown has yet to satisfy the Victorian regulator it has met recommendations imposed on the Melbourne casino last year that were supposed to be in place a month ago. In other Crown-related doings, lawyers for one of its directors, the former media buyer Harold Mitchell, were in court today for a brief hearing in a case where the corporate regulator is attempting to have him disqualified from the boardroom over his behaviour while a director of Tennis Australia. We are on the downhill slide towards question time. Who has Labor deemed (extreme Cornelia Frances voice) the Weakest Link today? Mike Bowers then caught this lovely moment: The first speeches are still rolling out: The bill aimed at animal activists who have promoted or encouraged trespassing on farms is being debated in the House. It\u2019s being called the vegan activist bill for short. Labor wants to send it for review. We\u2019ll see \u2026 Just a reminder that everything passes the House these days, because the government has the majority. The parliament has been officially advised of the petitions lodged against Kooyong and Chisholm: Labor is still pushing on Raheem Kassam. After Mathias Cormann\u2019s letter was tabled in the Senate (you\u2019ll find it a few posts below) Labor is saying he is going back on the comments he made yesterday: The comments that Senator Keneally just quoted are disgraceful and highly objectionable and completely outrageous that, of course, I entirely abhor, and I\u2019m sure anyone in this Senate chamber abhors. I don\u2019t think that that is a partisan position. Those are disgusting comments and I reject them. I reject them entirely and utterly. Now, having said that, I am not aware of this conference. I don\u2019t have the information in relation to this conference. I have already taken these matters on notice. I will just make a general point that, just because you are at an event somewhere, you\u2019re not expected to agree with everything that everybody says that is at the same event. Let me tell you, all of us have been at events in our electorates where we\u2019ve come across people who have made highly objectionable comments. Andrew Giles: These are not just \u2018bad ideas\u2019; these are detestable ideas which vilify members of the Australian community. The third term Morrison government is willing to roll out the welcome mat for people who want to come to Australia to spread hatred, fear, division and discrimination. It is clear Prime Minister Scott Morrison is comfortable with having his members of parliament take the stage with people who vilify other on the basis of their race, religion and sexuality. As predicted, Labor voted with the government on the extension bill for Asio\u2019s detention powers. Labor had wanted to amend it to three months. The government wanted 12. Without the numbers, Labor voted for the government\u2019s bill. Again. Julie Bishop has recorded a video message about her new appointment. You\u2019ll find that, here. Consultation has opened on the ACCC digital platform report. Written submissions can be lodged on the Treasury website, and close on 24 October 2019. Julie Bishop has found her post-political career. Mathias Cormann has to deliver a statement to the Senate on Crown, after the Greens were successful in this motion: For what it is worth, this is what Home Affairs told me about the visa processing when I asked in early July: The government is not privatising the visa system or outsourcing responsibility for visa decision making. As set out in the tender documentation on the department\u2019s website, the government will always retain responsibility and accountability for sovereign functions including immigration policy, visa decision making and security checks. The procurement process remains under way, it would be inappropriate to comment further. Big Stick is back, back, and is now being clumsily included in press releases. From Angus Taylor: In February this year the Australian government asked the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) to crack down on sneaky late payment fees charged by energy retailers to both electricity and gas customers who have failed to meet discount conditions. Today, the AEMC is acting on our commitment to deliver better protections for vulnerable consumers through the release of a consultation paper on the government\u2019s proposed rule to tackle these excessive penalties. Retailers can offer large discounts off a customer\u2019s bill, but these discounts are often only provided if the customer meets certain conditions, such as paying their bill on time or by direct debit. The amount charged when a consumer misses the bill due date can result in a high penalty which can significantly hurt the hip pocket. This practice impacts a large number of Australians, with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission finding, on average, one in four customers did not meet the conditions of their discount. This was even higher for customers in financial hardship, with around 60% missing out on these discounts. The rule proposed by this government would limit the conditional discount only to the retailer\u2019s reasonable costs. Retailers would also be prevented from penalising customers twice, with both a late payment fee and withdrawal of a pay-on-time discount. This proposed rule change builds on action already taken to protect customers and reduce power prices for families and small businesses, including: \u00b7 Implementing the Default Market Offer\u2014or price cap\u2014which places a limit on what retailers can charge their electricity standing offer customers; \u00b7 Introducing a reference price mechanism, which ensures consumers are able to compare electricity offers against a standard benchmark price; and \u00b7 Ensuring vulnerable customers who are experiencing financial hardship get the help they need to pay their power bills. The government\u2019s Big Stick legislation to prohibit energy market misconduct is also an important reform that aims to end customer ripoffs, hold the big energy companies to account, and drive competition in the market and lower prices for consumers. The AEMC is seeking responses to the consultation paper by 19 September 2019, with the view to finalising a rule change determination by the end of February 2020. For further information see: aemc.gov.au. The motion requires the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee to inquire into: (a) the privatisation of Australia\u2019s visa and citizenship program, including: (i) the integrity of Australia\u2019s visa and citizenship system, (ii) the commercial implications and increased costs to industry, with particular regard for the tourism and higher education sectors, (iii) the implications to national security, data security and privacy, and (iv) the risk to public sector employment \u2013 especially rural and regional employment \u2013 through service delivery model changes; and (b) Centrelink\u2019s Robodebt compliance and outsourced debt collection program, including: (i) the integrity and impact of the automated debt collection processes, (ii) the limitations and impact of Robodebt collection methods, (iii) the identification of inaccurate debts \u2013 made without human oversight, (iv) the impact to public sector employment \u2013 especially on the capacity and adequacy of staffing level, and (v) the review and appeals process for debt notices; and (c) the broader outsourcing of functions in the Human Services portfolio and at the National Disability Insurance Agency, including (i) the processes for contracting and tendering under the outsourcing of services; (ii) the impact of capped staffing numbers and the efficiency dividend at government departments/agencies. (iii) the future planning and preparation for the outsourcing of departmental functions; (iv) the impact outsourcing has on service provision; and (v) the impact on current public sector employment and the risks to future public sector employment; and (d) the outsourcing of security vetting services in the Australian Government Security Vetting Agency, including: (i) the processes for contracting and tendering under the outsourcing of services; (ii) the impact of capped staffing numbers and the efficiency dividend at government departments/agencies. (iii) the future planning and preparation for the outsourcing of departmental functions; (iv) the impact outsourcing has on service provision; and (v) the impact on current public sector employment and the risks to future public sector employment; (e) and related matters. The Senate has voted 33 to 29 in favour of Kristina Keneally\u2019s motion to establish an inquiry into the privatisation of the visa system, robodebt and other outsourcing of government services. The Home Affairs Department put the visa privatisation process on ice before the election in case Labor came into government and killed it, as it threatened. But given the Coalition\u2019s upset victory, the privatisation is going ahead. Earlier on Thursday, the shadow minister for multicultural affairs, Andrew Giles, said: \u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned by reports in today\u2019s the Australian which confirms something that Labor has been very worried about for some time, and that is that the government will proceed with privatising Australia\u2019s important visa services. Even more concerning is the fact that one of the tenderers for this process, which is due to be determined in a couple of months, is Scott Briggs. Mr Briggs is a prominent activist in the Liberal party and someone whose business has been a significant Liberal party donor. This process will result in the loss of some 2,000 jobs and will compound real issues in our visa system including visa fraud and issues of data security.\u201d The government services minister, Stuart Robert, has admitted Centrelink resumed welfare debt compliance in Townsville, claiming his department did so of its \u201cown volition\u201d. The government has been under fire after Guardian Australia revealed that Centrelink staff were told to resume welfare debt compliance \u2013 which includes the robodebt debt scheme \u2013 in Townsville, which is still recovering from February\u2019s floods. Despite Labor producing a debt notice sent to a Townsville woman this month, Robert still maintains that debt \u201crecovery\u201d has not commenced. \u201cThey commenced compliance work, though, on the 2nd of July. I was informed on 22 July the department of their own volition had commenced,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cIt was my wife\u2019s birthday. I remember it well. And immediately said, no, I don\u2019t want compliance to continue either. So debt halt had gone right the way through from 1 February to today. It\u2019s still in place, and I put a hold on any compliance work on 22 July as well.\u201d Stuart Robert sent this out on Tuesday: Minister for Government Services, Stuart Robert, today said the former Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten\u2019s claims of Centrelink debt notices for income compliance being issued to people in the Townsville region following the devastating floods are wrong. There is currently no debt recovery for income compliance in the four affected post codes in the Townsville region. \u2018The impact of natural disasters can be absolutely devastating for the families and communities impacted \u2013 not least those in Townsville during the floods this year,\u2019 Mr Robert said. \u2018The last thing people in the Townsville region need are false rumours of debt notices for income compliance being issued. I want to reassure people in the Townsville region that debt recovery for income compliance recovery has not recommenced and it will not be commencing in the foreseeable future. \u2018During natural disaster events such as cyclones, bushfires or floods, it is routine practice for my department to temporarily suspend compliance activities within the affected area. \u2018The Department of Human Services assists people facing difficult situations every day and consider any special circumstances. The department have very carefully considered how to best work with people identified as vulnerable and staff receive regular training to help them provide the best possible support. \u2018When the department are informed about changes in people\u2019s circumstances or current difficulties, they can tailor a solution for their situation. There is a network of social workers provide short-term counselling, support and information for people in a time of crisis. \u2018I encourage anyone who wants more information or to talk through options to speak with the department.\u2019 Mathias Cormann has defended the presence of two Liberal Party MPs \u2013 Craig Kelly and Amanda Stoker \u2013 at a conservative conference being held in Sydney next week. On Tuesday night in the Senate, Labor\u2019s Kristina Keneally questioned why the two MPs were appearing at the Australian Conservative Political Action Conference alongside Raheem Kassam, a former chief advisor to Nigel Farage and former editor-in-chief of Breitbart. Describing it as a \u201ctalkfest of hate\u201d, Keneally also called on the government to block Kassam\u2019s visa over comments the former UK Independence party leadership candidate has previously made on Islam and women. Cormann was questioned on their attendance by Labor yesterday, and in a letter to Senate president Scott Ryan today he has defended the MPs for attending the event. \u201cTheir attendance at this conference does not imply agreement or endorsement with the views of any of the other speakers attending in any way. \u201cThe government will always stand against divisive, inflammatory commentary which seeks to incite hatred or which seeks to vilify people. \u201cHowever, the way to defeat bad ideas, bad arguments and unacceptable views is through debate, especially with those we disagree with. It is not by limiting our conversations only to those who at all times we share all of our views.\u201d Sarah Hanson-Young has responded to David Littleproud\u2019s announcement: Minister Littleproud\u2019s announcement of an inspector general highlights just how deep the rot in the Murray-Darling Basin runs. Basin communities, family farmers and the environment have suffered as a result of years of mismanagement and inaction. The nation\u2019s most important river system hangs in the balance \u2013 this new role must be able to look at past wrongs not just future misdeeds. We await detail from the minister on exactly what powers an inspector general would have, what resources will be available to them and how much information the public will be made privy to. Most of the $13 billion allocated for the plan has been spent and the river remains in crisis. Basin communities, farmers and Australian taxpayers deserve answers. The government must also announce their plans for a federal Icac \u2013 and how an inspector general would work with them \u2013 for this announcement to have real credibility. An inspector general would be appointed to oversee integrity matters across the entire Murray-Darling Basin system under a proposal from the water resources minister, David Littleproud. Littleproud will propose the new role when the basin states meet for ministerial council on Sunday. The statutory role would monitor water recovery and efficiency measures across the basin, as well as compliance and suspected water theft. Littleproud said the inspector general would have powers to investigate and collect evidence where appropriate. The position wouldn\u2019t replace the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, but it would hold the regulator to account, along with the federal and state governments, the minister said. \u201cThe public needs to know the Basin plan is delivering the water it was intended to, and farmers need to know the plan is working as it should,\u201d Littleproud said. The role would be established by amending the Water Act and an interim inspector general may be appointed while the parliament considers the legislation. The position would be established by 2020 with a budget of $8m and an office of about 10 staff, including the inspector general themselves, Littleproud said. Sunday\u2019s ministerial council is the first since the mass fish kills in Menindee during summer and also the first since renewed calls for an independent commission of inquiry into the management of water flows in the Murray-Darling Basin. Meanwhile, Raheem Kassam, who doesn\u2019t care at all about the possibility Australia could ban him from entering, seems to be spending a lot of time on Twitter talking about things he doesn\u2019t understand. For example \u2013 the Senate. Or who Mathias Cormann is I mean, weird flex, but whatever bub Today is a lot slower pace, compared with the rest of the week. It\u2019s got a very last-day-of-school vibe. If your school was full of broken zombies on midnight trains going anywhere. I\u2019ve had a chat to a few constitutional experts about whether parliament itself can resolve eligibility questions, in the context of news a constituent has challenged treasurer Josh Frydenberg in the court of disputed returns. It\u2019s a little known fact that section 47 of the constitution contains a power for the houses of parliament to determine eligibility and deal with disputed elections \u2013 but it is subject to the qualification \u201cuntil parliament otherwise provides\u201d. Professor Tony Blackshield told Guardian Australia the houses of parliament \u201cno longer have exclusive power\u201d \u2013 because they have passed legislation allowing challenges to the court \u2013 \u201cbut they still do have the power\u201d. For example, in 1999 the House of Representatives declined to refer Warren Entsch to the high court over an alleged pecuniary interest, and instead resolved itself that he was eligible. Professor Anne Twomey thinks it\u2019s \u201ca very hard question\u201d to resolve. On one view parliament has decided to confer jurisdiction on the court, and limited its own jurisdiction. But on the other hand, Twomey points to some observations by three justices in Sue v Hill which suggest it could be possible that the court and parliament could come into conflict, offering contradictory views on the eligibility of a member or senator. Twomey: \u201cEven if the House did retain jurisdiction to decide the issue, there is also the convention of \u2018sub judice\u2019 in parliament. That is that the Houses should not debate things that are currently before the courts. It would hence be most inappropriate for a House to decide on a Member\u2019s qualification or disqualification once proceedings have been initiated in the court of disputed returns. It would also show a lack of respect for the judicial process. Hence, I don\u2019t think it likely that the House would do so.\u201d In any event \u2013 the government does not seem keen to try to resolve the issue in parliament. Attorney general Christian Porter said: \u201cAll Coalition candidates at the last election were subject to rigorous eligibility checks. The government is confident in its members\u2019 eligibility and does not need to move a motion on the floor of the House to resolve the issue.\u201d \u201cPeople do know what my values are, I am a progressive, I want to shape change, to move the country forward. I am concerned that Australia is treading water at the moment,\u201d Anthony Albanese says. He says the nation is not making enough of its assets \u2013 in that it digs up its resources, but imports them back once it has been \u201cvalue added to overseas with manufacturing\u201d and that is something which needs to be addressed. \u201cWhat Labor has always been about is aspiration. I am a living example,\u201d Albanese says. \u201c... When we talk about aspiration, I think they want something else as well, it is not just individualism.\u201d He says he thinks Australians want everyone to do better \u2013 \u201ca broader concept than the current government, which seems to be all about individualism\u201d. \u201cWe believe the government has a role in lifting everyone up, not just leaving some people behind.\u201d Anthony Albanese is defending Labor\u2019s decision to vote against setting up a parliamentary committee into the Crown allegations. He says it was because the law integrity commission would be more powerful. The problem the crossbench has with that one though is that it doesn\u2019t have the power to investigate parliamentarians. Kieran Gilbert\u2019s interview with Anthony Albanese is being shown on Sky right now. Albanese is calling for the government to ban Raheem Kassam, and also says he will be meeting with Mike Pompeo when he visits this weekend. Albanese says the \u201cUnited States are very important allies\u201d, despite some of Trump\u2019s rhetoric. On the latest terror laws the government wants (to keep terrorist offenders in prison beyond their court imposed sentence), Albanese says he hasn\u2019t been briefed by the government as yet. \u201cThis has been a government that hasn\u2019t been great at consultation,\u201d he says. The legislation is headed to the joint parliamentary security and intelligence committee, which is government heavy, but bipartisan. The government broke from tradition with the temporary exclusion order bill and didn\u2019t amend the legislation with all of the committee\u2019s recommendations (Labor had done this once previously as well) so Albanese says he hopes the tradition will once again stand with any future bills. This is the bill that Labor wants to amend to extend the powers for just three months, not 12 as the government does, because it says it is beyond time to review the laws and Peter Dutton has just not got around to it. The security agencies haven\u2019t actually used these powers. They want them amended so they can actually use them, which is forming the basis of Labor\u2019s arguments. Labor hasn\u2019t said what it will do, if the government doesn\u2019t accept the amendments, and if the crossbench doesn\u2019t help them do it in the Senate. But we do know how these things on national security tend to go. (spoiler: Labor still votes for the bill) Michael McCormack is coming up on Sky. Might stare at the wall for a bit. It is bound to be just as illuminating. The Greens gave notice yesterday that it would be putting forward its own Icac bill, in the Senate, where there is an actual prospect of success. Labor, the Greens and the crossbench are all on the same side in the House. Centre Alliance is onboard and so is Jacqui Lambie. If One Nation comes on over, then yes, it will have a chance in the Senate. In the House, the government has the numbers. But it will make a statement. In news that will surprise no one who has a basic understanding of maths, Labor did not get its suspension motion up. 68 to 73. Chris Bowen stopped by doors this morning and chatted about why Labor believes Raheem Kassam should be banned from entering Australia: I think Penny Wong, Kristina Keneally, Pat Dodson have done a great job highlighting the fact, firstly: that Liberal National party figures are sharing the stage with purveyors of hate speech at this conference, I believe it\u2019s next week. This says a lot about the lurch to the right of the modern Liberal National party that this is apparently OK to speak at such a conference. Many figures in the Liberal National party are very quick to call for visas to be denied. I think Kristina Keneally and her colleagues have done a great job in highlighting that this is a serious matter, a serious matter which the minister for Home Affairs should be turning his attention to and the prime minister should be showing some leadership and saying this conference is not something Liberals or Nationals should be associated with. Labor is not letting this go, pointing out that David Coleman cancelled Milo Yiannopoulos\u2019s visa after a vile Facebook post he made following the Christchurch terror attack on Muslims. Milo Yiannopoulos will not be allowed to enter Australia for his proposed tour this year. Mr Yiannopoulos\u2019 comments on social media regarding the Christchurch terror attack are appalling and foment hatred and division. The terrorist attack in Christchurch was carried out on Muslims peacefully practicing their religion. It was an act of pure evil. Australia stands with New Zealand and with Muslim communities the world over in condemning this inhuman act. Given some of Kassam\u2019s comments (which we won\u2019t be amplifying here), Labor is asking \u2018what\u2019s the difference?\u2019 Christian Porter says the government is getting around to the integrity commission, and is taking its time getting the legislation together. AAP has reported on Karina Okotel, the Liberal party\u2019s federal vice president, interviewed on RN this morning. Liberal party members accusing colleagues of sexual assault must name them before the organisation takes action, the party\u2019s federal vice president has declared. Karina Okotel\u2019s comments come after two women who worked for senior Liberal politicians made allegations of sexual assault against staffers within state and federal politics. \u2018The alleged perpetrators need to be named,\u2019 Ms Okotel told ABC radio National on Thursday. \u2018If a complaint is to be made, if there\u2019s to be any resolution around it, even an internal organisation needs to know who, what and when, where, in order to be able to take any kind of action.\u2019 And in the Senate, the Crown saga is still very much on the agenda. The Nine Network and newspapers had a very strong response to Crown\u2019s statement\u2019s today. If you haven\u2019t already, you should check it out Also not going away \u2013 Labor\u2019s attempt to wedge the government on a federal integrity commission. The crossbench have been leading the debate on this, but Labor committed to establishing one well before the election. That forced the Coalition to promise one, but their version would be kept behind closed doors, to avoid it being used for political gain. Mark Dreyfus has opened the chamber\u2019s proceedings with a call to suspend standing orders: The bells have just rung for the start of parliament. Let the countdown begin. This isn\u2019t going away This is interesting. David Littleproud is proposing a new inspector general be installed for the Murray-Darling basin, when the basin states meet this weekend. From his office: The new statutory position will have powers across the basin under The Water Act 2007. The inspector general will hold the MDBA, commonwealth and all states to account, provide independent assurance to the community around the plan\u2019s implementation and ensure the laws governing water use are followed. The inspector general will be able to refer issues to the Commonwealth Integrity Commission once it is established. State and territory ministers will be asked this weekend to endorse the new position, which is due to be established by 2020. The move follows the successful Northern Basin commissioner role filled by former AFP commissioner Mick Keelty, which has already brought greater confidence and accountability to communities in northern New South Wales and Queensland. The inspector general will: \u00b7 Check on water recovery and delivery of water efficiency projects \u00b7 Monitor compliance and suspected water theft across the Basin; investigating and collecting evidence where appropriate \u00b7 provide annual reports to the minister for water resources, and tabled in parliament \u00b7 conduct community engagement on Basin Plan implementation and compliance matters This is a fun response I just received from Home Affairs, almost a month after I put in the request about the Home Affairs strategic review and received this response: Home Affairs review response: \u201cA Home Affairs Portfolio Review was completed and the report has not been publicly released.\u201d Now Home Affairs, after releasing one page to the Senate, sent this to me: Following on to your media enquiry on 8 July, please see below for a response to be attributed to the Department of Home Affairs: On 10 July 2019, the Department provided a response to The Guardian advising that \u201cA Home Affairs Portfolio Review was completed and the report has not been publicly released.\u201d This response incorrectly implied that a report was available, but not released. The strategic review process was initiated following the creation of the Home Affairs Portfolio in December 2017 There was no single consolidated report prepared as part of the process. The strategic review was initiated to identify opportunities and areas of collaboration across the Department and the agencies in the new Home Affairs Portfolio, created in December 2017. This included harnessing the collective capabilities of those working in domestic security and law enforcement, and to develop options for greater efficiency and effectiveness. Of the $7 million allocated, the Review work was largely undertaken internally, with almost $5 million expended on contractors and consultants, and other expenses. The Home Affairs Portfolio brought together six agencies and departments and encompasses around 23,000 public servants and serving law enforcement officers Its broad remit encompasses national security, federal law enforcement, transport security and critical infrastructure protection, trade and customs, emergency management, immigration, border security, cyber policy, countering terrorism and foreign interference, citizenship and multicultural services. The review process provided valuable insights into effective methodologies for working together and delivered substantial and long-term benefits to the Portfolio. It has also fed into strategic financial planning methodologies and analytic tools to support the Portfolio\u2019s financial evaluation and input into the Government\u2019s Portfolio Charging Review and Charging Survey, financial and analytic tools to support Portfolio budget development, financial and analytical models for evaluation of future investment proposals, cross agency workshops and business impact work on efficiencies. Also, a thank you to Samantha Maiden, who pointed me to the answer of the burning question of the 46th parliament \u2013 what was the gift the new Liberal MP Gladys Liu couldn\u2019t describe, so didn\u2019t know how to declare? She raised it during MP Kindy, which had everyone immediately abuzz. Then this popped up in her declarations: But ask and you shall receive: Barnaby Joyce delivered a late-night speech to the Federation chamber (where speeches go to die) which my colleague Josh Taylor has just passed on to me, which is interesting. He blames the headline on the Courier-Mail article that kickstarted the whole conversation, but let\u2019s look at some of his comments in that article. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m not getting money, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s spread so thin. I\u2019m just saying these circumstances have made me more vastly attuned \u2026 it\u2019s just a great exercise in humility going from deputy prime minister to watching every dollar you get. A politician [renting a duplex without a dishwasher] for 415 bucks a week, he\u2019s not living high on the hog, is he? There is a reason for that and that\u2019s basically what I can afford. You do become a lot more mindful. So the big thrill of the day, to be honest, is a cup of coffee. We [he and Vikki] rarely, if ever, go out for dinner. You\u2019re very mindful of what\u2019s coming up in the next couple of weeks and try to make sure I don\u2019t miss any payments. There has to some purpose for everything. The purpose of this \u2013 I\u2019m a lot more focused people who don\u2019t have money. He\u2019s \u201cwatching every dollar he gets\u201d after going from close to $500,000 to $250,000. Again, it is not that he has changed his mind. Our politicians should do that and, as we saw in the marriage equality debate, it\u2019s exceptionally important to bringing about change. But maybe, just maybe, it\u2019s not about going from a huge six-figure salary to a lower six-figure salary, which includes $288 a day in travel allowance when you are in Canberra. Maybe it should be about the fact you represent one of the poorest electorates in the country, and used to lead a party which represents the vast majority of poverty-stricken electorates. Maybe, just maybe, it isn\u2019t actually about our politicians themselves, but the job they do. Speaking of Kristina Keneally, the senator, along with colleagues Penny Wong and Pat Dodson, is leading the charge to have former Breitbart editor and apparent ping-pong enthusiast Raheem Kassam banned from entering Australia, for hate speech. I mean, if you have the Fredo of America\u2019s First Family on your side, then you must be fine, right? Kassam is one of the headline speakers at a conservative conference headed to Australia next month, where Craig Kelly, Amanda Stoker and Tony Abbott will all talk on the need to fight for conservatives in this country, as if the conservatives have not been in power for 17 of the last 23 years. He has said some pretty vile stuff in the past but, so far, the government has not said whether it will be responding in the same way it did to Milo Yiannopoulos and denying him a visa. Welcome to the last sitting day for five weeks, with politicians heading on the parliament winter break at the close of business today. Parliament won\u2019t be back until 9 September and then there are only five full sitting weeks (plus a separate House and Senate sitting) until the end of the year. But before we get to that, we have to get through today. First up, remember this story? The home affairs department is keeping a multimillion-dollar strategic review into Peter Dutton\u2019s super portfolio secret from the public. The review was ordered just five months after the creation of the home affairs department in late 2017, which saw the former department of immigration and border protection expanded with agencies and responsibilities from within the attorney general\u2019s department, as well as elements of regional development, social services and prime minister and cabinet. Kristina Keneally asked the Senate to force the home affairs department to produce the review and, late yesterday, it did. A whole one page. Keneally told the Senate on Wednesday night: This is a $5m piece of paper. This is either the single most expensive piece of paper in the history of this chamber or a blatant rejection of the will of the Senate by a minister who is allergic to scrutiny. The community has the right to know how one of our largest government departments \u2013 and one that is so fundamental to our national security \u2013 is being administered. Meanwhile, the government is pushing new legislation to keep \u201chigh-risk terrorist offenders\u201d in prison, beyond any sentence they may be handed \u201cif they pose an ongoing threat to public safety\u201d. There\u2019s no information yet on who judges who is an ongoing threat, or what constitutes that ongoing threat. From Christian Porter\u2019s office: The changes were recommended by the Council of Australian Governments following a deadly 2017 terror attack in Victoria, which involved an offender who was on bail and had previously been charged with a terrorism offence. The community was rightly outraged by Yacqub Khayre\u2019s case and I believe the changes we are introducing today strike the right balance between protecting individual rights and freedoms, and protecting the community. Plus, there is the ensuring integrity bill heading to the Senate. But that doesn\u2019t have the numbers with the crossbench as yet, so it is doubtful it will go anywhere before the break. You have Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and me, who is at least at 15% capacity, so huzzah for that. Also \u2013 happy horse birthday. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

Dean Smith\u2019s side are set to make their 177th signing of the summer by raiding Brentford for striker <strong>Neal Maupay</strong>. <br><br><strong>Arsenal</strong>, meanwhile, are continuing to pipe sweet songs across Europe in the hope of attracting bids of <strong>Shkodran Mustafi</strong>.

      "bodyText": "Hard facts are not a currency in which the Rumour Mill usually deals but let\u2019s start with one right here: this has been an underwhelming transfer window so far. Lots of clubs have done little or not exciting business. But, as the Mill is contractually obliged to say, that could all change soon because there\u2019s a stampede of Premier League clubs heading to Barcelona to woo Ivan Rakitic. When we say stampede, we mean at least one. Everton, are said to be slightly interested. Manchester United might have a nibble, too. Everton\u2019s main focus at the moment, though, is the Mainz midfielder Jean-Philippe Gbamin. So, in truth, there\u2019s not exactly a clamour for the services of Rakitic. Even more surprisingly, no one has submitted an offer for Philippe Coutinho despite Barcelona making it clear he is available. Spurs are ready to pounce if they need to replace Christian Eriksen but he, too, seems stranded at the moment. There\u2019s no chain reaction in the transfer market, just deadlock. Malcom\u2019s imminent move to Zenit Saint Petersburg isn\u2019t going to launch any merry-go-rounds. Except at Aston Villa, of course. Dean Smith\u2019s side are set to make their 177th signing of the summer by raiding Brentford for striker Neal Maupay. Arsenal, meanwhile, are continuing to pipe sweet songs across Europe in the hope of attracting bids of Shkodran Mustafi. Roma have pricked up their ears but not stumped up any cash. Laurent Koscielny remains at loggerheads with the club over a potential move to Bordeaux. That may change if Arsenal persuade Juve to give them Daniel Rugani on loan. Romelu Lukaku is another marooned player, as his planned transfer to Juventus cannot go through until United know whether Paulo Dybala is going to head to Old Trafford. If Antonio Conte throws a big enough strop, Inter may yet step in to land Lukaku instead. But the most interesting deal in Italy may well come from Napoli, who are said to be preparing a \u00a356m offer for Wilfried Zaha, for whom bids from Everton and Arsenal have already been rejected this summer. Speaking of Everton, they are hoping to persuade Frank Lampard that Fikayo Tomori needs another loan spell away from Chelsea, ideally at Goodison Park.

But the vast majority of it is either not recycled, unrecyclable, or doesn't get reused once it's been recycled. Volumes ending up in the natural environment are surging.

It kills sea creatures that eat it but cannot digest it. It gets into the human food chain by contaminating the fish that we eat. It is even in our tap water. There is no science about the long-term impact of humans ingesting plastic.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is to be done?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Taxing plastic bags \u2013 or even banning them outright as Kenya has done \u2013 has changed consumer and producer behaviour. But what next? Deposit return schemes for plastic bottles work well in several countries. Charging for one-time coffee cups also seems to be on the agenda. But the real solutions may not be top down but ...<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>... bottom up?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Yes. Grassroots movements led the way on plastic bags, and have spawned others such as Refill, which emphasises reusing bottles, and A Plastic Planet, which urges plastic-free aisles in supermarkets.

Wolfson said the group\u2019s Label business, which sells brands including Ted Baker and Joules online and via a catalogue, had performed well helping drive 12% total growth online. Next now expects full-price sales to rise by 3.6% for the year, just over double the previous estimate. The good performance comes despite widespread troubles on the high street which have led to a string of retailers, including Debenhams, Topshop and New Look, closing stores and asking landlords for rent cuts. Sofie Willmott, an analyst at GlobalData, a market analysis firm, said: \u201cNext\u2019s current performance is not an indicator for its mid-market competitors as the retailer continues to outperform.\u201d She said Next\u2019s click-and-collect services and efforts to reinvent its stores by adding a range of concessions from coffee shops to car dealers had helped attract shoppers.",

Indeed, if all nations now have a mathematically likelier chance of qualifying by virtue of the expanded format, why would they change anything at all? Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I hope they do. I hope Infantino is right and that all these federations see the 2023 World Cup, the pinnacle of women\u2019s football, as an achievable goal, and that they all implement long-term, sustainable strategies to get there. But growing the women\u2019s game globally requires more work than simply setting up a few extra chairs at the table. While there is definitely merit to the idea of using World Cup qualification to incentivise federations to invest in their women\u2019s programs, the stories that came out of this year\u2019s tournament \u2013 of teams succeeding despite their federations, not because of them \u2013 proves that incentives in the form of a few extra World Cup spots is not enough.",

The idea that he could wander through New York for a couple of days, unaccounted for, without any contact from an adult in his life must seem completely foreign to kids today, who are kept on tight leashes. A parent can watch their child\u2019s exact geolocation from a handheld device. Holden had much more freedom, but it came with a heaping side order of neglect.</p> <p>Though young people today are more carefully watched, they\u2019re also looking out at the adult world and seeing very clearly that it has gone absolutely mad. How can one get all worked up about some \u201cphony\u201d classmate or a brother who sold out to Hollywood (is selling out even a thing any more?) when earlier that morning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/31/shooter-drills-high-school-shooting-new-normal\">you did an active shooter drill in homeroom?</a> Or when it\u2019s possible the Earth might be uninhabitable within your lifetime and the grownups are doing nothing about it? Holden\u2019s melancholia feels positively quaint in comparison to the problems kids face today.</p> <p>I\u2019ve read Catcher at a few different stages of my life, and it\u2019s changed each time. First at the age of 13, as part of my education as a New York City kid attending a progressive private school on the Upper West Side (just a Central Park away from Holden\u2019s stomping grounds), then again on my own at 17, when I was mainlining ennui and noticing how disappointing people were. So I fell in love.</p> <p>When I was about to graduate college at 21 and feeling that morphine drip of nostalgia that accompanies points of departure in youth, I read Catcher again in search of my old friend. But by then, Holden\u2019s appeal had worn off. I\u2019d figured out sensitive and angry young men usually reserved their sensitivity for themselves. It was like bumping into an old crush and realising that everything you ever liked about them was a projection. After I turned the last page I thought, \u201cWhat did I ever see in that guy?\u201d As with most things in life, reading Catcher is all about timing.</p> <p>I\u2019m closer now to 40 than to 17. I no longer read to find friends in literature \u2013 I read for the writing. So when I recently read the book for the fourth time, I saw something brand new and I think closer to what Salinger intended: a perfectly written portrait of an imperfect character. Every syllable sings. Much of what I saw in this fourth reading, I had completely missed before.</p> <p>Which puts Catcher in a bit of a Catch-22. Kids who are reading to fall in love with a book no longer relate to Holden, and adult readers who appreciate the craftsmanship are too old to be struck by it emotionally.</p> <p>So, here\u2019s my proposal to readers coming to The Catcher in the Rye for the first time now: read it as early as possible in your life. Read it alongside Ralph Ellison, Sylvia Plath, James Baldwin, Junot D\u00edaz, Toni Morrison, Andr\u00e9 Aciman and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Hate it if you must. Rail against Holden. Call him a spoiled brat. When it comes to all the money and opportunity he squanders, he is! Let 20 years pass. Let the world wash over you, then read it again. You might see Holden for who he really is. Not a stand-in for every single teenager that ever walked the Earth, but a lonely individual who finds the injustices of the world intolerable.</p> <p>\u2022 The Falconer by Dana Czapnik is out now (Faber &amp; Faber)<br></p>",

A parent can watch their child\u2019s exact geolocation from a handheld device. Holden had much more freedom, but it came with a heaping side order of neglect. Though young people today are more carefully watched, they\u2019re also looking out at the adult world and seeing very clearly that it has gone absolutely mad. How can one get all worked up about some \u201cphony\u201d classmate or a brother who sold out to Hollywood (is selling out even a thing any more?) when earlier that morning you did an active shooter drill in homeroom? Or when it\u2019s possible the Earth might be uninhabitable within your lifetime and the grownups are doing nothing about it? Holden\u2019s melancholia feels positively quaint in comparison to the problems kids face today. I\u2019ve read Catcher at a few different stages of my life, and it\u2019s changed each time. First at the age of 13, as part of my education as a New York City kid attending a progressive private school on the Upper West Side (just a Central Park away from Holden\u2019s stomping grounds), then again on my own at 17, when I was mainlining ennui and noticing how disappointing people were. So I fell in love. When I was about to graduate college at 21 and feeling that morphine drip of nostalgia that accompanies points of departure in youth, I read Catcher again in search of my old friend. But by then, Holden\u2019s appeal had worn off. I\u2019d figured out sensitive and angry young men usually reserved their sensitivity for themselves. It was like bumping into an old crush and realising that everything you ever liked about them was a projection. After I turned the last page I thought, \u201cWhat did I ever see in that guy?\u201d As with most things in life, reading Catcher is all about timing. I\u2019m closer now to 40 than to 17. I no longer read to find friends in literature \u2013 I read for the writing. So when I recently read the book for the fourth time, I saw something brand new and I think closer to what Salinger intended: a perfectly written portrait of an imperfect character. Every syllable sings. Much of what I saw in this fourth reading, I had completely missed before. Which puts Catcher in a bit of a Catch-22. Kids who are reading to fall in love with a book no longer relate to Holden, and adult readers who appreciate the craftsmanship are too old to be struck by it emotionally. So, here\u2019s my proposal to readers coming to The Catcher in the Rye for the first time now: read it as early as possible in your life. Read it alongside Ralph Ellison, Sylvia Plath, James Baldwin, Junot D\u00edaz, Toni Morrison, Andr\u00e9 Aciman and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Hate it if you must. Rail against Holden. Call him a spoiled brat. When it comes to all the money and opportunity he squanders, he is! Let 20 years pass. Let the world wash over you, then read it again. You might see Holden for who he really is. Not a stand-in for every single teenager that ever walked the Earth, but a lonely individual who finds the injustices of the world intolerable. \u2022 The Falconer by Dana Czapnik is out now (Faber &amp; Faber)",

But we should recognise the dual role they also play in encouraging a delay to the action we need to take: rapidly ending the use of fossil fuels. \u2022 Simon Lewis is professor of global change science at University College London",

You certainly can\u2019t fault him when it comes to giving readers value for money, and not just in terms of pages. A typical Stephenson novel will contain enough plot for two or three regular-sized books, and enough thought-provoking ideas for four or five. And the bonus here: <em>Fall</em> is the best thing he\u2019s written in ages.</p> <p>In <em>Reamde</em>, games developer Richard \u201cDodge\u201d Forthrast developed an immersive virtual reality MMORPG \u2013 a massively multiplayer online role-playing game \u2013 called T\u2019Rain. It made him rich, and provoked a kidnap/terrorism Russian-mafia storyline too intricate to summarise here. Luckily you don\u2019t need to know all the ins and outs of the former novel to enjoy <em>Fall</em>, which starts with Forthrast, now a middle-aged billionaire, waking in his luxurious Seattle apartment. We get a leisurely account of his morning, and of the routine medical procedure he has scheduled. But something goes wrong in the clinic and he dies under anaesthetic. His will instructs that his body be cryonically preserved and his brain scanned neuron by neuron in the hope that technology will eventually be developed that can bring him back to life. Soon enough, virtual reality provides him with just such a second chance.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The info-dumping is still there \u2013 fans of Stephenson expect nothing less \u2013 but  mixed with an old-school fantasy novel</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>Reamde</em>, like many of Stephenson\u2019s books, was a Goliath-sized techno thriller, mixing info-dumps and action in a sometimes uneasy novelistic emulsion. <em>Fall</em> is a different sort of beast. The info-dumping is still there, of course \u2013 fans would expect nothing less \u2013 but this time it\u2019s mixed in with an old-school fantasy novel, exploring the exotic, magical world of its virtual afterlife, Bitworld.

      "bodyText": "At a paltry 883 pages, Fall or, Dodge in Hell is short by Neal Stephenson\u2019s standards. Reamde, from 2011, to which Fall is a sequel, is 1,044 pages long, and his multi-award-winning three-part Baroque Cycle (2003-04) runs to 2,671 pages. You certainly can\u2019t fault him when it comes to giving readers value for money, and not just in terms of pages. A typical Stephenson novel will contain enough plot for two or three regular-sized books, and enough thought-provoking ideas for four or five. And the bonus here: Fall is the best thing he\u2019s written in ages. In Reamde, games developer Richard \u201cDodge\u201d Forthrast developed an immersive virtual reality MMORPG \u2013 a massively multiplayer online role-playing game \u2013 called T\u2019Rain. It made him rich, and provoked a kidnap/terrorism Russian-mafia storyline too intricate to summarise here. Luckily you don\u2019t need to know all the ins and outs of the former novel to enjoy Fall, which starts with Forthrast, now a middle-aged billionaire, waking in his luxurious Seattle apartment. We get a leisurely account of his morning, and of the routine medical procedure he has scheduled. But something goes wrong in the clinic and he dies under anaesthetic. His will instructs that his body be cryonically preserved and his brain scanned neuron by neuron in the hope that technology will eventually be developed that can bring him back to life. Soon enough, virtual reality provides him with just such a second chance. Reamde, like many of Stephenson\u2019s books, was a Goliath-sized techno thriller, mixing info-dumps and action in a sometimes uneasy novelistic emulsion. Fall is a different sort of beast. The info-dumping is still there, of course \u2013 fans would expect nothing less \u2013 but this time it\u2019s mixed in with an old-school fantasy novel, exploring the exotic, magical world of its virtual afterlife, Bitworld. There are even maps, although this being Stephenson the maps are in the process of being drawn as the story develops. He doesn\u2019t usually write fantasy. On the evidence of Fall, he ought to do it more often. His Bitworld starts nebulous, coalesces into landscape, and soon enough is giving us warring gods, talking birds, giants, fiery swords, magic forests, fortresses, quests, prophecies and pretty much everything the fantasy fan might hope for. The scanning process destroys Dodge\u2019s memory, so he wakes amnesiac into his virtual afterlife. As \u201cEgdod\u201d, his avatar from the game world of Reamde, and with the help of various other brains scanned and added to this computer-maintained world, he builds landscapes, biomes and cities, and settles into his post-existence existence.

It\u2019s engrossing stuff, although the fact that nobody can \u201cdie\u201d a second time \u2013 they just get rebooted \u2013 means that the narrative stakes are never particularly high. Meanwhile, in the \u201cmeatspace\u201d of our world, life goes on. Shortly after Dodge\u2019s death a midwestern town called Moab is destroyed in a nuclear attack. This is quickly shown to be a hoax, orchestrated via faked online video, massively coordinated misinformation and a few holographic special effects, but when the truth is revealed many people refuse to accept it.

      "bodyText": "Sports media giant ESPN recently published an in-depth and supposedly inspirational feature on Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) hopeful Jordan Williams, who fought for a lucrative UFC pro contract, on 23 July. It described how the true fighter has persevered through difficulties, training hard and smart to rise to the top despite many setbacks, including his type 1 diabetes. \u201cI\u2019ve been an athlete my whole life, even before I was diagnosed as a diabetic and now long after. I always try to go my hardest and always try to train and push myself to the limit,\u201d Williams explains. The article is a standard \u201ctriumph over adversity\u201d piece until it casually notes in the 17th paragraph: \u201cWilliams doesn\u2019t have medical insurance and cannot afford the treatment. So he buys insulin that\u2019s sold for dogs at Walmart for $24.99 per bottle.\u201d It accepts without comment that insulin costs up to $470 a bottle and that Williams considers himself \u201csuper lucky\u201d that somebody told him he could use the cheaper, animal-grade substitute. Super lucky? This is a disturbing, but not uncommon, story in the US, where more than 1 million adults have type 1 diabetes and the cost of insulin, the drug that keeps them alive, rises exponentially year on year to the point where Americans must pay thousands of dollars a year simply to not die. Turning 26, the age when you are no longer eligible for cover on your parents\u2019 health insurance, can be a death sentence for diabetics, who often also resort to reusing costly needles into oblivion to save money. This is part of a deeper malaise in American healthcare where hospital bills are the leading cause of bankruptcy and one-third of all GoFundMe donations are for medical expenses. Increasingly, those who cannot afford health insurance are turning to fish antibiotics as cheaper alternatives to human ones, despite the health consequences. Unsurprisingly, a 2015 poll found healthcare was the public\u2019s most pressing issue; Americans are more scared of getting sick than of a terrorist attack.

For instance, children setting up lemonade stands in the hopes of paying for their baby brother\u2019s medical treatment, their mother\u2019s kidney transplant or their own chemotherapy. Or how about selling your beloved car to pay for your wife\u2019s cancer? These sorts of behaviors are largely unknown in developed countries outside the US, as all employ some form of universal healthcare plan. Drug prices are kept under control by other governments so no one is forced to risk their lives with animal-grade medicine. And Breaking Bad could not have been set in Canada because Walter White would have been given free treatment immediately.

Nawng Lat, 31, who was at that meeting alongside Bawk Nu Awng, said: \u201cWe urgently had to form a group to think deeply about our returns and raise our voice.\u201d</p> <p>The group developed a statement, published on Facebook, stating that returns should only happen when safety and dignity could be assured, and when people have been consulted and are free to decide when to return without pressure or force being applied.

I\u2019m not saying we don\u2019t want to go back; actually, we are eager to back as soon as possible.

Nawng Lat, 31, who was at that meeting alongside Bawk Nu Awng, said: \u201cWe urgently had to form a group to think deeply about our returns and raise our voice.\u201d The group developed a statement, published on Facebook, stating that returns should only happen when safety and dignity could be assured, and when people have been consulted and are free to decide when to return without pressure or force being applied. It also stated that displaced people should not be used for political, economic or social advantage. Nawng Lat, who is from Nam San Yang village, was not part of the group that returned. He is eager to go home, but only when conditions are right. When fighting resumed eight years ago, he never imagined living in a camp for so long. \u201cMy first thought was that the war would last a few months,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter about three years, everything became unsure. I wondered why it was happening, why we couldn\u2019t go back.\u201d Now he is among more than 38,000 displaced people living in areas outside the government\u2019s jurisdiction. With limited access to higher education and jobs, many young people leave for China in search of livelihoods, where they are vulnerable to trafficking and abuse. \u201cThe longer we stay in IDP camps, the more problems we face,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want returns to happen under pressure. I\u2019m not saying we don\u2019t want to go back; actually, we are eager to back as soon as possible. It\u2019s been eight years since we have been displaced and we have lost so many things related to our education and development. We will only return after we have a security guarantee.\u201d Bawk Nu Awng wants a guarantee that landmines have been cleared: \u201cCurrently, it is like they want us to stay in a house that is not fully built. When it rains, it will leak. Only after they have fully built the house should we stay in it. There needs to be trust. \u201cI would like both of the militaries [Tatmadaw and KIA] to clear the landmines that are in our land, and I only want to go back after we have official peace.\u201d In June, the activists staged a public drama performance to commemorate the war\u2019s eighth anniversary. Pau Lu and fellow organiser Seng Nu Pan informed the authorities yet, moments before the performance, police turned up claiming that extra permissions were required. The event was moved and went ahead, but Pau Lu and Seng Nu Pan were charged with holding an unauthorised protest. They now face a maximum three-month prison sentence in the ongoing case. The incident is one of several in which activists have faced criminal charges. In April last yea,r Lum Zawng and fellow activists Zau Jat and Nang Pu received a six-month prison sentence for defaming the Tatmadaw by leading a demonstration demanding safe passage and humanitarian access to 2,000 villagers trapped during a period of escalated fighting. Bawk Nu Awng says fear makes people reluctant to act: \u201cSome are afraid of engaging in politics \u2026 My parents don\u2019t want me to participate because they are afraid I will get shot or arrested.\u201d Released during an annual presidential amnesty, Lum Zawng said arresting activists serves as a \u201cpsychological threat\u201d. Pau Lu said they would not back down. \u201cEven if [Seng Nu Pan and I] get arrested, the youth won\u2019t stop. We have plenty of people who can step up in our place.\u201d Seng Nu Pan says arrests only \u201cpush us to do more\u201d \u201cWe have to practise our freedom of expression. If we don\u2019t express what is happening, [no one will] know,\u201d says Lum Zawng. \u201cThe young generation can change \u2026 We\u2019re not afraid to lead a movement.\u201d",

This was a nerve-racking day for Liz Muller, cofounder of California startup technology company <a href=\"https://www.deepisolation.com/\">Deep Isolation</a> and her father, Richard Muller, professor emeritus of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, and now chief technology officer at Deep Isolation.</p> <p>The father-daughter team had invited 40 nuclear scientists, US Department of Energy officials, oil and gas professionals, and environmentalists to witness the first attempt to test whether the latest oil-fracking technology could be used to permanently dispose of the most dangerous nuclear waste.</p> <p>At 11.30am, the crew of oil workers used a wire cable to lower an 80cm-long, 20cm-wide, 64kg canister \u2014 filled with steel rather than radioactive waste \u2014 down a previously drilled borehole. Then, using a tool called a \u201ctractor\u201d invented by the industry to reach horizontally into mile-deep oil reservoirs, they pushed it 120 metres farther away from the borehole through the rock.</p> <p>Five hours later, the crew used the tractor to relocate and collect the canister, attach it to the cable and pull it back to the surface \u2013 to the cheers of the workers. Until then, few people in the nuclear industry had believed this could be done.</p> <p>By avoiding the need to excavate large, expensive tunnels to store waste below ground, the Deep Isolation team believes it has found a solution to one of the world\u2019s most intractable environmental problems \u2013 how to permanently dispose of and potentially retrieve the hundreds of thousands of tonnes of nuclear waste currently being stored at nuclear power plants and research and military stations around the world.</p> <p>\u201cWe showed it could be done,\u201d Elizabeth Muller says. \u201cHorizontal, directional drilling has come a long way recently. This is now an off-the-shelf technology. Using larger canisters, we think about 300 boreholes with tunnels up to two miles long would be able to take much of the US\u2019s high-level nuclear waste. We think we can reduce by two-thirds the cost of permanent storage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe are using a technique that\u2019s been made cheap over the last 20 years,\u201d says Richard Muller, who has worked in the shale gas industry. \u201cWe realised we could put together the oil and nuclear technologies. One offered the solution to the other. These capsules can be lowered deep down, far deeper than anyone has proposed, and stored underneath a billion tonnes of rock so none of the radiation gets out.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Great stockpiles</strong></h2> <p>The dilemma of how to manage nuclear waste \u2013 radioactive materials routinely produced in large quantities at every stage of nuclear power production, from uranium mining and enrichment to reactor operation and the reprocessing of spent fuel \u2013 has taxed the industry, academics and governments for decades.</p> <p>Along with accidents, it has been a major reason for continuing public opposition to the industry\u2019s further expansion despite substantial interest in nuclear\u2019s status as a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/is-nuclear-power-zero-emission-no-but-it-isnt-high-emission-either-41615\">low-carbon power source</a> that can help mitigate climate change.</p> <p>In 80-odd years of nuclear power, in which more than 450 commercial reactors, many experimental stations and tens of thousands of nuclear warheads have been built, great stockpiles of different levels of waste have accumulated.</p> <p>Depending on how countries classify waste, <a href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/nuclear-basics/what-are-nuclear-wastes.aspx\">only about 0.2\u20133% by volume is high-level waste</a>, according to the World Nuclear Association (WNA), a London-based industry group that promotes nuclear power.</p> <p>Mostly derived from civil reactor fuel, this is some of the most dangerous material known on Earth, remaining radioactive for tens of thousands of years. It requires cooling and shielding indefinitely and contains 95% of the radioactivity related to nuclear power generation.</p> <p>A further 7% or so by volume, known as intermediate waste, is made up of things such as reactor components and graphite from reactor cores. This is also highly dangerous, but it can be stored in special canisters because it does not generate much heat.</p> <p>The rest is made up of vast quantities of what is called low-level and very low-level waste. This comprises scrap metal, paper, plastics, building materials and everything else radioactive involved in the operation and dismantling of nuclear facilities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bae93d5f5a6f23de86026db2b5ed3566921b8dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bae93d5f5a6f23de86026db2b5ed3566921b8dc/0_59_1984_1191/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steel barrels of low-level nuclear waste are buried in an underground waste storage pit in Tokaimura, Japan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steel barrels of low-level nuclear waste are buried in an underground waste storage pit in Tokaimura, Japan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jun Yasukawa/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The consensus is that about <a href=\"https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/nuclear-wastes/radioactive-waste-management.aspx#ECSArticleLink5\">22,000 cubic metres</a> of solid high-level waste has accumulated in temporary storage but not been disposed of (moved to permanent storage) in 14 western countries, along with unknown amounts in China, Russia and at military stations.</p> <p>A further 460,000 cubic metres of intermediate waste is being stored, and about 3.5m cubic metres of low-level waste. About 34,000 cubic metres of new high-level and intermediate waste is generated each year by operating civil reactors, says the WNA.</p> <p>The US, with 59 nuclear power plants comprising <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=207&amp;t=3\">97 working civil reactors</a>, each generating at least several tonnes of high-level waste per year, has about 90,000 tonnes of high-level waste awaiting permanent disposal, <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/key_issues/disposal_of_highlevel_nuclear_waste/issue_summary\">according to the US Government Accountability Office</a>.</p> <p>Although it is impossible to come up with a global total because of differences in how quantities are measured and reported, and with some inventories kept secret, other countries harbour significant amounts of waste as well.</p> <h2><strong>Many ideas</strong></h2> <p>In the early days of nuclear power, waste of any sort was barely considered. <a href=\"http://www.no2nuclearpower.org.uk/radwaste/history-of-nuclear-waste-disposal-proposals-in-britain/\">British</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/04/world/the-us-too-has-dumped-waste-at-sea.html\">American</a> and <a href=\"http://wmsym.org/archives/2000/pdf/59/59-4.pdf\">Russian</a> authorities, among others, dumped nuclear waste \u2013 including more than 150,000 tonnes of low-level waste \u2013 at sea or in rivers. Since then, billions have been spent trying to identify how best to reduce the amount produced and then store it for what may be eternity.</p> <p>Many ideas have been investigated, but most have been rejected as impractical, too expensive or ecologically unacceptable. They include: <a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19780015628.pdf\">shooting it into space</a>; <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/synroc\">isolating it in synthetic rock</a>; <a href=\"https://www.igsoc.org/journal/19/81/igs_journal_vol19_issue081_pg607-617.pdf\">burying it in ice sheets</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/03/runit-dome-pacific-radioactive-waste\">dumping it on the world\u2019s most isolated islands</a>; and <a href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/dont-dispose-waste-in-ocean-trenches-1441116\">dropping it to the bottom of the world\u2019s deepest oceanic trenches</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05736.pdf\">Vertical boreholes</a> up to 5,000 metres deep have also been proposed, and this option is said by some scientists to be promising. But there have been doubts, because it is likely to be nearly impossible to retrieve waste from vertical boreholes.</p> <p>Two scientific developments excite nuclear scientists. One is to build a new generation of advanced <a href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/fast-neutron-reactors.aspx\">fast neutron reactors</a>, which would use the high-level waste as fuel. This slowly emerging \u201cGeneration IV\u201d nuclear power programme is billed by the industry as <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/nuclear-power-is-set-to-get-a-lot-safer-and-cheaper-heres-why-62207\">safer and more efficient</a>. But even though such reactors can reduce the degree of hazard the waste poses, they do not solve the issue entirely.</p> <p>\u201cThese new reactors will still need a waste repository, likely as large as a repository for the waste produced by the current crop of conventional reactors,\u201d says Allison MacFarlane, director of the Institute for International Science and Technical Policy at the George Washington University and chair of the US nuclear regulatory commission in 2012\u201314.</p> <p>The other technology that could reduce waste, known as <a href=\"http://www.oecd-nea.org/trw/\">transmutation</a>, aims to reduce radiotoxicity by using lasers to change the composition of dangerous waste. It has been investigated for decades in the UK, US, Sweden and elsewhere but without great success.</p> <p>But the idea was boosted in December 2018 by French Nobel prize\u2013winning physicist G\u00e9rard Mourou, who, in his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Fz_BsWCjU\">acceptance lecture</a>, said laser beams millions of times brighter than the surface of the sun in bursts that last a millionth of a billionth of a second had the potential to neutralise nuclear waste, reducing its half-life to a few years and its radioactivity to very little.</p> <p>\u201cNuclear energy may be the best candidate for the future, but we are still left with a lot of dangerous junk. The idea is to transmute this nuclear waste into new forms of atoms which don\u2019t have the problem of radioactivity. What you have to do is to change the makeup of the nucleus,\u201d he said in the lecture.</p> <p>But Mourou accepted that it might take decades before this \u201cextreme light\u201d solution could be deployed to destroy nuclear waste on an industrial scale.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018No reliable method\u2019</strong></h2> <p>After decades of civil nuclear power and billions spent researching different geological sites and ways to best dispose of the waste, the problems are both technical and political, and the consensus of governments and industry is that deep burial is the best solution \u2013 at least for the moment.</p> <p>Yet, so far, no country has managed to build a deep repository for high-level waste.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough almost every nuclear country has, in principle, plans for the eventual burial of the most radioactive waste, only a handful have made any progress and nowhere in the world is there operating an authorised site for the deep geological disposal of the highest level radioactive waste,\u201d says Andrew Blowers, author of The Legacy of Nuclear Power and a former member of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/committee-on-radioactive-waste-management#content\">Committee on Radioactive Waste Management</a>, set up to advise the British government on how and where to store nuclear waste.</p> <p>\u201cCurrently no options have been able to demonstrate that waste will remain isolated from the environment over the tens to hundreds of thousands of years. There is no reliable method to warn future generations about the existence of nuclear waste dumps,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThe nuclear legacy stretches into the far future; it poses a risk to environments and human health for periods which extend well beyond our comprehension. Radioactive waste is the achilles heel of the industry,\u201d says Blowers.</p> <p>The US has come closest with a single deep repository. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico is a 655-metre deep complex for the disposal of \u201ctransuranic\u201d waste, or long-lived intermediate level waste, mostly deriving from military bomb-making.</p> <p>By law, however, all high-level US nuclear waste must go to Yucca Mountain in Nevada, which since 1987 has been the designated deep geological repository about 90 miles north-west of Las Vegas.</p> <p>But the site has been met with continued legal, regulatory and constitutional challenges, becoming a political yo-yo since it was identified as a <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/aaac7e45c5604fb1bba8a01fe64ddf3a\">potentially suitable</a> repository. It is fiercely opposed by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Shoshone\">Western Shoshone</a> peoples, Nevada state and others.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73b50e5e4343cacf6e27de4b17819d619c2f3bbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73b50e5e4343cacf6e27de4b17819d619c2f3bbe/18_129_1982_1190/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The tunnel at the Yucca Mountain Project in Nevada\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The tunnel at the Yucca Mountain Project in Nevada</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura Rauch/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A massive tunnel was excavated in Yucca Mountain but was never licensed and the site is now largely abandoned \u2013 to the frustration of the federal government and the nuclear industry, which has raised <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2018/11/f58/DOE-OIG-19-08_0.pdf\">more than $41bn</a> (\u00a334bn) from a levy on consumer bills to pay for the repository and which must pay for heavy security at their temporary nuclear waste storage sites.</p> <p>\u201cWe need a high-level repository. We are holding waste now at about 121 sites across the US,\u201d says Baker Elmore, director of federal programs at the Nuclear Energy Institute.</p> <p>\u201cThis costs the taxpayer $800m a year. We have 97 [nuclear] plants operating and the amount of waste is only going to grow. We are not allowing the science to play out here. There is $41bn in the government\u2019s nuclear waste fund, and Yucca Mountain is scientifically sound. We want a decision. We are going to need more than one repository.\u201d</p> <p>He is supported by the US energy secretary, Rick Perry. \u201cWe have a moral and national security obligation to come up with a long-term solution, finding the safest repositories available \u2026 we can no longer kick the can down the road,\u201d he said at a Senate hearing in June 2017.</p> <h2><strong>Painfully slow</strong></h2> <p>Political and community opposition to plans has made progress painfully slow in most countries. In the UK, the government has offered communities money, but has been unable to persuade any local authority to host a permanent deep repository. Massive protests in <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/10/20/gen.france.nuclear/index.html\">France</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/germany-to-dump-nuclear-waste-for-good-but-where/a-19380548\">Germany</a> helped fuel the political rise of the Green party and have indefinitely delayed or stopped work on proposed repositories.</p> <p>Only Finland is close to completing a deep repository for high-level waste. In May, work started on an \u201cencapsulation\u201d plant where waste will be packed inside copper canisters that will be transferred into 400- to 450-metre deep underground tunnels. But <a href=\"https://www.stralsakerhetsmyndigheten.se/publikationer/rapporter/avfall--transport--fysiskt-skydd/2012/201217/\">doubt has been cast on the long-term safety of the canisters</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/15/sellafield-thorp-reprocessing-uranium-hazard-cleanup\">Sellafield, former star of the nuclear age, scrubs up for a different future</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe problem is intractable,\u201d says Paul Dorfman, founder of the <a href=\"https://www.nuclearconsult.com/\">Nuclear Consulting Group</a>, made up of about 120 international academics and independent experts in the fields of radiation waste, nuclear policy and environmental risk.</p> <p>\u201cThe bitter reality is that there is no scientifically proven way of disposing of the existential problem of high- and intermediate-level waste. Some countries have built repositories, some plan them.</p> <p>\u201cBut given the huge technical uncertainties, if disposal does go ahead and anything goes wrong underground in the next millennia, then future generations risk profound widespread pollution.\u201d</p> <p>Many people now doubt that a satisfactory final repository will ever be found.</p> <p>\u201cManaging the nuclear legacy is not just a technical issue but a social one,\u201d says Blowers.</p> <p>\u201cThe truth is that whatever efforts are made to bury and forget it, it will not go away. For the foreseeable future, the future is the safe and secure storage that is already in situ [at nuclear plants].

At 11.30am, the crew of oil workers used a wire cable to lower an 80cm-long, 20cm-wide, 64kg canister \u2014 filled with steel rather than radioactive waste \u2014 down a previously drilled borehole. Then, using a tool called a \u201ctractor\u201d invented by the industry to reach horizontally into mile-deep oil reservoirs, they pushed it 120 metres farther away from the borehole through the rock. Five hours later, the crew used the tractor to relocate and collect the canister, attach it to the cable and pull it back to the surface \u2013 to the cheers of the workers. Until then, few people in the nuclear industry had believed this could be done. By avoiding the need to excavate large, expensive tunnels to store waste below ground, the Deep Isolation team believes it has found a solution to one of the world\u2019s most intractable environmental problems \u2013 how to permanently dispose of and potentially retrieve the hundreds of thousands of tonnes of nuclear waste currently being stored at nuclear power plants and research and military stations around the world. \u201cWe showed it could be done,\u201d Elizabeth Muller says. \u201cHorizontal, directional drilling has come a long way recently. This is now an off-the-shelf technology. Using larger canisters, we think about 300 boreholes with tunnels up to two miles long would be able to take much of the US\u2019s high-level nuclear waste. We think we can reduce by two-thirds the cost of permanent storage.\u201d \u201cWe are using a technique that\u2019s been made cheap over the last 20 years,\u201d says Richard Muller, who has worked in the shale gas industry. \u201cWe realised we could put together the oil and nuclear technologies. One offered the solution to the other. These capsules can be lowered deep down, far deeper than anyone has proposed, and stored underneath a billion tonnes of rock so none of the radiation gets out.\u201d Great stockpiles The dilemma of how to manage nuclear waste \u2013 radioactive materials routinely produced in large quantities at every stage of nuclear power production, from uranium mining and enrichment to reactor operation and the reprocessing of spent fuel \u2013 has taxed the industry, academics and governments for decades. Along with accidents, it has been a major reason for continuing public opposition to the industry\u2019s further expansion despite substantial interest in nuclear\u2019s status as a low-carbon power source that can help mitigate climate change. In 80-odd years of nuclear power, in which more than 450 commercial reactors, many experimental stations and tens of thousands of nuclear warheads have been built, great stockpiles of different levels of waste have accumulated. Depending on how countries classify waste, only about 0.2\u20133% by volume is high-level waste, according to the World Nuclear Association (WNA), a London-based industry group that promotes nuclear power. Mostly derived from civil reactor fuel, this is some of the most dangerous material known on Earth, remaining radioactive for tens of thousands of years. It requires cooling and shielding indefinitely and contains 95% of the radioactivity related to nuclear power generation. A further 7% or so by volume, known as intermediate waste, is made up of things such as reactor components and graphite from reactor cores. This is also highly dangerous, but it can be stored in special canisters because it does not generate much heat. The rest is made up of vast quantities of what is called low-level and very low-level waste. This comprises scrap metal, paper, plastics, building materials and everything else radioactive involved in the operation and dismantling of nuclear facilities. The consensus is that about 22,000 cubic metres of solid high-level waste has accumulated in temporary storage but not been disposed of (moved to permanent storage) in 14 western countries, along with unknown amounts in China, Russia and at military stations. A further 460,000 cubic metres of intermediate waste is being stored, and about 3.5m cubic metres of low-level waste. About 34,000 cubic metres of new high-level and intermediate waste is generated each year by operating civil reactors, says the WNA. The US, with 59 nuclear power plants comprising 97 working civil reactors, each generating at least several tonnes of high-level waste per year, has about 90,000 tonnes of high-level waste awaiting permanent disposal, according to the US Government Accountability Office. Although it is impossible to come up with a global total because of differences in how quantities are measured and reported, and with some inventories kept secret, other countries harbour significant amounts of waste as well. Many ideas In the early days of nuclear power, waste of any sort was barely considered. British, American and Russian authorities, among others, dumped nuclear waste \u2013 including more than 150,000 tonnes of low-level waste \u2013 at sea or in rivers. Since then, billions have been spent trying to identify how best to reduce the amount produced and then store it for what may be eternity. Many ideas have been investigated, but most have been rejected as impractical, too expensive or ecologically unacceptable. They include: shooting it into space; isolating it in synthetic rock; burying it in ice sheets; dumping it on the world\u2019s most isolated islands; and dropping it to the bottom of the world\u2019s deepest oceanic trenches. Vertical boreholes up to 5,000 metres deep have also been proposed, and this option is said by some scientists to be promising. But there have been doubts, because it is likely to be nearly impossible to retrieve waste from vertical boreholes. Two scientific developments excite nuclear scientists. One is to build a new generation of advanced fast neutron reactors, which would use the high-level waste as fuel. This slowly emerging \u201cGeneration IV\u201d nuclear power programme is billed by the industry as safer and more efficient. But even though such reactors can reduce the degree of hazard the waste poses, they do not solve the issue entirely. \u201cThese new reactors will still need a waste repository, likely as large as a repository for the waste produced by the current crop of conventional reactors,\u201d says Allison MacFarlane, director of the Institute for International Science and Technical Policy at the George Washington University and chair of the US nuclear regulatory commission in 2012\u201314. The other technology that could reduce waste, known as transmutation, aims to reduce radiotoxicity by using lasers to change the composition of dangerous waste. It has been investigated for decades in the UK, US, Sweden and elsewhere but without great success. But the idea was boosted in December 2018 by French Nobel prize\u2013winning physicist G\u00e9rard Mourou, who, in his acceptance lecture, said laser beams millions of times brighter than the surface of the sun in bursts that last a millionth of a billionth of a second had the potential to neutralise nuclear waste, reducing its half-life to a few years and its radioactivity to very little. \u201cNuclear energy may be the best candidate for the future, but we are still left with a lot of dangerous junk. The idea is to transmute this nuclear waste into new forms of atoms which don\u2019t have the problem of radioactivity. What you have to do is to change the makeup of the nucleus,\u201d he said in the lecture. But Mourou accepted that it might take decades before this \u201cextreme light\u201d solution could be deployed to destroy nuclear waste on an industrial scale. \u2018No reliable method\u2019 After decades of civil nuclear power and billions spent researching different geological sites and ways to best dispose of the waste, the problems are both technical and political, and the consensus of governments and industry is that deep burial is the best solution \u2013 at least for the moment. Yet, so far, no country has managed to build a deep repository for high-level waste. \u201cAlthough almost every nuclear country has, in principle, plans for the eventual burial of the most radioactive waste, only a handful have made any progress and nowhere in the world is there operating an authorised site for the deep geological disposal of the highest level radioactive waste,\u201d says Andrew Blowers, author of The Legacy of Nuclear Power and a former member of the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, set up to advise the British government on how and where to store nuclear waste. \u201cCurrently no options have been able to demonstrate that waste will remain isolated from the environment over the tens to hundreds of thousands of years. There is no reliable method to warn future generations about the existence of nuclear waste dumps,\u201d he says. \u201cThe nuclear legacy stretches into the far future; it poses a risk to environments and human health for periods which extend well beyond our comprehension. Radioactive waste is the achilles heel of the industry,\u201d says Blowers. The US has come closest with a single deep repository. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico is a 655-metre deep complex for the disposal of \u201ctransuranic\u201d waste, or long-lived intermediate level waste, mostly deriving from military bomb-making. By law, however, all high-level US nuclear waste must go to Yucca Mountain in Nevada, which since 1987 has been the designated deep geological repository about 90 miles north-west of Las Vegas. But the site has been met with continued legal, regulatory and constitutional challenges, becoming a political yo-yo since it was identified as a potentially suitable repository. It is fiercely opposed by the Western Shoshone peoples, Nevada state and others. A massive tunnel was excavated in Yucca Mountain but was never licensed and the site is now largely abandoned \u2013 to the frustration of the federal government and the nuclear industry, which has raised more than $41bn (\u00a334bn) from a levy on consumer bills to pay for the repository and which must pay for heavy security at their temporary nuclear waste storage sites. \u201cWe need a high-level repository. We are holding waste now at about 121 sites across the US,\u201d says Baker Elmore, director of federal programs at the Nuclear Energy Institute. \u201cThis costs the taxpayer $800m a year. We have 97 [nuclear] plants operating and the amount of waste is only going to grow. We are not allowing the science to play out here. There is $41bn in the government\u2019s nuclear waste fund, and Yucca Mountain is scientifically sound. We want a decision. We are going to need more than one repository.\u201d He is supported by the US energy secretary, Rick Perry. \u201cWe have a moral and national security obligation to come up with a long-term solution, finding the safest repositories available \u2026 we can no longer kick the can down the road,\u201d he said at a Senate hearing in June 2017. Painfully slow Political and community opposition to plans has made progress painfully slow in most countries. In the UK, the government has offered communities money, but has been unable to persuade any local authority to host a permanent deep repository. Massive protests in France and Germany helped fuel the political rise of the Green party and have indefinitely delayed or stopped work on proposed repositories. Only Finland is close to completing a deep repository for high-level waste. In May, work started on an \u201cencapsulation\u201d plant where waste will be packed inside copper canisters that will be transferred into 400- to 450-metre deep underground tunnels. But doubt has been cast on the long-term safety of the canisters. \u201cThe problem is intractable,\u201d says Paul Dorfman, founder of the Nuclear Consulting Group, made up of about 120 international academics and independent experts in the fields of radiation waste, nuclear policy and environmental risk. \u201cThe bitter reality is that there is no scientifically proven way of disposing of the existential problem of high- and intermediate-level waste. Some countries have built repositories, some plan them. \u201cBut given the huge technical uncertainties, if disposal does go ahead and anything goes wrong underground in the next millennia, then future generations risk profound widespread pollution.\u201d Many people now doubt that a satisfactory final repository will ever be found. \u201cManaging the nuclear legacy is not just a technical issue but a social one,\u201d says Blowers. \u201cThe truth is that whatever efforts are made to bury and forget it, it will not go away. For the foreseeable future, the future is the safe and secure storage that is already in situ [at nuclear plants]. In the longer term, better options may materialise. \u201cGiven the timescales involved, there is no need to hurry. Society can and should take its time dealing with its nuclear legacy.\u201d \u2022 This article originally appeared on Ensia",

The paper says policymakers have made a \u201ccatastrophic mistake\u201d by underestimating the risks posed by environmental breakdown and the potential benefits of switching to a different economic approach that focuses on building abundance rather than running down resources. \u201cA new model is needed to rapidly create societies that are more sustainable, just and prepared: bringing human activity to within environmentally sustainable limits while narrowing inequality, improving quality of life, and becoming better prepared for the accelerating consequences of environmental breakdown,\u201d says the discussion document by the Institute for Public Policy Research. The paper is a follow-up to a widely circulated IPPR study, published in February, that said a gathering storm of human-caused threats to climate, nature and economy posed a danger of systemic crash comparable to the 2008 financial crisis. To avoid this, the document says there is an urgent need for parliament to pass a \u201cSustainable Economy Act\u201d that would mandate statutory targets to rapidly reduce the effects of declining soil fertility, air quality, pollinator numbers, fish stocks, wildlife diversity and other benchmarks of a healthy environment. The move would effectively place a full sustainability constraint on all UK economic activity, allowing natural abundance to recover for the common good instead of running it down to the detriment of all but a super-wealthy minority. The model would be the Climate Change Act 2008, which put Britain at the forefront of efforts to ensure economic activity was aligned with goals to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that cause global heating. A sustainable economy legislation would go further by widening the range of targets and standards, including those relating to trade to ensure that imported goods were not only safe for human consumption in the UK, but also had a minimum environmental impact in the country of production. This would represent a major change from the current situation in which the UK is making some progress in reducing domestic emissions even as it continues to subsidise and support fossil fuel industries overseas. It would also be markedly more ambitious than the government\u2019s plans for a new Environment Act because the IPPR \u2013 which is considered an influence on Labour policy \u2013 also proposes establishing a committee to regularly update goals in line with advances in scientific knowledge and creating a powerful watchdog body that would enforce the targets. Environmental groups worry that the government is planning a weak post-Brexit replacement for the EU\u2019s strong monitoring regulations on water quality, wildlife and air pollution. The IPPR said a sustainability act would also require measures to reduce excessive consumption, which was worsening inequality and making it harder to improve living standards. This could include changes to advertising standards, wider introduction of carbon pricing and investment in public services that encourage more sustainable, fulfilling lifestyles. It would also encourage financial markets to include environment risks in asset valuations so that unsustainable investments become prohibitively expensive. Central banks would be asked to take a more prominent role in managing the financial risks from extreme weather and other symptoms of environmental breakdown. A new public investment bank and a network of regional development banks could fund the transition to a carbon-free economy, which would create jobs similar to the plans outlined in the \u201cgreen new deals\u201d that have been called for in the US and elsewhere. The authors of the IPPR paper say much of this will already be necessary as a result of the UK\u2019s recent commitment to go carbon neutral by 2050. But their proposal would go further to ensure other natural life support systems are not sacrificed in the race to salvage the climate. \u201cWe are suggesting placing a boundary on our economy to ensure we live within our environmental means,\u201d said Laurie Laybourn-Langton, the lead author of the report. \u201cIt is not just about the climate. Environmental breakdown might be the most complex, dangerous, difficult problem that we\u2019ve ever faced. By its very nature, it requires ambitious, large-scale legislation.\u201d He acknowledges that the current trend in global politics is in the opposite direction, towards a nationalist race to run-down what is left of the world\u2019s resources, but remains optimistic about the positive potential of a new sustainability law, particularly compared to the alternative. \u201cFor those who want to listen to suggestions for solutions, this is roadmap,\u201d Laybourn-Langton says. \u201cAnd we think that a country doing this can unlock great benefits for society in terms of health, quality of life and a sense of a shared abundance \u2026 The actions needed to realise this will be hard, but what will be harder will be for my generation and those below me to try to live with the current set of cascading problems. Running down what we have leads to a horrendous, suicidal, self defeating spiral. A good life is where we benefit from a strong commons and not destroy those common resources.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Barack Obama warned in April about the dangers of progressives creating a \u201ccircular firing squad\u201d. Nine Democratic presidential candidates did form such a squad at the second Detroit debate on Wednesday night. The problem for current frontrunner Joe Biden \u2013 touted by many moderates as the man to take on Donald Trump in 2020 \u2013 was that he was at the centre. California senator Kamala Harris opened fire at him over healthcare. Former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro attacked him on immigration, while New York mayor Bill de Blasio did so over deportations. New Jersey senator Cory Booker took a shot over criminal justice. Washington governor Jay Inslee said his climate change plan lacks urgency. New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand fired old prejudices about working women back at him. Harris blasted him again on race. At the end of it all, Biden was still standing. For sure, there was blood on the carpet and he could hardly pretend to casually brush dirt off his shoulder. But the former US vice-president\u2019s supporters will be consoled that he survived the onslaught and avoided another flop like the first debates in Miami that could have seen support and donor money drain away. It made for a very different debate from night one in Detroit when the ideological split in the Democratic party was put on full display among 10 other candidates. That was an age-old philosophical argument about pragmatism versus daring to dream. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders formed a progressive double act to parry assaults from the centre. On Wednesday, however, the tables were turned as the moderate Biden had a target painted on his back and the left took aim. Only he was all alone. But after his lacklustre performance in the first debate, the 76-year-old was better prepared, more engaged and spoke longer than his rivals, even getting in the old Bidenism \u201ca bunch of malarkey\u201d, even if he did fade somewhat as time went on. As if anticipating fight night as hyped by CNN, Biden, like an ageing boxer, told Harris, \u201cGo easy on me, kid,\u201d when they first took the stage and shook hands, she smiling and placing a hand on his right arm. She later brushed off the comment.

Next up was immigration. Castro defended his plan to decriminalise unauthorised border crossings. Biden, who disagrees, said, \u201cI never heard him talk about any of this,\u201d when Castro was a member of Obama\u2019s cabinet.

Les, a sheep farmer, was taking his ease in the sunshine as the Brexit party\u2019s bus rolled through Brecon. \u201cThey\u2019re the sort that are here today, gone tomorrow,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile the huge cost of a no-deal Brexit has been laid bare after Johnson\u2019s government announced an extra \u00a32.1bn for measure including stockpiling of medicines, an extra 500 border officials and a public awareness campaign about disruption. Labour has attacked it as an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/31/labour-attacks-appalling-waste-as-johnson-adds-2bn-no-deal-brexit-fund\">\u201cappalling waste of tax-payers\u2019 cash\u201d</a> \u2013 John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThis government could have ruled out no deal, and spent these billions on our schools and hospitals.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Biden put on the ropes \u2013 </strong>Joe Biden had to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/01/democratic-debate-brawl-fight-joe-biden\">fend off multiple attacks</a> at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/01/who-won-the-democrats-debate-our-panelists-verdict\">second Democratic presidential debate</a> in Detroit overnight, as the party\u2019s other contenders to take on Donald Trump in 2020 jockeyed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/31/joe-biden-kamala-harris-and-other-2020-candidates-prepare-for-debate-rematch\">position themselves as a clear alternative to the current frontrunner</a>.

Among <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/31/democratic-debate-joe-biden-kamala-harris-detroit\">key moments</a>, Biden criticised Harris\u2019 healthcare plan as too costly and taking too long to implement, but Harris shot back that Biden\u2019s own healthcare proposal would leave behind roughly 10 million Americans. Biden accused Booker of engaging in controversial \u201cstop and frisk\u201d policies as mayor of Newark, but Booker hit back: \u201cYou\u2019re dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don\u2019t even know the flavour.\u201d The unruly and often contentious debate produced no clear winner, as some onstage cautioned against losing sight of the party\u2019s real target: Trump. Biden bungled his closing line by asking viewers to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/31/joe-30330-biden-debate-gaffe-internet-reaction\">Go to Joe 3-0-3-3-0 and help me in this fight</a>\u201d \u2013 an apparent mangling of his website and a text line for supporters.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Al-Qaida heir\u2019 reported killed \u2013 </strong>Osama bin Laden\u2019s son Hamza, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/01/who-is-hamza-bin-laden-heir-who-sought-to-revive-al-qaida\">trying to lead an al-Qaida resurgence</a>, is believed dead.

In March of this year Saudi Arabia revoked his citizenship after the US offered a $1m (\u00a3800,000) reward for help locating him as part of its \u201crewards for justice\u201d programme.

It says dozens of cases were related directly to allegations of antisemitism within the Labour party. More than a third of incidents involved social media and two-thirds took place in Greater London and Greater Manchester, home to the two largest Jewish populations in the UK. David Delew, the trust\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe problem is spreading across the country and online.

The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) says BlackRock has squandered value by betting on oil companies that were falling in value and by missing out on growth in clean energy investments. Its multibillion-dollar investments in the world\u2019s largest oil companies \u2013 including ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and BP\u2013 were responsible for the bulk of its losses. BlackRock says its fossil fuel investments come about through investment indices that are controlled by third parties, not itself, but the IEEFA has called on BlackRock to propose its own low-emissions index benchmark for the passive funds.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Should I wash this? \u2013 </strong>Extending the life of your wardrobe is good for the planet and your finances.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Tories face losing seat to Lib Dems Hello again \u2013 Warren Murray here, time to wake up and smell the copy (as in, you know, news copy). The Brecon and Radnorshire byelection takes place today with the Conservatives battling to prevent their Commons majority being whittled down to a single seat. Despite being removed by a recall petition, over a conviction for diddling parliamentary expenses, the Tories\u2019 Chris Davies is standing again and will hope to retain the seat. If, as predicted, Davies is defeated by the Liberal Democrats\u2019 Jane Dodds, Boris Johnson\u2019s first major test as prime minister will result in his working majority in the Commons being reduced to one. Steven Morris has taken the temperature in this Welsh constituency where agriculture has been at the centre of the campaign, with warnings of heartache for sheep farmers and even civil unrest if there is a no-deal Brexit. Les, a sheep farmer, was taking his ease in the sunshine as the Brexit party\u2019s bus rolled through Brecon. \u201cThey\u2019re the sort that are here today, gone tomorrow,\u201d he said. Meanwhile the huge cost of a no-deal Brexit has been laid bare after Johnson\u2019s government announced an extra \u00a32.1bn for measure including stockpiling of medicines, an extra 500 border officials and a public awareness campaign about disruption. Labour has attacked it as an \u201cappalling waste of tax-payers\u2019 cash\u201d \u2013 John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThis government could have ruled out no deal, and spent these billions on our schools and hospitals.\u201d * * * Biden put on the ropes \u2013 Joe Biden had to fend off multiple attacks at the second Democratic presidential debate in Detroit overnight, as the party\u2019s other contenders to take on Donald Trump in 2020 jockeyed to position themselves as a clear alternative to the current frontrunner. California senator Kamala Harris opened fire at Barack Obama\u2019s vice-president over health care and race; former housing secretary Julian Castro attacked him on immigration; while New York mayor Bill de Blasio did so over deportations. New Jersey senator Cory Booker took a shot over criminal justice, Washington governor Jay Inslee said Biden\u2019s climate change plan lacked urgency. Kirsten Gillibrand fired old prejudices about working women at him. The two nights in Detroit have left Democrats with more questions than answers, contemplating a field fragmented across age, gender, race and policy. Among key moments, Biden criticised Harris\u2019 healthcare plan as too costly and taking too long to implement, but Harris shot back that Biden\u2019s own healthcare proposal would leave behind roughly 10 million Americans. Biden accused Booker of engaging in controversial \u201cstop and frisk\u201d policies as mayor of Newark, but Booker hit back: \u201cYou\u2019re dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don\u2019t even know the flavour.\u201d The unruly and often contentious debate produced no clear winner, as some onstage cautioned against losing sight of the party\u2019s real target: Trump. Biden bungled his closing line by asking viewers to \u201cGo to Joe 3-0-3-3-0 and help me in this fight\u201d \u2013 an apparent mangling of his website and a text line for supporters. * * * \u2018Al-Qaida heir\u2019 reported killed \u2013 Osama bin Laden\u2019s son Hamza, who was trying to lead an al-Qaida resurgence, is believed dead. Reports suggested the US had a hand in the death of the roughly 30-year-old, sometime in the last two years, but Donald Trump declined to comment. In March of this year Saudi Arabia revoked his citizenship after the US offered a $1m (\u00a3800,000) reward for help locating him as part of its \u201crewards for justice\u201d programme. He was thought to have been based in Pakistan\u2019s tribal areas, along the border with Afghanistan, from where he sought to inspire attacks on the west and its Middle Eastern allies after al-Qaida\u2019s decline and eclipse by Islamic State. * * * \u2018Tide of hate\u2019 \u2013 There were 892 reported antisemitic incidents between January and June in the UK, a 10% increase on the same period of 2018 and the third year in a row that reports have gone up, according to Jewish charity the Community Security Trust. It says dozens of cases were related directly to allegations of antisemitism within the Labour party. More than a third of incidents involved social media and two-thirds took place in Greater London and Greater Manchester, home to the two largest Jewish populations in the UK. David Delew, the trust\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe problem is spreading across the country and online. It will take people of all communities and backgrounds standing together to turn this tide of hate around.\u201d * * * Thursday catch-up \u2013 The day\u2019s just got that kind of feel about it \u2026 &gt; The head of China\u2019s military in Hong Kong has made an alarming intervention, warning unrest should not be tolerated. The PLA released a video with an anti-riot soldier shouting in Cantonese: \u201cAll consequences are at your own risk.\u201d &gt; Ronald Reagan was recorded calling African diplomats \u201cmonkeys\u201d in a phone call to then-president Richard Nixon in 1971. &gt; Suspected sex offenders and others accused of serious crimes should be kept anonymous until charged if their reputation is at stake, the new justice secretary, Robert Buckland QC, has said. &gt; The US has imposed sanctions on Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who seemed to take it in good humour: \u201cIt has no effect on me or my family, as I have no property or interests outside of Iran. Thank you for considering me such a huge threat to your agenda.\u201d &gt; Severn View services on the M48 in Gloucestershire has been rated the worst motorway service station in England. Norton Canes (Roadchef) services on the M6 toll road in Staffordshire was rated the best by Transport Focus. * * * Black hole \u2013 BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest investor, has lost an estimated $90bn over the last decade by ignoring the financial risk of investing in fossil fuel companies, according to economic experts. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) says BlackRock has squandered value by betting on oil companies that were falling in value and by missing out on growth in clean energy investments. Its multibillion-dollar investments in the world\u2019s largest oil companies \u2013 including ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and BP\u2013 were responsible for the bulk of its losses. BlackRock says its fossil fuel investments come about through investment indices that are controlled by third parties, not itself, but the IEEFA has called on BlackRock to propose its own low-emissions index benchmark for the passive funds. * * * Should I wash this? \u2013 Extending the life of your wardrobe is good for the planet and your finances. Sirin Kale has gathered experts tips on how to make your outfits last as long as possible. There\u2019s not washing an item unless it really needs it: some stains dab out, and apparently lukewarm water and vodka in a spray bottle will get rid of smells. (One for yourself while you\u2019re at it?) Other advice: guard against moths using cedarwood, support your local tailor and cobbler, and/or learn to mend things yourself. And the Briefing\u2019s favourite, this bit of purchasing advice: \u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at a piece of clothing, turn it inside out and pull at every piece of string you find. If it starts to unravel \u2013 don\u2019t buy it.\u201d Then perhaps beat a tactical retreat out of the shop \u2026 Today in Focus podcast: Understanding Dominic Cummings James Graham, screenwriter of the TV drama Brexit: The Uncivil War, talks about Dominic Cummings, the former Vote Leave director now at the heart of Boris Johnson\u2019s strategy team. And: Daniel Trilling on how the media covers refugees. Lunchtime read: Migrants and the media \u201cThe professional who moves to a neighbouring city for work is not usually described as a migrant, and neither is the wealthy businessman who acquires new passports as easily as he moves his money around the world,\u201d writes Daniel Trilling today. \u201cIt is most often applied to those people who fall foul of border control at the frontiers of the rich world, whether that\u2019s in Europe, the US, Australia, South Africa or elsewhere. \u201cThat\u2019s because the terms that surround migration are inextricably bound up with power, as is the way in which our media organisations choose to disseminate them. Instead, it implies an endless present: they are migrants, they move, it\u2019s what they do. It\u2019s a form of description that, until 2015, I might have expected to see more often in nature documentaries, applied to animals rather than human beings.\u201d Sport Joe Root has been left frustrated at discovering pre-match player handshakes are listed among the events before today\u2019s Ashes opener, despite not being consulted. Australia\u2019s captain, Tim Paine, has dismissed suggestions that Edgbaston could have a detrimental effect on his players by claiming it would not make his top 15 most intimidating grounds. Joe Root\u2019s return to the No 3 spot for the first Test has caused a fuss but it is just another part of the this enduring series\u2019 mythology, writes Barney Ronay. Two 20-year-olds, Mady Villiers and Sophie Ecclestone, saved England\u2019s blushes with fine bowling displays in the final match of the Women\u2019s Ashes, a T20 won by 17 runs. Mike Brown is ready to sweat for a place in England\u2019s Rugby World Cup squad after the full-back was called up by Eddie Jones for heat training in Italy.

Taking the GR11 upstream from the park\u2019s entrance, a three-hour hike takes you past increasingly dramatic falls. Another kilometre beyond the Cola is the beautifully isolated G\u00f3riz mountain refuge hut, where you can enjoy some of Europe\u2019s most unpolluted night skies. The backdrop is the brooding grandeur of <a href=\"https://www.ordesa.net/\" title=\"\">Monte Perdido</a> (Lost Mountain) looking down from its 3,300-metre peak, and often you can see giant lammergeiers (also called bearded vultures) circling.

We sampled local food and wine as we wandered ever closer to the base of the dramatic falls \u2013 two tiers and twin streams dropping 130 metres off the valley wall \u2013 and found a good viewpoint to spread our blanket on the grass, and wait. There were river pools for kids to play in and lots of pop-up bars for refreshments.

When we revisited the next day, it was transformed: a bright, sunny afternoon had framed the waterfall with blue sky and green trees and brought many people out to enjoy the show from the wooden platform and seating. <br><strong>Liz Young</strong></p> \n<h2>Svartifoss, Iceland</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"39dab3dad342ba0e1e6ea6a8dba059e2cf6f6a89\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39dab3dad342ba0e1e6ea6a8dba059e2cf6f6a89/0_209_5100_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Waterfall in rolling hills in remote landscape.

Although this is not the biggest of the Icelandic \u201cfosses\u201d, the magic of the place was palpable. Magnificent octagonal basalt columns that surround Svatrifoss add something special. In the dying light of winter sun, the icy glow of falling glacier water was radiating extraordinary power. The hike to Svartifoss from the visitor centre in Skaftafell takes about 45 minutes each way.

It can be reached by walking from the historic town of New Lanark via a well-maintained woodland pathway alongside the river where badgers and otters make their home. The falls have impressed and inspired poets and writers for centuries, including Wordsworth, Coleridge, and JMW Turner. The feeling of being miles from anywhere while being midway between Scotland\u2019s major cities is sensational.

A vertical shaft of icy melt water drops 250 metres through a limestone cave. Over the centuries the water has carved three limestone arcs across the main chamber at the end of a dizzyingly steep gorge. The curved nature of the erosion and abundance of greenery give the impression of an imagined landscape, a sublime rendering of the natural world. The Baatara Gorge can be accessed by trail from the village of Mgharet al-Ghaouaghir and offers an insight into the incredible geology of this tiny, troubled country.<br><strong>Gareth Roberts</strong></p> \n<h2>Gocta Waterfall, Peru</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7456ab276e0f28e7c0361e47c294c2a33501e1ba\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7456ab276e0f28e7c0361e47c294c2a33501e1ba/0_148_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourist on hiking trail looking at Gocta waterfall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>It is well worth the trek to get to this astonishing waterfall. In cloud forest at the edge of the Amazon, in the Chachapoyas region, it is the most beautiful waterfall I\u2019ve ever seen. Locals will tell you it\u2019s the third-highest waterfall in the world (at 771 metres) although experts dispute this because it falls in two drops and it\u2019s rated by the World Waterfall Database as 16th-highest in the world. Whatever its standing, it\u2019s worth the 6km trek, which takes about four hours. The route is generally well-signposted, if a little rugged in parts. It\u2019s also free, unless you want to take up the option of hiring a horse and a guide. <br><strong>Tim Evans</strong></p> \n<h2>Mocon\u00e1 Falls, Misiones, Argentina</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"d5776714acf09928c8d87cd15904d6b4afeb014a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5776714acf09928c8d87cd15904d6b4afeb014a/0_0_3819_2292/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Misiones, Mocona Falls\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>These falls on the Uruguay River dividing Brazil and Argentina are often overlooked by travellers seeking the undoubted majesty of its big brother, Iguazu, 300km away. We visited <a href=\"https://www.welcomeargentina.com/elsoberbio/river_that_swallows_everything.html\" title=\"\">Mocon\u00e1 Falls</a> when staying at <a href=\"https://www.donenriquelodge.com/\" title=\"\">Don Enrique Lodge</a>, about 50km from the falls, after a tip from our hosts. A 4WD taxi down miles of dirt tracks followed by an hour\u2019s rib-boat trip took us to the 3km-long falls. Uniquely, the falls run the length of the river and although only about 20 metres high, they are breathtaking. Mocon\u00e1 translates in the Guarani language as \u201cto swallow everything\u201d, an entirely justified description. Not easy to reach but an unforgettable experience. Also known as the Yucum\u00e3 Falls, this incredible sight can also be viewed from the Brazilian side. <br><strong>Paul Hammond</strong></p> \n<h2>Snoqualmie, Washington State, US</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f0d8c77379857c1c3caec2c2cdf9de5d27f36042\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0d8c77379857c1c3caec2c2cdf9de5d27f36042/0_356_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Snoqualmie Falls in Washington State on a cloudy day\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>This is the 82-metre waterfall (about 30 metres taller than Niagara Falls) made famous internationally in the 1990s TV series Twin Peaks. One of the great things, beyond the sheer force of its visual splendour, is that Snoqualmie is accessible by public bus services from downtown Seattle (30 miles) for a few dollars, so you don\u2019t need a hire car to get there. It\u2019s less than a mile woodland hike to the base of the falls from the top (and there are other hikes there too).<br><strong>David Chalton</strong></p> \n<h2>Sunwapta Falls, Jasper national park, Canada</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1c6aed377c217fbf171d31cb64894b970af35077\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c6aed377c217fbf171d31cb64894b970af35077/0_0_7261_4846/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sunwapta Falls, Symmetrical view of landscape with waterfall, forest and mountains\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>This is a perfect stopover when driving on the Icefields Parkway.

The cascading water, partly fed by the Athabasca Glacier, is immensely powerful in spring and early summer when meltwater volumes are at peak. Walk to the centre of the high wooden footbridge that spans the gorge to appreciate the picture-perfect sight of the towering mountains in the background, and the picturesque island of trees just before the falls. Rushing water curves dramatically around both sides of the island. Sunwapta means \u201cturbulent river\u201d in the Stoney First Nation people\u2019s language. A mile\u2019s hike leads you through forest to the Lower Falls.

The thundering noise, mist and setting are overwhelming. The best way to experience the falls is by hire car from Luanda, a six-hour drive on fairly rudimentary roads through varied landscapes. Alternatively, travel by train to the regional capital, Malanje, and then drive north for an hour via Lombe and Calandula. Stay at the charming <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Hotel-Resort/Pousada-Calandula-124088828231253/\" title=\"\">Pousada Calandula</a> (doubles from about \u00a3150).

Four amazingly clear pools stretch a kilometre from a cerulean-blue pool fed by melting ice from the slopes of nearby Mount Kenya, past a couple of smaller, steeper pools with myriad jumping opportunities for adrenalin junkies, ending with the largest fall and best swimming spot.

Hiring a local guide costs between \u00a38 and \u00a316 to take you on a trek along the luscious green terraces carving along mountains before a 30-minute descent to the falls. Here, the water plummets 30 metres to a huge, refreshing pool to swim in and wash off the sweat from the hike. Tappiya\u2019s beauty isn\u2019t solely in the falls (stunning as they are), but the journey to get there: to the remote village, the phenomenal terraces, and the tricky descent.<br><strong>Laurence Britton</strong></p> \n<h2>Nachi, Japan</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"44bea4c1d8cee2c88ce7442f02db7849f054bfa0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44bea4c1d8cee2c88ce7442f02db7849f054bfa0/894_0_5106_3064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nachi no Taki waterfall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jan/23/japan-pilgrimage-trails-kumano-wakayama-walking-kii-peninsula\" title=\"\">Kumano Kodo pilgrim trail</a> is actually a collection of routes 100km or so south of Osaka.

      "bodyText": "Winning tip: Cola de Caballo, Pyrenees, Spain The aptly named Cola de Caballo (horsetail) cascade is the most spectacular of the many along the Arazas River in the Spanish Pyrenean Ordesa national park. Taking the GR11 upstream from the park\u2019s entrance, a three-hour hike takes you past increasingly dramatic falls. Another kilometre beyond the Cola is the beautifully isolated G\u00f3riz mountain refuge hut, where you can enjoy some of Europe\u2019s most unpolluted night skies. The backdrop is the brooding grandeur of Monte Perdido (Lost Mountain) looking down from its 3,300-metre peak, and often you can see giant lammergeiers (also called bearded vultures) circling. To the north, across the French border is Gavarnie, another magnificent waterfall. Alan Aquafraggia Falls, Lombardy, Italy A couple of weeks ago we went to the Notte delle Cascate festival which sprawls around the foot of the Acquafraggia Falls in the Val Bregaglia near Chiavenna. We sampled local food and wine as we wandered ever closer to the base of the dramatic falls \u2013 two tiers and twin streams dropping 130 metres off the valley wall \u2013 and found a good viewpoint to spread our blanket on the grass, and wait. There were river pools for kids to play in and lots of pop-up bars for refreshments. All this is the build up to the exciting climax: at 10pm a squad of abseilers, their bodies outlined with lights, slowly descend the falls in the dark. Magical. Martha Grawa, Austria The Grawa waterfall is on the Wild Water Trail in the Stubai Valley. We travelled there by bus using the Stubai Super Card. Our walking group were the only ones there on a damp, misty morning. The 85-metre-wide waterfall wasn\u2019t even in full flow but it was an awesome, thundering spectacle. When we revisited the next day, it was transformed: a bright, sunny afternoon had framed the waterfall with blue sky and green trees and brought many people out to enjoy the show from the wooden platform and seating. Liz Young Svartifoss, Iceland One of my most amazing experiences ever was to see the mystical Svartifoss waterfall in Iceland, in the south of Vatnaj\u00f6kull national park. Although this is not the biggest of the Icelandic \u201cfosses\u201d, the magic of the place was palpable. Magnificent octagonal basalt columns that surround Svatrifoss add something special. In the dying light of winter sun, the icy glow of falling glacier water was radiating extraordinary power. The hike to Svartifoss from the visitor centre in Skaftafell takes about 45 minutes each way. Every time I think about Svartifoss, my heart is filled with wonder. Rod L S\u00f8tefossen, Norway If, like me, you\u2019re obsessed with waterfalls, Norway is the promised land. No other country gives more bang for your buck. Unfortunately many of Norway\u2019s cataracts are harnessed for the country\u2019s huge hydroelectric industry. But a hike up the Kinso River bags you four of its finest unharnessed falls culminating in S\u00f8tefossen, a giant double leap down the headwall of the Husedalen. You start in Kinsarvik: there\u2019s a bus stop in the village and a car park at the trailhead a few kilometres up the valley. The trail climbs 666 metres, it\u2019s strenuous but the payoff is extraordinary. Michael Glen Maye, Isle of Man A small but powerful force, Glen Maye waterfall in the Isle of Man plungesthrough a dramatic, intensely green gorge sheltered by mature woods and clothed in moss, ferns and trailing plants saturated by the river\u2019s breath. When the river is not in full spate, the pool is an unforgettable place to swim \u2013 deep, wild, clear and exhilaratingly cold. A spirit of Manx folklore - the Cabbyl-Ushtey (Water Horse) \u2013 is said to dwell here. Glen Maye is a 10-minute drive from the western town of Peel. There\u2019s a car park above the glen, from which you can follow the river down through the trees to the beach for a picnic. Elizabeth Cora Linn, South Lanarkshire The most magical place in Central Scotland is the Cora Linn at the Falls of Clyde after a heavy rainfall. It can be reached by walking from the historic town of New Lanark via a well-maintained woodland pathway alongside the river where badgers and otters make their home. The falls have impressed and inspired poets and writers for centuries, including Wordsworth, Coleridge, and JMW Turner. The feeling of being miles from anywhere while being midway between Scotland\u2019s major cities is sensational. And when you catch your first sight of the falls the feeling is glorious. Moira Mill and Whitfield Gill Force, Wensleydale, Yorkshire Picturesque Askrigg in Wensleydale offers an enchanting five-mile round-trip to two fabulous but unheralded waterfalls, Mill Gill Force and Whitfield Gill Force. Park outside the church (free) and walk through backstreets and then meadows before meeting Mill Gill Beck in its wooded glade. You\u2019ll soon be following the whooshing of the falls, descending to the first in a cavernous gully shrouded by cliffs and trees. Keep going to the even more spectacular Whitfield, before ascending out of the glen and taking a moorland track back to Askrigg, with commanding views over the dale. Refresh at the ancient and atmospheric King\u2019s Arms, with its excellent food, ales, and friendly staff. Daniel Ashman Baatara Gorge waterfall, Lebanon The Cave of Three Bridges near Tannourine village (a 90-minute drive from Beirut) is a primordial wonder. A vertical shaft of icy melt water drops 250 metres through a limestone cave. Over the centuries the water has carved three limestone arcs across the main chamber at the end of a dizzyingly steep gorge. The curved nature of the erosion and abundance of greenery give the impression of an imagined landscape, a sublime rendering of the natural world. The Baatara Gorge can be accessed by trail from the village of Mgharet al-Ghaouaghir and offers an insight into the incredible geology of this tiny, troubled country. Gareth Roberts Gocta Waterfall, Peru It is well worth the trek to get to this astonishing waterfall. In cloud forest at the edge of the Amazon, in the Chachapoyas region, it is the most beautiful waterfall I\u2019ve ever seen. Locals will tell you it\u2019s the third-highest waterfall in the world (at 771 metres) although experts dispute this because it falls in two drops and it\u2019s rated by the World Waterfall Database as 16th-highest in the world. Whatever its standing, it\u2019s worth the 6km trek, which takes about four hours. The route is generally well-signposted, if a little rugged in parts. It\u2019s also free, unless you want to take up the option of hiring a horse and a guide. Tim Evans Mocon\u00e1 Falls, Misiones, Argentina These falls on the Uruguay River dividing Brazil and Argentina are often overlooked by travellers seeking the undoubted majesty of its big brother, Iguazu, 300km away. We visited Mocon\u00e1 Falls when staying at Don Enrique Lodge, about 50km from the falls, after a tip from our hosts. A 4WD taxi down miles of dirt tracks followed by an hour\u2019s rib-boat trip took us to the 3km-long falls. Uniquely, the falls run the length of the river and although only about 20 metres high, they are breathtaking. Mocon\u00e1 translates in the Guarani language as \u201cto swallow everything\u201d, an entirely justified description. Not easy to reach but an unforgettable experience. Also known as the Yucum\u00e3 Falls, this incredible sight can also be viewed from the Brazilian side. Paul Hammond Snoqualmie, Washington State, US This is the 82-metre waterfall (about 30 metres taller than Niagara Falls) made famous internationally in the 1990s TV series Twin Peaks. One of the great things, beyond the sheer force of its visual splendour, is that Snoqualmie is accessible by public bus services from downtown Seattle (30 miles) for a few dollars, so you don\u2019t need a hire car to get there. It\u2019s less than a mile woodland hike to the base of the falls from the top (and there are other hikes there too). David Chalton Sunwapta Falls, Jasper national park, Canada This is a perfect stopover when driving on the Icefields Parkway. The 18-metre Upper Falls are easily accessed from the car park. The cascading water, partly fed by the Athabasca Glacier, is immensely powerful in spring and early summer when meltwater volumes are at peak. Walk to the centre of the high wooden footbridge that spans the gorge to appreciate the picture-perfect sight of the towering mountains in the background, and the picturesque island of trees just before the falls. Rushing water curves dramatically around both sides of the island. Sunwapta means \u201cturbulent river\u201d in the Stoney First Nation people\u2019s language. A mile\u2019s hike leads you through forest to the Lower Falls. Watch out for bears. Victoria Kalandula Falls, Angola Angola is home to one of Africa\u2019s biggest waterfalls, the Kalendula Falls, boasting an impressive width of 410 metres and a drop of 105 metres. The thundering noise, mist and setting are overwhelming. The best way to experience the falls is by hire car from Luanda, a six-hour drive on fairly rudimentary roads through varied landscapes. Alternatively, travel by train to the regional capital, Malanje, and then drive north for an hour via Lombe and Calandula. Stay at the charming Pousada Calandula (doubles from about \u00a3150). The six rooms have incredible views (and the noise) of the waterfall. The falls are best enjoyed from the B&amp;B\u2019s veranda with its bar. Line Nyhagen Ngare Ndare, Kenya Hidden in the middle of a small, community-managed forest reserve in central Kenya, Ngare Ndare is an impossibly pretty set of waterfalls perfect for swimming in. Four amazingly clear pools stretch a kilometre from a cerulean-blue pool fed by melting ice from the slopes of nearby Mount Kenya, past a couple of smaller, steeper pools with myriad jumping opportunities for adrenalin junkies, ending with the largest fall and best swimming spot. It\u2019s a cool 4km hike through shady forest from the main gate. Take a guide \u2013 we came across elephants. Clare Tappiya Falls, Philippines In a valley of the Cordillera mountains, the journey to the Tappiyal Falls involves making your way to the small village of Batad, among the Ifuago rice terraces, a Unesco world heritage site (390km north of Manila). Hiring a local guide costs between \u00a38 and \u00a316 to take you on a trek along the luscious green terraces carving along mountains before a 30-minute descent to the falls. Here, the water plummets 30 metres to a huge, refreshing pool to swim in and wash off the sweat from the hike. Tappiya\u2019s beauty isn\u2019t solely in the falls (stunning as they are), but the journey to get there: to the remote village, the phenomenal terraces, and the tricky descent. Laurence Britton Nachi, Japan The Kumano Kodo pilgrim trail is actually a collection of routes 100km or so south of Osaka. They are among the best and most well-organised of Japanese hikes with wonderful traditional Japanese accommodation and food on route. The gem at the end of the Nakahechi route is the Nachi Falls which, with a drop of 133 metres, is Japan\u2019s most spectacular cascade. Full details from the Kumano Travel Centre. John Thackray Khe Kem, Vietnam Take a rented moped (about \u00a37) from Con Cu\u00f4ng in the North Central Coast region on a meandering 20km ride through chiseled mountains, alongside rural villages to access the graceful Khe Kem waterfall. |For a \u00a31 entry fee, visitors get access to paths with bamboo rails that guide through the undergrowth towards the foot of the cascade, where a serene pool is surrounded by natural sun-baked stone loungers. Swim directly under the flowing torrent while having your feet gently nibbled by some of Pu Mat park\u2019s fish population. If you\u2019re lucky, as we were, an invitation to join a picnicking local family and share in food, beers and cheers might cap this magnificent experience. Belly Weeping Wall, Hawaii If you take one helicopter trip in your lifetime, let it be around Hawaiian island Kauai. Not only will you feel transported to the opening scene of Jurassic Park, but in one sweep you will see some of the most astonishing and remote landscapes on Earth from an unforgettable vantage. The Waimea Canyon, the towering cliffs of the N\u0101 Pali coastline, the horseshoe reef of Tunnels beach, and the Weeping Wall. Scores of rivulets thousands of feet high fall like tears directly from the misty sky. Set against the emerald background of shield volcano Mount Waialeale: a towering physical beauty from an earlier geological age, this is one of the most astounding sights on the planet. Hiking to the falls is only feasible for experienced adventurers. Sarah croudace Whangarei Falls, North Island, New Zealand There are bigger, splashier more dramatic Kiwi waterfalls but few are as photogenic as Whangarei Falls. The spectacular 27-metre drop down a basalt cliff is set in a wooded valley. There\u2019s a wonderful loop walk around the falls among the 500-year-old native flora and fauna. The three viewing platforms, picnic spots and well-maintained paths are balanced with the sheer beauty of the place. It\u2019s easily accessible, a 10-minute drive out of Whangarei, with plenty of free parking and toilets. Walks to the falls from the car parks range from 15 minutes to 1.5 hours. Perfect for a picnic and exploring. Phil Lines Looking for a holiday with a difference? Browse Guardian Holidays to see a range of fantastic trips",

      "bodyText": "Joe Biden was the central target as 10 Democratic presidential candidates took the stage for the second debate in Detroit on Wednesday, with rivals attempting to knock the former vice-president from his frontrunner status. Unlike last month\u2019s debate in Miami, however, where Biden visibly struggled to defend his decades-old record, this time Biden was ready for the fight. Biden, 76, was flanked by a crop of younger and more diverse candidates intent on casting him as a relic in their fight to be the party\u2019s nominee to take on Donald Trump in the 2020 election. They included California senator Kamala Harris, who in the last debate skilfully attacked Biden\u2019s past positions on ordered busing and segregation; New Jersey senator Cory Booker, with whom Biden has sparred over criminal justice; and other contenders who have so far failed to make a splash in the race, such as New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Colorado senator Michael Bennet, former San Antonio mayor Julian Castro, and Hawaii representative Tulsi Gabbard. The debate opened with what appeared to be a redux of last month\u2019s searing confrontation between Biden and Harris, this time over healthcare. As Harris sought to defend a Medicare-for-All plan she unveiled this week, which would maintain a role for private insurance and be implemented over 10 years, Biden sensed an opportunity. \u201cAnytime someone tells you you\u2019re going to get something good in 10 years, you should wonder why it\u2019s going to take 10 years,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be very blunt, and to be very straightforward, you can\u2019t beat President Trump with double-talk on this plan. \u201cYou\u2019re just simply inaccurate in what you\u2019re describing,\u201d Harris shot back. Countering that Biden\u2019s own healthcare plan would leave out roughly 10 million Americans, Harris added: \u201cIn 2019 in America, for a Democrat to be running for president with a plan that does not cover everyone, I think is without excuse.\u201d But Harris, whose breakout moment in last month\u2019s debate prompted a brief surge in the polls, was forced to weather other criticisms of her healthcare proposal. What followed was an unruly and often deeply personal debate over issues that included immigration, climate change and race relations. At nearly every turn, Biden and his past were brought squarely into focus. On immigration, it was Castro\u2019s turn to land a punch when the topic turned whether or not illegal border crossings should be decriminalized. The issue, which has been elevated amid Trump\u2019s policy of separating parents and children at the US-Mexico border, has divided Democrats. \u201cOpen borders is a right-wing talking point,\u201d Castro, who served as Barack Obama\u2019s housing secretary, said. \u201cAnd, frankly, I\u2019m disappointed that some folks, including some folks on this stage, have taken [the] bait.\u201d Biden dismissed the critique, pointing out he had never heard Castro level such criticisms of immigration policy while serving in the Obama administration. \u201cIt looks like one of us has learned the lessons of the past, and one of us hasn\u2019t,\u201d Castro retorted. The tenor was not unlike Tuesday\u2019s debate, which exposed the sharp dividing lines between the progressive and moderate wings of the party. But whereas the previous night saw progressive stars Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren defending the Democratic Party\u2019s leftward turn, Wednesday was dominated by a clash of personalities and tactics. At times, it devolved into allegations of cynicism and whose framing was most disingenuous. When Gillibrand resurrected a 1981 op-ed in which Biden argued against expanding a child tax credit for high-income earners \u2013 suggesting his views had undercut women in the workplace \u2013 Biden asked why she had previously praised his work on gender equality. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened except you\u2019re now running for president,\u201d Biden said. A similarly personal back-and-forth transpired when Booker accused Biden of constantly linking himself to Obama, only to dodge scrutiny over the more controversial aspects of the former president\u2019s tenure. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it when it\u2019s convenient and then dodge it when it\u2019s not,\u201d said Booker, who also went after Biden\u2019s role in authoring a tough-on-crime bill in 1994 now seen as the cause of mass incarceration. \u201cThere are people right now in prison for life for drug offenses because you stood up and used that tough on crime phony rhetoric that got a lot of people elected but destroyed communities like mine,\u201d Booker said. Despite the onslaught, Biden largely managed to stand his ground. In many ways, the evening was a testament to the Democratic Party\u2019s most pressing debate: whether to campaign on sweeping, progressive reforms or frame the election around the urgency of limiting Trump\u2019s presidency to a single term. Biden has built his candidacy on the latter, telling voters the choice before America was to determine whether Trump would forever reshape the nation\u2019s identity or simply go down as \u201can aberration\u201d. But Warren, who has yet to share the debate stage with Biden, warned Democrats on Tuesday that the White House would not be reclaimed through \u201csmall ideas and spinelessness\u201d. For many candidates, the Detroit debates may have been their last chance to leave a national impression. The threshold to qualify for the third round of debates in September is expected to grow tighter, requiring candidates to achieve 2% support from at least four polls and contributions from 130,000 donors. Trump dismissed his potential opponents on Wednesday. \u201cThe people on the stage tonight, and last, were not those that will either Make America Great Again or Keep America Great!\u201d the president tweeted. In an impassioned plea to his colleagues, Booker warned Democrats that picking one another apart only worked to Trump\u2019s benefit. \u201cThis pitting against progressives against moderates, saying one is unrealistic and the other doesn\u2019t care enough \u2013 that to me is dividing our party and demoralizing us in the face of the real enemy here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe person who is enjoying this debate the most right now is Donald Trump.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "An unemployed New Zealand man is facing an extraordinary payday after picking up a cricket bat Sir Donald Bradman once owned for a few hundred dollars and now offering it up to a memorabilia auction. James Sanders snapped up the bat for a few hundred dollars at a deceased estate auction. Bradman\u2019s signature adorns the bat alongside those of 16 English players, including Douglas Jardine, captain of the touring team during the infamous Bodyline Ashes series of 1932/33. It will go under the hammer at Melbourne auction house Leski on 11 August. Auctioneer Charles Leski, who has previously sold five other Bradman bats in the past 30 years, expects this one to fetch between $25,000 and $35,000. The item is expected to attract interest from bidders in Australia, India, Pakistan and Britain. Bradman, who died aged 92 in 2001, is considered the greatest cricketer of the 20th century and the greatest batsman who ever lived. Leski said Bradman had used this bat to collect signatures. \u201cFrom the point of view of its collectibility, the key element is that it has been signed by Don Bradman in the ownership position in the top right-hand corner of the back of the blade,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile we can say for certain the bat has been used, and we can say for certain it was used around the time of the Bodyline series, we can not say for certain any particular innings that it was used in.\u201d Jardine was the architect of the controversial and brutal bowling tactic that was employed by England on their tour of Australia in 1932-33. It was devised as a way of blunting the Australian\u2019s batting prowess, and in particular that of Bradman. Little is known about the bat\u2019s time in New Zealand. \u201cIf only the bat could speak,\u201d Leski said. A previous Badman bat Leski sold brought in $145,000 because it was the first bat the cricket legend had used during a Test match in Brisbane in 1928. He said Sanders wasn\u2019t a cricket tragic but sensed it was an important find based on the signatures of the English team. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit Antiques Roadshow or one of those trash or treasure programs on television,\u201d Leski said. He joked it might be a great belated 80th birthday present for Australia\u2019s former prime minister John Howard. Sanders told the New Zealand Herald he had no emotional attachment to the bat and hopes it will find a home back in Australia where it belongs. \u201cI\u2019m between jobs and had a bit of cash to spend from my redundancy and thought this would be a good investment,\u201d he told the paper. \u201cI\u2019m amazed at the price it might go for.

      "body": "<p>New South Wales farmers who cleared land illegally under the old Native Vegetation Act have been granted an amnesty by the Berijiklian government, which has announced it will no longer launch any new prosecutions for breaches of the old law.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theland.com.au/story/6258528/native-veg-case-crisis-talks-with-old-laws/\">Hundreds of cases are believed to be in the pipeline,</a> after the land clearing skyrocketed in north-western NSW ahead of more lenient land clearing laws being introduced by the government in August 2017.</p> <p>The new law, known as the Biodiversity Conservation Act, brought in a self-assessment system based on maps that showed the most sensitive areas of land. Farmers could self assess before clearing and only the most sensitive areas required prior permission.</p> <p>The amount of land being cleared for agriculture in NSW soared before the new system came into force and farmers apparently anticipated they would not be prosecuted under the old law.</p> <p>In 2013-14 9,200 hectares was cleared for new pastures and cropping in NSW.

      "bodyText": "New South Wales farmers who cleared land illegally under the old Native Vegetation Act have been granted an amnesty by the Berijiklian government, which has announced it will no longer launch any new prosecutions for breaches of the old law. Hundreds of cases are believed to be in the pipeline, after the land clearing skyrocketed in north-western NSW ahead of more lenient land clearing laws being introduced by the government in August 2017. The new law, known as the Biodiversity Conservation Act, brought in a self-assessment system based on maps that showed the most sensitive areas of land. Farmers could self assess before clearing and only the most sensitive areas required prior permission. The amount of land being cleared for agriculture in NSW soared before the new system came into force and farmers apparently anticipated they would not be prosecuted under the old law. In 2013-14 9,200 hectares was cleared for new pastures and cropping in NSW. Following the announcement of a review of the Native Vegetation Act, the number of hectares cleared doubled to 20,200 in 2016-17 and in 2017-18 \u2013 the first year of the new laws \u2013 it had hit 27,100. This does not represent all the native vegetation lost in NSW. The figures are much higher when losses due to bush fires and forestry activities are included. The announcement by agriculture minister, Adam Marshall, says there will be \u201cno new investigations under the old Native Vegetation Act from August.\u201d A spokeswoman for the environment minister said this meant 31 August but other sources said it was from 1 August. There will also be a review mechanism to ensure those who committed activities that would be legal under the government\u2019s new laws are not unfairly punished, Marshall said. The Land reported that the NSW farmers conference was told last week there were 164 compliance cases against farmers over alleged illegal clearing with another 100 on the way. Remediation orders that can tie up land for 20 years will become a last resort penalty. Landholders who were in breach of the Native Vegetation Act may be able to propose other solutions such as set-asides that deliver equivalent environmental outcomes. The environment movement has accused the government of caving in to the demands of big agribusiness by granting an amnesty to environmental lawbreakers. \u201cThe government has effectively made its deforestation laws retrospective and in the process has endorsed possibly hundreds of incidents of environmental lawbreaking,\u201d said Nature Conservation Council CEO, Kate Smolski. \u201cThis decision undermines the rule of law and sets a dangerous precedent.\u201d Independent NSW MP, Justin Field echoed the concerns. \u201cThis decision sends a terrible signal to those farmers who have done the right thing in the past and invested in protecting and improving the environmental values on their land.\u201d \u201cTime and again we see the National Party undermining, watering down or not enforcing environmental laws. Their treatment of the Darling River and the failure to enforce habitat protection just reinforces this track record and further undermines the Coalition\u2019s environmental legacy,\u201d he said. Radio station 2GB has been campaigning against the prosecutions for months, saying they are unfair to farmers. Prosecutions for land clearing have been deeply resented by farmers, particularly farmers around Moree, Bourke and the northern tablelands. Five years ago, an environment department officer, Glen Turner was murdered by a farmer Ian Turnbull, after he arrived to inspect land that had been illegally cleared. Smolski said that \u201cGladys Berejikilan\u2019s repeal of the Native Vegetation Act has been an environmental disaster. \u201cThey have led to thousands of hectares of wildlife habitat being bulldozed at a time when more than 1,000 native species are now threatened with extinction in NSW. \u201cEven before the act was repealed in late 2017, there was a massive spike in clearing, presumably because the National party gave big agribusiness an assurance that law breakers would not be prosecuted. \u201cToday the government has caved into the demands of big agribusiness and dealt another blow to nature and its already appalling record as environmental managers.\u201d",

Neither Tom\u0161i\u010d nor Bricelj Baraga are confident the building will be preserved, but they hope their work will at least help save the narrative of the space. \u201cEven if it\u2019s gone, as in the case of the McKeldin fountain, we will be able to preserve it digitally so people will still be able to see this beautiful structure,\u201d says Bricelj Baraga. This article was amended on 1 August 2019, because while the former Yugoslavia was communist and allied with the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin, it was not part of the Soviet Union as an earlier version said.

A thin black shadow is cast on to the studio\u2019s walls at the moment of closure.

Even though that was what I was trying to do.\u201d</p> <p>At the Edinburgh art festival, Jaar is failing again. As part of the festival\u2019s commissions programme, he is organising a public artwork that takes its title, I Can\u2019t Go On, I\u2019ll Go On, from the closing words of The Unnamable, a novel by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/jul/07/samuel-beckett-the-maestro-of-failure\">another chronicler of failure, Samuel Beckett</a>.</p> <p>Edinburgh\u2019s Bridge of Sighs (appropriately enough) is home to a large neon sign quoting Beckett\u2019s text, and his words will be spread through the streets of Edinburgh over the course of the festival by performers wearing sandwich boards: I Can\u2019t Go On on their chests, I\u2019ll Go On on their backs. It\u2019s like the characters who used to walk around advertising The End Is Nigh. In this case it\u2019s The End Is Nigh, But Perhaps Not Quite Yet.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about our incapacity to change this reality, even though I keep going, I keep trying. Because this is the only thing I know,\u201d Jaar says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Rome, his posters read: The old world is dying.

He hoovers up the daily news, the only way he says he knows how to work, and salts his chat with quotations from favourite authors, films and magazine pieces. Today he recommends the bleak Romanian philosopher <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/02/18/emil-cioran-delusion/\">Emil Cioran</a> (\u201cIt is not worth the bother of killing yourself, since you always kill yourself too late\u201d), the poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/06/adrienne-rich-eve-ensler-jackie-kay\">Adrienne Rich</a> and the films of Cuban director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/jun/27/filmandmusic1.filmandmusic7\">Tom\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez Alea</a>.</p> <p>Beckett\u2019s words trigger a conversation about another favourite writer, Italian neo-Marxist <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Antonio-Gramsci\">Antonio Gramsci</a>, who wrote about \u201cthe pessimism of the intellect and the optimism of the will\u201d.

What does it say about us and about the world that the leader trying to change this reality is a little Swedish girl\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/11/greta-thunberg-schoolgirl-climate-change-warrior-some-people-can-let-things-go-i-cant\">Greta Thunberg</a> \u2013 \u201cwho is 16 years old?\u201d</p> <p>All is not lost, however. \u201cWith my will, I have to be optimistic.

It\u2019s obvious which has the upper hand in the battle between Jaar\u2019s pessimistic intellect and his optimistic will.</p> <p>Born in Chile in 1956, Jaar grew up under the bloody rule of General <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/pinochet\">Augusto Pinochet</a>, the US and UK-backed dictator whose soldiers travelled the country murdering and torturing opponents in a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-46160437\">caravan of death</a>\u201d. Jaar escaped in 1982 after finishing a degree in architecture. The experience has informed his work ever since.</p> <p>\u201cI know fascism when I see it,\u201d Jaar says. When he escaped, \u201cnot even in my wildest dreams\u201d did he expect to see the world facing what it is facing now. \u201cWe have fascism growing everywhere.

It was \u201ca huge controversy. People were saying, \u2018This is illegal, how could they let him do it?\u2019\u201d He has restaged the work several times since and its meaning has shifted as the politics have changed. Today, it seems to have been adopted as a comment on Trump, he says. \u201cThe semantics of what is America have changed completely and I accept that, gladly.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you live with censorship, you don't know things. And this lack of knowledge makes you fearful</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nonetheless, he says, the situation today is very different from the 1980s or Pinochet\u2019s Chile. Back then \u201cwe lived under censorship. The entire media system was controlled by the military.\u201d The free press may be under attack now, but, at least in the west, it is not yet at the level endured under Pinochet. \u201cWhen you live with a sense of censorship, you don\u2019t know [things]. And this lack of knowledge makes you fearful. You don\u2019t know what will happen to you, what you can and can\u2019t do, how you can express yourself. And if there is something worse than censorship, it is self-censorship. Fear makes you censor yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Today\u2019s problems are different but seem just as dangerous. Thanks to the proliferation of social media and the rise of \u201cfake news\u201d, people are drowning in information and increasingly unable to disentangle truth from lies. \u201cIt\u2019s insane,\u201d Jaar says. \u201cWhen the internet was created, we thought we had found this extraordinary tool that would change our lives. It was going to create the free flow of information, of ideas, with the rest of the world and so on.

      "bodyText": "Two light-box tables, like the ones a photographer would use to look at slides and negatives, are set in a corner of Alfredo Jaar\u2019s airy studio in Manhattan. One is suspended from the ceiling, the other standing on the floor directly below it. Over the course of a minute, the suspended table is lowered to meet its twin. A thin black shadow is cast on to the studio\u2019s walls at the moment of closure. As the table rises, the artist is brightly lit again, just as visitors will be when the piece, Lament of the Images, goes on show in Japan (Tate has an earlier version). There are no slides on the table, something that often confuses spectators, even those too young to have seen a slide. And that\u2019s the point, says Jaar. The piece illuminates the onlookers in \u201ca failed attempt to try and get people to see each other\u201d, he says. Jaar is big on failure. For 30 years, the Chilean-born, New York-based artist has been confronting failure \u2013 our inability to see, our unwillingness to look, our struggle to communicate \u2013 fearlessly tackling some of the darkest horrors of our age, from the Rwanda genocide to the US\u2019s \u201cblack site\u201d detention centres and torture rooms. He\u2019s never really happy with the results. \u201cI\u2019m an idealist and a utopian,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to change the world. And so in that sense, I fail all the time because I have failed to change it. I\u2019ve failed to change the reality around me. Even though that was what I was trying to do.\u201d At the Edinburgh art festival, Jaar is failing again. As part of the festival\u2019s commissions programme, he is organising a public artwork that takes its title, I Can\u2019t Go On, I\u2019ll Go On, from the closing words of The Unnamable, a novel by another chronicler of failure, Samuel Beckett. Edinburgh\u2019s Bridge of Sighs (appropriately enough) is home to a large neon sign quoting Beckett\u2019s text, and his words will be spread through the streets of Edinburgh over the course of the festival by performers wearing sandwich boards: I Can\u2019t Go On on their chests, I\u2019ll Go On on their backs. It\u2019s like the characters who used to walk around advertising The End Is Nigh. In this case it\u2019s The End Is Nigh, But Perhaps Not Quite Yet. \u201cIt\u2019s about our incapacity to change this reality, even though I keep going, I keep trying. Because this is the only thing I know,\u201d Jaar says. A conversation with him will leave you with a reading list a mile long. He hoovers up the daily news, the only way he says he knows how to work, and salts his chat with quotations from favourite authors, films and magazine pieces. Today he recommends the bleak Romanian philosopher Emil Cioran (\u201cIt is not worth the bother of killing yourself, since you always kill yourself too late\u201d), the poet Adrienne Rich and the films of Cuban director Tom\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez Alea. Beckett\u2019s words trigger a conversation about another favourite writer, Italian neo-Marxist Antonio Gramsci, who wrote about \u201cthe pessimism of the intellect and the optimism of the will\u201d. Gramsci was the source of another recent Jaar intervention, plastering Rome with posters of another of his quotes: \u201cThe old world is dying. The new world is slow to emerge. And in this chiaroscuro, monsters are born.\u201d That chiaroscuro \u2013 dark as Caravaggio \u2013 is everywhere, Jaar warns. \u201cWe live in dark times.\u201d Just look at the climate crisis, he says. \u201cWe face extinction. What does it say about us and about the world that the leader trying to change this reality is a little Swedish girl\u201d \u2013 Greta Thunberg \u2013 \u201cwho is 16 years old?\u201d All is not lost, however. \u201cWith my will, I have to be optimistic. If not, I would just kill myself,\u201d he says, miming a gun to his head even as he beams another of his frequent, playful smiles. It\u2019s obvious which has the upper hand in the battle between Jaar\u2019s pessimistic intellect and his optimistic will. Born in Chile in 1956, Jaar grew up under the bloody rule of General Augusto Pinochet, the US and UK-backed dictator whose soldiers travelled the country murdering and torturing opponents in a \u201ccaravan of death\u201d. Jaar escaped in 1982 after finishing a degree in architecture. The experience has informed his work ever since. \u201cI know fascism when I see it,\u201d Jaar says. When he escaped, \u201cnot even in my wildest dreams\u201d did he expect to see the world facing what it is facing now. \u201cWe have fascism growing everywhere. In this country, in your country, in half of Europe, in Latin America.\u201d Jaar has been tackling nationalism since at least 1987 when he erected a lightbulb-studded screen in Times Square, A Logo for America, reading: \u201cThis is not America.\u201d It was saying the US was part of a continent, not the continent itself, at a time \u2013 then as now \u2013 of great conflict between the US and its neighbours. It was \u201ca huge controversy. People were saying, \u2018This is illegal, how could they let him do it?\u2019\u201d He has restaged the work several times since and its meaning has shifted as the politics have changed. Today, it seems to have been adopted as a comment on Trump, he says. \u201cThe semantics of what is America have changed completely and I accept that, gladly.\u201d Nonetheless, he says, the situation today is very different from the 1980s or Pinochet\u2019s Chile. Back then \u201cwe lived under censorship. The entire media system was controlled by the military.\u201d The free press may be under attack now, but, at least in the west, it is not yet at the level endured under Pinochet. \u201cWhen you live with a sense of censorship, you don\u2019t know [things]. And this lack of knowledge makes you fearful. You don\u2019t know what will happen to you, what you can and can\u2019t do, how you can express yourself. And if there is something worse than censorship, it is self-censorship. Fear makes you censor yourself.\u201d Today\u2019s problems are different but seem just as dangerous. Thanks to the proliferation of social media and the rise of \u201cfake news\u201d, people are drowning in information and increasingly unable to disentangle truth from lies. \u201cIt\u2019s insane,\u201d Jaar says. \u201cWhen the internet was created, we thought we had found this extraordinary tool that would change our lives. It was going to create the free flow of information, of ideas, with the rest of the world and so on. And now we have discovered the ugly end of these technologies.\u201d He points to the way technology has been used to influence elections, both in the US and the UK, the constant distractions it creates, the undermining of truth. This, he believes, is where art has a role. Art can teach people to see, it can offer a way to get \u201cback to the essential\u201d. In a 2006 piece, The Sound of Silence, Jaar built a mini-theatre dedicated to one image, the Pulitzer-prize winning photographer Kevin Carter\u2019s devastating picture of a starving Sudanese child crouched in a stony field and stalked by a vulture. The idea was to ask viewers to dedicate some time \u2013 eight minutes \u2013 to the picture and its story. A green light bids you to enter to watch a film that examines the history and politics of the image. Given the average time someone spends in front of a piece in a museum or gallery is 15 to 30 seconds, it\u2019s a big ask, but it\u2019s one Jaar believes is essential. \u201cWe see, but we don\u2019t understand, because there is a lack of context. We have not created the models to resolve these problems.\u201d Around the world, people are taught to read, \u201cbut who teaches us the influence that images, the media landscape, have? How it changes our vision of the world,\u201d Jaar says. \u201cI really believe that images are not innocent. Every image contains a conception of the world.\u201d And too often those conceptions go unchallenged. The art world \u2013 not the art market, Jaar is keen to point out, which is fixated on money \u2013 is perhaps the only place where those conceptions are being challenged today, he believes. A place made up of millions of young people \u201cwho against the wishes of their families and the pressures of society have decided to become artists and are trying to make sense of the world\u201d. He\u2019s hopeful about the new generations now coming up, new artists, new thinkers, new leaders such as Thunberg. It\u2019s one of the reasons he dedicates a third of his time to teaching. \u201cI learn from them enormously,\u201d he says. Perhaps someone who sees his Edinburgh piece this week will be inspired to make their own work. Perhaps they will offer us a new vision that can help us navigate the darkness. Intellectually, Jaar may be pessimistic about whether others can really succeed where he keeps \u201cfailing\u201d. But his will is filled with optimism.

Peter Sutcliffe\u2019s victims included white, black and Asian women, including a 14-year-old schoolgirl and a 34-year-old doctor from Singapore. But the investigation was placed solely in the hands of white working-class men who then reinforced each other\u2019s prejudices.</p> <p>Detectives catastrophically misconstrued the killer\u2019s motivation, insisting he was driven by a hatred of prostitutes and categorising his attacks on other women as \u201cmistakes\u201d. They dismissed the testimony of one of the surviving witnesses, who insisted that the man who had brutally attacked his victims spoke with a Yorkshire accent. Instead they convinced themselves that they were being taunted by the killer, haring off in search of a fraudster from the north-east who mocked them in letters and a tape. And the real killer, Peter Sutcliffe, remained free to attack other women.</p> <p>It was a painful insight into the failure of the criminal justice system to understand the nature of male violence. Years later I had another epiphany, when I noticed that all the men who carried out fatal terrorist attacks in London and Manchester in 2017 had a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/19/home-grown-how-domestic-violence-turns-men-into-terrorists-joan-smith-review\" title=\"\">history of abusing women</a>. When I pointed it out in a meeting with one of the country\u2019s most senior police officers, he looked aghast and said no one had mentioned the connection before. The next time I saw him, he told me he had returned to Scotland Yard and asked if there was any data on terrorists who had previously abused wives or girlfriends \u2013 and was told it didn\u2019t exist.</p> <p>Counter-terrorism experts had somehow managed to miss the vital link between mass killers and violence against women and girls. Yet I found enough examples of it to write an entire book, listing dozens of terrorists and mass shooters who started out by terrorising female family members. Several cases I studied, including the Finsbury Park mosque attacker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/02/finsbury-park-attack-darren-osborne-jailed\" title=\"\">Darren Osborne</a>, became \u201cradicalised\u201d and turned on members of the public after they\u2019d been thrown out of the family home. Women who work with victims of domestic and sexual violence had noticed the pattern \u2013 but nobody talked to them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/31/sexual-assault-case-dropped-phone-traumatic\">My sexual assault case was dropped because I wouldn\u2019t hand over my phone | Anonymous</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Official investigations into male violence are divided into silos, something which allows damaging myths to flourish. Eight years ago, following a series of damning reports by the then Independent Police Complaints Commission about the force\u2019s handling of serious sex offences, the Met adopted a new policy of believing women (and men) who reported a rape. It shouldn\u2019t be a big deal for officers to accept that a sexual crime has been committed, just as they do when someone reports a burglary, but even getting that far had taken years of campaigning. Last year, however, the Met police commissioner, Cressida Dick, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/police-ditch-practice-of-believing-all-victims-jsg6qd2ws\" title=\"\">reversed it</a>.</p> <p>It was part of the fallout from Operation Midland, the force\u2019s catastrophically mishandled investigation into lurid claims about the existence of a VIP paedophile ring by a man known as \u201cNick\u201d,. The Met\u2019s reputation is still suffering, especially now that \u201cNick\u201d has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/22/how-nick-the-serial-child-abuse-accuser-became-the-accused\" title=\"\">revealed</a> to be the convicted paedophile and fraudster Carl Beech \u2013 who was sent to prison for 18 years last week for perverting the course of justice.</p> <p>Detectives are not usually so quick to believe rape allegations, and it\u2019s hard to avoid a weary sigh over the way senior officers allowed themselves to be duped by a male fantasist. But it\u2019s also hard to think of a more egregious example of listening to the wrong people \u2013 men talking among themselves, in other words, as they have for centuries.</p> <p>The criminal justice system needs to do many things if it is serious about tackling its dismal track record in rape cases. One of the very first is showing some humility and listening to the people who really know what\u2019s going on. Frankly, if you really want to understand male violence, you need to listen to women.</p> <p>\u2022 Joan Smith is a columnist and the author of Misogynies</p>",

But the investigation was placed solely in the hands of white working-class men who then reinforced each other\u2019s prejudices. Detectives catastrophically misconstrued the killer\u2019s motivation, insisting he was driven by a hatred of prostitutes and categorising his attacks on other women as \u201cmistakes\u201d. They dismissed the testimony of one of the surviving witnesses, who insisted that the man who had brutally attacked his victims spoke with a Yorkshire accent. Instead they convinced themselves that they were being taunted by the killer, haring off in search of a fraudster from the north-east who mocked them in letters and a tape. And the real killer, Peter Sutcliffe, remained free to attack other women. It was a painful insight into the failure of the criminal justice system to understand the nature of male violence. Years later I had another epiphany, when I noticed that all the men who carried out fatal terrorist attacks in London and Manchester in 2017 had a history of abusing women. When I pointed it out in a meeting with one of the country\u2019s most senior police officers, he looked aghast and said no one had mentioned the connection before. The next time I saw him, he told me he had returned to Scotland Yard and asked if there was any data on terrorists who had previously abused wives or girlfriends \u2013 and was told it didn\u2019t exist. Counter-terrorism experts had somehow managed to miss the vital link between mass killers and violence against women and girls. Yet I found enough examples of it to write an entire book, listing dozens of terrorists and mass shooters who started out by terrorising female family members. Several cases I studied, including the Finsbury Park mosque attacker Darren Osborne, became \u201cradicalised\u201d and turned on members of the public after they\u2019d been thrown out of the family home. Women who work with victims of domestic and sexual violence had noticed the pattern \u2013 but nobody talked to them. Official investigations into male violence are divided into silos, something which allows damaging myths to flourish. Eight years ago, following a series of damning reports by the then Independent Police Complaints Commission about the force\u2019s handling of serious sex offences, the Met adopted a new policy of believing women (and men) who reported a rape. It shouldn\u2019t be a big deal for officers to accept that a sexual crime has been committed, just as they do when someone reports a burglary, but even getting that far had taken years of campaigning. Last year, however, the Met police commissioner, Cressida Dick, reversed it. It was part of the fallout from Operation Midland, the force\u2019s catastrophically mishandled investigation into lurid claims about the existence of a VIP paedophile ring by a man known as \u201cNick\u201d,. The Met\u2019s reputation is still suffering, especially now that \u201cNick\u201d has been revealed to be the convicted paedophile and fraudster Carl Beech \u2013 who was sent to prison for 18 years last week for perverting the course of justice. Detectives are not usually so quick to believe rape allegations, and it\u2019s hard to avoid a weary sigh over the way senior officers allowed themselves to be duped by a male fantasist. But it\u2019s also hard to think of a more egregious example of listening to the wrong people \u2013 men talking among themselves, in other words, as they have for centuries. The criminal justice system needs to do many things if it is serious about tackling its dismal track record in rape cases. One of the very first is showing some humility and listening to the people who really know what\u2019s going on. Frankly, if you really want to understand male violence, you need to listen to women. \u2022 Joan Smith is a columnist and the author of Misogynies",

Some experts prefer the longevity of synthetic fibres such as polyester, while others favour natural fibres such as cotton.</p> <p>Charles Ross, sustainability expert and lecturer at the Royal College of Art says: \u201cI prefer wearing synthetics because I believe they are more durable fibres. If you have two identical T-shirts in cotton or polyester, the cotton will wear out quicker.\u201d </p> <p>De Castro, on the other hand, favours natural fibres. She advises buying items made out of single fabric components, such as 100% cotton or 100% merino wool. They may not stand up to repeated washings as well as synthetic fibres but as they are more breathable, you will sweat less so you don\u2019t need to wash them as often. De Castro warns against wearing polyester for environmental reasons \u2013 when washed, it sheds microfibres, which have been linked <a href=\"https://friendsoftheearth.uk/plastics/microfibres-plastic-in-our-clothes\" title=\"\">to plastic pollution</a> in our oceans.</p> <h2><strong>Do you </strong><strong>need to wash it?</strong><br></h2> <p>The more you wash clothes, the quicker they wear out. De Castro echoes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jul/07/stella-mccartney-its-not-like-i-am-here-for-an-easy-life\" title=\"\">Stella McCartney\u2019s recent advice</a> that we should refrain from over-cleaning clothes. \u201cIf something is made from good-quality wool, such as a man\u2019s suit, it\u2019s designed to be brushed clean and not washed,\u201d she says. If you must wash things in a machine, use a low heat, and put delicate fabrics in a laundry bag to reduce tearing.</p> <p>There are plenty of ways to refresh clothes without bunging them in the machine: De Castro suggests spot-cleaning tricky stains, or taking whiffy garments into the bathroom while you shower, to steam them. This will not only help to make your clothes last longer, but is also more environmentally friendly. The <a href=\"http://sustainability.umich.edu/pba/resources/water/laundry-water-use\" title=\"\">average washing machine uses 13,500 gallons of water </a><a href=\"http://sustainability.umich.edu/pba/resources/water/laundry-water-use\" title=\"\">a year</a>, as much as you drink in your lifetime.</p> <p>Winston-Hart has some nifty tricks for cleaning items without putting them in the machine. \u201cA mixture of lukewarm water and vodka will get rid of smells,\u201d she says. Use three parts vodka and two parts water if something is very stinky, or three parts water and two parts vodka if it only has a light musk. \u201cStick the mixture in a spray bottle and mist it over. If your clothing still smells bad the next day, give it another spray.\u201d She is also a fan of popping clothes in the freezer, for an overnight refresh. If things are still pongy, hang them out on the line on a breezy day \u2013 you will be surprised by how much it can help.</p> <p>None of the experts I speak to are fans of dry cleaning, although they accept it is sometimes necessary. \u201cDry cleaning doesn\u2019t always clean stuff that well,\u201d says Winston-Hart. \u201cSometimes it comes back smelling worse \u2013 that chemical smell.\u201d By looking after your clothes as much as possible, you can cut back on dry cleaning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6ab287fb4cb1af8ad30c653b835676b1bbcdaa61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ab287fb4cb1af8ad30c653b835676b1bbcdaa61/292_613_1300_1727/753.jpg\" alt=\"Man examining his pants\" width=\"753\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>If you must wash things, </strong><strong>do it properly</strong><br></h2> <p>An important caveat: items worn close to your skin, particularly underwear and socks, should be washed at an adequate heat. Don\u2019t fling pants in with your dish towels on a 30C wash. \u201cYou really don\u2019t want to put bedding, tea towels, gym kit, underwear and socks in at a low temperature,\u201d says environmental health practitioner <a href=\"http://thehygienedoctor.co.uk/about/\" title=\"\">Dr Lisa Ackerley</a>. All need to be washed at a minimum of 60C.</p> <p>If you are worried about ruining your underwear, wash it at a lower temperature, but add an antibacterial cleanser to the wash.</p> <h2><strong>How to store </strong><strong>clothes</strong><br></h2> <p><a href=\"https://sparkjoylondon.com/\" title=\"\">Katrina Hassan</a>, a professional organiser, recommends periodically decluttering your wardrobe. \u201cGet all your clothing in one space \u2013 I call it the power of the pile. A lot of people aren\u2019t aware of all the things they own, until they see it.\u201d</p> <p>Decide which items to keep, and check them over for damage. Store things properly \u2013 Hassan teaches clients how to fold clothes, then stack them in an upright position, so you can see everything you own at once. \u201cWhen you store things vertically, you\u2019re less tempted to buy things, and more conscious with your consumerism \u2026 you know exactly what you own, and where it\u2019s stored.\u201d</p> <p>Store expensive items in cotton suit bags to prevent moth damage. (If you are on a budget, Winston-Hart suggests using an old single bedsheet, cutting a hole in it for a coathanger to poke through, then sewing up the sides for a DIY suit bag.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0991eebedbf3dcb3aa99b08d879371761c21ee36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0991eebedbf3dcb3aa99b08d879371761c21ee36/0_269_1880_1128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man getting his clothes out of a freezer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Death to moths</strong><br></h2> <p>Clothes moths seem to be becoming more prevalent in UK homes, with figures from pest control firm Rentokil showing that moth-related callouts increased 60% from May 2014 to May 2018. Winston-Hart admits to hating moths. She doesn\u2019t have much time for conventional solutions such as mothballs or paper discs. \u201cI think they\u2019re rubbish. Visit your local tree surgeon and ask them for a lump of cedarwood, stick it in your wardrobe, and the moths won\u2019t go near it.\u201d She also recommends lining your drawers with lavender-scented paper. If you have unearthed a vintage find, but are worried that it may have moth eggs in it, put it in a plastic bag and stick it in the freezer for several days to kill eggs or larvae.</p> <h2><strong>Use treatments to protect </strong><strong>shoes and clothes</strong><br></h2> <p>To get the most out of your footwear, ensure you look after the leather. \u201cI tend to wear Timberland boots,\u201d Ross tells me, \u201cand every six weeks I wash off the dirt and put on a leather conditioner to keep them going for longer.\u201d (He favours a brand called <a href=\"https://www.nikwax.com/en-gb/products/productdetail.php?productid=88&amp;activityid=-1&amp;itemid=-1&amp;fabricid=-1\" title=\"\">Nikwax</a>.)</p> <p>It is not just footwear that you can treat to make it last longer: brands such as <a href=\"https://polygiene.com/\" title=\"\">Polygiene</a> use silver chloride technology, which is antimicrobial, to put a finish on fabrics. \u201cIf you have the finish on a polyester T-shirt, you can wear it for five years before it starts smelling,\u201d claims Ross.</p> <h2><strong>Support your local tailor and cobbler </strong><br></h2> <p>\u201cI have a deep relationship with my local tailor,\u201d says De Castro. Once a year, she sorts through all her items, and then takes them in for repairs. \u201cThey\u2019ll fix niggly things such as dropped hems, change the zips on evening gowns, or take things in and let them out.\u201d </p> <p>When a pair of shoes starts to wear out, consider whether they can be resoled. Ross has worn the same pair of outdoor boots since 1985: the soles have been replaced six times.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3b33a427bb243160a758d4666772a21117258dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3b33a427bb243160a758d4666772a21117258dc/0_282_2375_1652/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman smelling armpit of a man in a suit\" width=\"1000\" height=\"696\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Have a go yourself</strong><br></h2> <p>It is easy to do basic repairs yourself. \u201cIf you want to start repairing things and you\u2019re not sure how to go about it, try out on some scrap fabric first,\u201d says repairs expect Tom van Deijnen of <a href=\"https://tomofholland.com/\" title=\"\">the Visible Mending Programme</a>. He recommends watching YouTube videos to learn basic skills, and asking family and friends for help. \u201cIn my experience, mothers and grandmothers always come up trumps,\u201d he says.</p> <p>With worn-out jeans, Van Deijnen recommends sewing on patches. \u201cUse a similar colour fabric, in the same weight as the original material \u2013 if it\u2019s a woven fabric, patch it with a woven fabric, and if it\u2019s a jersey fabric, use a jersey patch.\u201d</p> <p>A common mistake people make when darning knitwear is to do it too tightly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t leave room for shrinking \u2013 sometimes threads can shrink when they are new. And if you pull the hole too tight, it can also cause a pucker, which creates tension in the fabric, meaning it will rip again.\u201d</p> <p>Van Deijnen explains the best way to sew on a button. \u201cThread the needle, make some stitches in the fabric, then attach the button and sew it on. Do it a good few times. When you\u2019ve finished, tug on the thread. If it comes loose, you didn\u2019t do a good job.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Know when to admit defeat</strong><br></h2> <p>Not every item can be repaired. \u201cI\u2019m quite adventurous and I\u2019ll always give things ago, but sometimes things can be completely beyond repair,\u201d says Van Deijnen. He recently had to bin a knitted tie that was riddled with moth eggs. The fabric disintegrated in his hands when he touched it, so he had no choice.</p> <p>When something can\u2019t be fixed, think of alternate uses for it. \u201cEverything can have another function at the end of its life,\u201d says De Castro. She cuts up old swimsuits to use as hair ties (old tights are also good for this). And old T-shirts make the best cleaning rags.</p> <p>Donate intelligently. \u201cCharity shops are brimming with our clothes,\u201d says De Castro, \u201cso you should only donate to charity what you think will sell. Otherwise, you\u2019re dumping your problem on another organisation.\u201d If you know it won\u2019t sell \u2013 perhaps because it is old gym kit \u2013 take it to a textile-recycling bank where it can be turned into a new item. (Trainers <a href=\"https://www.runnersneed.com/about-us/recyclemyrun.html\" title=\"\">can be recycled at branches of Runners Need</a>.) The Love Your Clothes campaign has a textile bank locator, along with other resources, <a href=\"https://www.loveyourclothes.org.uk/recycle-your-clothes\" title=\"\">on </a><a href=\"https://www.loveyourclothes.org.uk/recycle-your-clothes\" title=\"\">its website</a>.</p> <h2><strong>When it comes to vintage,</strong><strong> beware</strong><br></h2> <p>If you want your clothes to last, it can make sense to buy vintage: things made before 1980 tend to be made to a higher standard than modern items. \u201cEven cheaply made 1970s trousers, if you turn them inside out, will resemble couture now,\u201d says De Castro. But there is also a lot of factory-made fake vintage out there. How to tell? Look at details such as zips \u2013 is there a hook and eye to keep the zip in place? If not, it may be a fake. Other signs include 40s-style dresses with elasticated fabric \u2013 stretchy material wasn\u2019t around then.</p> <p>Look after your vintage. \u201cArmpit shields are really good,\u201d says Winston-Hart. \u201cThey\u2019re just cotton half-moons you attach with safety pins to your clothing under the armpits. You remove the pins and wash the pads themselves \u2013 which saves you having to wash the garment all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Wearing a slip under a skirt means you don\u2019t have to clean the skirt as often, as it is not touching your skin, cutting down on dry cleaning costs and reducing wear. If the slip is made out of silk, it will also help to regulate your body temperature. </p> <p>There are so many places to find secondhand treasures, whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/apr/12/swap-clothes-swishing\" title=\"\">it is a clothes swap with friends</a>, charity shops or car boot sales. If you are a vintage aficionado, Winston-Hart recommends her favourite stores: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Vintage-Store/Apple-Tree-Vintage-156253907746547/\" title=\"\">Apple </a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Vintage-Store/Apple-Tree-Vintage-156253907746547/\" title=\"\">Tree Vintage</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/1940s-Style-For-You-277415228940466/\" title=\"\">1940s Style </a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/1940s-Style-For-You-277415228940466/\" title=\"\">For You</a>, <a href=\"https://www.scarletragevintage.com/\" title=\"\">Scarlet Rage Vintage</a>, <a href=\"http://www.blackout2.com/\" title=\"\">Blackout Vintage Fashion</a> and <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/HunkyDoryVTG\" title=\"\">Hunky Dory Vintage</a>. (Many have online stores.) If vintage isn\u2019t your thing, find more contemporary secondhand pieces on eBay or Depop. Sometimes, buying new clothes can be a sustainable choice \u2013 <a href=\"https://hiutdenim.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Hiut Denim</a> will do free repairs on your jeans for life.</p> <p>It is not just about buying vintage or secondhand clothes. Ross talks about \u201cemotional durability,\u201d or the attachment to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jun/11/forget-fast-fashion-slow-style-pioneers-on-the-clothes-theyve-worn-for-decades\" title=\"\">our most beloved clothes</a>, because the most sustainable item in your wardrobe isn\u2019t always the one that is ethically produced from non-polluting fabrics.

De Castro warns against wearing polyester for environmental reasons \u2013 when washed, it sheds microfibres, which have been linked to plastic pollution in our oceans. Do you need to wash it? The more you wash clothes, the quicker they wear out. De Castro echoes Stella McCartney\u2019s recent advice that we should refrain from over-cleaning clothes. \u201cIf something is made from good-quality wool, such as a man\u2019s suit, it\u2019s designed to be brushed clean and not washed,\u201d she says. If you must wash things in a machine, use a low heat, and put delicate fabrics in a laundry bag to reduce tearing. There are plenty of ways to refresh clothes without bunging them in the machine: De Castro suggests spot-cleaning tricky stains, or taking whiffy garments into the bathroom while you shower, to steam them. This will not only help to make your clothes last longer, but is also more environmentally friendly. The average washing machine uses 13,500 gallons of water a year, as much as you drink in your lifetime. Winston-Hart has some nifty tricks for cleaning items without putting them in the machine. \u201cA mixture of lukewarm water and vodka will get rid of smells,\u201d she says. Use three parts vodka and two parts water if something is very stinky, or three parts water and two parts vodka if it only has a light musk. \u201cStick the mixture in a spray bottle and mist it over. If your clothing still smells bad the next day, give it another spray.\u201d She is also a fan of popping clothes in the freezer, for an overnight refresh. If things are still pongy, hang them out on the line on a breezy day \u2013 you will be surprised by how much it can help. None of the experts I speak to are fans of dry cleaning, although they accept it is sometimes necessary. \u201cDry cleaning doesn\u2019t always clean stuff that well,\u201d says Winston-Hart. \u201cSometimes it comes back smelling worse \u2013 that chemical smell.\u201d By looking after your clothes as much as possible, you can cut back on dry cleaning. If you must wash things, do it properly An important caveat: items worn close to your skin, particularly underwear and socks, should be washed at an adequate heat. Don\u2019t fling pants in with your dish towels on a 30C wash. \u201cYou really don\u2019t want to put bedding, tea towels, gym kit, underwear and socks in at a low temperature,\u201d says environmental health practitioner Dr Lisa Ackerley. All need to be washed at a minimum of 60C. If you are worried about ruining your underwear, wash it at a lower temperature, but add an antibacterial cleanser to the wash. How to store clothes Katrina Hassan, a professional organiser, recommends periodically decluttering your wardrobe. \u201cGet all your clothing in one space \u2013 I call it the power of the pile. A lot of people aren\u2019t aware of all the things they own, until they see it.\u201d Decide which items to keep, and check them over for damage. Store things properly \u2013 Hassan teaches clients how to fold clothes, then stack them in an upright position, so you can see everything you own at once. \u201cWhen you store things vertically, you\u2019re less tempted to buy things, and more conscious with your consumerism \u2026 you know exactly what you own, and where it\u2019s stored.\u201d Store expensive items in cotton suit bags to prevent moth damage. (If you are on a budget, Winston-Hart suggests using an old single bedsheet, cutting a hole in it for a coathanger to poke through, then sewing up the sides for a DIY suit bag.) Death to moths Clothes moths seem to be becoming more prevalent in UK homes, with figures from pest control firm Rentokil showing that moth-related callouts increased 60% from May 2014 to May 2018. Winston-Hart admits to hating moths. She doesn\u2019t have much time for conventional solutions such as mothballs or paper discs. \u201cI think they\u2019re rubbish. Visit your local tree surgeon and ask them for a lump of cedarwood, stick it in your wardrobe, and the moths won\u2019t go near it.\u201d She also recommends lining your drawers with lavender-scented paper. If you have unearthed a vintage find, but are worried that it may have moth eggs in it, put it in a plastic bag and stick it in the freezer for several days to kill eggs or larvae. Use treatments to protect shoes and clothes To get the most out of your footwear, ensure you look after the leather. \u201cI tend to wear Timberland boots,\u201d Ross tells me, \u201cand every six weeks I wash off the dirt and put on a leather conditioner to keep them going for longer.\u201d (He favours a brand called Nikwax.) It is not just footwear that you can treat to make it last longer: brands such as Polygiene use silver chloride technology, which is antimicrobial, to put a finish on fabrics. \u201cIf you have the finish on a polyester T-shirt, you can wear it for five years before it starts smelling,\u201d claims Ross. Support your local tailor and cobbler \u201cI have a deep relationship with my local tailor,\u201d says De Castro. Once a year, she sorts through all her items, and then takes them in for repairs. \u201cThey\u2019ll fix niggly things such as dropped hems, change the zips on evening gowns, or take things in and let them out.\u201d When a pair of shoes starts to wear out, consider whether they can be resoled. Ross has worn the same pair of outdoor boots since 1985: the soles have been replaced six times. Have a go yourself It is easy to do basic repairs yourself. \u201cIf you want to start repairing things and you\u2019re not sure how to go about it, try out on some scrap fabric first,\u201d says repairs expect Tom van Deijnen of the Visible Mending Programme. He recommends watching YouTube videos to learn basic skills, and asking family and friends for help. \u201cIn my experience, mothers and grandmothers always come up trumps,\u201d he says. With worn-out jeans, Van Deijnen recommends sewing on patches. \u201cUse a similar colour fabric, in the same weight as the original material \u2013 if it\u2019s a woven fabric, patch it with a woven fabric, and if it\u2019s a jersey fabric, use a jersey patch.\u201d A common mistake people make when darning knitwear is to do it too tightly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t leave room for shrinking \u2013 sometimes threads can shrink when they are new. And if you pull the hole too tight, it can also cause a pucker, which creates tension in the fabric, meaning it will rip again.\u201d Van Deijnen explains the best way to sew on a button. \u201cThread the needle, make some stitches in the fabric, then attach the button and sew it on. Do it a good few times. When you\u2019ve finished, tug on the thread. If it comes loose, you didn\u2019t do a good job.\u201d Know when to admit defeat Not every item can be repaired. \u201cI\u2019m quite adventurous and I\u2019ll always give things ago, but sometimes things can be completely beyond repair,\u201d says Van Deijnen. He recently had to bin a knitted tie that was riddled with moth eggs. The fabric disintegrated in his hands when he touched it, so he had no choice. When something can\u2019t be fixed, think of alternate uses for it. \u201cEverything can have another function at the end of its life,\u201d says De Castro. She cuts up old swimsuits to use as hair ties (old tights are also good for this). And old T-shirts make the best cleaning rags. Donate intelligently. \u201cCharity shops are brimming with our clothes,\u201d says De Castro, \u201cso you should only donate to charity what you think will sell. Otherwise, you\u2019re dumping your problem on another organisation.\u201d If you know it won\u2019t sell \u2013 perhaps because it is old gym kit \u2013 take it to a textile-recycling bank where it can be turned into a new item. (Trainers can be recycled at branches of Runners Need.) The Love Your Clothes campaign has a textile bank locator, along with other resources, on its website. When it comes to vintage, beware If you want your clothes to last, it can make sense to buy vintage: things made before 1980 tend to be made to a higher standard than modern items. \u201cEven cheaply made 1970s trousers, if you turn them inside out, will resemble couture now,\u201d says De Castro. But there is also a lot of factory-made fake vintage out there. How to tell? Look at details such as zips \u2013 is there a hook and eye to keep the zip in place? If not, it may be a fake. Other signs include 40s-style dresses with elasticated fabric \u2013 stretchy material wasn\u2019t around then. Look after your vintage. \u201cArmpit shields are really good,\u201d says Winston-Hart. \u201cThey\u2019re just cotton half-moons you attach with safety pins to your clothing under the armpits. You remove the pins and wash the pads themselves \u2013 which saves you having to wash the garment all the time.\u201d Wearing a slip under a skirt means you don\u2019t have to clean the skirt as often, as it is not touching your skin, cutting down on dry cleaning costs and reducing wear. If the slip is made out of silk, it will also help to regulate your body temperature. There are so many places to find secondhand treasures, whether it is a clothes swap with friends, charity shops or car boot sales. If you are a vintage aficionado, Winston-Hart recommends her favourite stores: Apple Tree Vintage, 1940s Style For You, Scarlet Rage Vintage, Blackout Vintage Fashion and Hunky Dory Vintage. (Many have online stores.) If vintage isn\u2019t your thing, find more contemporary secondhand pieces on eBay or Depop. Sometimes, buying new clothes can be a sustainable choice \u2013 Hiut Denim will do free repairs on your jeans for life. It is not just about buying vintage or secondhand clothes. Ross talks about \u201cemotional durability,\u201d or the attachment to our most beloved clothes, because the most sustainable item in your wardrobe isn\u2019t always the one that is ethically produced from non-polluting fabrics. It is the one you love, and will wear your whole life.",

Simon Bottery, a senior fellow at the King\u2019s Fund thinktank, recalls: \u201cThe Conservatives proposed a \u2018cap and floor\u2019 model. That would have capped the amount someone might have had to pay during their lifetime for care and the floor would have raised the amount of assets that someone could have had \u2013 from \u00a323,250 to \u00a3100,000 in cash and property. That is, more people would have been entitled to free personal care.</p> <p>\u201cThese proposals created a political firestorm for the Conservatives. The public looked at them and thought they weren\u2019t very generous and didn\u2019t realise that they were in fact more generous than the current system. The Conservatives\u2019 20-point polling lead shrunk to just two points within days.\u201d</p> <p>That was largely because the plans were labelled a \u201cdementia tax\u201d.

It has proven politically fraught since 1999, when the Labour government-appointed Sutherland commission recommended free personal care for everyone with eligible needs in the UK. Scotland brought it in but the UK parliament rejected it for England and Wales because of the cost involved. Clearly the cost is a factor in the government inaction we\u2019ve seen over the last 20 years.\u201d</p> <p>That is also why the green paper on social care, first due in 2017, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/04/matt-hancock-social-care-green-paper-partisan-politics-health\">has still </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/04/matt-hancock-social-care-green-paper-partisan-politics-health\">not been published</a>.</p> <p>Helen Buckingham, the director of strategy at the Nuffield Trust thinktank, says that while spending \u00a37bn a year on a universal free personal care system is not cheap, it is a fraction of the NHS budget, which is due to hit \u00a3148.5bn by 2023-24. That would arguably be \u00a37bn well-spent given that inadequate social care costs the NHS billions because poorly cared-for older people are more likely to need hospital care for a broken limb, infection or pressure sores.</p> <p>So what are Johnson\u2019s options for reform? Free personal care may appeal because of its growing cross-party support, says Harry Quilter-Pinner, a senior research fellow at the IPPR. </p> <p>\u201cAnother alternative is a more generous means test and a cap on care costs as proposed in the Conservatives\u2019 2017 manifesto. This would guarantee that no one would face catastrophic care cost of \u00a3100,000 or more and would be marginally cheaper than free personal care at an additional \u00a35bn per annum by 2020\u201321. However, it is regressive, with additional resources primarily focused on protecting the wealth of homeowners.\u201d</p> <p>Buckingham adds: \u201cOne option on the table could be a compulsory insurance scheme, as seen in Germany. Or we could learn from Japan, which funds its system through a mixture of compulsory insurance payments for those aged over 40. </p> <p>\u201cIt includes contributions from pensions, taxes and payments by individuals, which are capped to ensure no one pays excessive amounts. Another option would be to simply fund it through taxes, like the NHS.\u201d</p> <p>Under May, the government was understood to be keen to bring in a system of voluntary insurance. While experts believed that would leave too many people still unable to cover care costs, Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, believed it was the only scheme the Treasury would back given the cost of more radical options.</p> <p>However, Johnson is understood to have rejected voluntary insurance. Well-placed sources say he has told Hancock to undertake \u201ca fundamental and much more ambitious rethink\u201d of the proposals in the unpublished green paper, and warned Sajid Javid, the chancellor, to be prepared to put significant sums of government money behind whatever solution emerges.</p> <p>There are other problems in social care beyond the increasingly unmet need, including a rise in care home closures and more than 100,000 vacancies in the workforce. But if Johnson\u2019s intention to be bolder than before is true, then he may yet come up with an ambitious \u2013 and expensive \u2013 solution to one of the country\u2019s longest-running challenges.</p> <p>He has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/25/boris-johnson-first-speech-as-pm-what-is-he-promising\">pledged to help and improve the NHS</a>. A speech in the next few days is expected to flesh out what he told MPs last week would be plans for \u201curgent funding for 20 hospital upgrades and winter-readiness \u2026 [and] policy proposals for drastically reducing waiting times and for GP appointments\u201d.</p> <p>The increasingly decrepit state of many hospitals has become a matter of acute concern for NHS bosses, with the bill for repairs now about \u00a36bn. Years of ministers diverting money from the service\u2019s capital budget into its day-to-day running costs have left it unable to even undertake repairs deemed a safety risk. </p> <p>Some hospitals, such as St Mary\u2019s in London, are so archaic they probably need to be demolished and rebuilt to provide facilities fit to house the world-class care outlined in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/07/what-is-the-nhs-long-term-plan-and-can-it-achieve-its-aims\">NHS long-term plan</a>.</p> <p>Reducing waiting-times for NHS treatment \u2013 for emergency, GP and cancer care and non-urgent operations \u2013 is a political imperative as public irritation continues to grow. However it will not be easy as the main problem is chronic staff shortages, the solution to which, experts say, requires more than money.</p>",

So what are Johnson\u2019s options for reform? Free personal care may appeal because of its growing cross-party support, says Harry Quilter-Pinner, a senior research fellow at the IPPR. \u201cAnother alternative is a more generous means test and a cap on care costs as proposed in the Conservatives\u2019 2017 manifesto. This would guarantee that no one would face catastrophic care cost of \u00a3100,000 or more and would be marginally cheaper than free personal care at an additional \u00a35bn per annum by 2020\u201321. However, it is regressive, with additional resources primarily focused on protecting the wealth of homeowners.\u201d Buckingham adds: \u201cOne option on the table could be a compulsory insurance scheme, as seen in Germany. Or we could learn from Japan, which funds its system through a mixture of compulsory insurance payments for those aged over 40. \u201cIt includes contributions from pensions, taxes and payments by individuals, which are capped to ensure no one pays excessive amounts. Another option would be to simply fund it through taxes, like the NHS.\u201d Under May, the government was understood to be keen to bring in a system of voluntary insurance. While experts believed that would leave too many people still unable to cover care costs, Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, believed it was the only scheme the Treasury would back given the cost of more radical options. However, Johnson is understood to have rejected voluntary insurance. Well-placed sources say he has told Hancock to undertake \u201ca fundamental and much more ambitious rethink\u201d of the proposals in the unpublished green paper, and warned Sajid Javid, the chancellor, to be prepared to put significant sums of government money behind whatever solution emerges. There are other problems in social care beyond the increasingly unmet need, including a rise in care home closures and more than 100,000 vacancies in the workforce. But if Johnson\u2019s intention to be bolder than before is true, then he may yet come up with an ambitious \u2013 and expensive \u2013 solution to one of the country\u2019s longest-running challenges. He has also pledged to help and improve the NHS. A speech in the next few days is expected to flesh out what he told MPs last week would be plans for \u201curgent funding for 20 hospital upgrades and winter-readiness \u2026 [and] policy proposals for drastically reducing waiting times and for GP appointments\u201d. The increasingly decrepit state of many hospitals has become a matter of acute concern for NHS bosses, with the bill for repairs now about \u00a36bn. Years of ministers diverting money from the service\u2019s capital budget into its day-to-day running costs have left it unable to even undertake repairs deemed a safety risk. Some hospitals, such as St Mary\u2019s in London, are so archaic they probably need to be demolished and rebuilt to provide facilities fit to house the world-class care outlined in the NHS long-term plan. Reducing waiting-times for NHS treatment \u2013 for emergency, GP and cancer care and non-urgent operations \u2013 is a political imperative as public irritation continues to grow. However it will not be easy as the main problem is chronic staff shortages, the solution to which, experts say, requires more than money.",

As the American Psychological Association\u2019s Dr Kathleen Ashton says in an email, \u201cThere is little evidence to support sharing advice over social media as being effective treatment for health conditions.\u201d (The APA is currently working on professional practice guidelines for social media use.)</p> <p>It can also be hard to separate those who have proper qualifications from charlatans: it\u2019s up to users to determine the suitability of those whom they follow. Many also seem to blur psychoeducation with other wellness concepts, such as self-care or life coaching.</p> <p>Yet the phenomenon\u2019s popularity indicates many find it beneficial. Plenty of comments beneath posts demonstrate that if you relate to the content in question, you\u2019re far from alone. The trend also destigmatizes and demystifies therapy, and conveys there is no shame in reaching out to a professional.</p> <p>The ability to access low-barrier mental health information on Instagram can also be especially valuable to people from cultures in which therapy is seen as taboo.</p> <p>\u201cI think for a lot of people of color and people from other marginalized groups, therapy in general may still seem like a very weird concept,\u201d says Atlanta-based psychologist Dr Joy Harden Bradford. Bradford\u2019s organization, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/therapyforblackgirls/\">Therapy for Black Girls</a>, offers its audience mental health resources in the form of articles and podcasts, as well as a directory of over 1,400 therapists.</p> <p>On Instagram, Therapy for Black Girls posts are created with the intent to \u201chelp people understand the breadth and the depth of what therapy could be like \u2026 and how psychology is part of our everyday life\u201d, explains Bradford.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"m\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

      "bodyText": "In 2017, California therapist Lisa Olivera made her first post to her Instagram account. \u201cI am here to share bits of wisdom, tools for well-being, and reflection on topics related to self-worth, vulnerability, shame/guilt \u2026\u201d she wrote beneath a selfie. Today, her feed is followed by over 215,000 people, and represents just one of a growing subset of Instagram accounts run by licensed therapists and used to share mental health self-care tips and food for thought. Last month, this group was shaken when American media coverage of the movement referred to it as \u201cInsta-therapy\u201d, with one outlet extrapolating that in the future, therapy could mean \u201cscrolling through Instagram rather than sitting in an office\u201d. According to an essay Olivera self-published on Medium, many people, herself included, took issue with the phrase \u201cInsta-therapy\u201d and the implications therein. \u201c\u2018Insta-therapy,\u2019\u201d writes Olivera, \u201cis, quite frankly, not a thing.\u201d Therapy is a highly engaged relationship between a patient and a professional \u2013 it\u2019s often of critical importance to those coping with mental illness, and can involve intense vulnerability. Therapists engaging directly with individuals through a social media site would be inappropriate and unethical. The more accurate description of the work Olivera and her peers do online, then, may be Insta-psychoeducation. The distinction is important. Therapists like Olivera, Nicole LePera (who has 644,000 followers) and Nedra Tawwab (109,000 followers), are sharing psychological insights that may be broadly useful to those interested in improving their mental health. Some posts may define terms like \u201cgaslighting\u201d, or \u201cemotional enmeshment\u201d. Others may offer lists of traits commonly associated with codependency or anxiety. They may simply offer vague inspirational tidbits (random sample: \u201cAn important step for growth is giving yourself permission to grow.\u201d) Therapists on Instagram, Olivera says, are \u201cchanging the paradigm of therapy, offering support to those who might not otherwise have it, sharing supportive resources and tips on accessing therapy, and creating conversations around what it means to be human\u201d. They are not intended to treat or diagnose \u2013 which is for the best. As the American Psychological Association\u2019s Dr Kathleen Ashton says in an email, \u201cThere is little evidence to support sharing advice over social media as being effective treatment for health conditions.\u201d (The APA is currently working on professional practice guidelines for social media use.) It can also be hard to separate those who have proper qualifications from charlatans: it\u2019s up to users to determine the suitability of those whom they follow. Many also seem to blur psychoeducation with other wellness concepts, such as self-care or life coaching. Yet the phenomenon\u2019s popularity indicates many find it beneficial. Plenty of comments beneath posts demonstrate that if you relate to the content in question, you\u2019re far from alone. The trend also destigmatizes and demystifies therapy, and conveys there is no shame in reaching out to a professional. The ability to access low-barrier mental health information on Instagram can also be especially valuable to people from cultures in which therapy is seen as taboo. \u201cI think for a lot of people of color and people from other marginalized groups, therapy in general may still seem like a very weird concept,\u201d says Atlanta-based psychologist Dr Joy Harden Bradford. Bradford\u2019s organization, Therapy for Black Girls, offers its audience mental health resources in the form of articles and podcasts, as well as a directory of over 1,400 therapists. On Instagram, Therapy for Black Girls posts are created with the intent to \u201chelp people understand the breadth and the depth of what therapy could be like \u2026 and how psychology is part of our everyday life\u201d, explains Bradford. \u201cMy Chinese culture is definitely not receptive of therapy and doesn\u2019t see its value,\u201d says Alice Ko. An entrepreneur and self-described \u201ctherapy and self help nerd\u201d, Ko enjoys following therapists on Instagram for what she calls \u201cpocket real-talk\u201d, a sort of on-the-go alternative to reading self-help books. \u201cI often get in fights with family members when I try to describe the benefits of therapy,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that Instagram accounts are a really good way for people from these cultures to be introduced to therapy in a gentle way.\u201d That therapists using Instagram seems strange at all may amount to rapidly changing norms. \u201cI was told it was safer to just not be on Instagram by my professors,\u201d says 27-year-old Vancouver-based therapist Erin Davidson, who recently graduated with her MA in counseling psychology. \u201cI didn\u2019t really share that perspective.

      "body": "<p>In a distant echo of a medieval monarch\u2019s royal progress around the realm, Boris Johnson has been journeying on a prime ministerial grand tour around the country to show his new subjects who is boss. Last weekend it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/27/critics-doubt-boris-johnson-can-deliver-new-rail-route-pledge\" title=\"\">northern England</a>; on Monday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/28/boris-johnson-heads-to-scotland-to-deliver-300m-pledge\" title=\"\">Scotland</a>; Tuesday was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/30/boris-johnson-prime-minister-brexit-news-warned-no-deal-brexit-could-lead-to-farmers-blocking-roads-in-protest-live-news\" title=\"\">Wales</a> day and Wednesday was the turn of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/31/boris-johnson-holds-talks-in-belfast-as-sinn-fein-says-border-poll-must-follow-no-deal-brexit-live-news\" title=\"\">Northern Ireland</a>.</p> <p>These visits contained none of the celebratory pageants that would have been expected in the middle ages. Instead, the new leader was whisked in and then out again. Much of the tour has been controlled. Journalists were mostly kept at a distance. In the streets, boos seem to have been more common than cheers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is hard to dispute the widening gulf between current reality and the rhetoric of Johnson\u2019s \u2018awesome foursome'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Like Theresa May did, Johnson talks the talk about holding the United Kingdom together amid the disruption of Brexit. He has even cast himself as minister for the union. But it is hard to dispute the widening gulf between current reality and the rhetoric of both May\u2019s \u201cprecious union\u201d and Johnson\u2019s \u201cawesome foursome\u201d. Tours like Johnson\u2019s only emphasise that this union is increasingly divided \u2013 and perhaps even breaking apart.</p> <p>Politically, by far the most urgent stop on Johnson\u2019s tour was in Northern Ireland. The most fraught of the visits was probably the one to Scotland.

      "bodyText": "In a distant echo of a medieval monarch\u2019s royal progress around the realm, Boris Johnson has been journeying on a prime ministerial grand tour around the country to show his new subjects who is boss. Last weekend it was northern England; on Monday, Scotland; Tuesday was Wales day and Wednesday was the turn of Northern Ireland. These visits contained none of the celebratory pageants that would have been expected in the middle ages. Instead, the new leader was whisked in and then out again. Much of the tour has been controlled. Journalists were mostly kept at a distance. In the streets, boos seem to have been more common than cheers. Like Theresa May did, Johnson talks the talk about holding the United Kingdom together amid the disruption of Brexit. He has even cast himself as minister for the union. But it is hard to dispute the widening gulf between current reality and the rhetoric of both May\u2019s \u201cprecious union\u201d and Johnson\u2019s \u201cawesome foursome\u201d. Tours like Johnson\u2019s only emphasise that this union is increasingly divided \u2013 and perhaps even breaking apart. Politically, by far the most urgent stop on Johnson\u2019s tour was in Northern Ireland. The most fraught of the visits was probably the one to Scotland. But in many ways the most telling trip was Johnson\u2019s foray into Wales on Tuesday, when he cuddled a chicken in Newport, visited a retail company in Brecon and met Wales\u2019s Labour first minister, Mark Drakeford, in Cardiff before heading to Belfast. Wales was not included in the Johnsonian progress merely for completeness\u2019s sake. It was also there because of Thursday\u2019s byelection in the vast and lovely mid-Wales rural constituency of Brecon and Radnorshire. The result will test whether there is the Johnson bounce for the Tory party that his supporters crave, or whether Jo Swinson will be celebrating a Liberal Democrat recapture of a seat that the old Liberal party first won in a famous 1985 byelection. Yet Wales should never be overlooked. In discussions about the UK\u2019s constitutional and political distresses, Wales is all too often treated as an afterthought. The reasons are not hard to see. Modern Wales has endured little of the existential pain of Northern Ireland. The nationalist cause has never carved through Welsh politics the way it has in Scotland. Wales has been welded to England for far longer than the other nations. And its support for devolution was often lukewarm. Yet amid the more eye-catching convulsions of Brexit elsewhere, the old idea that nothing is likely to change in the relationship between Wales and England is looking lazy.

But the unruly and often contentious evening produced no clear winner, as some onstage cautioned against losing sight of the party\u2019s real target \u2013 Trump.</p> \n<p>Here are the key takeaways:</p> \n<h2><strong>The People v</strong><strong> Joe Biden</strong></h2> \n<p>Democratic candidates piled on their criticisms of Biden, who continues to lead the polls, on issues ranging from healthcare and immigration to criminal justice and gender equality.</p> \n<p>It was a clear bid to knock the former vice-president from his frontrunner status and expose his potential weaknesses \u2013 as the California senator Kamala Harris so successfully did in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/28/joe-bidens-harsh-lesson-when-youre-on-top-the-only-way-to-go-is-down\">last month\u2019s debate in Miami, Florida</a>. But this time, Biden was better prepared for the onslaught and repeatedly turned the tables on his opponents.</p> \n<p>Early on, Biden took on the role of aggressor as he criticized <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/politics/kamala-harris-health-care-plan/index.html\">Harris\u2019s healthcare plan</a> as too costly while questioning its 10-year implementation period. \u201cAnytime somebody tells you you\u2019re going to get something good in 10 years, you should wonder why it takes 10 years,\u201d Biden said.</p> \n<p>Harris shot back that Biden\u2019s own healthcare proposal would leave behind roughly 10 million Americans, but she found herself mostly on the defensive, as other candidates took swings at her plan \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/31/healthcare-democrats-2020-debates-detroit\">dubbed </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/31/healthcare-democrats-2020-debates-detroit\"> \u201cMedicare</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/31/healthcare-democrats-2020-debates-detroit\"> for</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/31/healthcare-democrats-2020-debates-detroit\"> All Lite\u201d</a> by some critics.</p> \n<h2><strong>Biden \u2026 30330?</strong></h2> \n<p>Biden, who is known for being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/25/joe-biden-2020-public-gaffes-mistakes-history\">gaffe-prone</a>, somehow managed to bungle his closing statement.</p> \n<p>Biden initially warned that four more years of Donald Trump would \u201cgo down as an aberration\u201d, repeating a line he has often used on the campaign trail. He then said \u201ceight more years\u201d of Trump would \u201cchange America in a fundamental way\u201d.</p> \n<p>There will obviously not be another eight years of Trump, given that presidents are limited to two terms. Biden\u2019s intent was clearly to say that a second Trump term would mean eight years in total, thus reshaping the country in an indelible way. He just didn\u2019t quite land the delivery.</p> \n<p>But his verbal stumbles did not end there.</p> \n<p>In closing, he asked viewers to \u201cGo to Joe 3-0-3-3-0 and help me in this fight\u201d. Other candidates had just promoted their websites in a bid for donations; but Biden, rather than direct people to his campaign site, accidentally read the number individuals can text to get involved in his campaign. And in doing so, he failed to explain where exactly people should go to support his candidacy.</p> \n<p>For a brief moment, it looked as though Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign had bought the <a href=\"http://joe30330.com\">Joe30330.com</a> URL. But later the domain redirected to a previously unheard of and self-described \u201cGen Z\u2019er\u201d known as Josh.</p> \n<h2><strong>Cory Booker finds his voice</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8779b9bbe7b7832b7ab3ef2693bf036cf3fd1c3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8779b9bbe7b7832b7ab3ef2693bf036cf3fd1c3/0_4_2412_1448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cory Booker won applause for criticism of Joe Biden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cory Booker won applause for criticism of Joe Biden.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Cory Booker has struggled to gain traction since launching his campaign in February, despite ranking among the Democratic party\u2019s rising stars.

The New York senator barely qualified for the first two Democratic debates and was banking on a big night in Detroit.</p> \n<p>The results were mixed.</p> \n<p>On the one hand, Gillibrand was able to tout her work addressing women\u2019s economic issues, reproductive rights and helping secure permanent health benefits for 9/11 first responders.</p> \n<p>She also landed one of the night\u2019s standout zingers when asked about her first order if business should she replace Trump. \u201cThe first thing I am going to do when I am president is Clorox the Oval Office,\u201d Gillibrand said to laughter and applause.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SenGillibrand/status/1156743873047269376\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Step one: Clorox the Oval Office.<br>Step two: Restore US climate leadership and act to fight climate change.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DemDebate?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DemDebate</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/UR4wq39NJC\">pic.twitter.com/UR4wq39NJC</a></p>\u2014 Kirsten Gillibrand (@SenGillibrand) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenGillibrand/status/1156743873047269376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 1, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>But other moments did not go as expected.

      "bodyText": "Joe Biden fended off multiple attacks at the second Democratic presidential debate in Detroit on Wednesday night, as the party\u2019s contenders to take on Donald Trump in 2020 jockeyed to position themselves as a clear alternative to the current frontrunner. Following Tuesday\u2019s debate, which pitted a slew of moderates against the progressive leaders Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, Wednesday night\u2019s debate saw Biden almost single-handedly commanding the centrist lane. But the unruly and often contentious evening produced no clear winner, as some onstage cautioned against losing sight of the party\u2019s real target \u2013 Trump. Here are the key takeaways: The People v Joe Biden Democratic candidates piled on their criticisms of Biden, who continues to lead the polls, on issues ranging from healthcare and immigration to criminal justice and gender equality. It was a clear bid to knock the former vice-president from his frontrunner status and expose his potential weaknesses \u2013 as the California senator Kamala Harris so successfully did in last month\u2019s debate in Miami, Florida. But this time, Biden was better prepared for the onslaught and repeatedly turned the tables on his opponents. Early on, Biden took on the role of aggressor as he criticized Harris\u2019s healthcare plan as too costly while questioning its 10-year implementation period. \u201cAnytime somebody tells you you\u2019re going to get something good in 10 years, you should wonder why it takes 10 years,\u201d Biden said. Harris shot back that Biden\u2019s own healthcare proposal would leave behind roughly 10 million Americans, but she found herself mostly on the defensive, as other candidates took swings at her plan \u2013 dubbed \u201cMedicare for All Lite\u201d by some critics. Biden \u2026 30330? Biden, who is known for being gaffe-prone, somehow managed to bungle his closing statement. Biden initially warned that four more years of Donald Trump would \u201cgo down as an aberration\u201d, repeating a line he has often used on the campaign trail. He then said \u201ceight more years\u201d of Trump would \u201cchange America in a fundamental way\u201d. There will obviously not be another eight years of Trump, given that presidents are limited to two terms. Biden\u2019s intent was clearly to say that a second Trump term would mean eight years in total, thus reshaping the country in an indelible way. He just didn\u2019t quite land the delivery. But his verbal stumbles did not end there. In closing, he asked viewers to \u201cGo to Joe 3-0-3-3-0 and help me in this fight\u201d. Other candidates had just promoted their websites in a bid for donations; but Biden, rather than direct people to his campaign site, accidentally read the number individuals can text to get involved in his campaign. And in doing so, he failed to explain where exactly people should go to support his candidacy. For a brief moment, it looked as though Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign had bought the Joe30330.com URL. But later the domain redirected to a previously unheard of and self-described \u201cGen Z\u2019er\u201d known as Josh. Cory Booker finds his voice Cory Booker has struggled to gain traction since launching his campaign in February, despite ranking among the Democratic party\u2019s rising stars. But on Wednesday, the New Jersey senator made several moments his own. In one exchange, Booker took a shot at Biden for selectively invoking Obama only when it was \u201cconvenient\u201d. Although Biden countered by accusing Booker of engaging in controversial \u201cstop and frisk\u201d policies as the former mayor of Newark, Booker was ready and waiting to punch back. \u201cYou\u2019re dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don\u2019t even know the flavor,\u201d Booker said, drawing both laughter and applause from the crowd. Booker, one of two black 2020 presidential candidates, also drew praise from the audience for referencing voter suppression. When moderators asked how Democrats planned to win back the state of Michigan, which Trump carried in 2016, Booker said the party lost because \u201ceverybody from Republicans to Russians were targeting the suppression of African American voters\u201d. \u201cWe need to have a campaign that is ready for what\u2019s coming,\u201d he added, \u201can all-out assault, especially on the most valuable voter group \u2013 in fact, the highest-performing voter group in our coalition, which is black women.\u201d Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s make-or-break moment Despite her prominence in the Senate, Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s campaign has hardly taken off. The New York senator barely qualified for the first two Democratic debates and was banking on a big night in Detroit. The results were mixed. On the one hand, Gillibrand was able to tout her work addressing women\u2019s economic issues, reproductive rights and helping secure permanent health benefits for 9/11 first responders. She also landed one of the night\u2019s standout zingers when asked about her first order if business should she replace Trump. \u201cThe first thing I am going to do when I am president is Clorox the Oval Office,\u201d Gillibrand said to laughter and applause. But other moments did not go as expected. Gillibrand\u2019s campaign had telegraphed plans to attack Biden for writing a 1981 op-ed against expanding a child tax credit. In her framing at the debate, Gillibrand suggested Biden had said women working outside the home would contribute to \u201cthe deterioration of the family\u201d. Biden rejected Gillibrand\u2019s characterization, stating he did not oppose an expansion of the child tax credit in its entirety \u2013 but rather he opposed expanding it to high-income families. Biden pointed out Gillibrand had long praised his work on gender quality. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened except you\u2019re now running for president,\u201d Biden told Gillibrand.",

Some of those charged were as young as 16 and included a Cathay Pacific pilot.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from me in Detroit. Here are some of the key takeaways from tonight: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris repeatedly came under attack from their lower-polling opponents for their records on criminal justice and proposals on health care. Biden seemed to fend off the attacks more successfully than he did last time around, but expectations were pretty low for the former vice president following his dismal first performance. In one memorable exchange, Biden and Cory Booker criticized each other for their records on criminal justice. Booker blamed Biden for the effects of the 1994 crime bill, while Biden said Booker had not done enough as mayor of Newark. The fall debate seemed to loom large over tonight\u2019s stage. Several candidates are at risk of not making the cut for the next debate, and attacking Harris and Biden appeared to be at least partly meant to attract more interest and donors. The live blog will be back online tomorrow morning with our usual coverage, so be sure to return for that. And thanks for following along with our live coverage tonight and last night. The progressive group Democracy for America put out a statement declaring, \u201cThe real winner of tonight\u2019s debate was Tuesday night\u2019s debate.\u201d \u201cOn Tuesday, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren not only delivered strong performances, they teamed up to articulate a bold, inclusive populist vision for the future of the country that Democrats need to beat Trump AND deliver a transformative win in 2020,\u201d the group\u2019s CEO, Yvette Simpson, said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get that tonight.\u201d Simpson specifically said Joe Biden and Kamala Harris had fallen short on the debate stage. \u201cJoe Biden repeatedly showed that he\u2019s our party\u2019s past, and failed to get the big win he needed to solidify his status as frontrunner. He was embattled by many challengers, which led to forced errors that will be difficult to recover from. \u201cKamala Harris struggled and will likely emerge from Detroit weakened by her failure to fully defend her record on criminal justice reform and her overly-complicated, \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 plan that was easily attacked from all sides.\u201d Tulsi Gabbard kept up her criticisms of Kamala Harris in a CNN interview after the debate. Host Anderson Cooper replayed a clip of Gabbard pushing Harris about her record as California\u2019s attorney general. When asked what she thought of the exchange, Gabbard said, \u201cShe never answered the question.\u201d Gabbard also claimed many California families have \u201cdirectly suffered ... because of the decisions she made as attorney general.\u201d Cooper also referenced Harris\u2019s post-debate comments about Gabbard. Harris dismissed Gabbard\u2019s criticisms because she is an \u201capologist\u201d for Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president who has used chemical weapons against civilians. Gabbard said Harris \u201cresorts to cheap smears rather than addressing her record.\u201d But when pushed on her 2017 meeting with Assad, Gabbard said she would never apologize for trying to prevent more US wars -- even if that meant meeting with a murderous leader. Cooper repeatedly pushed her on whether she recognized that Assad was a murderer and a torturer. \u201cI don\u2019t dispute that,\u201d Gabbard eventually said. Donald Trump once again weighed in on the debates to unsurprisingly argue that he is the only candidate who can continue America\u2019s prosperity. Ironically, the message came hours after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to reflect the slowing growth of the US economy. Kamala Harris also brushed off concerns about Joe Biden referring to her as \u201ckid\u201d when the two front-runners took the debate stage. The vice president greeted Harris tonight by saying, \u201cGo easy on me, kid.\u201d The comment irked some viewers, including this vice president at Emily\u2019s List: But Harris told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper that she didn\u2019t pay much attention to Biden\u2019s comment. \u201cI didn\u2019t really think much about it,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe\u2019re both on that stage running for president \u2026 nobody\u2019s going to define me on that stage.\u201d Tulsi Gabbard went after Kamala Harris during the debate for her record as California\u2019s attorney general. But Harris isn\u2019t taking those criticisms too seriously. The California senator said she expected to take hits tonight because she is a \u201ctop-tier candidate\u201d and many of her opponents are trying to make the fall debate. She went on to slam Gabbard as an \u201capologist\u201d for Bashar al-Assad, noting the Syrian president\u2019s use of chemical weapons against civilians. Gabbard met with Assad in 2017 and has since said he is \u201cnot the enemy of the United States.\u201d \u201cI can only take her opinion so seriously,\u201d Harris said. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders may not have been debating tonight, but they still weighed heavily on Twitter\u2019s mind. They were among the most-tweeted about candidates tonight: The 11th participant tonight seemed to be the heightened requirements for the fall debate, which lurked just offstage tormenting most of the candidates. Of those participating tonight, only Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker have met both requirements needed to participate in the September debate. Two other candidates -- Andrew Yang and Juli\u00e1n Castro -- have met the donor requirement but have not yet crossed the polling threshold. For the seven candidates who have not yet made the cut, tonight could be their final debate, a possibility that appeared to weigh on them all night. It was certainly on the minds of Bill de Blasio, Kirsten Gillibransd and Tulsi Gabbard as they repeatedly launched attacks against the front-runners. When closing statements came around, most of those seven candidates plugged their campaign websites in the hope of attracting more donors and supporters. Gillibrand specifically asked for help \u201cso I can make the next debate stage.\u201d But that direct plea may have paid off. Gillibrand\u2019s deputy communications director just tweeted this: The closing remarks are over, and the snap verdicts are in. Overall the wind seems to be blowing in Cory Booker\u2019s favor after he took Joe Biden to task, but not everyone agrees: Meanwhile, some viewers called it for a candidate who wasn\u2019t on stage: And get ready for this, Trump\u2019s campaign manager is calling it for \u2013 can you guess? As the debate was still unfolding, Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign put out a statement slamming Joe Biden for his reversal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \u201cJoe Biden was a big cheerleader for the TPP, and was even a \u2018key surrogate for the Obama administration in their effort to build support on Capitol Hill,\u2019\u201d the campaign said in a statement, quoting from a 2015 NBC News story. \u201cUntil tonight, when Biden just said he would not rejoin the agreement as it was.\u201d Biden said in response to a question about the trade agreement that he would \u201crenegotiate\u201d TPP, even though he was one of its main proponents as Obama\u2019s vice president. But Trump now has his own record he has to run on when it comes to trade. His tariffs, which have proven unpopular with many of the farmers they\u2019re ostensibly intended to help, could weaken this TPP talking point against Biden if he becomes the nominee. Immediately after the debate ended, pundits started making the case that Joe Biden had done ... better at least? After the former vice president\u2019s disastrous first performance, expectations were pretty low going into tonight. But he did manage to fend off some of his opponents\u2019 attacks, partly by accusing them of trying to simply attract attention by bashing him. \u201cI love your affection for me,\u201d Biden sarcastically told Bill de Blasio after the New York mayor tried to launch yet another line of attack against him. It\u2019s hard to tell what Biden\u2019s strategy will be for the fall debate, when many of these struggling candidates will have likely dropped out. But it\u2019s worth noting that Biden has yet to face off against an opponent who has already guaranteed her spot in the next debate: Elizabeth Warren. Joe Biden was the last to deliver his closing remarks tonight, and got right to the last sentence before managing to both confuse (and amuse) everyone. After every candidate took the opportunity in their remarks to reel off their website and urge viewers to visit it, Biden looked into the camera and said \u201cIf you agree with me go to Joe 30330\u201d. What is Joe 30330? It seems like he meant to say \u201cText Joe to 30330\u201d. But instead, he\u2019s accidentally created one of the most talked about moments of the night, at least on Twitter. Tonight\u2019s debate seemed defined by candidates attacking Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on their records. Biden was criticized for his major role in crafting the 1994 crime bill, while Harris was scrutinized for her handling of prosecutions as California\u2019s attorney general. As the top-polling candidates, the pair were bound to find themselves repeatedly under the microscope. But because of their contentious face-off during the last debate, Biden and Harris could not tag team the other candidates, as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren did the night before. That dynamic, combined with every other candidate except Cory Booker scrambling to make the fall debate stage, left Biden and Harris constantly playing defense. But the Guardian team is sticking around for more analysis of everything that happened tonight. Cory Booker argued that Democrats had to look beyond simply defeating Donald Trump. \u201cThat is the floor and not the ceiling,\u201d Booker said, adding that Democrats had to unit around their \u201ccommon bonds and common purpose.\u201d Kamala Harris took direct aim at Trump, saying the president has a \u201cpredatory nature and predatory instincts.\u201d She once again argued she was the best person to \u201cprosecute the case against four more years.\u201d Joe Biden said the country was \u201cin a battle for the soul of America\u201d and warned that four more years of Trump would change America \u201cin a fundamental way.\u201d In her closing statement, Tulsi Gabbard recounted the false missile alert that Hawaii residents received last year. Juli\u00e1n Castro re-upped his promise to help Americans say \u201cadios\u201d to Donald Trump. Andrew Yang argued he would be the best candidate to help America combat the threat of automaton. Bill de Blasio closed with a pitch for the Democratic Party to be the party that \u201cstands for something\u201d and accused Donald Trump of being the \u201creal socialist\u201d for providing financial assistance to the wealthy. Michael Bennet urged his fellow Democrats to put the \u201cdivisive politics of Donald Trump behind us.\u201d Jay Inslee closed his performance as he opened it: with a plea to confront the climate crisis. Kirsten Gillibrand promised the audience that she knows \u201chow to beat Donald Trump\u201d because he has \u201cbroken his promises to the American people.\u201d All four candidates also referenced their campaign websites, demonstrating their need to attract more interest to make it to the next debate stage. Gillibrand specifically asked for help \u201cso I can make the next debate stage.\u201d Tonight\u2019s debate has followed the pattern established last night of running long. It was originally set to end at 10:30 p.m. EDT, but closing statements are just beginning now. Gillibrand\u2019s 2020 communications director has tweeted the article the senator was quoting from to question Biden on his support for women working outside the home. Gillibrand questioned Biden about an article apparently published under his name in 1981 headlined \u201cCongress Is Subsidizing Deterioration of Family\u201d about a childcare tax credit that would have allowed more women into the workplace. Biden said he opposed the credit because it would have helped higher income families who didn\u2019t need financial assistance. After Michael Bennet expressed concern that Democrats were focusing too much on impeachment, Juli\u00e1n Castro pushed back that some members of their party were \u201cspooked\u201d by 1998, when Bill Clinton was impeached by congressional Republicans. But Castro argued that the times have changed since that 1998 debate and that Democrats must act because Donald Trump would take inaction as evidence of his innocence. Castro also accused Republicans, including \u201cMoscow Mitch,\u201d of enabling the president. CNN host Don Lemon referenced Robert Mueller\u2019s appearance before Congress last week, where the special counsel told lawmakers that Donald Trump could face charges after leaving office. Kamala Harris has previously said her Justice Department would have \u201cno choice\u201d but to prosecute Trump. Harris slightly backed off that tonight, saying she wouldn\u2019t direct the Justice Department to do anything. But she argued Mueller\u2019s report clearly outlined Trump repeatedly obstructing justice, a sentiment that other candidates agreed with. Still on the topic of foreign policy and America\u2019s ongoing wars, Jay Inslee noted that he voted against the Iraq War as a congressman. Moderator Jake Tapper then turned to Joe Biden, who voted in favor of invading Iraq. \u201cI did make a bad judgment\u201d on trusting former president George W. Bush, Biden said. Cory Booker said he would not do \u201cforeign policy by tweet\u201d as Donald Trump has done, but he refused to commit to a timeline on pulling US troops out of Afghanistan. \u201cI will bring our troops home, and I will bring them home as quickly as possible,\u201d Booker said, rejecting any \u201cartificial deadline\u201d that could worsen the situation. Here\u2019s how long each candidate has spoken so far, courtesy of CNN Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris ganged up to slam Joe Biden over past comments about the gender pay gap and the Hyde Amendment. Biden accused Gillibrand of reversing her previous praise to him on women\u2019s issues. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened, except you\u2019re now running for president,\u201d Biden said. The former vice president went on to emphatically state, \u201cI support a women\u2019s right to choose.\u201d The conversation has turned to the gender pay gap. Andrew Yang argued that his proposal for universal basic income would help to compensate women for the \u201cunrecognized and uncompensated work\u201d they do in society. Kamala Harris cited statistics on how women of different races face different pay gaps, with women of color facing steeper differentials. Demanding action, Harris said, \u201cI\u2019m done with the conversation.\u201d Cory Booker has been praised after becoming the first candidate to bring up voter suppression. Author, and Guardian contributor, Ibram X. Kendi, notes: Meanwhile, the journalist Lauren Duca applauded Booker\u2019s passion: It took awhile for the first mention of voter suppression but there has still been no formal question on the topic, as Mother Jones\u2019s Ari Berman has pointed out: Joe Biden said he would \u201crenegotiate\u201d the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that he promoted as Barack Obama\u2019s vice president. When pushed by Bill de Blasio whether Biden would involve labor in those discussions, the former veep responded simply, \u201cYes.\u201d He then mocked de Blasio for repeatedly trying to pick a fight with him. \u201cI love your affection for me,\u201d Biden said. The Guardian\u2019s Oliver Laughland \u2013 who has covered the Eric Garner case that has been the subject of several impassioned exchanges tonight \u2013 writes: Watching the candidates spar over the local and federal response to the in custody death of Eric Garner is a sobering reminder that it has been over five years since the 43 year-old African American was killed by NYPD officers in Staten Island. Garner\u2019s mother, Gwen Carr, was in the beginning stages of her fight for accountability during the Democratic primary season four years ago, when she addressed the Democratic Convention as Hillary Clinton accepted the party\u2019s nomination. But, to this day, Carr and the rest of the Garner family have received no justice. New York City mayor Bill de Blasio was met with chants of \u201cfire Pantaleo\u201d as he began his opening pitch on tonight\u2019s debate stage - a reference to the fact that officer Daniel Pantaleo remains employed by the NYPD, despite having placed Garner in a banned chokehold that contributed to his death. Julian Castro was the first candidate to bring the case up arguing \u201cthat police officer should be off the streets\u201d. De Blasio was invited to respond to this, and instantly blamed the federal government, which earlier this month announced Pantaleo would not be charged in a federal civil rights case. De Blasio has long argued that the city of New York could not pursue disciplinary action against Pantaleo until the federal case had been resolved. This is an entirely false characterization, and one that has frustrated both the Garner family and Black Lives Matter activists around the country. The mayor did make a newsworthy comment on the case, however, suggesting that a decision in the long overdue disciplinary that was finally taken to an administrative trial last month, could be delivered within 30 days. The highest punishment Pantaelo faces is losing his job. Juli\u00e1n Castro argued Donald Trump was taking credit for the success of the US economy when that credit actually belonged to his precessor. \u201cThank you, Barack Obama!\u201d Castro, who served as Obama\u2019s housing and urban development secretary, said. Just before CNN went to a commercial break, Cory Booker managed to become the first candidate to get in a reference to voter suppression. \u201cWe lost the state of Michigan because everybody from Republicans to Russians were targeting the suppression of African American voters,\u201d the New Jersey senator said. \u201cWe need to say that.\u201d Donald Trump has weighed in on the Democratic debate by repeating his totally false claim that the Obama administration initiated the policy of separating migrant families at the border: The water contamination crisis in Flint, Michigan, has entered the discussion. Juli\u00e1n Castro noted that he helped Flint residents get water filters while he was serving as housing and urban development secretary. But he noted that water contamination is \u201cstill a major problem out there\u201d and pledged to invest $50 billion to remove lead as a major health threat. The Guardian\u2019s environment reporter Emily Holden writes: Although the first climate question came late in the debate, it was more sophisticated than last night\u2019s. Yesterday CNN host Dana Bash asked moderate candidate John Delaney to explain why the Green New Deal \u2013 a radical plan to tackle climate change with considerable support among progressive Democrats \u2013 is unrealistic. Tonight Bash noted that scientists say the world needs to cut all carbon emissions by 2050, asking Washington governor Jay Inslee \u2013 who has primarily run on a message of tackling the climate crisis \u2013 to explain why he thinks it is America\u2019s most pressing problem. Inslee quickly attacked Joe Biden\u2019s climate crisis plan for not being serious enough. Biden vowed his administration would phase out both fracking of natural gas and coal, saying \u201cwe would work it out.\u201d \u201cWe cannot work it out,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cOur house is on fire.\u201d Tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang said any plan will be too late and the US should both fight heat-trapping emissions and start moving people to higher ground. Kamala Harris also appeared to endorse going carbon-neutral by 2030, far earlier than other candidates. Kirsten Gillibrand tried to land her first big line of the night by discussing what immediate steps she would take if she won the election. The New York senator said the firs thing she would do as president is \u201cColorox the Oval Office.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levin and Lois Beckett have reported on how Kamala Harris\u2019s record as a prosecutor in California complicates her progressive image, which provides some useful context on Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s attacks on Harris over her record as California attorney general. As the nation watches the frontrunner Joe Biden get torn into by almost everyone on stage, the polling guru Nate Silver over at 538 makes the point that the Twitter reaction to the pile-on might not represent Democrat voters in the nation at large. Jay Inslee and Joe Biden argued about the intricacies of their climate change policies, with Inslee claiming Biden\u2019s proposal did not go far enough. Inslee said Biden was turning a blind eye to the research proving that significant changes need to be enacted immediately. \u201cYour argument is not with me; it\u2019s with science,\u201d Inslee told Biden. When he was pushed on whether fossil fuels would have a role under his plan, Biden clumsily replied, \u201cWe would work it out.\u201d \u201cWe cannot work it out,\u201d Inslee shot back. \u201cOur time is up. The house is on fire.\u201d Kirsten Gillibrand said that it was the responsibility of white candidates to address racial issues in this election. Referencing the death of Trayvon Martin, Gillibrand talked about the effect of white privilege and said that whiteness should not be what protects American children. Cory Booker has been tearing into Joe Biden over criminal justice, and while he hasn\u2019t quite matched Kamala Harris\u2019 \u201cThat little girl was me\u201d moment from the first round of debates, he has come prepped with some zingers. As they clashed over their records, Booker said: \u201cMr Vice President, there\u2019s a saying in my community: you\u2019re dipping into the Kool Aid and you don\u2019t even know the flavor\u201d Here\u2019s the moment: Booker\u2019s deconstruction of Biden has won him points among some commentators: The Guardian\u2019s environment reporter Emily Holden is highlighting the lack of discussion of the climate crisis Juli\u00e1n Castro was asked what he would do as president to help cities like Baltimore, which Donald Trump recently attacked in racist terms. He started his answer by specifically calling out Trump\u2019s comments. \u201cThe president is a racist, and that was just one more example of it,\u201d Castro said. He went on to explain how he would invest in cities\u2019 educational and housing systems. Asked why he would be the best candidate to \u201cheal the racial divide in America,\u201d Michael Bennet argued that the country could draw a straight line from slavery to Jim Crow to redlining to mass incarceration. He then called for educational reform to improve public schools and disrupt the school-to-prison pipeline. Tulsi Gabbard repeatedly attacked Kamala Harris on her record as the attorney general of California. The Hawaii congresswoman\u2019s attacks are just her latest criticisms against Harris since the last debate. CNN host Jake Tapper asked Kamala Harris whether her stance on busing was actually all that dissimilar from Joe Biden\u2019s. Harris dismissed the premise of Tapper\u2019s question as \u201csimply false.\u201d \u201cOn that issue, we could not be more apart,\u201d the California senator said of Biden. Harris then turned to the issue of Eric Garner\u2019s death. When Tapper tried to get her to wrap up her answer, she cut him off: \u201cThis is important.\u201d Kirsten Gillibrand criticized Bill de Blasio for not firing the police officer connected to the choking death of Eric Garner. \u201cHe should be fired. He should be fired now,\u201d Gillibrand said. Protesters earlier interrupted the debate to call for the officer to be fired. Joe Biden defended his criminal justice reform plan and generally shrugged off responsibility for mass incarceration, which many say has been spurred by the 1994 crime bill that Biden helped craft. Cory Booker, who has made criminal justice a key plank of his campaign and has called Biden\u2019s plan \u201cinadequate,\u201d retorted that Biden was trying to put out the fire he set. \u201cYou can\u2019t just now come up with a plan to put out that fire,\u201d Booker said. The heated discussion briefly got derailed when Biden accidentally referred to Booker as \u201cpresident.\u201d He then adjusted it to \u201cfuture president.\u201d But it begged the question of whether Biden momentarily confused Booker with ... another recent president. \u201cI\u2019m grateful that he endorsed my presidency already,\u201d Booker replied with a laugh. Biden then attacked Booker\u2019s record as mayor of Newark. \u201cI am shocked that you do [want to compare records],\u201d Booker replied. He said that his plan \u201creverses the damage\u201d of the 1994 crime bill. The Guardian\u2019s environment reporter Emily Holden writes: More than an hour into the debate, moderators have yet to ask candidates about the climate crisis. They spent most of the time on health care, before moving to immigration, in a pattern previous debates have followed. Only Jay Inslee has even mentioned climate. He dedicated his entire opening statement to rising global temperatures and the serious threats they pose to America. \u201cIf we make defeating the climate crisis the top priority of the United State we will have a fighting chance to save ourselves and our childrens\u2019 future. It has to be our top priority,\u201d Inslee said, touting his plans for a national mobilization toward clean energy. \u201cWe are at a tipping point and whether we shrink from this challenge or rise to it is the vital question of our time.\u201d A recent Pew poll notes Democrats see climate change as the most important foreign policy issue: \u201cAmong seven global issues included in a new survey, climate change ranks as the top international threat among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (84% say it is major threat) and the lowest-ranked threat among Republicans and Republican leaners (27%).\u201d Well, that\u2019s going to go viral in the bad way. In the middle of a heated discussion about immigration, Don Lemon turned to Kirsten Gillibrand and asked for her response to the points made by Joe Biden and Cory Booker. Her initial response? A pause followed by \u201cUm...\u201d The former vice president seems to be the target that many of his opponents have zeroed in on. Bill de Blasio in particular keeps taking direct aim at Joe Biden, likely in the hope of getting a viral moment from the repeated confrontations. But Cory Booker has just joined in on the fight, accusing Biden of picking and choosing when he aligns himself with the Obama administration. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it when it\u2019s convenient and dodge it when it\u2019s not,\u201d Booker said. Kamala Harris is receiving considerable heat online for \u201cdemoting\u201d Joe Biden by referring to him as senator rather than his higher rank of vice president earlier in the debate Harris did correct herself. But some speculated Harris may have been retaliating for Biden calling her \u201ckid\u201d when the pair took to the stage Jay Inslee has landed his first big line of the night, saying America needs to no longer have a \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d in the White House. That line could help boost the Washington governor\u2019s campaign as he strives to make it to the fall debate. Quick note: Joe Biden seems to be at a slight disadvantage by actually adhering to moderators\u2019 admonishments about time limits. As moderators have repeatedly interjected to say his time was up, Biden has generally stopped speaking. Meanwhile, his opponents, including Kamala Harris, have taken ... a slightly different approach. Joe Biden was just beginning to explain his position on the deportation policies under the Obama administration when he was interrupted by protesters apparently criticizing those same policies. Biden then resumed his answer by claiming former HUD secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro had changed his position radically from when he served in Obama\u2019s cabinet. Castro responded that it appeared \u201cone of us has learned the lessons of the past, and one of us hasn\u2019t.\u201d The debate has turned to the issue of immigration, specifically the decriminalization of border crossings. Michael Bennet does not support decriminalization, while noting that the issue is \u201cpersonal\u201d for him because of his mother\u2019s immigrant history as a Holocaust refugee. The moderators then turned to Kamala Harris, who does support decriminalization. But the California senator deftly redirected the debate to the Trump administration\u2019s treatment of migrant children, an issue that all the Democrats can agree upon. It seems the timing of the release of Kamala Harris\u2019s health care plan was a masterstroke. It became the starting point for this debate and set the early terms of it. The California senator looked like the incumbent as all the others, including even Joe Biden, try to take pot shots. Harris swatted aside Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who claimed Kathleen Sebelius wrote the plan; Harris pointed out Sebelius merely endorsed it; Gabbard swallowed hard, realising her blunder. Harris was also able to recycle a line from last night, accusing Michael Bennet of using Republican talking points. \u201cYou gotta stop,\u201d she said. Joe Biden defended his own health care plan by accusing his opponents of spewing a \u201cbunch of malarkey\u201d on the issue, resurrecting one of his favorite lines from past campaigns. The CNN moderators are sticking with their strategy from last night of trying to draw the candidates into fights against each other. After Bill de Blasio argued that Democrats needed to argue in favor of changing the status quo, Jake Tapper asked the New York mayor to clarify who he felt was falling short on that. De Blasio responded that Michael Bennet was being \u201cabsolutely inaccurate\u201d about taxes. Michael Bennet also went back and forth with Kamala Harris about her health care plan, even as the two Democratic senators referred to each other as \u201cmy friend.\u201d Echoing the discussion last night, Harris argued that other Democrats were repeating \u201cRepublican talking points\u201d about Americans potentially losing their private health insurance under Medicare-for-all proposals. So far, almost the entire health care debate has centered around Harris\u2019 proposal, allowing her to dominate the discussion. The protesters who interrupted Cory Booker seem to have been chanting \u201cFire Pantaleo\u201d \u2013 referencing Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who put Eric Garner in a chokehold leading up to his death. The Department of Justice recently announced it would not be bringing charges against Pantaleo. The decision on whether or not he now keeps his job will be taken on Thursday. Here\u2019s the moment: This is how Rashad Robinson, president of the civil rights group Color of Change responded: Kamala Harris deflected a criticism from Tulsi Gabbard, clarifying that former HHS secretary Kathleen Sebelius did not write her plan but simply endorsed it. She then turned her attention back to Joe Biden. Harris seems intent on making this event a one-on-one debate between her and the former vice president. Kamala Harris invoked the endorsement of former HHS secretary Kathleen Sebelius, the architect of Obamacare, to defend her health care proposal. She also accused Joe Biden of trying to maintain the status quo in the health care industry. He shot back that his plan would build on the success of Obamacare without overhauling the entire system. The two front-runners have so far dominated the debate and directed their comments squarely at each other. Joe Biden keeps hammering on the cost of his opponents\u2019 health care plans, arguing that their proposals are fiscally irresponsible. But Democratic voters in recent election cycles have not seemed very concerned with warnings about the spiraling US debt. Well, those good feelings didn\u2019t last long. The first question goes to Kamala Harris on health care. The California senator released a plan this week to switch America to a Medicare-for-all system over 10 years, a plan that Joe Biden\u2019s campaign criticized as \u201cconfusing.\u201d Harris defended her plan, but Biden claimed his opponent\u2019s proposal was too expensive and accused her of being indecisive. \u201cThe senator has had several plans so far,\u201d Biden said, saying Harris was engaging in \u201cdouble talk.\u201d Harris shot back that Biden\u2019s characterizations were inaccurate and that his proposals would not insure enough Americans. Joe Biden used his opening statement to surprisingly praise the wide Democratic field, boasting that it included \u201cdiverse people from diverse backgrounds.\u201d Kamala Harris said in her opening statement that America was at an \u201cinflection point\u201d and that we needed to address a question: \u201cWho are we?\u201d Cory Booker started to deliver his opening statement on how Donald Trump has denigrated cities like Baltimore but was quickly interrupted by protesters shouting \u201cfire Pantaleo\u201d. Daniel Pantaleo is the New York police officer implicated in the chokehold death of Eric Garner, an African American man killed almost five years ago. Federal prosecutors recently announced Pantaleo would not face federal charges over Garner\u2019s death, prompting outcry from campaigners. The protesters also shouted while New York mayor Bill De Blasio spoke. Read more on the Garner case here. Booker waited as the protesters were apparently led out of the debate venue. He then went on to explain how he would \u201cmove us forward together\u201d as president. Here\u2019s the moment Joe Biden told Kamala Harris to \u201cgo easy on me, kid\u201d. As has been noted, Harris is 54 years old. Michael Bennet used his opening statement to denounce the Trump administration for, among other things, its treatment of migrant children. Jay Inslee emphasized his focus on the climate crisis, arguing that we are the \u201clast, best hope\u201d to save humanity and the planet. Kirsten Gillibrand touted her accomplishments as a member of Congress, saying she disregards any notion of \u201cimpossible\u201d goals. Tulsi Gabbard noted her time spent serving in the military and described her definition of patriotism. Juli\u00e1n Castro promised to make America \u201cbetter than its ever been\u201d as president. Andrew Yang slammed Amazon for contributing to the closure of small businesses and returned to his winning line: \u201cThe opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math.\u201d Not everyone has been a big fan of CNN\u2019s dramatic opening montage featuring all the candidates, with some people comparing it to a sports show, not a political debate. After a commercial break and another explanation of the rules, the candidates are delivering their opening statements. The first candidate, Bill de Blasio, went after Joe Biden and Kamala Harris by name, continuing the theme from last night of attacking the debate\u2019s top-polling participants. An NBC News reporter noted that Joe Biden\u2019s opening line to Kamala Harris -- \u201cGo easy on me, kid\u201d -- comes 11 years after Sarah Palin kicked off her vice presidential debate against Biden by asking, \u201cCan I call you Joe?\u201d Several journalists noted that Joe Biden\u2019s first words to Kamala Harris as they took the stage sounded like, \u201cGo easy on me, kid.\u201d It should be an interesting night ... Joe Biden and Kamala Harris shook hands as they met at the center of the stage, avoiding some potential awkwardness after their contentious first debate. Roughly 22 hours after Elizabeth Warren unleashed the line of the night against John Delaney, the former congressman\u2019s team has come out with a response. Last night, Warren told Delaney, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can\u2019t do and shouldn\u2019t fight for.\u201d And now ... zing! Delaney\u2019s team has belatedly retorted in a statement: \u201cI don\u2019t understand why anyone goes through the trouble of running for President if they either can\u2019t explain how their plans work or can\u2019t honestly debate their ideas without reverting to accusing people who disagree with them of reciting Republican talking points. The media should ask Senator Sanders and Senator Warren why they\u2019re so scared to debate the merits of their plans.\u201d The Guardian team will be providing live updates and analysis as the candidates face off, so stay tuned. The Guardian\u2019s environment reporter Emily Holden writes: Candidates might not dive deeply on environmental proposals tonight, although Jay Inslee has promised to make sure they focus on the climate crisis. But if they are looking for ideas for clean and safe water, a group of Great Lakes governors has a blueprint for them. It\u2019s signed by the governors of Michigan \u2013 where the debate is \u2013 and Illinois, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. They\u2019re mostly looking for funding for infrastructure for drinking water, wastewater and stormwater. The region also has a history of pollution from the industries based there over the years. The governors want more money to work on cleanups and stop invasive species. They want help reducing the nutrient pollution that causes the harmful algal blooms that make water undrinkable. And they say they want \u201cfinancial resources and leadership in establishing drinking water standards,\u201d for PFAS chemicals from the federal government. The main event will kick off in just a few minutes at 8 p.m. EDT and is expected to end around 10:30 p.m. But last night\u2019s debate ran slightly over, much to the chagrin of those watching here in the Detroit press room. CNN is hosting and broadcasting the debate, but the network is allowing viewers to stream the debate without a cable subscription on their homepage. The same three CNN anchors \u2013 Dana Bash, Don Lemon and Jake Tapper \u2013 will host tonight. But it will be interesting to see if they stick with the same approach from last night, when their strict adherence to time limits often made the debate seem choppy. The president\u2019s eldest son has also jumped into the pre-debate chatter, reminding his Twitter followers of when Donald Trump made a reference to hand size during a 2016 debate in Detroit: The debate hasn\u2019t even started, and one of its participants is already complaining that the format is rigged. In a Twitter thread attributed to Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s sister, the Hawaii congresswoman\u2019s campaign claimed last night\u2019s debate was \u201clopsided\u201d in favor of certain candidates and suggested CNN should not be allowed to host future debates. She DNC Chairman Tom Perez once again took the stage just before the debate kicked off to deliver a pep talk of sorts to the Detroit crowd. The former labor secretary compared Donald Trump\u2019s presidency to America\u2019s past \u201cdark days\u201d of systematic discrimination. He specifically invoked the persecution of Catholic Americans, Japanese internment during World War II and the Chinese exclusion movement. \u201cRegrettably this is not our first rodeo,\u201d Perez said, saying that history would similarly note Trump\u2019s presidency \u201cwith shame.\u201d But he added all of those shameful chapters of history had something else in common: \u201cThey came to an end.\u201d Just like last night, there will be candidates onstage tonight looking to have a breakout moment capable of launching them to the fall debate stage. The heightened requirements for the next debate, which is set for September, mean far fewer candidates are expected to qualify. In order to make the cut for this week\u2019s debates, candidates had to either attract at least 1 percent of support in three separate polls or receive contributions from 65,000 unique donors. For the fall debate, he Democratic National Committee has both doubled each requirement and made both of them necessary to qualify. So every candidate who makes the cut for September has to have both registered at 2 percent or more in four polls and received contributions from 130,000 donors. Only seven candidates have so far crossed both thresholds: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Beto O\u2019Rourke and Cory Booker. Two other candidates onstage tonight \u2013 Andrew Yang and Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2013 have met the donor requirement but not the polling qualification. So seven of the ten candidates participating tonight will go into the debate knowing that it could be their last chance to make an impression on Democratic voters. That is sure to weigh heavily on those candidates and could push them to confront top-polling candidates like Biden and Harris. Not so long ago Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were posing for together for selfies and posting them on social media, fuelling speculation that they could be the Democratic dream ticket in 2020. Now all eyes are on a bitter Biden v Harris rematch in the second primary debate in Detroit. Last month, in Miami, Harris ambushed the former vice-president, pointing to his recent comments about working with segregationist senators and his opposition to government-ordered busing as a tool to desegregate schools. Recalling her own experience of busing, Harris said: \u201cThat little girl was me.\u201d Biden, who served under Barack Obama for eight years, tried to defend himself but bungled by saying: \u201cMy time is up. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The frontrunner appears to have been personally stung by the attack, especially as Harris was friends with his son, Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015. Biden told CNN: \u201cI was prepared for them to come after me, but I wasn\u2019t prepared for the person coming at me the way she came at me. She knew Beau. She knows me.\u201d And last week the Washington Post quoted a longtime friend of Beau, who did not wish to be named, as saying: \u201cI don\u2019t pretend to know what\u2019s in the vice president\u2019s head \u2013 I wasn\u2019t surprised that someone came after him. But I turned to my wife and said, \u2018Beau\u2019s flipping in his grave.\u2019\u201d Biden, 76, has promised \u201cI\u2019m not going to be as polite this time,\u201d in Wednesday\u2019s debate, which carries risks of its own. He will be standing between Harris and senator Cory Booker, another African American, who is expected to take him to task over his support for the 1994 crime bill. Going in too hard, or appearing to lecture either of them on race, could come off very badly indeed. Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan, said of Harris\u2019s performance in the first debate: \u201cShe told a very personal story about her own experience with busing and, as opposed to expressing some empathy and being a human being, Vice President Biden went into debate politician mode and just had numbered arguments and was all about policy and it was just the wrong tone. \u201cI fear for him tonight it may be the same thing where he telegraphs being aggressive and not being polite and, if you have people from several directions coming at him and he tries to get angry and nasty, it may not come off well, especially with people that have a real positive image of him as the vice president and \u2018Uncle Joe\u2019.\u201d Much ado has been made about Joe Biden\u2019s role in crafting a \u201ctough on crime\u201d bill in 1994. The former vice president has been confronted about the legislation, which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton, as part of the debate over criminal justice reform. So what did the bill do and why is it controversial? The proposal was intended to reverse rising crime and implemented mandatory minimum prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. Research since has shown the legislation led to mass incarceration and disproportionately targeted the African American community. Biden was not alone in supporting the bill. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has said he regrets voting for it, telling CNN earlier this week: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not happy I voted for a terrible bill.\u201d Hillary Clinton was also dogged by the bill in 2016 and struggled to defend it. There were, however, some positives that came from the legislation, such as the Violence Against Women\u2019s Act, of which Biden was also an author. But Biden has refused to acknowledge its problems, claiming the 1994 bill \u201cdid not generate mass incarceration.\u201d The participants in tonight\u2019s debate are: Joe Biden, the former vice president who has maintained a consistent polling advantage in the race despite some Democrats\u2019 insistence that the party needs fresh leadership. Kamala Harris, the California senator who enjoyed a polling bump after the last debate, where she attacked Biden for his past opposition to federally mandated busing to racially integrate schools. Cory Booker, the generally mild-mannered New Jersey senator who has recently criticized Biden\u2019s position on criminal justice reform in harsher terms. Andrew Yang, the entrepreneur who has attracted interest with his universal basic income proposal. Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former Housing and Urban Development secretary and San Antonio mayor who went after fellow Texan Beto O\u2019Rourke in the last debate. Kirsten Gillibrand, the New York senator who has failed to gain traction despite her focus on issues like reproductive rights and paid family leave. Bill de Blasio, the New York mayor who sparked the trend of repeatedly interrupting other candidates during the last debate (but that could cost him tonight). Tulsi Gabbard, the Hawaii congresswoman and Iraq War veteran whose non-interventionist foreign policy appeals to some voters \u2013 despite her controversial 2017 meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has unleashed chemical weapons against civilians. Jay Inslee, the Washington governor who has crafted his campaign around combating the climate crisis. Michael Bennet, the Colorado senator looking for a breakout moment to help him differentiate himself from the other more centrist candidates in the race. It\u2019s worth noting that all of the candidates of color participating in the debates will be onstage tonight. Issues involving race are also expected to feature prominently in the discussion \u2013 particularly given Biden\u2019s past opposition to busing and his involvement in the 1994 crime bill, which we\u2019ll be diving into momentarily. Donald Trump has thrown himself into the pre-debate discourse by insulting both his Democratic opponents and CNN for the ratings from last night\u2019s event. The first debate drew 8.69 million viewers, a steep drop-off from the 15.26 million and 18.1 million people who tuned in to the NBC News debates last month. The president consistently seems to zero in on ratings as an indication of candidates\u2019 success, a habit perhaps first developed when he was hosting the reality television series \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d As Democrats debate just an hour from the lead crisis in Flint, Michigan, at least one of them has a water scandal lurking in his past. One of Cory Booker\u2019s \u201cbiggest policy nightmares,\u201d according to Politico\u2019s archives, was the corruption surrounding the Newark Watershed while he was mayor. The Newark Watershed Conservation and Development Corporation was accused of \u201cstaggering\u201d corruption,\u201d as the outlet detailed in a string of stories in 2015 and 2016. Multiple senior officials pleaded guilty to accepting millions of dollars in bribes from contractors, and the corporation declared bankruptcy in 2013, with the city taking over its duties. But a federal judge excluded Booker from a lawsuit over the problems, saying he wasn\u2019t liable because his chairmanship was a function of his elected position. NJ.com calls the incident \u201cone of the bigger blemishes of Booker\u2019s tenure.\u201d Newark now is dealing with its own lead problems, from old pipes and problems at a city water treatment plant, the publication noted. In case you need a refresher, the format of tonight\u2019s debate will be very similar to last month\u2019s. Candidates will get 60 seconds to answer a moderator-directed question and 30 seconds for responses and rebuttals. Candidates will also get 30 seconds to respond if an opponent attacks them by name. A series of flashing lights \u2013 from yellow to solid red \u2013 will warn them when their time is running out. Last night, the moderators were strict about enforcing time limits for answers, a well-intended strategy that nevertheless seemed to stifle the flow of discussion among the candidates. CNN has also warned that anyone who consistently interrupts others\u2019 answers will have his or her time reduced. This could be a disappointment to candidates like Bill de Blasio. The New York mayor repeatedly forced himself into the conversation at last month\u2019s debate by interjecting while other candidates were speaking. Detroit offers some respite for those feeling Democratic debate overload. On Wednesday there was a steady flow of people at the Motown Museum, gazing at Diana Ross\u2019s dress and entering the famed Studio A to walk among the ghosts of the Temptations, Marvin Gaye and the Four Tops. The Supremes first sang \u201cStop in the Name of Love\u201d here and the 1877 Steinway grand piano was retuned with the help of Paul McCartney. Not that politics is ever entirely escapable. The museum notes that Martin Luther King delivered his original \u201cI have a dream\u201d speech in Detroit before its more celebrated incarnation in Washington. There are displays about Nelson Mandela, who found the music of Motown inspirational during the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, and Jesse Jackson, a former Democratic candidate for president. Oprah Winfrey is quoted saying how the Supremes changed her perspective on the possibilities for African American women. And a wall of the Motown label\u2019s album covers is striking because the first four lack photos of the artists \u2013 it was feared that, since they were black, DJs would decline to play them. Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign said in a statement that the candidate has raised more than $1 million from over 70,000 contributions since his debate performance last night. \u201cBernie Sanders commanded the debate, his vision and ideas dominated the stage, and he left absolutely no doubt that he is the best candidate ready to take this fight to Donald Trump and finally bring the change we need to America,\u201d campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement. The figures are sure to spark envy among Sanders\u2019 many competitors who have not yet qualified for the fall debate. One of the requirements is to attract at least 130,000 unique donors. But Sanders\u2019 fundraising haul was almost certainly aided by the sale of stickers reading, \u201cI wrote the damn bill!\u201d The line about Medicare-for-all was arguably Sanders\u2019 most successful moment last night, and he quickly moved to capitalize on it. Candidates tonight will be looking to do the same. In the immediate run-up to his debate tonight, Joe Biden made an important announcement: he is now on Snapchat. The former vice president\u2019s Snapchat was turned over to one of his senior advisers, Symone Sanders, and his granddaughter Finn in the hours before the debate. It also showed some footage of Biden walking through the debate site in Detroit. Immigrant rights protesters have blocked Detroit\u2019s Windsor Tunnel, which connects the city to Canada, to demand that 2020 Democrats commit to ending deportations. The immigrants\u2019 rights group Movimiento Cosecha said 21 protesters were arrested and hundreds more were marching to the debate site. \u201cA vague commitment to support immigration reform is an empty promise that we cannot accept,\u201d said Carlos Rojas, a Cosecha spokesperson. \u201cThe immigrant community has learned this lesson and we will not let candidates get away with another round of empty promises.\u201d Another spokesperson, Cindy Gamboa, noted Detroit\u2019s proximity to a border meant a heightened presence of immigration officers. \u201cImmigrants live in constant fear of being stopped by agents because of the color of their skin and once they notice you are driving without a driver license it very often it leads to detention and deportation.\u201d Hi, live blog readers \u2013 and once again greetings from Detroit! The Guardian team is here covering the second night of the Democratic debates, and we\u2019ll be providing live updates and analysis once things kick off at 8 p.m. EDT. A quick refresher on what happened last night: Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren teamed up against their more moderate debate opponents to defend progressive proposals like Medicare-for-all. Defying some pundits\u2019 expectations that the two like-minded senators would attack each other, Warren and Sanders instead voiced similar points about the country needing bold change to combat its challenges. None of the more moderate candidates \u2013 like John Delaney, John Hickenlooper and Steve Bullock \u2013 seemed to score the breakout moment they needed to make it to the fall debate. They repeatedly went after Warren and Sanders for endorsing \u201cfairytale\u201d policies but never seemed to clearly articulate their own alternatives. Marianne Williamson once again fascinated audiences with her stirring answers on slavery reparations and the water contamination crisis in nearby Flint, Michigan. She was the most-searched candidate on Google during last night\u2019s debate. CNN moderators Dana Bash, Don Lemon and Jake Tapper \u2013 who will return tonight \u2013 were strict about enforcing time limits on answers, which at times seemed to stifle the flow of debate among the candidates. Tonight\u2019s participants will likely run into many of these same challenges, but more on that later. Stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "Osama bin Laden\u2019s son, Hamza, is believed to be dead, according to reports out of the US. He had been seeking to stage attacks on western targets with the aim of restoring al-Qaida\u2019s status at the vanguard of extreme jihadist groups, after many years of decline and eclipse by Islamic State Who is he? Hamza Bin Laden is the son of Osama Bin Laden and Khairiah Sabar, one of the former al-Qaida leader\u2019s three surviving wives. She lived with him in a compound in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad where he was killed in 2011. It is believed that Hamza was aged around 30, with the US State Department listing his suspected birth date as sometime in 1989, but the department also lists an alternative birth date of 1986. He is believed to have been born in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where the Bin Laden family have lived for generations and where Hamza\u2019s grandmother and uncles, Osama\u2019s mother and brothers, live today. Hamza spent many years after the 9/11 attacks, masterminded by his father, in Iran, where he and dozens of other family members of the 9/11 plotters were guarded by senior Iranian intelligence and military officials. Hamza was married to one of the daughters of a senior al-Qaida leader, Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah. A video of Hamza\u2019s wedding was found in the compound where Osama bin Laden was killed. His family also reported in an exclusive interview with the Guardian in 2018, that Hamza had married the daughter of Mohammed Atta, the lead hijacker in the 9/11 terror attacks. What is his involvement with al-Qaida? Hamza has appeared in al-Qaida videos since he was a teenager. During the family\u2019s time in Iran after 9/11, Hamza was mentored by Abu al-Khayr al-Masri, who was deputy to al-Qaida\u2019s current leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. In March, Saudi Arabia revoked Hamza\u2019s citizenship after the US offered a $1m (\u00a3800,000) reward for help locating him. In their announcement of the reward, the State Department wrote that Hamza was \u201cemerging as a leader in the al-Qaida franchise\u201d. Hamza has made public statements urging followers to wage war on Washington, London, Paris and Tel Aviv and threatened attacks against the United States in revenge for the killing of his father by US military forces. Recently he has been seen as a deputy to al-Zawahiri. According to letters seized from Osama Bin Laden\u2019s compound after his death, Osama was grooming Hamza to replace him as leader of al-Qaida. Osama Bin Laden\u2019s family has said that they thought Hamza had shaken off the ways of his father and they had been disappointed to learn he was emulating him. \u201cWe thought everyone was over this,\u201d Hassan Bin Laden, Osama\u2019s brother, told the Guardian last year. \u201cThen the next thing I knew, Hamza was saying, \u2018I am going to avenge my father.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to go through that again. If Hamza was in front of me now, I would tell him, \u2018God guide you. Think twice about what you are doing. Don\u2019t retake the steps of your father. You are entering horrible parts of your soul.\u2019\u201d What do we know about his death? The death has been reported by several news outlets, citing multiple unnamed official sources. NBC News reported the US had received intelligence that he had died, citing three American officials. The New York Times, quoting two unnamed officials, also reported Hamza bin Laden had been killed some time over the past two years, and it had taken time to confirm the death. The report said the US had a hand in the death of the al-Qaida heir. Donald Trump was asked by reporters on Wednesday if the US had intelligence that Hamza bin Laden was dead, to which the US president replied: \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on that.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Crown Resorts director Harold Mitchell claims the corporate regulator has had to be \u201cdragged kicking and screaming\u201d to give his lawyers documents related to its efforts to disqualify him as a company director. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission is pursuing Mitchell in the federal court over allegations that in late 2012 and early 2013, as a director of Tennis Australia, he helped the Seven Network get a cheap deal to broadcast the Australian Open. Asic is also attempting to disqualify a former Tennis Australia president, Steve Healy, over the broadcast deal. Mitchell, who made his fortune as a media buyer, is one of two Crown directors over whom probity concerns have been raised. The Victorian commission for gambling and liquor regulation investigated the role of the former AFL chief executive, Andrew Demetriou, at the failed training group Acquire Learning last year as part of a regular review of Crown\u2019s flagship Melbourne casino. The commission found Demetriou was not a director of Acquire. It has said it is monitoring Asic\u2019s case against Mitchell, which he and Healy are contesting. Asic filed its case against the two former Tennis Australia directors in November, but it is coming to a head amid a storm of allegations published by Nine and made under parliamentary privilege that include linking it to organised crime through junket operators, claiming its high-roller customers are not checked by officials at the border, and raising concerns about money laundering. On Thursday morning, counsel for Mitchell, Matt Collins QC, complained to the court that his client\u2019s solicitors had received three versions of lists of documents Asic said were relevant. This included details of contacts between Asic and two former Tennis Australia directors, Graeme Holloway, who died in February, and former tennis player Kerryn Pratt, who resigned from the board in 2016 and has publicly raised concerns about the broadcast deal. \u201cThey are two former board members of Tennis Australia who have had communications with Asic about which we knew nothing,\u201d Collins said. The lists provided by Asic were \u201cmaterially different in ways that excited suspicion on our side of the bar table\u201d. \u201cIn circumstances where we have a trial date bearing down upon us we need everything and we need it as soon as it can be provided.\u201d Mitchell\u2019s legal team received a flood of documents after the case was previously in court on 17 May, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve received since the last occasion about 1,000 further documents, many of which are dross, to put it succinctly,\u201d he said. Counsel for Asic, Michael Pearce SC, said the documents Asic was using in the case \u201ccame in in dribs and drabs, in February, in March, in May\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve waited until we have them all and then we\u2019ve provided them to them,\u201d he said. Most of them were \u201centirely uncontroversial\u201d. Justice Jonathan Beach said it seemed Asic was continuously updating its list of documents, suggesting there was \u201cno grand conspiracy\u201d. \u201cIt is bureaucratic error,\u201d he said. He ordered Asic to swear an affidavit by 23 August certifying that it had produced all the relevant documents. The case is set down for trial in November. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it,\u201d Beach said. \u201cSo is Mr Mitchell,\u201d Collins replied.",

These include being told by the department that grant applications had \u201caccidentally gone to the electronic junk mail folder\u201d, despite evidence this was \u201cfalse\u201d.</p> <p>Separate to the civil court case, Hartley contacted the CCC and made complaints about the actions of several public servants, who were alleged to have misused their authority and caused a detriment to Choice.</p> <p>The CCC completed a preliminary investigation in June. It found that evidence against three bureaucrats, if proved, amounted to corrupt conduct.</p> <p>The CCC was also asked to consider a complaint about the state\u2019s attorney general, Yvette D\u2019Ath, specifically that she failed to refer allegations of corrupt conduct between 2015 and 2017.</p> <p>The CCC said that because complaints about D\u2019Ath related to her official duties, and did not amount to criminal conduct, it did not have the authority to investigate further. Instead it suggested Hartley take his complaint to court.</p> <p>\u201cWe are aware that some of your concerns relating to D\u2019Ath may be facts likely to be heard before the district court of Queensland,\u201d the CCC wrote to Hartley.</p> <p>\u201cThe courts have a responsibility to hear and determine facts of law. For this reason some of your concerns about D\u2019Ath may be better placed to be heard in a court of law. Should any adverse comments be made by the court in relation to your concerns, you may consider renewing your concerns about D\u2019Ath to the CCC.\u201d</p> <p>In 2012 the department produced a report claiming the charity had not spent $209,000 from a $4.7m grant to to deliver employment and training to displaced people, and an environmental recovery program after tropical cyclone Yasi.</p> <p>A subsequent independent audit, requested by government solicitors on behalf of the department, found that all grant money had been properly spent or committed.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the department launched \u2013 then later discontinued \u2013 court proceedings against Choice seeking to recover unspent money.</p> <p>The charity claims in court documents this legal action was an \u201cabuse of process\u201d and based on an \u201culterior motive\u201d.</p> <p>In 2017 the communities, child safety and disability services department wrote to Hartley to say it intended to renew a service agreement with Choice to deliver youth services for another three years.</p> <p>Hartley said this was effectively rescinded by the department in October 2018, 12 days after the charity acted to extend its right to serve the government with a statement of claim in the district court civil case.</p> <p>Allegations against a senior bureaucrat in the child safety department, who is alleged to have \u201cmisused her authority to withdraw funding from Choice and ... to bully and harass Choice and ultimately cause a detriment to Choice\u201d, were among those whose actions, if proved, were found by the CCC to meet the definition of corrupt conduct.</p> <p>The CCC has referred those allegations to the department\u2019s ethical standards unit.</p>",

But Choice alleges it has been rejected for funding by the same department consistently since 2011, after its chief executive, Todd Hartley, made a complaint about a public servant for making racist comments. In documents filed in the Queensland district court, Choice is seeking more than $700,000 in damages for \u201cmalfeasance in public office\u201d. \u201c[The public servant] said words to Mr Hartley to the effect that the department would not be wasting valuable monies on a group of Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander and multicultural people as it was clear most of them could not read or write and it would be a waste of money,\u201d Choice\u2019s statement of claim alleges. It also alleges the public servant told a subordinate to \u201cmake life as difficult as possible for Choice\u201d. And it details a series of alleged retaliatory actions against the charity. These include being told by the department that grant applications had \u201caccidentally gone to the electronic junk mail folder\u201d, despite evidence this was \u201cfalse\u201d. Separate to the civil court case, Hartley contacted the CCC and made complaints about the actions of several public servants, who were alleged to have misused their authority and caused a detriment to Choice. The CCC completed a preliminary investigation in June. It found that evidence against three bureaucrats, if proved, amounted to corrupt conduct. The CCC was also asked to consider a complaint about the state\u2019s attorney general, Yvette D\u2019Ath, specifically that she failed to refer allegations of corrupt conduct between 2015 and 2017. The CCC said that because complaints about D\u2019Ath related to her official duties, and did not amount to criminal conduct, it did not have the authority to investigate further. Instead it suggested Hartley take his complaint to court. \u201cWe are aware that some of your concerns relating to D\u2019Ath may be facts likely to be heard before the district court of Queensland,\u201d the CCC wrote to Hartley. \u201cThe courts have a responsibility to hear and determine facts of law. For this reason some of your concerns about D\u2019Ath may be better placed to be heard in a court of law. Should any adverse comments be made by the court in relation to your concerns, you may consider renewing your concerns about D\u2019Ath to the CCC.\u201d In 2012 the department produced a report claiming the charity had not spent $209,000 from a $4.7m grant to to deliver employment and training to displaced people, and an environmental recovery program after tropical cyclone Yasi. A subsequent independent audit, requested by government solicitors on behalf of the department, found that all grant money had been properly spent or committed. Nevertheless, the department launched \u2013 then later discontinued \u2013 court proceedings against Choice seeking to recover unspent money. The charity claims in court documents this legal action was an \u201cabuse of process\u201d and based on an \u201culterior motive\u201d. In 2017 the communities, child safety and disability services department wrote to Hartley to say it intended to renew a service agreement with Choice to deliver youth services for another three years. Hartley said this was effectively rescinded by the department in October 2018, 12 days after the charity acted to extend its right to serve the government with a statement of claim in the district court civil case. Allegations against a senior bureaucrat in the child safety department, who is alleged to have \u201cmisused her authority to withdraw funding from Choice and ... to bully and harass Choice and ultimately cause a detriment to Choice\u201d, were among those whose actions, if proved, were found by the CCC to meet the definition of corrupt conduct. The CCC has referred those allegations to the department\u2019s ethical standards unit.",

      "bodyText": "The architect of a historic bill to decriminalise abortion in New South Wales has hit out at opponents of the legislation, after a conservative MP wrongly claimed the bill would allow unrestricted abortion \u201cuntil the moment of birth\u201d. The independent MP for Sydney, Alex Greenwich, tabled the bill on Thursday after it was delayed by a week by resistance within the Coalition government. The bill has the backing of the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, and a number of members of cabinet including the health minister, Brad Hazzard, but has faced pushback from the Liberal party\u2019s conservative wing. MPs including the state\u2019s police minister, David Elliott, have argued they will oppose the bill \u201cbecause there has not been enough time to consult with my electorate\u201d, and on Thursday the Sydney Morning Herald published an opinion piece by the finance minister, Damien Tudehope, in which he wrongly claimed the laws would allow \u201cunrestricted abortion until the moment of birth\u201d. Describing the proposed bill as \u201cthe most extreme abortion laws in the country (perhaps in the world)\u201d Tudehope \u2013 who described himself as \u201cfiercely pro-life\u201d in his maiden speech to parliament \u2013 wrote that MPs supporting the bill had \u201ctried to ride roughshod over parliamentary procedure and pass abortion laws that barely anyone in the state has even heard of\u201d. The private member\u2019s bill is based on laws in Queensland and Victoria and has the backing of the NSW branch of the Australian Medical Association and the Pro-Choice Alliance. Under the proposed legislation a woman would not commit an offence if she procured a termination within the bill\u2019s framework. It would also repeal provisions of the Crimes Act relating to abortions and common law offences. The bill would allow for terminations up to 22 weeks \u2013 and later if two doctors believe they should be performed given the medical, physical, social and psychological circumstances. But Tudehope claimed the bill would allow abortions \u201call the way up to birth, with no meaningful restrictions whatsoever\u201d because, he wrote, authorising doctors \u201cwouldn\u2019t need to be independent from one another\u201d and \u201cneedn\u2019t give reasons\u201d for performing the procedure. He also said there were \u201cno criminal sanctions for a doctor who flouts this requirement and performs an abortion beyond 22 weeks without the consent of an additional doctor\u201d, though supporters of the bill have said the legislation would create a new criminal offence under the Crimes Act for anyone who assisted in terminations without authorisation. On Thursday Greenwich hit back at Tudehope, saying the bill was the \u201cresult of decades of advocacy\u201d. \u201cOn behalf of our 15 co-sponsors this morning I will introduce our bill to decriminalise abortion,\u201d Greenwich said. \u201cThis bill was first publicly announced early March, it is 119 years overdue, and the result of decades of advocacy. \u201cMy message to the opponents of reform who are currently playing politics with this reform is clear: don\u2019t hold women\u2019s reproductive rights hostage because you haven\u2019t done your homework.\u201d Coalition and Labor MPs will be given a conscience vote on the bill, but a number of key members of cabinet support the bill including Andrew Constance, Bronwyn Taylor, Gareth Ward, Shelley Hancock and Sarah Mitchell. Another Liberal party MP, Felicity Wilson, is one of the bill\u2019s 15 co-sponsors. NSW is the only state in Australia which has yet to decriminalise abortion, instead relying on common law rulings to define what constitutes a lawful abortion. Introducing the bill into parliament on Thursday, Greenwich used the example of a mother of five who was prosecuted for self-administering a drug to cause a miscarriage as recently as 2017. \u201cThe courts have ruled that terminations are lawful if they protect a woman from serious danger to her life or physical or mental health, taking into account economic, social or medical reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no clarity beyond this interpretation in the law itself and determining whether each termination meets the common law criteria for \u2018lawful\u2019 remains a grey area in the law. \u201cThis has a number of poor consequences for women trying to access reproductive health care. \u201cThe threat of conviction can obviously create fear and stigma for women wanting an abortion and reluctance by health practitioners to provide services or even advice to women about their options. In turn this prevents many facilities from providing a full range of reproductive health care services.

No.\u201d In a statement promoting Ridd\u2019s lecture in Bundaberg, the local district representative for Canegrowers, Allan Dingle, said the event would \u201cset the record straight\u201d. \u201cCane farmers are being pushed to the wall by over-regulation based on unsubstantiated scaremongering around the Great Barrier Reef,\u201d Dingle said. \u201cIt is time for politicians and vested interests to stop demonising agriculture. This situation is shaping up to be Adani 2.0 for the state Labor government.\u201d Canegrowers was among several agricultural groups upset at the state government\u2019s implementation of reef protection regulations, which impose new standards on farmers. The regulations include set \u201cload limits\u201d on the amounts of sediment and inorganic nitrogen from agricultural chemicals that can be allowed to run off into reef catchments. The industry last month proudly called attention to \u201cthe collaborative relationship between sugarcane growers and scientists working together for improved water quality on the Great Barrier Reef\u201d. The chief executive of Canegrowers, Dan Galligan, told Guardian Australia the organisation\u2019s attitude had not changed and it still promoted environmentally sustainable practices. But Galligan said the state\u2019s reef regulations had \u201cdampened the confidence of growers [in circumstances] where we\u2019ve spent five years to build them up to be conscious [about reef water quality]. The regulations have set us back in that sense. \u201cThe government is making policy and regulations and telling us it\u2019s because of the science. At the moment, the way a lot of the communication happens is by politicians telling farmers they\u2019re going to be regulated, and they\u2019re going to be regulated because of science. We\u2019ve got to open it up for debate.\u201d \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning When asked whether farmers might not understand that Ridd\u2019s views are broadly rejected by the scientific community, Galligan said: \u201cIt hasn\u2019t worked to tell people that if you\u2019ve got a contrary view, you\u2019re an idiot. It\u2019s trying to provide that balance \u2026 making sure we have an open conversation about it. We\u2019d do it for other scientists, too.\u201d Imogen Zethoven, the Great Barrier Reef campaign director for the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said it was irresponsible to present Ridd\u2019s work as if it were one of two competing views. \u201cIt is problematic,\u201d Zethoven said. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic tactic to delay action to address a problem by casting doubt on the science. \u201cThey need to accept the overwhelming consensus of the Great Barrier Reef that the greatest threat to water quality on the [reef] is pollution from agriculture. So many reports have come out saying that we need regulatory reform. For years voluntary measures have not produced the speed of change that\u2019s needed. \u201cThere is no debate about the science, it\u2019s overwhelming.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The justice secretary has suggested that the anonymity of suspected sex offenders and others accused of serious crimes should be respected until they are charged if they have a reputation to protect. Robert Buckland QC was asked if he supported a campaign to ban the naming of those arrested on suspicion of rape and other sexual offences, which has been led by Sir Cliff Richard and the radio presenter Paul Gambaccini, both falsely accused of historical sex offences. The qualified barrister told the Times there was \u201cmerit\u201d in extending this principle to all serious crimes. No 10 distanced itself from Buckland\u2019s remarks on Wednesday evening and said they did not reflect government policy. Buckland told the Times (paywall): \u201cLet\u2019s say you are a reputable local businessperson who is accused of fraud. Your good name is going to be really undermined by this mere accusation. You are a person of good character. That might be a meritorious case for anonymity. \u201cLet\u2019s say you are a person with a list of previous convictions. You\u2019ve committed offences. There is intelligence out there that suggests that other victims might come forward. Is that a case where anonymity should be automatic?\u201d Official guidance over whether arrested suspects\u2019 names should be published ahead of charge is mixed, but the names are often disclosed by other means \u2013 particularly in high-profile cases. Buckland\u2019s suggestion comes after the trial and conviction of Carl Beech, who anonymously falsely accused senior political figures of sexual abuse and murder. The case has reignited the debate over whether those accused of sexual offences should be named before they are charged. Police took almost a year to announce that Gambaccini would not face charges as there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him, despite the fact he was named directly after he was arrested in 2013. Similarly, Richard was named after his Berkshire flat was raided in 2014 and he was forced to publicly deny the widely circulated false allegations before police confirmed he would not be charged in 2016. Chris Henley QC, the chair of the Criminal Bar Association (CBA), said open justice was a fundamental and valuable cornerstone of the British system and that secret arrests were \u201cthe hallmark of oppressive regimes\u201d. \u201cWhilst the police behaved lamentably in the Cliff Richard and Paul Gambaccini cases, it would be profoundly wrong to divide suspects into \u2018people like us\u2019 who are allowed anonymity, and the rest of society who are not,\u201d he said. The CBA said authorities should focus on investing in police resources to allow investigations to be conducted thoroughly and in a timely manner, while warning of possible future scenarios in which politicians could evade scrutiny in the event of their arrest. \u201cThe public should be concerned about the unforeseen consequences of allowing anonymity to creep into the system,\u201d a spokesperson said.",
