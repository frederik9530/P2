      "bodyText": "Universities will be required to work with Australian government agencies to protect sensitive research from foreign governments, Dan Tehan has confirmed. But the federal education minister has denied that the new guidelines on research collaboration will give security agencies an effective veto, as concerns about foreign influence on campuses, particularly from China, grow. Tehan also defended universities in the wake of a Centre for Independent Studies report claiming they are financially vulnerable because of a dependence on international students, particularly from China. Tehan told Radio National the university sector has \u201cnot become captive to any country\u201d, explaining that talks on Wednesday would establish \u201cbest practice guidelines\u201d when it comes to foreign interference and cybersecurity. \u201cOne of the most important things here is that government and the university sector need to work very closely on these issues \u2013 and we need to put in place clear markers as to what is expected.\u201d Tehan said that \u201call research with whatever country\u201d must be in the Australian national interest, which could require \u201cmarkers\u201d to be put in to ring-fence certain sensitive research. Tehan said in some areas such as medical research there is a \u201cmutual interest\u201d, but in other types of research \u2013 such as that with military applications \u2013 \u201cthere might not be such mutual interest\u201d and Australia should not therefore share with other countries. Tehan said the guidelines would \u201cnot necessarily mean you have to seek permission\u201d from government agencies, but \u201cmight mean \u2026 an understanding of what technologies might have dual uses\u201d. The University of Technology Sydney has announced it will review its $10m partnership with CETC, a Chinese state-owned military tech company that developed an app that Chinese security forces use to track and detain Muslim Uyghur citizens in Xinjiang. The CIS report by adjunct professor Salvatore Babones found that some lectures are attended by 87% foreign students and that one quarter of students in surveyed Australian universities are international students, higher than any other nation. Of that total, 10% come from China. Any move by the Chinese government to impose currency controls or a drop in the enrolments would endanger the institutions, the centre says. Citing the large amount paid by Chinese students to Sydney University in 2017 \u2013 $500m or 23% of its revenue \u2013 Baboness, said: \u201cAt these levels \u2026 even small percentage declines in Chinese student numbers could induce significant financial hardship. Large percentage declines could be catastrophic.\u201d Tehan said that international students bring a total of $35bn in export income to Australia. He noted the seven universities surveyed had operating surpluses of $930.4m and said he hadn\u2019t seen anything to suggest they were \u201cfiscally irresponsible\u201d. \u201cThey understand about what they need to do to secure the futures of their universities, but they have very good financial positions and are managing their finances incredibly well,\u201d he said. The attorney general\u2019s department is currently inquiring into whether China-backed Confucius Institutes at Australian universities require registration as agents of foreign influence under the new transparency register. Earlier in 2019, intelligence officials claimed China may have been behind a massive data breach which compromised the personal details of thousands of Australian National University students and staff. Australian universities have been the battleground for pro-Hong Kong and pro-China rallies during protests against Hong Kong\u2019s controversial extradition law.",

It\u2019s intoxicating to watch even as she mindlessly stares at her laptop while Dragon\u2019s Den plays to unlistening ears. Steer\u2019s character is oblivious to the three dancers \u2013 James Olivo, Emily Thompson-Smith and Alethia Antonia \u2013 who invade her space. They move wildly to music we hear only some of the time; the moments of silence are like held breath. Choreographer Morgann Runacre-Temple steals Steer\u2019s actions \u2013 the Marie Kondo method of folding, the jiggle of frying the eggs \u2013 and mutates them into complex, balletic movements. Threading through her home, the dancers echo today\u2019s constant distractions: the half-watched TV shows, the unreplied-to texts, the short attention spans, the ignored letters, the unhealthy investment in strangers\u2019 lives. Civilisation simultaneously evokes the feeling of loneliness and never being able to be truly alone. We don\u2019t fully understand the link between the two worlds, but the strange symbiosis of dramatic realism and contemporary dance creates an intimate, alien portrait of loss and isolation. I could watch for ever. \u2022 At Underbelly Cowgate, Edinburgh, until 25 August. \u2022 Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews.",

      "bodyText": "Publicity-hungry schools and pressure to post results on social media are driving up exam stress among girls, the Girlguiding movement has said, after it found that close to two-thirds of girls now believe there is too much pressure to succeed. On the eve of the GCSE results the charity said girls were facing a perfect storm of pressures, with well over half of those aged 11 to 21 fearing a bad performance in exams could ruin their futures. With some schools having put up banners boasting about their A-level results and an expectation that girls will post about their results online, 64% of those polled for Girlguiding said there was too much pressure and focus on doing well in exams, with half saying exam stress affected their happiness. \u201cA lot of girls say they want more support about how they handle this stress,\u201d said Madison Rogers, 24, a volunteer with a guides group in Haywards Heath, West Sussex. \u201cThey want support from schools and parents but there is a lot of pressure on girls to cope with it themselves.\u201d In the 72 hours around the A-level results last week there was a 75% increase in texts about exam stress to Shout, a helpline for people experiencing suicidal thoughts or facing a mental health crisis. \u201cExam stress has been growing,\u201d said Alan Smithers, professor of education and a psychologist at the University of Buckingham. \u201cThe teachers are wound up about it all and the parents like to brag about their children and if they haven\u2019t done well enough, they are upset.\u201d The level of worry about exams emerged in an annual survey of girls\u2019 attitudes, which also showed: The proportion of 17-to-21-year-olds wanting to be leaders in their profession has fallen from 66% in 2016 to 53%. More than a third of girls aged 11 to 21 have faced bullying about how they look, rising to almost half among those aged 17 to 21. 71% of girls apply filters to the pictures they post on social media some or all of the time. A third said they had seen upsetting or harmful pictures or videos online that they wish they hadn\u2019t. \u201cIn a world full of filtered photographs and online bullying, the last thing girls need to face is a worrying amount of academic pressure,\u201d said Emma Dixon, 19, a member of Girlguiding\u2019s advocate panel. \u201cYet exam stress is very real and forms the perfect storm of pressure on girls, the detriment of their mental wellbeing.\u201d \u201cSchools are posting online pictures of students holding their results and it adds to the pressure to do really well,\u201d said Rogers. \u201cA lot of schools have banners out already saying 70% of our kids to A* to C.

      "bodyText": "Disadvantaged pupils are almost twice as likely to fail GCSE maths as their wealthier classmates, according to research that lays bare the attainment gap between rich and poor. Published on the eve of GCSE results day, the analysis shows students from poorer backgrounds in England lagging far behind their wealthier peers in key subjects at GCSE, prompting calls for the government to put more investment into schools serving deprived communities. Russell Hobby, the chief executive of the education charity Teach First, which carried out the research, said: \u201cA child\u2019s postcode should never determine how well they do at school, yet today we\u2019ve found huge disparities based on just that. Low attainment at GCSE is a real cause for concern as it can shut doors to future success and holds young people back from meeting their aspirations.\u201d Two in five pupils (38%) from the poorest one-third of postcodes fail GCSE maths, nearly twice as many as those from the richest third (20%), according to the analysis. Children from deprived backgrounds are also less likely to be awarded top grades. Just 13% of the poorest pupils attain either a 7, 8 or 9 \u2013 the top three grades under the reformed GCSEs \u2013 in maths, compared with 26% of their more advantaged peers. In English it is 11%, compared with 22% of wealthy students, and in French 15% of poorer pupils get top grades, compared with 27% of those from the most advantaged backgrounds. In geography, 50% of disadvantaged children fail to get a level 4 \u2013 a standard pass \u2013 compared with 27% of the richest pupils. As with maths, 38% of the poorest pupils fail to pass GCSE English, compared with 22% of the richest. Almost half (46%) of the poorest pupils fail history, compared with 27% of the wealthiest, while 16% of the poorest get the top grades, compared with 31% of the richest. The findings, based on the government\u2019s underlying key stage 4 results data for 2018, also show that 41% of young people from the poorest communities fail to pass French, compared with 26% of their wealthier peers. Similarly, pupils from wealthier backgrounds are almost twice as likely to get top grades, with 27% of them getting either a 7,8 or 9, compared with 15% of the poorest. Last month a study suggested progress in closing the GCSE attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their wealthier classmates had come to a standstill or even gone into reverse. The study by the Education Policy Institute found that the gap, which had been gradually closing since 2011, widened slightly last year, with the most disadvantaged pupils now almost two years behind their peers by the time they finish their GCSEs. Hobby said promised new government funding for schools should be targeted at areas of greatest need. He also called for higher starting salaries for teachers to boost recruitment. \u201cWe know that it is possible to alter the outcome for children in every area, because time and time again we\u2019ve seen the transformational difference a brilliant education can make, helping all young people to thrive.

      "body": "<p>John Gosden is concerned about a potentially tactical race after only four runners were declared for the Yorkshire Oaks on Thursday, expected to be the final race in Britain for his star mare Enable. The five-year-old is long odds-on with bookmakers to land the prize on her way to Paris in October, where she will attempt to become the first horse to win the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe for a third time.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe smaller the field, the stranger the race can often be,\u201d said Gosden, who has provided one of Enable\u2019s three rivals in Lah Ti Dar. The other two runners are trained by Aidan O\u2019Brien, notably Magical, supplemented into the race last week at a cost of \u00a330,000. Completing the field is South Sea Pearl, only eighth in a French Group Two race at the weekend.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/aug/20/talking-horses-how-remorex-won-the-palio-di-siena-without-his-jockey\">Talking Horses: how Remorex won the Palio di Siena without his jockey</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cMagical was what you might call an unusual late supplement for one of Aidan\u2019s, who are normally in all the races from day one,\u201d Gosden said. \u201cAnd then they\u2019ve popped in a filly that just happens to have run a mile and a half round Deauville on Sunday. She\u2019s obviously on a travel bonus scheme.\u201d</p> \n<p>To a suggestion that South Sea Pearl may be a pacemaker, Gosden replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know if she\u2019s fast enough to do that. She didn\u2019t look fast enough to me the other day, so I\u2019m not quite sure what she\u2019s doing there.\u201d</p> \n<p>Enable can make the running if required and did so when winning the Yorkshire Oaks two years ago but Gosden would not commit to her doing so again. \u201cI\u2019ve got to discuss it with Frankie [Dettori] and leave all the options open. They\u2019re very trappy, these small-field races. You can have a plan but you usually go pretty quickly to plan B, which is a blank canvas.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been very happy with her indeed. And actually, funnily enough, with Lah Ti Dar. She\u2019s run twice at York and won there both times. The Lloyd Webbers are very keen, they\u2019ve planned it all year, so she\u2019s running.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been a great one for running good fillies against each other but once you get into the late summer and autumn, the options are not multiple if you want to operate at Group One level.\u201d</p> \n<p>The presence of Enable and Magical, the two highest-rated females in Europe, proved enough to scare away the other possible runners, Sir Michael Stoute taking out Sun Maiden, while Ralph Beckett withdrew Manuela De Vega.

      "bodyText": "John Gosden is concerned about a potentially tactical race after only four runners were declared for the Yorkshire Oaks on Thursday, expected to be the final race in Britain for his star mare Enable. The five-year-old is long odds-on with bookmakers to land the prize on her way to Paris in October, where she will attempt to become the first horse to win the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe for a third time. \u201cThe smaller the field, the stranger the race can often be,\u201d said Gosden, who has provided one of Enable\u2019s three rivals in Lah Ti Dar. The other two runners are trained by Aidan O\u2019Brien, notably Magical, supplemented into the race last week at a cost of \u00a330,000. Completing the field is South Sea Pearl, only eighth in a French Group Two race at the weekend. \u201cMagical was what you might call an unusual late supplement for one of Aidan\u2019s, who are normally in all the races from day one,\u201d Gosden said. \u201cAnd then they\u2019ve popped in a filly that just happens to have run a mile and a half round Deauville on Sunday. She\u2019s obviously on a travel bonus scheme.\u201d To a suggestion that South Sea Pearl may be a pacemaker, Gosden replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know if she\u2019s fast enough to do that. She didn\u2019t look fast enough to me the other day, so I\u2019m not quite sure what she\u2019s doing there.\u201d Enable can make the running if required and did so when winning the Yorkshire Oaks two years ago but Gosden would not commit to her doing so again. \u201cI\u2019ve got to discuss it with Frankie [Dettori] and leave all the options open. They\u2019re very trappy, these small-field races. You can have a plan but you usually go pretty quickly to plan B, which is a blank canvas. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very happy with her indeed. And actually, funnily enough, with Lah Ti Dar. She\u2019s run twice at York and won there both times. The Lloyd Webbers are very keen, they\u2019ve planned it all year, so she\u2019s running. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a great one for running good fillies against each other but once you get into the late summer and autumn, the options are not multiple if you want to operate at Group One level.\u201d The presence of Enable and Magical, the two highest-rated females in Europe, proved enough to scare away the other possible runners, Sir Michael Stoute taking out Sun Maiden, while Ralph Beckett withdrew Manuela De Vega. Gosden\u2019s Oaks winner, Anapurna, will also go elsewhere, possibly to the Vermeille next month. Gosden runs the second-favourite in Wednesday\u2019s big race, the Juddmonte International, in King Of Comedy, last seen running on well into second over a shorter distance at Royal Ascot. \u201cYou can find easier races than this, taking on Crystal Ocean, but he\u2019s a talented young horse and he deserves the opportunity.

      "bodyText": "People who spend their childhood in areas with high levels of air pollution may be more likely to later develop mental disorders, research suggests. Air pollution has become a matter of growing concern as an increasing number of studies have found links to conditions ranging from asthma to dementia and various types of cancer. There are also signs it may take a toll on mental health. Research published in January found that children growing up in the more polluted areas of London were more likely to have depression by the age of 18 than those growing up in areas with cleaner air. But a study by researchers in the US and Denmark has suggested a link between air pollution and an increased risk of mental health problems, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and personality disorders. Between 1% and 2% of the UK population have bipolar disorder in their lifetime, with similar figures for schizophrenia. It is estimated that about 5% of people in the UK have a personality disorder at any one time. Prof Andrey Rzhetsky, a co-author of the research at the University of Chicago, said the team carried out their work after finding that genetics did not fully explain why some people experienced these conditions and others do not. Writing in the journal PLOS Biology, Rzhetsky and colleagues explained how they used a rather crude approach when they first examined possible links to air pollution. Insurance data for 151 million individuals collected between 2003 and 2013 was used to explore the rates of particular mental disorders in counties across the US. This was then analysed alongside the average level of air pollution in each county. The team found the rate for bipolar disorder was 27% higher for counties in the bottom seventh for air quality compared with those in the top seventh (with the best air quality), once factors including age, sex, poverty levels in the county and average income were taken into account. A tentative link was also seen for depression and air pollution. However, this analysis was based on average air pollution levels over very large areas. What\u2019s more, the rates of psychiatric conditions may not reflect the situation for low-income individuals who may be less likely to have insurance.

They looked at air pollution exposure for the first 10 years in the life of 1.4 million individuals born and living in the country between 1979 and the end of 2002, as calculated from their home addresses. Levels of 14 pollutants were considered \u2013 compared with the 87 considered in the US part of the study \u2013 and used to provide a measure of overall air pollution exposure over those years. The team then explored subsequent diagnoses for bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorder and depression up to the end of 2016. Once factors including age, sex and socioeconomic status were considered, the team found that the rate of all four mental disorders were higher among people who had greater exposure to overall air pollution during their childhood. When participants were split into seven equal-sized groups, based on the air they were exposed to until the age of 10, the researchers found the bottom seventh (who experienced the worst air) had 29%, 148%, 51% and 162% higher rates for bipolar, schizophrenia, depression and personality disorder respectively than the top seventh (who had experienced the cleanest air).

Another suggestion was that air pollutants travelled from the nose to the brain where they accumulated, causing inflammation and damage. If the links to mental health disorders are confirmed, they could \u2013 somewhat counterintuitively \u2013 offer some cause for hope. \u201cUnlike genetic predisposition, environment is something we can change,\u201d said Rzhetsky. However, the research has limitations: the findings do not prove that air pollution drives the development of these conditions, while the analyses do not take into account the influence of many factors known to affect mental health, including family history of psychiatric problems or bullying. Dr Ioannis Bakolis, an expert in biostatistics from King\u2019s College London, said the study added to previous evidence of a possible link between air pollution and mental health disorders. \u201cWhile causation cannot be proved, this work suggests substantial morbidity from mental disorders could be avoided with improved air quality,\u201d he said. Bakolis added that there was already plenty of evidence that air pollution can hurt many other aspects of health, adding that measures such as car-free zones in cities should be given attention. A second study, published in the Journal of Investigative Medicine, has revealed a link between long-term exposure to traffic fumes and age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) \u2013 one of the leading causes of vision problems in older people. The researchers used national health insurance data from 2000 to 2010 for almost 40,000 people aged 50 or older in Taiwan, together with air quality data from 1998 to 2010 centred on the location of the health centre people visited for help with an illness like a cold. The team found that patients visiting centres in the highest 25% for nitrogen dioxide levels had almost twice the risk of developing ARMD than those who visited centres in the bottom quartile. A similar link was seen for carbon monoxide pollution. However, several other factors including family history of the condition were not considered in the work, while the data might be skewed by people having less chance of a respiratory infection in less polluted areas.",

But then, as he is doing now, he backed away from the issue amid pushback from the NRA and Republicans. Trump is wary of any action that might hurt his support among conservative voters as he faces re-election with weak poll numbers and amid warnings of an economic recession.

Trump declined to comment on those measures, but insisted that he was in a \u201cvery meaningful discussion\u201d with Democrats, who he called \u201cnot strong at all on the second amendment\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Keanu Reeves is set to return to the world of The Matrix with a fourth chapter now officially confirmed. Lana Wachowski, who created the franchise with her sister Lilly, will also return as director, along with the original cast member Carrie-Anne Moss. \u201cMany of the ideas Lilly and I explored 20 years ago about our reality are even more relevant now,\u201d Wachowski said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to have these characters back in my life and grateful for another chance to work with my brilliant friends.\u201d The script is co-written by Wachowski alongside the sci-fi novelists Aleksandar Hemon and David Mitchell. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the original Matrix, which told the story of the hacker Neo and his discovery that the world was in fact a simulated reality. It was a surprise hit, making more than $460m worldwide and launching two sequels, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. The franchise has made more than $1.6bn. Rumours of a new film have been circulating since 2017, with Michael B Jordan then touted as a lead. Earlier this year, Lilly Wachowski gave any new iteration her blessing. \u201cI like it when stories go out into the world and then come back to you in different ways,\u201d she told Slash Film. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s what storytelling is all about. I\u2019m part of a bigger thing. I don\u2019t have any ownership over stuff like that, so whatever story anybody wants to tell, I can\u2019t wait to hear. I hope it\u2019s better than the original.\u201d Since the original trilogy, the Wachowskis have had a number of commercial disappointments, including Speed Racer, Cloud Atlas and Jupiter Ascending. Their Netflix show Sense8 was cancelled after two seasons. This summer, Reeves scored a global hit, with John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum making more than $320m worldwide. He will next be seen in a long- awaited Bill &amp; Ted sequel. Sources tell Variety that the new Matrix film will start production in 2020.",

      "body": "<p>Southern Spain. A rural location we will call, to use the correct overblown reality TV lingo, \u201can oasis of canine calm\u201d. \u201cSit!\u201d instructs Jo-Rosie Haffenden, an animal trainer, behaviourist and owner of a degree in human psychology and many spookily obedient creatures. Two beautifully trained bottoms go down. One belongs to Haffenden\u2019s cocker spaniel. The other to her three-year-old son. \u201cGood boy!\u201d Haffenden says \u2026 to her son. It is a shocking sight.</p> <p>For Haffenden, what is really shocking is that we are not all using dog training on our children. She believes: \u201cIf everyone parented the way we train dogs, we would end up with more confident, compassionate and curious human beings.\u201d She is willing to put her reputation on the line for it. Her controversial methods include using clickers and treats. She thinks that \u201ckids are a lot more like dogs than people like to think\u201d.</p> <p>As deliberately button-pressing Channel 4 programme titles go, <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/train-your-baby-like-a-dog\" title=\"\">Train Your Baby Like a Dog</a> comes from the same irony-clad but structurally unsound stable as Wife Swap, My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, The Undateables and so on, ad offendum. What are we to make of a show advocating the treatment of babies like animals? Is it funny? Absurd? Actually quite sensible beneath all the sensationalism? Or is it disturbing? Dehumanising? Dangerous? A cue, for anyone in their right mind, to call social services?</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"http://change.org\" title=\"\">change.org</a> petition, it is all of the latter. \u201cCancel Train Your Baby Like a Dog,\u201d which at the time of writing had <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/channel-4-cancel-train-your-baby-like-a-dog\" title=\"\">nearly 25,000 signatures</a>, points out, pretty uncontentiously, that \u201cchildren are not dogs!\u201d. It claims that clicker training \u2013 which we see Haffenden successfully using to reprogramme a 14-month-old\u2019s fear of bathtime \u2013 is dehumanising and potentially traumatising. Initiated by an autistic-led organisation in London, the petition states that clicker training is used in Applied Behaviour Analysis therapy to redirect the behaviour of autistic children. As the parent of an autistic child myself (and, full disclosure, an intermittently obedient dog), who, as with many others, finds ABA as upsetting and unethical as LGBT+ conversion therapy, this is profoundly disturbing stuff.</p> <p>And yet Haffenden\u2019s parenting advice is neither as dubious nor as extreme as all this might lead you to expect. With three-year-old Greydon, prone to tantrums, aggression and attention-seeking, her techniques include making him a play room (dogs act up when they are bored) and rewarding good behaviour instead of punishing bad, which is the mantra of positive reinforcement dog training. It works. Greydon starts saying \u201cPlease\u201d and \u201cThank you\u201d. He becomes more independent. Happier. The real breakthrough is his parents focusing on him more.</p> <p>The fact that Haffenden\u2019s methods can be intuitive, effective and kind doesn\u2019t justify them, though. Worse, it shows that standard advice around parenting styles \u2013 from, broadly speaking, attachment to crying it out \u2013 means we might be treating pets more humanely than children.

      "bodyText": "Southern Spain. A rural location we will call, to use the correct overblown reality TV lingo, \u201can oasis of canine calm\u201d. \u201cSit!\u201d instructs Jo-Rosie Haffenden, an animal trainer, behaviourist and owner of a degree in human psychology and many spookily obedient creatures. Two beautifully trained bottoms go down. One belongs to Haffenden\u2019s cocker spaniel. The other to her three-year-old son. \u201cGood boy!\u201d Haffenden says \u2026 to her son. It is a shocking sight. For Haffenden, what is really shocking is that we are not all using dog training on our children. She believes: \u201cIf everyone parented the way we train dogs, we would end up with more confident, compassionate and curious human beings.\u201d She is willing to put her reputation on the line for it. Her controversial methods include using clickers and treats. She thinks that \u201ckids are a lot more like dogs than people like to think\u201d. As deliberately button-pressing Channel 4 programme titles go, Train Your Baby Like a Dog comes from the same irony-clad but structurally unsound stable as Wife Swap, My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, The Undateables and so on, ad offendum. What are we to make of a show advocating the treatment of babies like animals? Is it funny? Absurd? Actually quite sensible beneath all the sensationalism? Or is it disturbing? Dehumanising? Dangerous? A cue, for anyone in their right mind, to call social services? According to a change.org petition, it is all of the latter. \u201cCancel Train Your Baby Like a Dog,\u201d which at the time of writing had nearly 25,000 signatures, points out, pretty uncontentiously, that \u201cchildren are not dogs!\u201d. It claims that clicker training \u2013 which we see Haffenden successfully using to reprogramme a 14-month-old\u2019s fear of bathtime \u2013 is dehumanising and potentially traumatising. Initiated by an autistic-led organisation in London, the petition states that clicker training is used in Applied Behaviour Analysis therapy to redirect the behaviour of autistic children. As the parent of an autistic child myself (and, full disclosure, an intermittently obedient dog), who, as with many others, finds ABA as upsetting and unethical as LGBT+ conversion therapy, this is profoundly disturbing stuff. And yet Haffenden\u2019s parenting advice is neither as dubious nor as extreme as all this might lead you to expect. With three-year-old Greydon, prone to tantrums, aggression and attention-seeking, her techniques include making him a play room (dogs act up when they are bored) and rewarding good behaviour instead of punishing bad, which is the mantra of positive reinforcement dog training. It works. Greydon starts saying \u201cPlease\u201d and \u201cThank you\u201d. He becomes more independent. Happier. The real breakthrough is his parents focusing on him more. The fact that Haffenden\u2019s methods can be intuitive, effective and kind doesn\u2019t justify them, though. Worse, it shows that standard advice around parenting styles \u2013 from, broadly speaking, attachment to crying it out \u2013 means we might be treating pets more humanely than children. Take Dulcie, the aforementioned 14-month-old, whose distress at bathtime is connected to her terror of bedtime. Every night her mum puts her in her cot and she screams for hours. Her equally distraught mother runs back and forth trying to soothe her. Eventually, they end up passed out on the sofa in a sweaty, traumatised heap. It is horrendous, for both of them. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t allow a dog to get into this state,\u201d Haffenden observes, watching remotely as Dulcie howls in the dark. \u201cIt\u2019s inhumane.\u201d Ouch.

      "bodyText": "The planet is facing a mounting and \u201cinvisible\u201d water pollution crisis, according to a hard-hitting World Bank report, which claims the issue is responsible for a one-third reduction in potential economic growth in the most heavily affected areas. The study, which assembled the world\u2019s largest database of water pollution, assesses how a combination of bacteria, sewage, chemicals and plastics suck oxygen from water supplies and transform water into poison for people and ecosystems. While much international attention has been focused on the question of water quantity, not least as the planet warms, a secondary impact of the climate emergency has been its effect on water quality. Because of the huge number of different pollutants entering the environment, researchers focused on the key measures for water quality laid down in the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals, in particular nutrient loads, salt balances, and the overall environmental health. The authors of the report employed a variety of technologies to study the problem, including satellite imaging of major algae blooms and artificial intelligence to assess the data they were collecting. In particular researchers looked at a key measure called biological oxygen demand (BOD) to assess how much organic pollution is in water, using it as an indicator of overall water quality. The researchers noted that when BOD crosses a certain threshold, GDP growth in areas affected by the problem drops by as much as a third because of the impact on health, agriculture and ecosystems. Although issues with water pollution affect both rich and poor countries, the researchers suggest that developing countries have the least resources to deal with the issue. A key contributor to poor water quality is nitrogen, which, applied as fertiliser in agriculture, eventually enters rivers, lakes and oceans where it transforms into nitrates. Early exposure of children to nitrates affects their growth and brain development, impacting their health and adult earning potential. The run-off and release into water from every additional kilogram of nitrogen fertiliser per hectare can increase the level of childhood stunting by as much as 19% percent and reduce future adult earnings by as much as 2%, compared with those who are not exposed. Researchers also looked at the growing issue of salinity \u2013 salt contamination \u2013 blamed on more intense droughts, storm surges and rising water extraction. They estimated that at current levels its impact on agriculture means that the food lost because of saline water across the world would feed 170 million people. The report notes that even wealthy countries still have serious issues with water pollution. \u201cEven high-income economies with well-resourced institutions find themselves unable to cope with the challenges,\u201d the authors report, citing the notorious contamination of the drinking water supply in Flint in the US. \u201cFour decades after the passing of the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act, over 100,000 residents in Flint were exposed to lead in their drinking water. \u201cIt required a national movement and three years for water to return to acceptable safety levels, but not before potentially thousands of children had been exposed to the irreversible harm caused by lead poisoning,\u201d said the report. \u201cIn Europe, countries such as France, Germany and Greece have been fined by the European Court of Justice for violating the regulatory limits for nitrates. Almost a third of monitoring stations in Germany present levels of nitrates exceeding the European Union\u2019s limits.\u201d \u201cWhen it comes to what\u2019s the cause of this problem, there are two forces,\u201d Richard Damania, a World Bank senior economic advisor and a lead author of the report, told the Guardian. \u201cThe first is climate change, which affects both water quantity and quality. The second is population growth and production. The debate has always focused on the issue of quantity, but it becomes obvious when you look below the surface that there are thousands of pollutants. \u201cWe find that water pollution is a problem that affects both rich and poor countries, however the cocktail of chemicals changes as countries develop. In poor countries it is faecal bacteria and as GDP increases then nitrogen [from fertilisers] becomes the issue.\u201d \u201cClean water is a key factor for economic growth,\u201d added the World Bank Group president, David Malpass. \u201cDeteriorating water quality is stalling economic growth, worsening health conditions, reducing food production, and exacerbating poverty in many countries. \u201cTheir governments must take urgent actions to help tackle water pollution so that countries can grow faster in equitable and environmentally sustainable ways.\u201d",

Twenty-six wickets fell in the day as first Essex lost nine for 82, then <strong>Kent</strong> were bowled out for 40, their lowest total at the St Lawrence ground.</p> <p>Sam Cook grabbed seven for 23 \u2013 and 12 for 65 in the match. No Kent batsman could reach double figures. Chasing 153 to win, Essex made it by the skin of their teeth. The pitch liaison officer said \u201cno blame\u201d could be attached to the pitch.</p> <p><strong>Somerset</strong>, top of the chasing pack, have an outside chance of a win at Edgbaston after <strong>Warwickshire</strong> subsided to 146 all out. Tom Abell pocketed a career-best four for 49. Earlier Somerset had avoided the follow-on thanks to 109 from Steve Davies.</p> <p><strong>Lancashire</strong> cruised to an innings and 150-run victory over <strong>Glamorgan</strong> at Colwyn Bay to rest at the top of Division Two, a whopping 43 points above Northamptonshire. Glamorgan were dismissed by mid-afternoon, Danny Lamb dismissing both openers, and Tom Bailey and Saqib Mahmood picking up three wickets each.</p> <p><strong>Nottinghamshire</strong> are in danger of slipping further into the relegation mire at Scarborough. Chasing 387 to win, they lost four wickets in the final session to finish on 135 for four.</p> <p>Ollie Pope flew a flag to the England selectors with 176 not out at the Oval in his first championship game back since a shoulder operation. Scott Borthwick also made a century, his first for two years. <strong>Leicestershire</strong> followed on at the Riverside after Bydon Carse finished with a career-best six for 63. </p> <p><strong>Northamptonshire</strong> smoothed the paper on the file marked Division One, after their 10-wicket defeat of <strong>Worcestershire</strong> left them in second place. Moeen Ali had looked in vintage flow while making 40 before he was run out going for a third. Rikki Wessels threw the bat for 84, ensuring Northants had to bat again.</p> <p><strong>Sussex</strong> snatched a seven-wicket victory at Hove after a fightback from <strong>Middlesex</strong>\u2019s batsmen had left them chasing 145 to win.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d5c3f7f8f081cf11cf1a051\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-20T18:50:53.197Z\">7.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>What an incredible game at Canterbury!!! </strong>And what a day all round.

      "bodyText": "A ridiculous match at Canterbury finished with Essex winning by three wickets to extend their lead at the top of Division One. Twenty-six wickets fell in the day as first Essex lost nine for 82, then Kent were bowled out for 40, their lowest total at the St Lawrence ground. Sam Cook grabbed seven for 23 \u2013 and 12 for 65 in the match. No Kent batsman could reach double figures. Chasing 153 to win, Essex made it by the skin of their teeth. The pitch liaison officer said \u201cno blame\u201d could be attached to the pitch. Somerset, top of the chasing pack, have an outside chance of a win at Edgbaston after Warwickshire subsided to 146 all out. Tom Abell pocketed a career-best four for 49. Earlier Somerset had avoided the follow-on thanks to 109 from Steve Davies. Lancashire cruised to an innings and 150-run victory over Glamorgan at Colwyn Bay to rest at the top of Division Two, a whopping 43 points above Northamptonshire. Glamorgan were dismissed by mid-afternoon, Danny Lamb dismissing both openers, and Tom Bailey and Saqib Mahmood picking up three wickets each. Nottinghamshire are in danger of slipping further into the relegation mire at Scarborough. Chasing 387 to win, they lost four wickets in the final session to finish on 135 for four. Ollie Pope flew a flag to the England selectors with 176 not out at the Oval in his first championship game back since a shoulder operation. Scott Borthwick also made a century, his first for two years. Leicestershire followed on at the Riverside after Bydon Carse finished with a career-best six for 63. Northamptonshire smoothed the paper on the file marked Division One, after their 10-wicket defeat of Worcestershire left them in second place. Moeen Ali had looked in vintage flow while making 40 before he was run out going for a third. Rikki Wessels threw the bat for 84, ensuring Northants had to bat again. Sussex snatched a seven-wicket victory at Hove after a fightback from Middlesex\u2019s batsmen had left them chasing 145 to win. What an incredible game at Canterbury!!! And what a day all round. Plenty to look forward to tomorrow too - with events at Edgbaston and Scarborough in particular looking promising. Thank you so much for all your comments and emails - I\u2019m leaving you in Graham\u2019s hands tomorrow as I\u2019m off to La Belle France! See you in September. Good night! I must go and write up but don\u2019t take your eyes off Canterbury, Hove and Scarborough! Ah, the old saying :when the sun comes out at Canterbury, Tom Westley will be bowled by Mitchell Claydon. Essex (83-5) need 70 to win. A small trophy to Derby for digging in. They\u2019ve threaded together a small lead, with Madsen and Lace following where Godleman and Reece trod: 231 for two....if they can just bat till tea tomorrow... It\u2019s been a wee cracker of a game down in Hove - I missed my lunchtime stroll to the beach today. Anyway, Sussex 37-1, need 108 to win. Salt the man gone, bowled by Murtagh. And now, while I was counting up how many batsmen had been bowled in the second innings, Haines\u2019 stumps disappear too, care of Finn. Of the 12 wickets to fall in the second innings - half have been bowled. So mull over that BTLers! Mutual, at least in theory... Clare Connor: \u201cMark passionately championed the development of the women\u2019s game during his time in this role and we thank him for all he has contributed to England women\u2019s cricket during such an exciting stage of our journey. \u201cAfter discussions with Mark, we have agreed that now is the right time for him to step down as England Women\u2019s Head Coach.\u201d Mark Robinson:\u201dAlthough the recent Ashes was a difficult series, a few hard weeks doesn\u2019t take anything away from what has been a wonderful four years. I\u2019ve had so many highlights and memorable moments with the team. \u201cNothing could ever surpass winning the ICC Women\u2019s World Cup on home soil, but from a pure coaching perspective, reaching the T20 final last November \u2013 with a depleted team, three non-contracted players and three players twenty years old or younger \u2013 is a huge personal highlight. \u201cIt\u2019s been exciting to watch so many players grow and to watch so many records broken, but it feels the right time for me to take on a new challenge and to allow a different voice to come in before the next T20 World Cup in Australia. \u201cWe have put a lot of groundwork in place, and this, coupled with the new investment into the women\u2019s game will make a huge difference in time. I would like to thank everyone associated with England Women for all the kindness and support they have shown me and wish Heather and the team all the best for the future.\u201d Assistant Coach Alastair Maiden takes temporary charge ahead of the ICC Women\u2019s Championship series against Pakistan in December Warwickshire 80 for 4, but the lead is 191. Two each for Abell and Brooks. And I haven\u2019t popped my nose in at Scarborough for a while, ah, better than I expected Notts. A relatively respectable 51 for two three...Clarke just Maharajed for four. And Ravi Bopara turns on his heel after edging Stevens behind to the other Ollie Robinson for a four-ball spherical nothing. Essex 59-4 And a century to Ollie Pope! Wishing him a truly happy Indian summer. A hundred in his first match back after his shoulder operation to (almost) ensure a draw at The Oval. I swear on the yellow book that when I typed that last entry, Essex were only one down. Essex currently 51 for 3, with Lawrence and, crucially, Alastair Cook, both falling in one Milnes over. Essex are cruising! 51 for 1 and just 102 to win. I don\u2019t know the answer to the question you\u2019re asking, except perhaps an old dog can only do old tricks once a day. Ooooh, interesting - a couple more go down at Edgbaston...Warwickshire 62 for three - a lead of 163 - and all is quiet for now at Canterbury. And Sussex need 145 to win at Hove! Finn (56) and Murtagh made hay this afternoon - adding 79 for the last wicket. Robinson 6-101 - and 14 in the match. Quite handy to have the Middlesex president watching too - that man, he has contacts. Ollie Pope in the nineties at The Oval and poor Dom Sibley crumbling under the (small) spotlight - a grand total of nine runs in two innings against Somerset. At Canterbury 19 of the 31 wickets have been bowled or lbw - I don\u2019t actually know what the \u201cnormal\u201d percentage would be, but that seems large. Billy Godleman (86) and Wayne Madsen have put on over 100 at The County Ground. Actually they PUT on over a hundred - Godleman now out for 86. Derby 177 for 2 trail by 42. Wicket number 20 falls at Canterbury! You know who don\u2019t you? Essex 5/1... Nottinghamshire need 387 to beat Yorkshire (ahem). They\u2019ll resume at Scarborough after tea. Glamorgan bowled out for 138 in their second innings. Three wickets each for Saqib Mahmood and Tom Bailey. Lancashire are 43 points clear at the top of the table. And the light roller is being applied at Canterbury... Sam Cook 8-23. Top scorers Matthew Milnes and Ollie Rayner with nine. Essex need 153 to win. Kent 36 for nine - with not one batsman yet in double figures. Just helpless babes in the face of Sam Cook\u2019s late swing ( 7-19) Well, well, well, the Middlesex lead passes 100. With TRJ up their sleeve, this isn\u2019t over yet. And the good news is that Kent (33-8) only need ten more to beat their lowest Championship score against Essex. A win in three days for Northants, who are now second in the Division two table, nine ahead of Gloucestershire and Glamorgan whose games are still going. Worcestershire remain second bottom, above only Leicestershire. Surrey quietly creeping up on Hampshire. A Borthwick hundred and an Ollie Pope fifty to please the Oval masses. Welcome back Ollie! Can he do enough for a tour place in the last four matches of the season? At Canterbury a trifling 17 wickets have fallen for 110 today. Sam Cook six for 12. I just tuned into the radio coverage and they say the pitch is blameless - it is Sam Cook\u2019s late swing and Amir\u2019s class wot done it. Thought it deserved a sub-head. Highest score this innings is five. Sam Billings, Ollie Rayner, raise your bats. Away from Canterbury briefly, Bresnan has just got off the mark after 24 minutes mooching about at the crease. Fifty for Kohler-Cadmore. The Yorkshire lead is 329. There I was looking for coverage of one wicket at Canterbury, only for the ticket-tape to fast forward another notch. Kent now 10-5... three for Cook, two for Amir and the question is can they last till tea? (No). OH SWEET LORD Kent are 7 for 4! Amir going out with a bang baggsying two in his fifth over and two more for Sam Cook. Oh! Essex are all out for 114. Ah! Kent are 7 for 2. Incidentally I\u2019ve just had some very nice courgette pate. Sounds disgusting I know but trust me, it was good. Well Worcestershire, at least you\u2019ve mad Northants bat again: Rikki Wessels 75 not out in an innings where the bottom five have comfortably outscored the top five. DIVISION ONE Canterbury: Kent 226 (Amir 4-48; Cook 5-42) v Essex 114-9 (Podmore 4-34) The Oval: Surrey 203-3 v Hampshire 367 (Vince 47; Abbot 72; Clarke 7-74). Edgbaston: Warwickshire 419 (Rhodes 82, Yates 141 ) v Somerset 263-7 (Davies 109) Scarborough: Yorkshire 232 (Tattersall 92; Luke Wood 5-67) and 240-5 (Lyth 81) v Nottinghamshire 184 (Olivier 4-60 ) DIVISION TWO Derby: Derbyshire 200 (Higgins 5-54 ) and 65-0 v Gloucestershire 419 Chester-le-Street: Durham 544-9 dec (Alex Lees 181 ) v Leicestershire 220-6 Colwyn Bay: Glamorgan 257 (Hemphrey 56, Patel 54, Carey 51) and 46-4 v Lancashire 545 (Vilas 266) County Ground: Worcestershire 186 (Moeen 42, Leach 53 Hutton 6-57) and 185-8 v Northants 376 Hove: Sussex 309 (Wells 62, Carey 56; Roland-Jones 5-56) v Middlesex 75 (Robinson 8-34) and 252-5 (Robinson 3-64) Anderson came unscathed through a morning\u2019s cricket at Great Crosby in a Lancashire friendly against Leicestershire, as he steps up the recovery process after pulling up with a calf problem at the first Test at Edgbaston. He missed the Second Test at Lord\u2019s and is fighting to be fit for the fourth Test at Old Trafford, after being left out for Headingley this week. Anderson bowled five overs in his first spell and took one for 11 and spent most of the rest morning fielding at first slip. He\u2019s expected to be substituted out sometime during the match. Wheater and Amir take the Essex total past 100. And Bess and Coverton continue to dig in at Edgbaston - deficit now 180 - just 30 more boys... Middlesex have achieved parity at Hove, Simpson and Harris having a good old swing. Which means the game second most likely to finish today now moves up the country to Colwyn Bay, where Glamorgan are 40 for four..both to Gleeson, Billy Root out for a golden duck Derby having a good stab against Gloucesteshire (40-0); and Leicester in a spot of bother at Chester le Street - they\u2019ve lost three wickets this morning, including Azad. Two wickets for Lamb at Colwyn Bay- both openers gone, Glamorgan 38-2. Has anyone read Lambs to the Slaughter by Graham Yallop? It was quite an obscure Christmas present one year. Worcester seven down and nearly out; so too Essex as Claydon gets in on the act. A third for Fidel Edwards at The Oval - overnight foundation Stoneman, but Borthwick passes fifty. Surrey 163 for three. Bess hanging on at Edgbaston and now joined by Craig Overton, Somerset 219 for 7 and in something between a ditch and a puddle. Notts have grabbed two wickets this morning, including Gary Ballance for 61, but the Yorkshire lead is already 268. A lovely spin from Emma John - do read it if you have a chance. Say it ain\u2019t so Mo: he\u2019s been RUN-OUT! Worcestershire 110 for six, after losing Joe Leach the ball before. I loved watching Worcestershire last year - and they pushed Surrey so strongly in the game where Surrey clinched the Championship, I think they were favourites to jump straight back up to Division One. I guess, sometimes, you just have a crap year. Two for Stevens, three for Podmore now as Kent kindly help out everyone who fancies a heart-in-mouth jaunt down to Taunton next month. Essex 49 for five but, alas, Davies is out at Edgbaston for 109. Somerset 201-6, with more than that needed for parity. Dig in Dom! Yorkshire weather doing its best to make Australia feel welcome. A third (well, eleventh) for Robinson at Hove - and, unfortunately for Middlesex, it is Sam Robson for 68. John Simpson has battled to fifty. Middx 194-5, trail by 40. I see Joe Leach has leapt four places up the batting order for Worcestershire. He and Mo showing some steel against Northants, putting on 58 for the fifth wicket - over half of them in boundaries. Worcs 88-4, still 102 behind. Somerset still chipping away at Edgbaston. Steve Davies, a rather wonderful hundred! Bravo! Davies, who kept wicket for Surrey and Worcestershire before coming to Somerset (thanks, Mes!), hasn\u2019t made a hundred in the Championship since 2017. Grizzly 1 Chef 0 https://twitter.com/KentCricket/status/1163757806471786496 Evidence! And in other news- Darren Stevens continues to do what he does in the best kind of way....Alastair Cook shuffling in front and snapped up for a mere 12. Essex 41-3! Grif is scratching his head: Jimmy was named in the Second XI squad, but from what I can see, not the 11. Does that mean he\u2019s definitely not bowling, or is there some leeway for the greatest seamer of all time? Hmmm, I see what you mean. Here he is hovering ominously on the shoulder of Perry. I see Hass is playing too- as captain. I\u2019m intrigued by the rumours I read BTL yesterday - will try to do some digging from this end. Hang on! Jimmy seems to be bowling now... DIVISION ONE Canterbury: Kent 226 (Amir 4-48; Cook 5-42) v Essex 32-1. The Oval: Surrey 109-2 v Hampshire 367 (Vince 47; Abbot 72; Clarke 7-74). Edgbaston: Warwickshire 419 (Rhodes 82, Yates 141 ) v Somerset 167-5 (Davies 89 not out) Scarborough: Yorkshire 232 (Tattersall 92; Luke Wood 5-67 and 177-2 (Lyth 81) v Nottinghamshire 184 (Olivier 4-60 ) DIVISION TWO Derby: Derbyshire 200 (Higgins 5-54 ) v Gloucestershire 396-7 Chester-le-Street: Durham 544-9 dec (Alex Lees 181 ) v Leicestershire 155-4 Colwyn Bay: Glamorgan 257 (Hemphrey 56, Patel 54, Carey 51) v Lancashire 545 (Vilas 266) County Ground: Worcestershire 186 (Moeen 42, Leach 53 Hutton 6-57) and 42-4 v Northants 376 Hove: Sussex 309 (Wells 62, Carey 56; Roland-Jones 5-56) v Middlesex 75 (Robinson 8-34 and 149-4 Some news: STEVE SMITH is out of the third Test. Quickly, round the grounds: Sussex are on top at Hove - the deficit is only 85 but I can\u2019t see Middlesex\u2019s batting clawing out of this one. Much, all, rests on Sam Robson. The sun is shining at last at Canterbury, where Essex are desperate to build on their lead at the top of the Championship as Somerset struggle in Birmingham. There much, all, rests on Steve Davies. Surrey need to batten down the hatches at The Oval after the Sam Curran at No.3 experiment failed to take off. And Nottinghamshire could lose today against Yorkshire, who have a lead of 225 with eight wickets still in hand. All hail Dane Vilas, who tore up the record book at Colwyn Bay - a Lancashire lead of 287 should almost seal their promotion to the top tier. Leicestershire still have a way to go to escape danger at Chester-le-Street, but Hassan Azad, owner of a new two-year contract, is unbeaten on 53. Worcestershire\u2019s batting is a walking disaster - cross all fingers and toes for Moeen Ali ; and Gloucestershrie are on top at the County Ground. Good morning! It\u2019s a beautiful day in the south-east of England, but first an apology. I was supposed to be at The Oval today but due to various things going slightly pear-shaped I\u2019m not. Will try to add some colour, but do feel free to send in your own. For all those Lancies out there, a little something. And a little something else:",

The Spanish government said that a warship, Audaz, would depart from the military base of Rota in C\u00e1diz, and take three days to arrive in Lampedusa before bringing the migrants to Mallorca. \u201cSpanish NGO, Spanish ship, Spanish port: rightly so. We are no longer the refugee camp of Europe,\u201d said Salvini, reiterating his refusal to let them disembark. However, a few hours later, prosecutors in Agrigento put an end to the standoff, which should stop the Spanish warship needing to intervene. Last week the Sicilian magistrates also opened an investigation into unknown suspects for the kidnapping of the migrants aboard the Open Arms vessel. If the prosecutors go ahead with the inquiry Salvini risks being investigated once again for the same charge. In January, an Italian court ruled in fact that Salvini should be tried for the kidnapping of 177 asylum seekers he prevented from disembarking the Italian coastguard ship, Ubaldo Diciotti, in August 2018. Salvini was eventually saved by the votes of the M5S, who ruled that the minister should not be stripped of his parliamentary immunity and the case fell apart. There have been many standoffs between NGO vessels and Salvini, who has repeatedly declared Italian seaports closed to rescue vessels. But this one is set against the background of a political crisis after Giuseppe Conte resigned on Tuesday as Italy\u2019s prime minister, blasting Salvini as \u201can opportunist who is only looking after his own interests and those of his party\u201d. Meanwhile, another charity vessel, the Norwegian-flagged Ocean Viking, operated by French charities SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e and Doctors Without Borders, with 356 migrants onboard, is waiting for a safe harbour. As Italy and Malta are continuing to deny entry into their ports, Alarm Phone, a hotline service for migrants in distress at sea, fears that another shipwreck occurred on Saturday with over 100 people missing. \u201cA fisherman told us about a boat turned upside down in the Libyan coast,\u201d said Alarm Phone. Three men, from the Ivory Coast, were rescued and transported to a hospital in Tripoli. According to the survivors\u2019 first testimonies to the fishermen, there were 178 people onboard.",

But now, finally, the truth is out. The next James Bond film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/20/no-time-to-die-james-bond-25-title\">will officially be called</a> No Time to Die.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/20/no-time-to-die-james-bond-25-title\">No Time to Die: 25th James Bond film gets a title</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But what does this mean? What layers of intrigue are buried between those four short words? Let\u2019s explore some No Time to Die theories.</p> <h2>Theory one: the Spectre connection</h2> <p>The title No Time to Die references two key scenes from 2015\u2019s Spectre. In the first, Bond tells Blofeld: \u201cI came here to kill you,\u201d and Blofeld replies: \u201cAnd I thought you came here to die.\u201d In the second, Bond says, \u201cDoesn\u2019t time fly?\u201d and then throws an exploding watch at Blofeld. The callbacks to these two scenes suggest a couple of things. First, No Time to Die will resume the intense to-the-death rivalry between Bond and Blofeld. Second, it will be full of puns so extraordinarily hopeless that just hearing them will feel like being stabbed in the kidneys by Hitler in hell.</p> <h2>Theory two: the death of James Bond</h2> <p>The word \u201cdie\u201d hangs over the new title like an axe, especially when you consider the reason for Danny Boyle departing the film a year ago. He wanted Bond to die at the end, completing Daniel Craig\u2019s cycle, remember? And now there\u2019s this. Perhaps Bond really will die in No Time to Die. You know, just like he did in Live and Let Die, Tomorrow Never Dies and Die Another Day.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChJ_afRiUzo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ChJ_afRiUzo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>Theory three: there\u2019s a letter missing somewhere</h2> <p>No Time to Die is a relatively bland title \u2013 it sounds like a 007 video game made on an especially tight deadline \u2013 which leads me to believe that there must have been a typo. After all, wouldn\u2019t you rather watch No Time to Dine, in which Bond is perpetually thwarted in his efforts to go out for a curry? Or No Time to Diet, in which Bond keeps rationalising his steady yet avoidable weight gain? Or, screw it, what about No Tie to Dye, a film that\u2019s exclusively about Bond\u2019s struggles to start his own business making and selling a range of obnoxiously coloured hand-printed T-shirts? You\u2019d watch that, right? I\u2019d totally watch that.</p> <h2>Theory four: James Bond is very busy</h2> <p>We\u2019ve had lots of focus on the \u201cdie\u201d part of No Time To Die, but not so much on the \u201ctime\u201d part. This feels like an oversight. Maybe this film is about all the demands that Bond constantly feels he has to face \u2013 all the emails he has to reply to, all the errands he has to run, that sort of thing. Maybe it\u2019s about Bond feeling like he has no time to squeeze any more obligations into his impossibly busy life, even dying. Maybe \u2013 and bear with me here \u2013 No Time to Die is actually a mature and sensitive exploration of the causes and symptoms of millennial burnout. Maybe the whole third act just revolves around Bond really getting into mindfulness apps.</p> <h2>Theory five: James Bond is a toddler now</h2> <p>I have a two-year-old son. Let me tell you from painful experience that this title follows the exact cadence of a tired and hungry toddler. If I tell him: \u201cTime to brush our teeth,\u201d he\u2019ll reply: \u201cNo time to brush our teeth.\u201d If I tell him: \u201cTime to tidy up,\u201d he\u2019ll reply: \u201cNo time to tidy up.\u201d If I tell him: \u201cTime to eat your vegetables,\u201d he\u2019ll reply: \u201cNo time to eat vegetables, vegetables stinky yuck.\u201d So logic dictates that in No Time to Die, Craig will waddle around in a nappy angrily bickering with an authority figure who has just told him that it\u2019s time to die. If this isn\u2019t the case, I\u2019ll eat my hat.</p>",

The incident comes days after a civil servant was attacked outside one of the department\u2019s other premises in the capital.

The man, who is in his 30s, was \u201cflagged down and taken into custody\u201d, according to the Metropolitan police. The street is the location of Becket House, an immigration reporting centre where people who do not have permission to stay in the UK are required to attend regular appointments. The incident is not being treated as terrorism-related and it is understood no one was injured. In a separate incident last Thursday another man was arrested outside a different Home Office building in central London after a civil servant in his 60s was slashed with a knife. Dominic Hornberger, 29, from Birmingham, appeared in court on Monday after being charged on Friday with grievous bodily harm with intent and possession of a knife in a public place. After his appearance at Westminster magistrates court he was remanded in custody to appear at Southwark crown court on 13 September. The man who was injured in the Thursday lunchtime attack works for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, which is in the same building as the headquarters of the Home Office in Westminster.

The president, Sergio Mattarella, is now calling the shots in a crisis triggered when Matteo Salvini pulled the plug on the League\u2019s tenuous relationship with the Five Star Movement (M5S) in an attempt to capitalise on his popularity and become PM. Mattarella has three options: immediately dissolve parliament and call a snap election; begin consultations with parties to see if a new parliamentary majority can be formed; or install a caretaker government to at least pass Italy\u2019s budget for 2020. Salvini is a highly effective campaigner, and support for the far-right League has risen from 17% at the 2018 election to 38% in recent polls, but his miscalculations in recent weeks reveal that he is not so much of a strategist. A key blunder was failing to factor in the possibility of M5S teaming up with the centre-left Democratic party (PD) to forge a new majority in parliament, where they are the two largest parties. The potential threat became clear when the two blocked Salvini\u2019s calls for an immediate vote of no-confidence in Conte last week. \u201cI think he believed that he could easily translate his consensus among voters in line with votes in parliament,\u201d said Alfonso Giordano, a politics professor at Rome\u2019s Luiss University. \u201cHe forgot that the League is still only at 17%.\u201d The former prime minister Matteo Renzi has overseen talks between factions of M5S and the PD but they are yet to be endorsed by the PD leader, Nicola Zingaretti, who said last week that a coalition with M5S would be a \u201cgift to the dangerous right\u201d. A source said on Tuesday that Zingaretti\u2019s first choice was still new elections. \u201cWe are only at the beginning of a complicated match,\u201d the source said. If the two parties do manage to strike an agreement, Salvini would be ousted from his roles as deputy prime minister and interior minister, from which he has spent the last year building up his and the League\u2019s profile. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t go to elections, in the short-term it is a problem as he could lose ground if in opposition for too long,\u201d said Giordano.",

In fact, our share of the world\u2019s traded coal market is bigger than Saudi Arabia\u2019s share of the world oil market. If Australia opened the Adani mine, and all the other mines proposed in Australia, we would indeed double our coal exports. But we would also drive down the world price of coal, drive down production in existing coalmines, and drive up global emissions. It\u2019s not complicated. But while Australia shows no sign of transitioning away from fossil fuels, we have well and truly transitioned away from economics and common sense when it comes to coal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/19/australia-is-third-largest-exporter-of-fossil-fuels-behind-russia-and-saudi-arabia\">Australia is third largest exporter of fossil fuels behind Russia and Saudi Arabia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And in the rush to mine more coal, Australia is transitioning away from its stated foreign policy. Since the second world war, Australia has sought to play a leadership role among the Pacific Island nations. This positioning has provided both a physical buffer to our north and a significant diplomatic platform. But that could all be coming to an end.</p> <p>In 2015 Pacific Island nations issued the Suva Declaration calling on Australia to stop building new coalmines. This request was repeated last month in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/31/pacific-leaders-plead-with-australia-to-drop-plans-to-carry-over-emissions-credits\">Nadi Bay </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/31/pacific-leaders-plead-with-australia-to-drop-plans-to-carry-over-emissions-credits\">declaration</a>. Yet last week, the Australian prime minister seemed either surprised or enraged that such a request would be included in the Pacific Island Forum declaration in Tuvalu. Adding insult to injury, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/16/pacific-islands-will-survive-climate-crisis-because-they-can-pick-our-fruit-australias-deputy-pm-says\">deputy </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/16/pacific-islands-will-survive-climate-crisis-because-they-can-pick-our-fruit-australias-deputy-pm-says\">prime </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/16/pacific-islands-will-survive-climate-crisis-because-they-can-pick-our-fruit-australias-deputy-pm-says\">minister </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/16/pacific-islands-will-survive-climate-crisis-because-they-can-pick-our-fruit-australias-deputy-pm-says\"> said</a> he was \u201cannoyed when we have people in those sorts of countries pointing the finger at Australia and say we should be shutting down all our resources sector\u201d, even though \u201cmany of their workers come here to pick our fruit\u201d. There\u2019s a reason why National party MPs don\u2019t get the trade portfolio any more.</p> <p>To be clear, Pacific leaders have never called on Australia to shut down our coalmines. What they have asked, repeatedly, is for us to please stop building new coalmines at a time when Australia\u2019s emissions, the world\u2019s emissions, and the Pacific Ocean are all rising steadily. But despite years of polite requests the Australian government, and large sections of the Australian media, can\u2019t even be bothered to listen properly to what our neighbours are actually asking for.</p> <p>While our deputy PM skilfully managed to interpret the Pacific\u2019s request to stop opening new coalminers as a demand to shut down our entire resources industry, he was not alone in his wilful deafness. Several journalists confused a call to stop building new coalmines with a demand we shut them all down tomorrow. <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/australia-has-lost-pacific-s-trust-on-climate-change-20190816-p52hxg.html\">The Sydney Morning Herald\u2019s editorial</a> informed us: \u201cNo doubt Australia will not be able to meet all the islanders\u2019 demands, which include a ban on new coalmines. We cannot close down the thermal coalmining industry overnight.\u201d No doubt at all.</p> <p>After years of ignoring Pacific leaders\u2019 calls to stop expanding our coal production, the Australian political class has now switched from pretending they can\u2019t hear the Pacific to pretending they don\u2019t understand them. No wonder Pacific Island leaders are getting frustrated.</p> <p>While rising coal production and rising sea levels are working against the Pacific Island nations, a seismic shift in global geopolitics are starting to tilt the tables their way. The strategic rivalry between the US and China in the Asia-Pacific region has rattled the defence and foreign policy establishment of Canberra, who now fear an expansionist China. The 2017<strong> </strong>Foreign Policy White Paper warned of the need to strengthen our relationships with our Pacific neighbours and in 2018 Scott Morrison reversed Tony Abbott\u2019s strategy of aid cuts to the Pacific in announcing his so-called \u201cPacific Step Up\u201d.</p> <p>Announcing a policy and implementing one are quite different things. As last week\u2019s disastrous trip to Tuvalu shows: when given the choice between promoting the expansion of the coal industry or opposing the expansion of China in the Pacific, the Morrison government will choose coal any day. Iceland is hosting a memorial for one of its lost glaciers, Greenland lost 11bn tonnes of ice in a day and the Arctic Circle hit a new record high of 34.8C. But the Australian government is not only on the wrong side of science, it is now on the wrong side of global diplomacy.</p> <p>Next month, world leaders will gather in New York to discuss the progress or, more precisely, the lack of progress on reducing global emissions. Word on the street is that Scott Morrison will be a no-show, despite being in the United States. Apparently \u2013 with Australia\u2019s domestic emissions rising, our determination to use dodgy carbon credits to meet our Paris commitments, and now the open revolt by the Pacific over our plans to build new coalmines \u2013 the reception for Australia might be a little too icy for our prime minister.</p> <p>Australia isn\u2019t just the world\u2019s largest coal exporter. We are the world\u2019s largest exporter of LNG, the third largest exporter of fossil fuels and the 14th largest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the world. We emit more than 40 countries with bigger populations than ours, and our exported emissions add double that again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/20/vanuatu-will-host-the-next-pacific-islands-forum-we-want-to-know-if-australia-really-wants-a-seat-at-the-table\">Vanuatu will host the next Pacific Islands Forum. We want to know if Australia really wants a seat at the table | Ralph Regenvanu</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While Morrison argues that what happens to our coal and gas after we sell it isn\u2019t our problem, that\u2019s not the way the rest of the world sees it. It\u2019s not the way the world sees those countries that export landmines, nuclear weapons technology or endangered species either.</p> <p>Even Morrison knows that the obligations for a country\u2019s actions extend well beyond their borders. That is why he is imposing restrictions on the export of Australian waste, and that\u2019s why he now keeps raising the issue of China funding coal-fired power stations in other countries.</p> <p>But what Morrison does or doesn\u2019t believe is not what matters. What matters are Australia\u2019s actions and how other countries respond. The Pacific Island nations have made clear that they want Australia to stop building new coalmines. They believe we all have a shared obligation to reduce fossil fuel production and consumption. But at the same time Morrison is rebuffing such requests from the Pacific, he is asking them to put their country\u2019s survival aside and work with Australia to secure our own geopolitical and economic interests.

      "bodyText": "Australia isn\u2019t transitioning away from extracting fossil fuels, it is doubling down on them. That\u2019s right \u2013 even though Australia is already the third largest fossil fuel exporter in the world, the federal government still wants to double our coal exports, drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight and open more farmland to fracking. Australia is the world\u2019s largest exporter of coal. In fact, our share of the world\u2019s traded coal market is bigger than Saudi Arabia\u2019s share of the world oil market. If Australia opened the Adani mine, and all the other mines proposed in Australia, we would indeed double our coal exports. But we would also drive down the world price of coal, drive down production in existing coalmines, and drive up global emissions. It\u2019s not complicated. But while Australia shows no sign of transitioning away from fossil fuels, we have well and truly transitioned away from economics and common sense when it comes to coal. And in the rush to mine more coal, Australia is transitioning away from its stated foreign policy. Since the second world war, Australia has sought to play a leadership role among the Pacific Island nations. This positioning has provided both a physical buffer to our north and a significant diplomatic platform. But that could all be coming to an end. In 2015 Pacific Island nations issued the Suva Declaration calling on Australia to stop building new coalmines. This request was repeated last month in the Nadi Bay declaration. Yet last week, the Australian prime minister seemed either surprised or enraged that such a request would be included in the Pacific Island Forum declaration in Tuvalu. Adding insult to injury, the deputy prime minister said he was \u201cannoyed when we have people in those sorts of countries pointing the finger at Australia and say we should be shutting down all our resources sector\u201d, even though \u201cmany of their workers come here to pick our fruit\u201d. There\u2019s a reason why National party MPs don\u2019t get the trade portfolio any more. To be clear, Pacific leaders have never called on Australia to shut down our coalmines. What they have asked, repeatedly, is for us to please stop building new coalmines at a time when Australia\u2019s emissions, the world\u2019s emissions, and the Pacific Ocean are all rising steadily. But despite years of polite requests the Australian government, and large sections of the Australian media, can\u2019t even be bothered to listen properly to what our neighbours are actually asking for. While our deputy PM skilfully managed to interpret the Pacific\u2019s request to stop opening new coalminers as a demand to shut down our entire resources industry, he was not alone in his wilful deafness. Several journalists confused a call to stop building new coalmines with a demand we shut them all down tomorrow. The Sydney Morning Herald\u2019s editorial informed us: \u201cNo doubt Australia will not be able to meet all the islanders\u2019 demands, which include a ban on new coalmines. We cannot close down the thermal coalmining industry overnight.\u201d No doubt at all. After years of ignoring Pacific leaders\u2019 calls to stop expanding our coal production, the Australian political class has now switched from pretending they can\u2019t hear the Pacific to pretending they don\u2019t understand them. No wonder Pacific Island leaders are getting frustrated. While rising coal production and rising sea levels are working against the Pacific Island nations, a seismic shift in global geopolitics are starting to tilt the tables their way. The strategic rivalry between the US and China in the Asia-Pacific region has rattled the defence and foreign policy establishment of Canberra, who now fear an expansionist China. The 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper warned of the need to strengthen our relationships with our Pacific neighbours and in 2018 Scott Morrison reversed Tony Abbott\u2019s strategy of aid cuts to the Pacific in announcing his so-called \u201cPacific Step Up\u201d. Announcing a policy and implementing one are quite different things. As last week\u2019s disastrous trip to Tuvalu shows: when given the choice between promoting the expansion of the coal industry or opposing the expansion of China in the Pacific, the Morrison government will choose coal any day. Iceland is hosting a memorial for one of its lost glaciers, Greenland lost 11bn tonnes of ice in a day and the Arctic Circle hit a new record high of 34.8C. But the Australian government is not only on the wrong side of science, it is now on the wrong side of global diplomacy. Next month, world leaders will gather in New York to discuss the progress or, more precisely, the lack of progress on reducing global emissions. Word on the street is that Scott Morrison will be a no-show, despite being in the United States. Apparently \u2013 with Australia\u2019s domestic emissions rising, our determination to use dodgy carbon credits to meet our Paris commitments, and now the open revolt by the Pacific over our plans to build new coalmines \u2013 the reception for Australia might be a little too icy for our prime minister. Australia isn\u2019t just the world\u2019s largest coal exporter. We are the world\u2019s largest exporter of LNG, the third largest exporter of fossil fuels and the 14th largest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the world. We emit more than 40 countries with bigger populations than ours, and our exported emissions add double that again. While Morrison argues that what happens to our coal and gas after we sell it isn\u2019t our problem, that\u2019s not the way the rest of the world sees it. It\u2019s not the way the world sees those countries that export landmines, nuclear weapons technology or endangered species either. Even Morrison knows that the obligations for a country\u2019s actions extend well beyond their borders. That is why he is imposing restrictions on the export of Australian waste, and that\u2019s why he now keeps raising the issue of China funding coal-fired power stations in other countries. But what Morrison does or doesn\u2019t believe is not what matters. What matters are Australia\u2019s actions and how other countries respond. The Pacific Island nations have made clear that they want Australia to stop building new coalmines. They believe we all have a shared obligation to reduce fossil fuel production and consumption. But at the same time Morrison is rebuffing such requests from the Pacific, he is asking them to put their country\u2019s survival aside and work with Australia to secure our own geopolitical and economic interests. What could go wrong? \u2022 Richard Denniss is the chief economist at the Australia Institute",

      "bodyText": "Supermarket giant Coles has signed a long-term contract to get electricity from three new solar farms, the latest in a series of companies that have turned to renewable energy to lower power bills. It comes as a group of 41 retailers and businesses including Bunnings, Harvey Norman, Ikea and JB Hi-Fi plan an unprecedented joint electricity purchase in a bid to reduce costs. Coles announced a 10-year deal to buy most of the electricity generated at three new solar farms to be built outside Wagga Wagga, Corowa and Junee in NSW. The plants will be operated by global clean energy company Metka EGN and are expected to provide the equivalent of 10% of Coles\u2019 power needs from June next year. Steven Cain, Coles Group\u2019s chief executive, said the company was committed to being the most sustainable supermarket in Australia. It had spent more than $40m on energy efficiency over two years and installed solar panels on 30 stores, with another 38 to follow this financial year. The supermarket agreement follows a similar announcement on Monday by Molycop, a manufacturer for mining and rail companies, that it had signed an 11-year-deal to take electricity from a separate solar farm near Wagga and the Sapphire wind farm in northern NSW to help it limit the impact of rising power prices. Consultants Energetics say corporate power purchase agreements have supported about 3700 megawatts of clean energy since 2016, more than 80% of which have been new developments. About half of the projects underpinned by big business have been large-scale solar, 40% wind and just under 10% a mix of the two. Companies to have signed renewable energy contracts include the Commonwealth Bank, Bluescope Steel, Telstra and zinc refiner Sun Metals. While there is uncertainty over whether the clean energy boom of the past two years will continue, Kane Thornton, chief executive of industry group the Clean Energy Council, said the falling cost of solar and wind energy suggested deals would continue to be signed. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to see more and more businesses got it alone or join consortia to provide their power and the economics says more and more that will be renewables,\u201d he said. The group of 41 retailers, also including Officeworks, Chemist Warehouse, Costco and Spotlight, have applied to the consumer watchdog for approval to ask for tenders to supply their power needs, which adds up to 0.5% of the total electricity drawn from the national grid. Lodged on behalf of the businesses by the Large Format Retail Association, the application to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission does not say the electricity would be renewable, but it cites two previous large-scale clean energy bulk buys, by the South Australian Chamber of Mines and Energy and the City of Melbourne, as evidence of why the application should be approved. It says the consortium could expand to include other companies, but would not make up more than 1% of electricity use, and could lead to investment in new generation while lowering power bills for member companies. Tony Wood, energy program director with thinktank the Grattan Institute, said the joint bid illustrated the frustration businesses felt about high electricity prices, which have been linked to the lack of a coherent national energy policy. Lindsay Soutar, a campaigner with Greenpeace, said the Coles deal was a \u201cgreat first step\u201d and showed companies were now leading the way on a transition to 100% renewable energy. \u201cPeople have the choice to support the businesses that are doing their part in enabling a safe and healthy climate,\u201d she said.",

You cannot really trust the speed guns, when during this same Lord\u2019s Test one of Archer\u2019s loopy knuckleballs got clocked at 90mph.</p> <p>Scientists have tried to get more precise measurements. A study done in 1976 clocked Jeff Thompson\u2019s top speed at 99.8mph, and Michael Holding\u2019s at 95.2mph, but then another, just three years later had Thompson at 91.8mph and Holding at 87.76mph.

But in the end, right towards the end of his life, he still believed \u201cthe only true judge of a bowler\u2019s speed is the batsman himself\u201d.</p> <p>The truth is that, just as in baseball, there has always been a small number of men who are able to bowl right up above 95mph. It\u2019s not a peak but a plateau and up there everything gets subjective and dependent on a wild number of variables. Not just the predictable ones, like the batsman\u2019s ability, and their familiarity with the bowler\u2019s action, the pitch and the atmospheric conditions, but more ephemeral things too. Perhaps the <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/668721.html\" title=\"\">batsman</a><a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/668721.html\" title=\"\"> has happened to catch the bowler in a bad mood</a>; maybe, like Smith did, he just made the mistake of thrashing him through cover for four. They are all fast, who is fastest depends on who you were unlucky enough to face and where and when it happened.</p>",

And there was another fast bowler in this very same Test, Pat Cummins, who swept away South Africa with six for 79 in Johannesburg when he was an 18-year-old tearaway playing his first match in 2011. So it\u2019s not just the batsmen who stop thinking clearly. The spectators do too. We get so worked up about what\u2019s in front of us we cannot believe it was ever any better. There is a school of thought that bowlers are bound to be faster now, simply because of the advances in sport science, strength and conditioning. Records progress, the argument goes. Except no one has come within 20cm of Mike Powell\u2019s long jump world record in almost 30 years and Seb Coe still holds the British 800m record set in 1981, and the time Jim Hines ran in the 1968 Olympic 100m final would have won him bronze at the world championships in 2017 in a dead heat with Usain Bolt. In baseball, the fastest recorded pitch was thrown by Aroldis Chapman, 105.1mph, in 2010 but retrospective analysis has shown Nolan Ryan was pitching nearly as quick in 1974 and Bob Feller was not so far behind in 1946. Pitchers have been throwing at 100mph for almost 100 years. There are no great leap forwards left to make. In cricket, the fastest ball is still Shoaib Akhtar\u2019s to Nick Knight during Pakistan\u2019s match against England in the 2003 World Cup. But Knight played it like he faced it hundreds of times before and even Shoaib admitted there is some scepticism about the measurement. You cannot really trust the speed guns, when during this same Lord\u2019s Test one of Archer\u2019s loopy knuckleballs got clocked at 90mph. Scientists have tried to get more precise measurements. A study done in 1976 clocked Jeff Thompson\u2019s top speed at 99.8mph, and Michael Holding\u2019s at 95.2mph, but then another, just three years later had Thompson at 91.8mph and Holding at 87.76mph. Back before that Frank Tyson, likely the fastest England ever had, remembered being tested at New Zealand\u2019s Aeronautical College in Wellington in 1955. \u201cWe bowled in two or three sweaters,\u201d Tyson said, \u201cand I cannot vouch for the length of our run-ups.\u201d Tyson says he was clocked at 89mph, from a strolling start. Tyson knew as much about fast bowling as anyone. \u201cHe fell into the particularly modern pattern of the sportsman who, by taking thought, has added a cubit to his athletic stature,\u201d wrote John Arlott. \u201cHe applied an academically trained brain to sport and, beginning from the basic principles of bowling, analysed his physical assets and exploited them to maximum effect.\u201d As a player, writer, scholar, and coach, Tyson made a lifelong study of both the art and science of fast bowling. He became an early evangelist for biomechanics. But in the end, right towards the end of his life, he still believed \u201cthe only true judge of a bowler\u2019s speed is the batsman himself\u201d. The truth is that, just as in baseball, there has always been a small number of men who are able to bowl right up above 95mph. It\u2019s not a peak but a plateau and up there everything gets subjective and dependent on a wild number of variables. Not just the predictable ones, like the batsman\u2019s ability, and their familiarity with the bowler\u2019s action, the pitch and the atmospheric conditions, but more ephemeral things too. Perhaps the batsman has happened to catch the bowler in a bad mood; maybe, like Smith did, he just made the mistake of thrashing him through cover for four. They are all fast, who is fastest depends on who you were unlucky enough to face and where and when it happened.",

The Home Office has released a factsheet for EU citizens resident in the UK, reiterating that people have until at least 31 December 2020 to apply for settled status, which allows them to remain in the UK. But many of the questions troubling EU residents remain unanswered. \u201cUnfortunately this still does not answer the most important question: how will border officials, employers, landlords, the NHS and others distinguish between EU citizens who came to live in the UK before 31 October and those who came after? It leaves people with the impression that the government itself doesn\u2019t know. It simply doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d said Stephanie Dawoud of IMIX, an immigration charity supporting EU citizens in the UK. Many were concerned about making half-term trips, and several said they had cancelled travel plans because they were worried about how they would prove entitlement to return to the UK if free movement ended. An Australian woman who has dual nationality through her French husband said she was cancelling a trip back to Australia to inter her mother\u2019s ashes. \u201cI am unsure if I will be able to return as I have no proof that I am legally resident,\u201d she wrote. A solicitor who moved from Sweden at the age of three in the 1980s, who has not yet applied for settled status because she does not have an Android phone, said she was unhappy about having to apply to live in a country she had lived in for decades. The application cannot yet be done on an iPhone, although the Home Office said this will be possible in the autumn, but can be done by post or by going to a dedicated scanning centre, although this takes longer. Dana Whiston, a German citizen about to move to the UK with her British husband, said she was worried she would be in legal limbo on arrival. \u201cWhat will happen if I go abroad on holiday? What distinction is there between me and someone arriving after 31 October if I have no proof of my status? The government is not prepared to answer these questions clearly. They are not interested in giving EU nationals any kind of security. All they want is to be seen to be hard on immigration,\u201d she wrote. Many people were concerned about how they would prove their entitlement to be in the UK when applying for work, bank accounts or medical care. They were not fully reassured by the Home Office\u2019s statement that they would remain eligible until December 2020. \u201cWhat concerns me is what lies ahead, if I am looking for a new place to live in or work at, I am certain that people will ask for proof that I am allowed to live and work here, and a passport won\u2019t be sufficient,\u201d wrote one woman who has not yet applied for settled status. Pawel Sobocinski, a Polish national who teaches computer science at Southhampton University, said he had decided to emigrate next month to Estonia, where he has found a better-paid teaching job. \u201cIt\u2019s an insult to be asked to apply for settled status after paying taxes for 15 years and teaching thousands of British university students,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are lots of reasons why I\u2019m leaving, but Brexit is a big part of it.\u201d The Home Office said EU citizens and their families should apply to the settled status scheme to avoid possible complications. \u201cHowever, for those who haven\u2019t applied when free movement ends, they will still have the same entitlements to work, benefits and services and will be able to prove these in the same way as they do now,\u201d the statement said. Laura Shields, of the British in Europe coalition group, said there was parallel anxiety among British citizens living in Europe over their status. \u201cIt has always been about reciprocity. If the EU governments think their nationals are being treated badly, they will act accordingly,\u201d she said. The Royal College of Midwives also expressed concern over the prospect of a sharp end to freedom of movement. \u201cWell over a thousand midwives working in the NHS are citizens of other EU countries. A great many more EU staff work in hospitals, GP practices and NHS services across the country,\u201d said Gill Walton, the organisation\u2019s general secretary. \u201cUnder these rushed plans, from 11pm on 31 October these NHS midwives, maternity support workers, doctors, nurses and others face an abrupt, cliff-edge change in how they are treated at the UK border. \u201cThey will be viewed with suspicion, even hostility. The plans don\u2019t even make sense. How will a UK border control officer even know which EU citizens are resident in the UK and which are not?\u201d",

Copies were also sent to EU27 leaders and the head of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker.</p> \n<p>As the EU made its first public statements, diplomats from the 27 countries were sent an analysis that described key arguments in Johnson\u2019s letter as incorrect and misleading.</p> \n<p>The internal document seen by the Guardian states it was \u201cincorrect\u201d to suggest the people of Northern Ireland would have no influence over EU laws that applied to them, pointing to provisions in the Brexit agreement.</p> \n<p>Officials had already strongly rejected Johnson\u2019s claim that the backstop was anti-democratic, pointing to the fact Northern Ireland had voted to remain in the EU and non-unionist parties were in favour of the backstop.</p> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s claim that it would be possible for two separate legal and economic jurisdictions to exist on the island of Ireland with an open border was judged \u201cmisleading\u201d as EU law provided \u201cthe common framework needed to enable frictionless trade between member states today\u201d.</p> \n<p>While the EU has said it was ready to examine alternative arrangements to the backstop, officials have stressed that no such options exist today anywhere in the world.</p> \n<p>Neale Richmond, an Irish senator, said Johnson\u2019s claim that the backstop posed a threat to the Good Friday agreement was \u201cvery disappointing language\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe negotiations ended in November,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4. \u201cThe British government in good faith agreed the withdrawal agreement. And the backstop isn\u2019t impossible to get out of; that is simply misleading. However, it cannot be unilaterally exited by one state. What\u2019s the point of the backstop if one side can simply just rip it up?\u201d</p> \n<p>He ruled out a time limit on the backstop. \u201cIt is an insurance policy to protect a very fragile peace deal, therefore it needs the buy-in of both sides, because both the British and Irish government are co-guarantors of that Good Friday agreement.\u201d</p> \n<p>An Irish government source played down the significance of Johnson\u2019s letter, saying: \u201cThe letter just reiterates the British government\u2019s position. The EU position remains clear. The withdrawal agreement cannot be renegotiated and the backstop is part of the withdrawal agreement.\u201d</p> \n<p>The backstop was consistent with the Good Friday agreement and did not undermine the constitutional status of Northern Ireland, an analysis that London shared during and after negotiations, the source said. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that the British government cannot stand over the commitment it gave in 2017 and 2018.\u201d</p> \n<p>Guy Verhofstadt, who chairs the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group, tweeted he did not see any majority in the UK parliament to remove the backstop. \u201cIt is a vital insurance policy, negotiated in good faith and supported by the people of the island of Ireland. The time for bluster and political blame games is fast running out.\u201d</p> \n<p>Last week a leaked German government paper revealed that Berlin saw a \u201chigh probability\u201d of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October as it was currently unforeseeable that Johnson would change his \u201ctough negotiating position\u201d.</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by Rory Carroll in Dublin and Philip Oltermann in Berlin.</em></p>",

Johnson suggested the EU\u2019s position was influenced by the manoeuvres of Conservative MPs who have been examining legislative methods to stop no deal in the House of Commons, including former cabinet ministers like Philip Hammond.

Even if they do not admit it.\u201d In a sign of the EU\u2019s carefully coordinated response, the European commission issued its own statement minutes later saying it shared Tusk\u2019s view. A commission spokeswoman welcomed the UK government\u2019s \u201cengagement and commitment to an orderly withdrawal\u201d while making clear its objections. \u201cWe also note that the letter does not provide a legal operational solution to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland,\u201d she said. \u201cIt does not set out what any alternative arrangements could be and in fact it recognises that there is no guarantee that such arrangements will be in place by the end of the transitional period.\u201d Johnson admitted that the EU\u2019s position was \u201ca bit negative\u201d but suggested Brussels must acknowledge the deal had been summarily rejected by the UK parliament. \u201cI saw what Donald Tusk had to say, and it wasn\u2019t redolent of a sense of optimism,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think, actually, we will get there. I think there\u2019s a real sense now that something needs to be done with this backstop.\u201d The prime minister said the UK had no intention of introducing any sort of new border checks or infrastructure at the Irish border. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a paradox because it is the other side, a bit odd, the other side of the argument, the EU, who seem to think it might be necessary to have checks for them to preserve the integrity of the single market,\u201d he said. Johnson had dashed any prospect of an early compromise in a letter on Monday night when he called on the EU to scrap the backstop, which he said was anti-democratic and \u201cinconsistent with the sovereignty of the UK as a state\u201d. The letter was addressed to Tusk, who chairs EU summits. Copies were also sent to EU27 leaders and the head of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker. As the EU made its first public statements, diplomats from the 27 countries were sent an analysis that described key arguments in Johnson\u2019s letter as incorrect and misleading. The internal document seen by the Guardian states it was \u201cincorrect\u201d to suggest the people of Northern Ireland would have no influence over EU laws that applied to them, pointing to provisions in the Brexit agreement. Officials had already strongly rejected Johnson\u2019s claim that the backstop was anti-democratic, pointing to the fact Northern Ireland had voted to remain in the EU and non-unionist parties were in favour of the backstop. Johnson\u2019s claim that it would be possible for two separate legal and economic jurisdictions to exist on the island of Ireland with an open border was judged \u201cmisleading\u201d as EU law provided \u201cthe common framework needed to enable frictionless trade between member states today\u201d. While the EU has said it was ready to examine alternative arrangements to the backstop, officials have stressed that no such options exist today anywhere in the world. Neale Richmond, an Irish senator, said Johnson\u2019s claim that the backstop posed a threat to the Good Friday agreement was \u201cvery disappointing language\u201d. \u201cThe negotiations ended in November,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4. \u201cThe British government in good faith agreed the withdrawal agreement. And the backstop isn\u2019t impossible to get out of; that is simply misleading. However, it cannot be unilaterally exited by one state. What\u2019s the point of the backstop if one side can simply just rip it up?\u201d He ruled out a time limit on the backstop. \u201cIt is an insurance policy to protect a very fragile peace deal, therefore it needs the buy-in of both sides, because both the British and Irish government are co-guarantors of that Good Friday agreement.\u201d An Irish government source played down the significance of Johnson\u2019s letter, saying: \u201cThe letter just reiterates the British government\u2019s position. The EU position remains clear. The withdrawal agreement cannot be renegotiated and the backstop is part of the withdrawal agreement.\u201d The backstop was consistent with the Good Friday agreement and did not undermine the constitutional status of Northern Ireland, an analysis that London shared during and after negotiations, the source said. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that the British government cannot stand over the commitment it gave in 2017 and 2018.\u201d Guy Verhofstadt, who chairs the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group, tweeted he did not see any majority in the UK parliament to remove the backstop. \u201cIt is a vital insurance policy, negotiated in good faith and supported by the people of the island of Ireland. The time for bluster and political blame games is fast running out.\u201d Last week a leaked German government paper revealed that Berlin saw a \u201chigh probability\u201d of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October as it was currently unforeseeable that Johnson would change his \u201ctough negotiating position\u201d.

The team also hope to confirm the presence of plumes of water, previously detected by Nasa\u2019s Galileo spacecraft and the Hubble space telescope. If confirmed, it would mean scientists would not need to find a way of hacking through the moon\u2019s icy crust to explore the makeup of the ocean. The new announcement means the mission has now been given the go-ahead for the final design to be made, the spacecraft to be built and the instruments to be developed and tested. \u201cWe are all excited about the decision that moves the Europa Clipper mission one key step closer to unlocking the mysteries of this ocean world,\u201d said Thomas Zurbuchen, an associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at Nasa\u2019s headquarters in Washington. Clipper is expected to launch in 2025, although it could be ready a couple of years sooner. It is not the only mission heading for Europa: the European Space Agency\u2019s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or Juice, is expected to launch in 2022 and will undertake flybys of three of Jupiter\u2019s moons, including Europa.",

      "bodyText": "Insurgent groups have withdrawn from Khan Sheikhun in north-west Syria, clearing the way for pro-government forces to enter the town, in a milestone moment in the war for Idlib province, the country\u2019s last major rebel stronghold. The development came hours after Turkey deployed tanks and armoured cars deep into Syria, partly in response to days of advances by forces fighting on behalf of the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad. Khan Sheikhun has been a key target in a military campaign launched in late April. The campaign had stalled until recent days, despite relentless Russian-led airstrikes that had decimated communities in southern Idlib and prompted up to 500,000 people to flee their homes. Aid agencies said on Tuesday the influx of displaced people from southern and central Idlib had left them at breaking point. Camps close to Turkey were already overwhelmed before the fighting intensified and, with the Turkish border sealed, those fleeing have nowhere left to run. \u201cThe onslaught on civilians and civilian infrastructure continues to run rampant,\u201d said the International Rescue Committee\u2019s Syria director, Rehana Zawar. \u201cThe UN has said the current escalation shows \u2018a level of destruction consistent with a bombing campaign aimed at a scorched earth policy\u2019. At least 45 schools have been impacted by the violence and 42 attacks on healthcare have been reported since the upsurge began.\u201d Medical facilities across southern Idlib have been systematically destroyed by airstrikes launched by Russia and the Syrian air force, which have also taken a heavy toll on bakeries and marketplaces. Much of Khan Sheikhun, the site of a chemical weapons attack in April 2017 that killed an estimated 92 people, had been levelled before insurgents spearheaded by the al-Qaida-linked extremist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) left the town. HTS said on Tuesday it had made \u201ca redeployment\u201d and its fighters had withdrawn south of the town. It said they would continue to defend the territory from there. The Turkish military set up observation posts just north of the town, overlooking a main road between Idlib city and Hama province, the fate of which had made Khan Sheikhun a prized possession. Extremist groups have blended with other anti-Assad fighters throughout Idlib and dominate parts of the province. Their presence has been used as a pretext by Russia and Syria to recapture all of north-western Syria, where up to 3 million people have taken refuge from all corners of the country. Idlib has become the last redoubt of those who rose up against Assad during the Arab revolts of 2011.

He said that the UK was not going to have checks at the border in Northern Ireland in any circumstances, and that that it was \u201ca bit odd\u201d that it was the EU who thought that checks might be necessary. And he insisted that alternatives to the backstop could be negotiated in the future talks on a long-term trade deal.</p> <p>Then he went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You know what. At the moment it is absolutely true that our friends and partners are a bit negative. I saw what Donald Tusk had to say, and it wasn\u2019t redolent of a sense of optimism.

And Scottish independence is not just at the other end of the spectrum of that, but on another spectrum altogether.</p> </blockquote> <p>Questioned specifically about a protester who has been pictured on the Royal Mile with a \u2018England get out of Scotland\u2019 banner, Sturgeon said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The person with that banner does not speak for the SNP. That kind of sentiment has no place in Scotland. You can\u2019t get to a situation in any party where you say we\u2019ll never attract the wrong kind of person but you can be absolutely vehement and resolute about calling it out. The people who put up that banner, I don\u2019t want them in the SNP.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sturgeon also made reference to the online reaction to <a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/people/scotland-decades-behind-in-attitudes-to-race-warns-national-poet-1-4985812\">comments made by the Scottish national poet Jackie Kay over the weekend about Scotland\u2019s relationship with race.</a> She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the heart of what she was saying was that for all the progress we have made, Scotland still has a lot of work to do on tackling racism and equality.

He explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The reality is that for unionists the Good Friday agreement was an agreement between Unionists and nationalists, and there isn\u2019t unionist consent for the backstop, and therefore there is no cross-community consensus on this proposal and that breaches the principles of the GFA.</p> </blockquote> <p>In his letter to Donald Tusk, Boris Johnson also made a similar argument. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It has become increasingly clear that the backstop risks weakening the delicate balance embodied in the Belfast (Good Friday) agreement. </p> <p>The historic compromise in Northern Ireland is based upon a carefully negotiated balance between both traditions in Northern Ireland, grounded in agreement, consent, and respect for minority rights. </p> <p>While I appreciate the laudable intentions with which the backstop was designed, by removing control of such large areas of the commercial and economic life of Northern Ireland to an external body over which the people of Northern Ireland have no democratic control, this balance risks being undermined. </p> <p>The Belfast (Good Friday) agreement neither depends upon nor requires a particular customs or regulatory regime. The broader commitments in the agreement, including to parity of esteem, partnership, democracy, and to peaceful means of resolving differences, can best be met if we explore solutions other than the backstop. </p> </blockquote> <p>This is a relatively novel argument from Johnson against the backstop, although some unionists have been making it for a while. It also contradicts the more conventional view (shared by everyone from Theresa May to Sinn Fein) which is that the backstop would help to maintain the Good Friday agreement. </p> <p>The GFA sought to stop Northern Ireland being contested territory by, among other provisions, allowing anyone born there to hold British citizenship, Irish citizenship, or both, and having an open border has been seen as an important enabling factor that helps to make fluid citizenship possible. May\u2019s government and the EU agreed the backstop because they thought that, without it, border controls would reappear, and territorial disputes would follow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1255ba778da2139974a845fec866cfc024ec2959\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1255ba778da2139974a845fec866cfc024ec2959/0_247_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeffrey Donaldson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeffrey Donaldson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul MceElane/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d5bfdd98f081cf11cf19d73\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-20T14:49:35.033Z\">3.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Unionism does not support backstop, says DUP leader Arlene Foster</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Arlene Foster </strong>found herself channelling Mandy Rice-Davies (an unlikely heroine for the DUP leader) when she was interviewed on BBC Radio Ulster earlier.

He needs to wise up and stop the nonsense with October 31 and start talking seriously.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the government plan to end freedom of movement immediately after 31 October under a no-deal Brexit would lead to a scandal that would amount to \u201cWindrush on steroids\u201d.</strong> He explained:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Priti Patel has announced that freedom of movement here in every form will end on October 31. It is an utterly ludicrous position she has adopted. </p> <p>Does that mean that a European Union national living in this country, possibly as a doctor, a nurse, a trauma surgeon, all kinds of things, goes home to see their family in Germany or Czech Republic or wherever else, they are not allowed back into this country? Is this another Windrush, on steroids?

Here\u2019s an extract from the news release.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government has decided this week that from 1 September, UK officials and ministers will now only attend EU meetings where the UK has a significant national interest in the outcome of discussions, such as on security.</p> <p>This decision reflects the fact that the UK\u2019s exit from the EU on 31 October is now very close and many of the discussions in EU meetings will be about the future of the Union after the UK has left.</p> <p>As the PM has promised in the House of Commons in July, as a departing member state it makes sense to \u2018unshackle\u2019 officials from these EU meetings to enable them to better focus their talents on our immediate national priorities. This includes, as the top priority, work on preparations for Brexit on 31 October and on our future relationship with the EU, but also on pioneering new trade deals and promoting a truly global Britain.</p> <p>This decision is not intended in any way to frustrate the functioning of the EU. The UK\u2019s vote will be delegated in a way that does not obstruct the ongoing business of the remaining 27 EU members.</p> <p>Where matters of ongoing national interest are being discussed, the UK will continue to be present until 31 October.</p> </blockquote> <p>The department says decisions about which meetings ministers and officials attend will be made on a case by case basis. But Boris Johnson will definitely continue to attend European council, the meeting of EU leaders (although only one is scheduled between now and the end of October).</p> <p>In a statement <strong>Stephen Barclay</strong>, the Brexit secretary, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An incredible amount of time and effort goes into EU meetings with attendance just the tip of the iceberg. Our diligent, world-class officials also spend many hours preparing for them whether in reading the necessary papers or working on briefings.</p> <p>From now on we will only go to the meetings that really matter, reducing attendance by over half and saving hundreds of hours. This will free up time for ministers and their officials to get on with preparing for our departure on October 31 and seizing the opportunities that lie ahead.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b71f0bb8cba6832aff026356208199f0d64225a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b71f0bb8cba6832aff026356208199f0d64225a/0_3_5663_3397/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen Barclay\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen Barclay</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d5bf7c88f084061ab3895a9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/andrewsparrow\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-20T13:41:17.330Z\">2.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">No 10 tells Tusk there is 'no prospect of deal' unless withdrawal agreement reopened</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I\u2019m back, and No 10 has responded to Donald Tusk\u2019s statement rejecting Boris Johnson\u2019s proposal for the backstop.

But the history of the Brexit negotiation that mutual self-interest is not, on its own, enough to secure a deal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a5f1b7a11e15e2e35f4a1ec6f7575370d4e8190\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a5f1b7a11e15e2e35f4a1ec6f7575370d4e8190/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Cleverly.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Cleverly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-20T10:42:35.516Z\">at 11.42am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d5bb3e68f081cf11cf19a55\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-20T09:26:22.125Z\">10.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Diane Abbott suggests Corbyn could not stay neutral in any future referendum on Brexit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Diane Abbott</strong>, the shadow home secretary, had the 8.10 slot on the Today programme this morning. Here are the key points from her interview.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Abbott said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/19/reckless-plan-to-cut-off-free-movement-alarms-eu-nationals\">government plans to end freedom of movement for EU citizens immediately after a no-deal Brexit</a> would \u201ccreate chaos\u201d and \u201cmake Windrush look like a minor blip\u201d.</strong> She explained:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it\u2019s going to create chaos, it\u2019s going to be very problematic for business, but it\u2019s going to be very difficult for EU nationals. </p> <p>There are currently 3 million here altogether, a million have registered for settled status, there\u2019s no possibility of 2 million registering between now and the 31st October, and then those EU nationals that were here but haven\u2019t registered for settled status will be in the exact same position as the Windrush people. </p> <p>There will be people that came here perfectly legally, but will not have the paperwork to prove that and will have all sorts of problems with employers and the NHS and so on ...</p> <p>The way Boris [Johnson] is doing it is heading to a catastrophe [which] will make Windrush look like a minor blip.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She dismissed the government\u2019s claim that it could tighten criminal record checks on EU nationals wanting to enter the UK immediately after a no-deal Brexit</strong>. She said she did not see how criminality could be checked once access to EU databases was lost. She went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The truth is one of the problems about leaving the EU without a deal is we will lose access to all the EU databases that the police and the security services have relied on and we will lose it on the stroke of the end of the day on October 31st.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She suggested that it would not be right for Jeremy Corbyn to stay neutral in any future referendum on Brexit.</strong> Yesterday<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/aug/19/brexit-latest-news-jeremy-corbyn-speech-labour-could-be-officially-neutral-in-any-second-referendum-campaign-john-mcdonnell-suggests-live-news?page=with:block-5d5a93188f08c7e177d4d2cd#block-5d5a93188f08c7e177d4d2cd\"> Corbyn refused to commit to backing remain in any referendum held after a general election</a>, with a credible leave option also on the ballot, and he and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, both suggested that in such a referendum Labour could remain neutral, with members free to campaign for either side. Asked about this, Abbott said Corbyn was trying to keep both wings of the party together. When Today\u2019s <strong>Justin Webb</strong> asked if it would be feasible for Corbyn to remain neutral in such a contest, she replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Jeremy is the leader of the Labour party, as Jo Swinson needs to remember, and he can\u2019t stay to one side on an issue such as this, but what he can do is try and bring both wings of the Labour movement together.</p> </blockquote> <p>Listening to the exchange, it was clear that what Abbott meant by \u201ccan\u2019t stay to one side\u201d was \u201ccan\u2019t stay on the sidelines\u201d, not \u201ccan\u2019t take one side\u201d. But when Webb pressed her again on this, asking her if she was saying Corbyn would have to campaign for remain, Abbott gave a more evasive answer. She replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I believe that Jeremy will do what he\u2019s always done, which is do what he thinks is best for the country and best for the Labour movement.</p> </blockquote> <p>Then, when Webb tried again to get her to clarify what she was saying, Abbott said they should be talking about the Tories instead. She finally said that Labour would have to debate this, and that Corbyn would follow what the party decided.</p> <ul> <li><strong>She confirmed she personally would campaign for remain in any future referendum on Brexit.</strong> This is also what John McDonnell said yesterday. Abbott said that she and \u201cJohn Mac\u201d, as she called him, were \u201cspeaking as individuals\u201d.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3cfba2d6deb75f83a700931fdc9699409414652f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cfba2d6deb75f83a700931fdc9699409414652f/0_4_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diane Abbott\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diane Abbott.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-20T10:40:47.630Z\">at 11.40am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d5bb23f8f08a0805bcc114f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-20T08:46:53.812Z\">9.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Brexit party has also criticised Boris Johnson\u2019s offer to the EU.</p> <p>This is from its leader, <strong>Nigel Farage</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/mar/15/guardian-eu-referendum-debate-with-farage-clegg-alan-johnson-and-leadsom-live?page=with:block-56e88cc0e4b0d6cdda5302b2#block-56e88cc0e4b0d6cdda5302b2\">who only three years ago was saying he would welcome a Norway-style Brexit.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Nigel_Farage/status/1163528836425900032\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Even without the backstop, this is still the worst \u201cdeal\u201d in history. <a href=\"https://t.co/tzOPjYaDL9\">https://t.co/tzOPjYaDL9</a></p>&mdash; Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nigel_Farage/status/1163528836425900032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 19, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And this is from <strong>Richard Tice,</strong> chair of the Brexit party.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TiceRichard/status/1163532915550109696\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Let\u2019s be clear: the WA even without the backstop is still the worst deal in history, is not Brexit and the Brexit Party will fight it tooth and nail.

Last night, ahead of those meetings, he released his first proposal since he became prime minister for how the Brexit deal might be renegotiated.

We would be happy to accept a legally binding commitment to this effect and hope that the EU would do likewise. </p> <p>We must also respect the aim to find \u2018flexible and creative\u2019 solutions to the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland. That means that alternative ways of managing the customs and regulatory differences contingent on Brexit must be explored. </p> <p>The reality is that there are already two separate legal, political, economic, and monetary jurisdictions on the island of Ireland. This system is already administered without contention and with an open border. </p> <p>The UK and the EU have already agreed that \u2018alternative arrangements\u2019 can be part of the solution. Accordingly: </p> <p>- I propose that the backstop should be replaced with a commitment to put in place such arrangements as far as possible before the end of the transition period, as part of the future relationship. </p> <p>- I also recognise that there will need to be a degree of confidence about what would happen if these arrangements were not all fully in place at the end of that period. We are ready to look constructively and flexibly at what commitments might help, consistent of course with the principles set out in this letter. </p> </blockquote> <p>This morning opinion is divided as to whether this is a genuine offer, that could open the door to a very unlikely but not 100% impossible compromise solution, or just an elaborate exercise in attempted blame deflection. As is often the case when trying to explain motive in politics, it is probably best to assume that both factors are in play.</p> <p>But the opposition parties have been damning.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has blamed those MPs trying to stop a no-deal Brexit for the EU\u2019s refusal to compromise on the backstop. But he has also claimed that, despite the EU\u2019s response to his proposal for an alternative to the backstop being \u201ca bit negative\u201d, he thinks a deal will be achieved in the end. (See 5.45pm and 6.02pm.) British officials will stop attending most EU meetings from September, the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, has said, suggesting his department would slash attendance by more than half to \u201cunshackle\u201d officials and ministers. Stopping freedom of movement immediately on 31 October could lead to a situation like \u201cWindrush on steroids\u201d and the idea is \u201cutterly ludicrous\u201d, Jeremy Corbyn has said. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. Here is another extract from Boris Johnson\u2019s clip for Sky News. Johnson said that in his meetings with Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron later this week, and at the G7, he would be saying that the backstop would have to go. He said that the UK was not going to have checks at the border in Northern Ireland in any circumstances, and that that it was \u201ca bit odd\u201d that it was the EU who thought that checks might be necessary. And he insisted that alternatives to the backstop could be negotiated in the future talks on a long-term trade deal. Then he went on: You know what. At the moment it is absolutely true that our friends and partners are a bit negative. I saw what Donald Tusk had to say, and it wasn\u2019t redolent of a sense of optimism. But I think, actually, we will get there. I think there\u2019s a real sense now that something needs to be done with this backstop. We can\u2019t get it through parliament as it is. So I\u2019m going to go at it with a lot of oomph, as you would expect, and I hope we will be making some progress in the course of the next few weeks. Boris Johnson has recorded a clip for broadcasters, and in it he has effectively blamed those MPs trying to stop a no-deal Brexit for the fact that the EU is refusing to compromise on the backstop. Here is an extract from the clip broadcast by Sky News. Johnson said: One thing that slightly, I think, complicates the picture is that our EU friends still clearly think that there is a possibility that parliament will block Brexit. And as long as they think there\u2019s a possibility that parliament will block Brexit they are unlikely to be minded to make the concessions that we need. So it is going to take a bit of patience. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has told an audience at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe that there is \u201cno place in Scotland\u201d for anti-English sentiment, insisting that the \u201ccivic nationalism\u201d of the SNP was \u201con another spectrum altogether\u201d from \u201cfar right, racist, insular movements\u201d seen in other parts of the world. Asked by comedian Matt Forde about Scottish nationalism, Sturgeon said: A lot of the regimes called nationalist today are not countries striving to be independent, because often they already are, but are based on some kind of racial exceptionalism or superiority - often very illiberal and oppressive of minorities. And Scottish independence is not just at the other end of the spectrum of that, but on another spectrum altogether. Questioned specifically about a protester who has been pictured on the Royal Mile with a \u2018England get out of Scotland\u2019 banner, Sturgeon said: The person with that banner does not speak for the SNP. That kind of sentiment has no place in Scotland. You can\u2019t get to a situation in any party where you say we\u2019ll never attract the wrong kind of person but you can be absolutely vehement and resolute about calling it out. The people who put up that banner, I don\u2019t want them in the SNP. Sturgeon also made reference to the online reaction to comments made by the Scottish national poet Jackie Kay over the weekend about Scotland\u2019s relationship with race. She said: At the heart of what she was saying was that for all the progress we have made, Scotland still has a lot of work to do on tackling racism and equality. She got a lot of criticism online from people who would not accept that there\u2019s anything wrong with Scotland and frankly we should never be complacent about racism or bigotry. Sturgeon was also challenged about the behaviour of independence supporters online, but said that there was \u201can unrealistic expectation given social media and the way people operate online that any leader of any party can police that completely\u201d. To laughter from the audience, she added: I\u2019m not responsible for everything people say on Twitter, thank God! It cuts both ways. Some, which I try not to look at, of the abuse I get would literally make your hair curl, it\u2019s horrible, misogynist, filthy, disgusting and women across all parties get that. There\u2019s a much bigger debate, not confined to Scotland, about how social media is distorting our political debate. Here is the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, on Boris Johnson\u2019s letter to Donald Tusk. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said the EU was ready to find a solution to the backstop issue during a visit to Iceland today. According to Reuters, she said: The moment we have a practical arrangement on how to preserve the Good Friday agreement and at the same time define the borders of the [European Union\u2019s] internal market, we would not need the backstop anymore. This means we would naturally think about practical solutions. And I\u2019ve always said that when one has the will to find these solutions, one can do so in a short period of time. The EU is ready to find a solution. According to Reuters, Merkel said this would not require the withdrawal agreement to be re-opened and was instead a question for the so-called political declaration on future relations. On the World at One Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP chief whip, claimed that the backstop would be contrary to the Good Friday agreement. He explained: The reality is that for unionists the Good Friday agreement was an agreement between Unionists and nationalists, and there isn\u2019t unionist consent for the backstop, and therefore there is no cross-community consensus on this proposal and that breaches the principles of the GFA. In his letter to Donald Tusk, Boris Johnson also made a similar argument. He said: It has become increasingly clear that the backstop risks weakening the delicate balance embodied in the Belfast (Good Friday) agreement. The historic compromise in Northern Ireland is based upon a carefully negotiated balance between both traditions in Northern Ireland, grounded in agreement, consent, and respect for minority rights. While I appreciate the laudable intentions with which the backstop was designed, by removing control of such large areas of the commercial and economic life of Northern Ireland to an external body over which the people of Northern Ireland have no democratic control, this balance risks being undermined. The Belfast (Good Friday) agreement neither depends upon nor requires a particular customs or regulatory regime. The broader commitments in the agreement, including to parity of esteem, partnership, democracy, and to peaceful means of resolving differences, can best be met if we explore solutions other than the backstop. This is a relatively novel argument from Johnson against the backstop, although some unionists have been making it for a while. It also contradicts the more conventional view (shared by everyone from Theresa May to Sinn Fein) which is that the backstop would help to maintain the Good Friday agreement. The GFA sought to stop Northern Ireland being contested territory by, among other provisions, allowing anyone born there to hold British citizenship, Irish citizenship, or both, and having an open border has been seen as an important enabling factor that helps to make fluid citizenship possible. May\u2019s government and the EU agreed the backstop because they thought that, without it, border controls would reappear, and territorial disputes would follow. Arlene Foster found herself channelling Mandy Rice-Davies (an unlikely heroine for the DUP leader) when she was interviewed on BBC Radio Ulster earlier. Asked about Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach, saying the backstop would have to be maintained, she said: I am not surprised by the taoiseach\u2019s reaction. I am almost tempted to say \u2018He would say that, wouldn\u2019t he?\u2019 But I think the letter that the prime minister has sent to President Tusk explains very clearly why the backstop cannot be entered into. Apart from, of course, the simple political reality that it has been rejected three times by the House of Commons, it is anti-democratic, it is inconsistent with the sovereignty of the United Kingdom, and, of course, it risks weakening the delicate balance, as is pointed out in the letter, between the parties to the Belfast [Good Friday] agreement. I think that\u2019s very important because, of course, the Belfast agreement has been used to justify the backstop but, as the prime minister points out, it doesn\u2019t have the support of ourselves - political unionism as we are so-called. I mean, when you look across unionism, we are all against the backstop so that should concern the Dublin government, because if the Dublin government is genuine and values the Belfast agreement they should be very concerned that unionism does not support the backstop. More on the decision by the UK to stop sending ministers and officials to some EU meetings from September. (See 3pm.) From my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels From Nicolai von Ondarza, from the German thinktank SWP From the Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge Jeremy Corbyn has been discussing Brexit today with people running small businesses in Stevenage. Here are the key points he made when he spoke to the media. Corbyn criticised Boris Johnson for threatening a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. He said: I have just spent the morning with a group of innovative small businesses here in Stevenage, all of whom do significant amounts of trade with the European Union. Some, themselves, are European Union nationals. They want us to continue to trade with Europe, and they are appalled at the idea of a no-deal Brexit, and I think the Prime Minister should go and talk to them. He needs to recognise that just holding the threat of a no-deal Brexit on October 31 towards the European Union isn\u2019t going to bring about a change, it\u2019s going to make things much worse. He created this arbitrary date by his behaviour during the Tory leadership campaign. He needs to wise up and stop the nonsense with October 31 and start talking seriously. He said the government plan to end freedom of movement immediately after 31 October under a no-deal Brexit would lead to a scandal that would amount to \u201cWindrush on steroids\u201d. He explained: Priti Patel has announced that freedom of movement here in every form will end on October 31. It is an utterly ludicrous position she has adopted. Does that mean that a European Union national living in this country, possibly as a doctor, a nurse, a trauma surgeon, all kinds of things, goes home to see their family in Germany or Czech Republic or wherever else, they are not allowed back into this country? Is this another Windrush, on steroids? It is a ludicrous proposal. We rely on a lot of European nationals to maintain our industries, maintain our education services. I\u2019d just say to Priti Patel, cut the nonsense, and don\u2019t impose this again. The Brexit department has just announced that British ministers and officials will stop attending some EU meetings from Sunday 1 September (or in practice Monday 2 September - the EU does not schedule a lot of meetings on Sundays). Here\u2019s an extract from the news release. The government has decided this week that from 1 September, UK officials and ministers will now only attend EU meetings where the UK has a significant national interest in the outcome of discussions, such as on security. This decision reflects the fact that the UK\u2019s exit from the EU on 31 October is now very close and many of the discussions in EU meetings will be about the future of the Union after the UK has left. As the PM has promised in the House of Commons in July, as a departing member state it makes sense to \u2018unshackle\u2019 officials from these EU meetings to enable them to better focus their talents on our immediate national priorities. This includes, as the top priority, work on preparations for Brexit on 31 October and on our future relationship with the EU, but also on pioneering new trade deals and promoting a truly global Britain. This decision is not intended in any way to frustrate the functioning of the EU. The UK\u2019s vote will be delegated in a way that does not obstruct the ongoing business of the remaining 27 EU members. Where matters of ongoing national interest are being discussed, the UK will continue to be present until 31 October. The department says decisions about which meetings ministers and officials attend will be made on a case by case basis. But Boris Johnson will definitely continue to attend European council, the meeting of EU leaders (although only one is scheduled between now and the end of October). In a statement Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, said: An incredible amount of time and effort goes into EU meetings with attendance just the tip of the iceberg. Our diligent, world-class officials also spend many hours preparing for them whether in reading the necessary papers or working on briefings. From now on we will only go to the meetings that really matter, reducing attendance by over half and saving hundreds of hours. This will free up time for ministers and their officials to get on with preparing for our departure on October 31 and seizing the opportunities that lie ahead. I\u2019m back, and No 10 has responded to Donald Tusk\u2019s statement rejecting Boris Johnson\u2019s proposal for the backstop. A Downing Street spokesman said: We are deeply invested in the peace, prosperity and security of Northern Ireland and always will be and we have been clear that we will never place infrastructure, checks, or controls at the border. But it is clear that unless the withdrawal agreement is reopened and the backstop abolished there is no prospect of a deal. It has already been rejected three times by MPs and is simply unviable as a solution, as the PM\u2019s letter makes clear. We are ready to negotiate, in good faith, an alternative to the backstop, with provisions to ensure that the Irish border issues are dealt with where they should always have been: in the negotiations on the future agreement between the UK and the EU. The latest from Boris Johnson, which does not exactly move things on: Donald Tusk has rejected Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to strip the backstop out of the Brexit deal, with a thinly veiled message that the British government was refusing to admit the lack of realistic alternatives. Ending the free movement of people with a no-deal Brexit on 31 October would cause chaos and confusion for EU citizens on a scale that would make the Windrush scandal look like a minor blip, Diane Abbott has said. Abbott has suggested that Jeremy Corbyn could not stay neutral in any future referendum on Brexit. (See 10.26am.) The government is holding on to more than \u00a328m in student loan overpayments by graduates that have been identified but not yet refunded. I\u2019m off for a bit to an important executive meeting (aka, a lunch). I\u2019ll be back after 2pm. In the meantime, a colleague will pick up the blog if there is any breaking news. Echoing the comment made by the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford (see 11.54am), the Sinn Fein leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle O\u2019Neill, has accused Boris Johnson of \u201crank hypocrisy\u201d over the peace process. In a statement she said: It is rank hypocrisy for Boris Johnson to claim to be acting in the interests of the peace process claiming it will be damaged by the backstop. In reality it is Boris Johnson\u2019s reckless pursuit of a no-deal Brexit that is threatening to undermine the peace process. Brexit is incompatible with the Good Friday agreement and the Tories have shown a total and callous disregard to that agreement and to the democratically expressed wishes of the people of the north. The fact is that the British government has agreed to the backstop and Boris Johnson has voted for it himself. The EU have made it clear that the backstop is integral to the withdrawal agreement and it is necessary to avoid any hardening of the border. It is high time the Tories realised that too. The DUP has issued a statement backing the stance on the backstop taken by Boris Johnson in his letter to Donald Tusk. Here\u2019s an extract. We have been strongly highlighting the fact that unionism in Northern Ireland does not support the backstop. None of the main unionist parties and groupings support the backstop. If Europe and the Republic of Ireland are serious about ensuring and recognising that progress in Northern Ireland is founded on support from both major traditions then it will have to face the reality that the backstop is not the way forward. The DUP wants to see a negotiated and orderly exit from the European Union based on no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic and no internal barriers to trade within the United Kingdom. The backstop has at its very heart an anti-democratic foundation where neither political representatives in London nor Belfast could change, or influence, rules made in Brussels to which Northern Ireland would be subjected. Those on all sides who genuinely want to see a deal will recognise that the backstop previously devised does not provide the basis for agreement. It may be the case that unionists in Northern Ireland reject the backstop, but a recent poll found that 58% of people in the region say they would prefer Northern Ireland, but not Great Britain, to remain aligned to the EU. This was the original backstop proposal made by the EU that was rejected by the DUP and the Conservative party because it would effectively put a regulatory border down the Irish Sea. Here is a round-up of assorted comment from journalists and specialists on the Boris Johnson letter to Donald Tusk. From Philip Oltermann, the Guardian\u2019s Berlin correspondent. From Simon Fraser, a former head of the Foreign Office. A Twitter thread, starting here, from Kevin O\u2019Rourke, a professor of economic history and author of a good book on Brexit. A Twitter thread, starting here, from Peter Foster, the Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor. From Mujtaba Rahman, the Brexit expert at the Eurasia consultancy. From the Financial Times editor Lionel Barber. Earlier I suggested that Boris Johnson\u2019s letter to Donald Tusk could be seen as just an elaborate exercise in attempted blame deflection. (See 9.25am.) This quote makes that interpretation look increasingly plausible. Judging by the use of the word \u201csad\u201d, government sources are starting to take their inspiration from Donald Trump. These are from the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming in Brussels. These are from Mark Drakeford, the Labour first minister of Wales, on Boris Johnson\u2019s offer to the EU on the backstop. Here is the full quote from the European commission\u2019s spokeswoman, Natasha Bertaud, on Boris Johnson\u2019s backstop proposal. She said: We welcome the UK government\u2019s engagement and continued commitment to an orderly withdrawal. We firmly believe this is in the best interests of both the EU and the UK. However, we also note that the letter does not provide a legal operational solution to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland. It does not set out what any alternative arrangements could be and in fact it recognises that there is no guarantee that such arrangements will be in place by the end of the transitional period. Otherwise, as we have said on many occasions, we do stand ready to work constructively with the UK and within our mandate. These are from my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, has given his first response to the letter he received from Boris Johnson yesterday. He seems to be rejecting Johnson\u2019s proposal for an alternative to the backstop. In an interview on the Today programme James Cleverly, the Conservative party chairman, was asked about the point raised by Diane Abbott (see 10.26am) - the impact of a no-deal Brexit on criminal justice cooperation with the EU. Asked if Britain had had assurances from the EU that policing, intelligence and counter-terrorism sharing would continue in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Cleverly was unable to give a firm yes. Instead he replied: The EU are sensible pragmatic people and it would be in no-one\u2019s interest to reduce the amount of intelligence sharing and co-operation that we do. It\u2019s not in their interest, it\u2019s not in our interest, these are smart, sensible and pragmatic people and it is unrealistic to think that they would hamper their own safety or attempt to hamper ours, it\u2019s ridiculous. To those of you have have followed the Brexit debate closely after the last three years, this is a surprise return of the argument that used to be associated with BMW manufacturers and prosecco producers \u2013 that the UK and the EU were bound to agree a free trade deal because that would be in both sides\u2019 interests. And it would be. But the history of the Brexit negotiation that mutual self-interest is not, on its own, enough to secure a deal. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, had the 8.10 slot on the Today programme this morning. Here are the key points from her interview. Abbott said government plans to end freedom of movement for EU citizens immediately after a no-deal Brexit would \u201ccreate chaos\u201d and \u201cmake Windrush look like a minor blip\u201d. She explained: I think it\u2019s going to create chaos, it\u2019s going to be very problematic for business, but it\u2019s going to be very difficult for EU nationals. There are currently 3 million here altogether, a million have registered for settled status, there\u2019s no possibility of 2 million registering between now and the 31st October, and then those EU nationals that were here but haven\u2019t registered for settled status will be in the exact same position as the Windrush people. There will be people that came here perfectly legally, but will not have the paperwork to prove that and will have all sorts of problems with employers and the NHS and so on ... The way Boris [Johnson] is doing it is heading to a catastrophe [which] will make Windrush look like a minor blip. She dismissed the government\u2019s claim that it could tighten criminal record checks on EU nationals wanting to enter the UK immediately after a no-deal Brexit. She said she did not see how criminality could be checked once access to EU databases was lost. She went on: The truth is one of the problems about leaving the EU without a deal is we will lose access to all the EU databases that the police and the security services have relied on and we will lose it on the stroke of the end of the day on October 31st. She suggested that it would not be right for Jeremy Corbyn to stay neutral in any future referendum on Brexit. Yesterday Corbyn refused to commit to backing remain in any referendum held after a general election, with a credible leave option also on the ballot, and he and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, both suggested that in such a referendum Labour could remain neutral, with members free to campaign for either side. Asked about this, Abbott said Corbyn was trying to keep both wings of the party together. When Today\u2019s Justin Webb asked if it would be feasible for Corbyn to remain neutral in such a contest, she replied: Jeremy is the leader of the Labour party, as Jo Swinson needs to remember, and he can\u2019t stay to one side on an issue such as this, but what he can do is try and bring both wings of the Labour movement together. Listening to the exchange, it was clear that what Abbott meant by \u201ccan\u2019t stay to one side\u201d was \u201ccan\u2019t stay on the sidelines\u201d, not \u201ccan\u2019t take one side\u201d. But when Webb pressed her again on this, asking her if she was saying Corbyn would have to campaign for remain, Abbott gave a more evasive answer. She replied: I believe that Jeremy will do what he\u2019s always done, which is do what he thinks is best for the country and best for the Labour movement. Then, when Webb tried again to get her to clarify what she was saying, Abbott said they should be talking about the Tories instead. She finally said that Labour would have to debate this, and that Corbyn would follow what the party decided. She confirmed she personally would campaign for remain in any future referendum on Brexit. This is also what John McDonnell said yesterday. Abbott said that she and \u201cJohn Mac\u201d, as she called him, were \u201cspeaking as individuals\u201d. The Brexit party has also criticised Boris Johnson\u2019s offer to the EU. This is from its leader, Nigel Farage, who only three years ago was saying he would welcome a Norway-style Brexit. And this is from Richard Tice, chair of the Brexit party. As we report in our overnight story, EU sources were last night ruling out any renegotiation of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, including the backstop. One well-informed source told the Guardian: There was a two and a half year negotiating process in which the EU compromised, including on the question of the backstop. The withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation and the backstop is not open for change. A legally operable backstop to avoid a hard border remains central to the withdrawal agreement for the EU27. Other reporters have been getting a similar message from their EU sources. These are from James Crisp, the Telegraph\u2019s Brussels correspondent. This is from the Financial Times\u2019 Sebastian Payne. And these are from Charlie Cooper\u2019s London Playblook briefing for Politico Europe. Reaction 1: One EU diplomat told POLITICO\u2019s Lili Bayer: \u201cIt\u2019s clear from the letter that renegotiation is the last thing the British government wants. Brexit started and ends with preservation of the Tory party.\u201d Reaction 2: A French diplomatic official tells POLITICO\u2019s Rym Momtaz: \u201cReplacing the backstop with something that isn\u2019t defined gets rid of the guarantee the backstop was meant to provide. No checks, it\u2019s a joke, it means that the U.K. would accept that products that don\u2019t respect its rules enter its market without control? How long will that hold?\u201d Reminder: Johnson meets Emmanuel Macron on Thursday. Boris Johnson is meeting the EU\u2019s two most powerful national leaders, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, later this week. Last night, ahead of those meetings, he released his first proposal since he became prime minister for how the Brexit deal might be renegotiated. It came in the form of an open letter to Donald Tusk, the outgoing European council president. You can read the four-page letter in full here (pdf). And here is our overnight story. Here is the key extract, where Johnson proposes how the backstop might be replaced. This government will not put in place infrastructure, checks, or controls at the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. We would be happy to accept a legally binding commitment to this effect and hope that the EU would do likewise. We must also respect the aim to find \u2018flexible and creative\u2019 solutions to the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland. That means that alternative ways of managing the customs and regulatory differences contingent on Brexit must be explored. The reality is that there are already two separate legal, political, economic, and monetary jurisdictions on the island of Ireland. This system is already administered without contention and with an open border. The UK and the EU have already agreed that \u2018alternative arrangements\u2019 can be part of the solution. Accordingly: - I propose that the backstop should be replaced with a commitment to put in place such arrangements as far as possible before the end of the transition period, as part of the future relationship. - I also recognise that there will need to be a degree of confidence about what would happen if these arrangements were not all fully in place at the end of that period. We are ready to look constructively and flexibly at what commitments might help, consistent of course with the principles set out in this letter. This morning opinion is divided as to whether this is a genuine offer, that could open the door to a very unlikely but not 100% impossible compromise solution, or just an elaborate exercise in attempted blame deflection. As is often the case when trying to explain motive in politics, it is probably best to assume that both factors are in play. But the opposition parties have been damning. Last night Labour issued this response, from the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Tony Lloyd. Boris Johnson seems to have forgotten that he voted for Theresa May\u2019s deal including the backstop. Whichever Brexit outcome he pursues, whether it\u2019s a disastrous no deal or this fantasyland wish list, Boris Johnson clearly has no qualms about putting jobs, rights, prosperity or peace in Northern Ireland at risk. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, posted this on Twitter. And the Liberal Democrats\u2019 Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake, put out a statement saying: The backstop, agreed between the UK government and the EU, is there to guarantee no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Boris Johnson\u2019s proposal to replace it with \u2018a commitment to put in place arrangements as far as possible before the end of the transition period\u2019 is so vague as to be deeply embarrassing. The border issue remains intractable and Johnson\u2019s intervention simply highlights after three years the Conservative government are no closer to identifying a credible solution. I will be posting more reaction as the day goes on. With parliament in recess, and much of the political class on holiday, there are only two diary items on the agenda for today. 11am: Jeremy Corbyn holds a meeting with business leaders in Hertfordshire. He is urging the government to publish the Operation Yellowhammer assessments of how disruptive a no-deal Brexit would be. 1.30pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, is interviewed by Matt Forde at an Edinburgh fringe event. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary at about 12.30pm and another when I wrap up. Unusually, I will be taking a break over lunch, so the blog will go quiet then for a bit. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone.

      "bodyText": "The Aston Villa youth coach Kevin MacDonald has left the club \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d following an investigation into allegations of bullying made by a number of former young players. Villa apologised to the former players affected by the behaviour of MacDonald, who was a youth and reserve team coach in two spells over a 25-year period from the mid-1990s, and Villa said his conduct \u201cwould not be tolerated by the club today\u201d. The investigation, conducted by an independent barrister, Jack Mitchell, was initiated by the club\u2019s chief executive, Christian Purslow, after the Guardian published an interview with the former Villa midfielder Gareth Farrelly in December. Farrelly, who was at Villa from 1992 to 1997 then played in the Premier League for Everton and Bolton and made six international appearances for the Republic of Ireland, called MacDonald\u2019s coaching regime \u201ca culture of verbal and physical bullying\u201d. Farrelly, now a solicitor and recently appointed to the panel of the court of arbitration for sport, said he sank to \u201cextremely dark places,\u201d including thoughts of suicide, as a young player struggling with MacDonald\u2019s \u201crelentlessly negative\u201d approach. In 2017 the Premier League upheld a bullying complaint against MacDonald made by a Villa player and his father but Farrelly was prompted to speak out because, he said, he was \u201cincredulous\u201d that MacDonald had remained in a coaching position at the club. Following publication of the interview with Farrelly several other former Villa youth players spoke to the Guardian describing similar treatment by MacDonald and another coach, Tony McAndrew, including negativity and constant verbal abuse. MacDonald remained as head of football development at Villa until this week, though he was removed from contact with players after Mitchell\u2019s investigation was launched in December. McAndrew left the club in 2017 after more than 20 years coaching young players and was not subject to the investigation. In December he declined to comment on the allegations. MacDonald was instructed by the club not to comment. Villa said: \u201cAston Villa can confirm Kevin MacDonald has left his position as head of football development with immediate effect. Mr MacDonald had been reallocated to non-player facing duties pending completion of an independent investigation into allegations published in The Guardian in December 2018 about his past conduct. \u201cThat investigation carried out by barrister Jack Mitchell has now concluded and the results delivered to the board. As the report forms part of an employee disciplinary process, the club is unable to provide details in public, although copies of Mr Mitchell\u2019s investigation have been provided to the FA, Premier League and statutory authorities. \u201cMr Mitchell appealed for individuals to come forward to give evidence and we are especially grateful to those former players who assisted him in his investigation. Aston Villa wishes to apologise to all former players who were affected by behaviour which would not be tolerated by the club today. Our approach to safeguarding is now unrecognisable from the past and has been described as excellent in recent EFL and Ofsted audits. The club will now begin a search for his successor.\u201d Farrelly welcomed the outcome of the investigation and paid tribute to the players who had given evidence. \u201cI hope people will see this news and feel vindicated after having had remarkable courage to come forward and relate their experiences or assist others to do so; it will no doubt have been incredibly difficult for them,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people still struggle and are affected now by the experiences they suffered at Villa, as young footballers hoping for a career in the game. This particular investigation and MacDonald\u2019s departure demonstrate that people in authority can be held to account for their actions, even if it takes many years.

In 2016, documents obtained by the Bristol Cable, a citizens\u2019 media cooperative, indicated that a number of UK police forces had also bought CCDC hardware.

He needs to be true to this character.\u201d During production, Craig injured his ankle and had to undergo minor surgery while soon after a controlled explosion led to a crew member suffering injuries. In June, a man was then charged with hiding a camera in the women\u2019s toilets. The cast also includes returning actors Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Rory Kinnear, Ben Whishaw, L\u00e9a Seydoux and Christoph Waltz as Blofeld. New cast members include Oscar winner Rami Malek as the lead villain and Captain Marvel star Lashana Lynch as a character who is rumoured to be taking over from 007 at the end of the film, set to be Craig\u2019s last. Grace Jones was set to make a cameo but reportedly quit after discovering how few lines she had. In the film, Bond has left active service and is enjoying a tranquil life in Jamaica. His peace is short-lived when an old friend from the CIA turns up asking for help. The mission to rescue a kidnapped scientist turns out to be far more treacherous than expected, leading Bond onto the trail of a mysterious villain armed with dangerous new technology. No Time to Die will be released in April 2020.",

The new lawsuits, filed in Manhattan federal court, bring the number of civil cases against Epstein\u2019s estate since his death in jail on 10 August to at least five. Epstein was arrested on 6 July and pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking involving dozens of girls as young as 14.

Two days before that, in a development first reported by the New York Post on Monday, Epstein signed a will placing his property, worth more than $577m, in a trust. Prosecutors have moved to dismiss the criminal indictment against Epstein but they have also said they are considering charging others with facilitating his alleged abuse of dozens of girls.

On Monday the Daily Mail reported that a picture of Maxwell in Los Angeles published last week may have been staged. Maxwell, who denies wrongdoing, is believed to be in Massachusetts.

      "bodyText": "You report how a pregnant rape survivor experiencing a miscarriage and barely able to stand was unlawfully held in immigration detention which amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment (Home Office pays \u00a350,000 to trafficked woman detained during miscarriage, 20 August). This case show precisely why the Home Office must heed our advice and that of the medical profession, and actually ban the detention of pregnant women. Medical Justice sent volunteer midwives to visit pregnant women in immigration detention for a decade. We warned the Home Office that women and their unborn children were suffering inadequate healthcare. The Home Office paid little attention. In 2013 we published Expecting Change, a dossier calling for a ban on the detention of pregnant women, backed by the Royal College of Midwives and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, as well as 337 other organisations. One of our clients complained for three weeks about abdominal pains and was sent to A&amp;E, where she miscarried with two guards in attendance. She subsequently attempted suicide and was admitted into a psychiatric ward. In 2016 the Home Office commissioned Stephen Shaw, a former prison and probation ombudsman, to review the use of immigration detention \u2013 he too called for a ban on the detention of pregnant women. In his 2018 follow-up, he called again for a ban \u2013 an option the Home Office again chose not to implement. Immigration detention is optional, so the Home Office is responsible for any woman miscarrying in detention. The Home Office must do the right thing, urgently, and ban the detention of pregnant women.

      "bodyText": "Finally, Italy\u2019s stock market has closed 1% lower, as political turmoil swirls again. The FTSE MIB shed 230 points to finish at 20.485. Other European markets also weakened, with the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 60 points, or 0.9%, at 7,125 -- continuing August\u2019s choppy trading. Edward Park, Deputy CIO at investment firm Brooks Macdonald, says the looming collapse of Italy\u2019s government was a risk: Ultimately, the decision for new elections rests with the Italian President Sergio Mattarella, but these latest developments add to uncertainty for markets. Why it is important: If we do see an election it is likely to be neatly parked within the end of October corridor of uncertainty for the Eurozone. On 20th October we have the deadline for the Italian budget, 31st the Brexit deadline and on 1st November a change of leadership at the major EU institutions. Giuseppe Conte ended his time as Italy\u2019s prime minister by blasting Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League, as an \u201copportunist\u201d for triggering the government crisis. Conte warned that Salvini\u2019s decision to quit the coalition could have \u201cserious consequences\u201d for Italy. My colleague Angela Giuffrida reports from Rome: Conte said he would formally resign his mandate to the president, Sergio Mattarella, after the close of the debate in the Senate on Tuesday. The outgoing prime minister said that Salvini, deputy prime minister and interior minister, had betrayed Italian citizens after pulling the plug on the party\u2019s tempestuous alliance with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) earlier this month. Salvini is eager to exploit the League\u2019s growing popularity by bringing about snap elections. \u201cHe is only looking after his own interests and those of his party,\u201d said Conte. \u201cCalling on voters every year is irresponsible,\u201d Conte said, adding that the prospect of Salvini as Italy\u2019s next prime minister was \u201cworrying\u201d. By resigning, Conte has avoided a no-confidence vote sought by the League. There\u2019s drama in the eurozone, as Italy\u2019s prime minister resigns (as flagged up earlier). Guiseppe Conte\u2019s move makes an autumn election likely, following the collapse of the coalition government. The early rally across Europe\u2019s stock markets is fading. You can sense the summer lull, with the FTSE 100 now up just 2 points (0.04%), and Germany\u2019s DAX down eine kleine 5 points (-0.05%). Wall Street is also expected to be subdued today, with the futures market predicting very little action. So here\u2019s a quick recap: UK factories have been hit by weak demand and orders this month, as trade war tussles and Brexit uncertainty weigh down. The CBI, which conducted the report, says it underlines the importance of avoiding a no-deal Brexit. The pound has weakened after PM Johnson called on Europe to help find an alternative to the Irish backstop - but was rebuffed by Brussels. Global investors are hoping that central banks will ease monetary policy to support growth, especially after president Trump urged the Federal Reserve to slash borrowing costs aggressively. The CEO of BHP Billiton has added to concerns over global growth, by warning that demand for commodities will be hit by the ongoing US-China trade war. And in other news... This chart will not please Donald Trump -- it shows the dollar has reached its highest level in around 17 years. Today\u2019s CBI survey shows that British manufacturing is finding life tough, warns economist Howard Archer of EY Item Club: David Madden of City spreadbetters CMC Markets says the report isn\u2019t as bad as feared: Reuters\u2019 Andy Bruce points out that factory bosses aren\u2019t expecting to hike prices in the next few months. Just in: British factories continue to suffer from Brexit uncertainty, trade conflicts, and the global slowdown. The CBI\u2019s monthly survey of UK manufacturing, just released, shows that total order books and export order books are both below normal this month, compared to a typical August. However, things appear to be improving compared to July, which was particularly disappointing. The CBI says: 15% of manufacturers reported total order books to be above normal, and 28% said they were below normal, giving a balance of -13% (from -34% in July). 11% of firms said their export order books were above normal, and 26% said they were below normal, giving a balance of -15% (from -32% in July) \u2013 broadly in line with the long-run average of -17% Chemicals, mechanical engineering and plastic producers all grew, but paper, printing and media were the main drag on growth. Anna Leach, deputy chief economist at the CBI, says UK industry seems to be stabilising, but a no-deal Brexit crisis would plunge the sector into deeper problems: \u201cDespite signs of stabilisation in the data this month, UK manufactures remain on the receiving end of a double whammy: the slowdown in the global economy and Brexit uncertainty. Trade tensions between nations such as China and the US only exacerbate the demand uncertainty facing UK manufacturers. \u201cAs we get closer to October, it\u2019s crucial that the new Prime Minister secures a Brexit deal ahead of that deadline and gets on with pressing domestic priorities, from improving our infrastructure to fixing the apprenticeship levy.\u201d The Italian stock market is sliding today, as Rome\u2019s coalition government appears on the brink of collapse. The FTSE MIB is down 111 points, or 0.55%, at 20,601, as traders in Milan brace for an autumn election. Prime minister Giuseppe Conte faces a confidence vote today after far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini - head of the right-wing Lega Nord party -- quit the coalition government last week. Conte is due to speak in the Senate at 2pm UK time. Italy\u2019s other deputy PM, Luigi Di Maio of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, has already thanked Conte for his work, implying his stint may soon be over. Writing on Facebook, Di Maio said: \u201cWhatever happens, I wanted to tell you that it was an honour to work together in this government,\u201d Conte certainly had a tough time, as the middleman between the Lega and M5S -- hardly natural political bedfellows. But with Italy already stagnating, fresh political uncertainty risks pushing the country into recession again. The pound\u2019s weakness has helped to push the US dollar to a new three-week high this morning. This will not please Donald Trump, who has been demanding a weak dollar to help exporters (and also to resist capital flows from emerging markets). Lukman Otunuga, Senior Research Analyst at FXTM, says the dollar is benefitting from the surge into safe-haven assets - although it would weaken if the Fed followed Trump\u2019s advice and cut rates aggressively. The mighty Dollar continues to tighten its grip across currency markets as the Dollar Index (DXY) hit a fresh three-week high at 98.40 on Tuesday. Stimulus hopes are sending investors away from safe haven assets, which is lifting US government bond yields - consequently supporting king Dollar. Where the Dollar concludes this week will be heavily influenced by the FOMC minutes and Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech in Jackson Hole on Friday. Should the minutes and Powell\u2019s speech confirm expectations of a US interest rate cut in September, the Dollar has the potential to weaken. Sterling is weakening this morning, after prime minister Boris Johnson tried to rip up the Irish Backstop at the heart of the current Brexit agreement. Johnson issued a four-page letter last night, insisting that the \u201canti-democratic\u201d backstop is removed. Instead, he wants new \u201cflexible and creative\u201d arrangements to manage a soft border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit. This hasn\u2019t gone down well in Europe, which is committed to avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. EU diplomats have concluded that Johnson is making a \u201cclear attempt\u201d to kill off negotiations - even as he prepares to meet Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. This has knocked the pound back below $1.21 for the first time this week. This is rather astonishing. Germany\u2019s government is planning to auction \u20ac2bn of new 30-year government bonds tomorrow, with a zero coupon. That means Berlin would not make any interest payments to bond-holders during the lifetime of the bund. Instead, it would simply take your money and promise to return it in 2049 - by which time inflation could have eroded much of its value. This highlights how bond yields have plunged to record lows, as investors have driven prices to new highs. Existing German 30-year bunds are currently changing hands at a negative yield, of -0.15%, in the bond market. So, Berlin seems to be pricing its bond correctly. But it\u2019s still A Moment. Such low yields imply pessimism over long-term growth prospects, and a real appetite for capital preservation (German bunds being safe as h\u00e4user). But it makes it very hard for pension funds, insurance firms, and fund managers trying grow their clients\u2019 wealth. Ralf Preusser, global head of rates strategy at Bank of America, has warned clients that Germany risks a \u201cbuyers\u2019 strike,\u201d if investors decide to seek better returns elsewhere. Paul McNamara of Swiss asset manager GAM has tweeted about the sale: European stock markets are following Asia\u2019s lead. The FTSE 100 has gained 35 points, or 0.5%, to 7219 - its highest level since last Wednesday\u2019s slump. Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC are both up 0.25% -- small gains, but a sign that stimulus hopes are still propping shares up. The boss of BHP Billiton, one of the world\u2019s biggest mining companies, has warned that the US-China trade war is hitting demand. After reporting BHP\u2019s best profits in five years, Andrew Mackenzie warned that the dispute will \u201cput a dampener\u201d on world growth. That could potentially hurting sales of iron ore, copper and coal, particularly to China - BHP\u2019s biggest customer. He said: \u201cThere\u2019s obviously been a slight cooling in appetite based on some of the concerns we have seen in the short-term for the global economy. We are not without some consideration as to what might be around the corner.\u201d Mackenzie also warned that the rise of nationalism, and governments that interfere in markets (yes you, Donald!) pose a threat to the global economic system. Donald Trump\u2019s latest attempt to force US interest rates down pushed some Asia-Pacific markets higher today. Lower borrowing costs, and higher growth, would be good news for Japanese exporters, Australian miners and South Korean tech firms. Here\u2019s some closing prices: Japan\u2019s Nikkei: up 114 points or 0.5% at 20,677 Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200: up 77 points or 1.2% South Korea\u2019s KOSPI: up 3 points, or 1.15%, at 258 My colleague Martin Farrer explains what investors are looking for: Investors now overwhelmingly expect the Fed to cut rates again at its 17-18 September policy meeting. The Fed cut rates in July for the first time in a decade to mitigate the effects of the US-China trade row and a global slowdown. The rate is very low by historic standards but nearly two points higher than the years after the 2008 crisis when it fell to 0.5%. Analysts will now shift their focus to the release of minutes of the Fed\u2019s July meeting which are due out on Wednesday. Traders are also keenly waiting on the Fed\u2019s Jackson Hole seminar and G7 summit in Biarritz this weekend for clues on what additional steps policymakers will take to bolster growth. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Can policymakers save us from recession? That\u2019s the question on the lips of investors this morning, as hopes of new stimulus packages build. Stocks have jumped in Asia overnight, following solid gains in Europe and in New York on Monday. After last week\u2019s rush to sell shares, traders are judiciously picking them up again, in anticipation of central bank stimulus. The European Central Bank seems certain to loosen monetary policy in September -- imposing steeper negative rates on banks and perhaps kickstarting its QE bond-buying programme again. The Federal Reserve may also ease next month, caving into pressure from Donald Trump to cut rates. Yesterday the president demanded that the Fed slash a whole percentage point off rates \u201cover a fairly short period of time\u201d, which is certainly more radical than Wall Street, or the Fed itself, had in mind. Trump also insists that America isn\u2019t heading into recession -- but if he\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s clear that the White House will point the finger of blame towards the Fed, rather than its own belligerent trade policies. Yesterday, the Bundesbank warned that Germany\u2019s economy could be sliding into recession right now. With orders for cars and industrial equipment sliding, GDP could shrink this summer for the second quarter in a row. The bank cited Brexit and the US-China trade war as key factors, adding: \u201cThe overall economic performance could decline slightly once again. Central to this is the ongoing downturn in industry.\u201d That is intensifying the pressure on Berlin to boost spending, with chatter about a \u20ac50bn stimulus package. Last night the Dow gained 249 points, taking it back over the 26,000 point mark for the first time in a week. As Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank points out, markets have now recovered a large chunk of their recent losses. Last night the S&amp;P 500 ended +1.21% which means it\u2019s now roughly an equal distance apart from the intraday post Trump trade tweet lows of early August and the highs prior to the tweet at the end of last month. It\u2019s also on a three-day winning run and believe it or not, has actually risen for seven of the last ten days even if it might not feel like it. But government bond yields are still at, or near, historic lows -- showing that the markets are still anxious about growth prospects. Also coming up today The CBI\u2019s monthly healthcheck on Britain\u2019s factories is likely to show that growth and new orders remained subdued this month, amid Brexit uncertainty and weaker global growth.

      "bodyText": "Even 24 hours on Yakou M\u00e9\u00eft\u00e9 is struggling to comprehend the events of Sunday afternoon. \u201cI was happy because we had won but personally I was a bit upset after missing the penalty,\u201d the Reading striker says of his side\u2019s 3-0 win over Cardiff. \u201cTo see that message when I checked my phone afterwards made me very sad \u2013 it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever experienced anything like that. To be honest for the first 30 minutes I think I was in a little bit of shock but then I realised it\u2019s not everyone who is like this. Unfortunately there are some bad people who like sending messages like that but it\u2019s important not to let it affect you.\u201d Minutes after his spot-kick had been saved during injury time of the Championship match three direct messages from an account named \u201csaw_pyay_htoo\u201d registered in Singapore were sent to the Ivory Coast forward: \u201cmother fucker\u201d; \u201ccan\u2019t score penalty\u201d; \u201cfucking monkey\u201d. It was the latest incident of racist abuse to have blighted the start of the football season, with Chelsea\u2019s Tammy Abraham and Paul Pogba of Manchester United also subjected to online discrimination over the past week having missed a penalty. M\u00e9\u00eft\u00e9 decided to take things into his own hands by publishing the messages to his 35,000 followers on Instagram with the reply: \u201cI don\u2019t think I need to speak.\u201d \u201cI was very angry so I decided to share it so people could see what kind of stuff we players have to put up with sometimes,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople think they can say whatever they want, even if it\u2019s racist. But of course they would never say that to my face. They hide behind Instagram or Facebook and that\u2019s why I posted it.\u201d After the Abraham incident in the Super Cup in Istanbul last week the anti-racism organisation Kick it Out issued a \u201ccall to action\u201d to social media companies to clamp down on online abuse. Even after the offending account was swiftly deleted M\u00e9\u00eft\u00e9 agrees. \u201cEveryone should be together to try to do something about this because it is unacceptable,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are all the same and we are playing to make people happy and to see this kind of message is not good for the sport. I want to say thank you to everyone who has sent me messages because I have received a lot of love \u2013 even from supporters of other Championship clubs. They make me feel I am not alone and these kind of messages are not only hurting me but everyone.\u201d Now settled in Berkshire after signing from Paris Saint-Germain in 2016, M\u00e9\u00eft\u00e9 enjoyed his best campaign as he scored 12 league goals despite Reading finishing 20th in the Championship last season. A hamstring injury that forced him out of the last few matches also ended up costing him a place in Ivory Coast\u2019s squad for the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt, where Ibrahim Kamara\u2019s side were beaten on penalties in the quarter-final by the eventual champions, Algeria. \u201cIt was difficult but I think the coach decided I wasn\u2019t 100%,\u201d he says. \u201cI accept that because when you go to a tournament like that you need to be at your best. It was a disappointing tournament because with the quality we had in the team we should have done better.\u201d That was underlined when Arsenal paid a club-record \u00a372m to sign the forward Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 from Lille last month. M\u00e9\u00eft\u00e9 has offered his services to the player he has known since the age of 12 when they and Tottenham\u2019s Georges-K\u00e9vin Nkoudou were teammates at FC Solitaire in the 19th arrondissement of Paris. \u201cHe was a goalkeeper at this time so I used to practise trying to score against him. Life is weird!\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cSometimes he would get bored and come out to play on the wing. He was very good. \u201cWe used to live near each other and also went to the same school so we are good friends. I\u2019ve already tried to help him a bit. I said to him I am not far from London, so let me know. \u201cHe is very happy to be at Arsenal and is very excited for the season. I\u2019m sure he is going to do well because he has a lot of quality.\u201d As for Reading, the victory over Cardiff has eased some of the pressure on the Portuguese manager Jos\u00e9 Manuel Gomes after two defeats. Reading started the summer under a \u201csoft\u201d transfer embargo having breached the Football League\u2019s financial fair play rules but the purchase of the forwards Lucas Jo\u00e3o and George Puscas, a Romania Under-21 international who scored twice on Sunday, for a combined \u00a313m has raised expectations at a club last relegated from the Premier League in 2013. \u201cI don\u2019t know where we are going to end up,\u201d says M\u00e9\u00eft\u00e9. \u201cEvery team is capable of surprising you.\u201d But having swapped the gilded surroundings of PSG for the rough and tumble of Championship he has no regrets. \u201cI\u2019ve been here for three years and feel half-English now,\u201d says M\u00e9\u00eft\u00e9. \u201cThe fans have always been so good to me and they have made me feel welcome.

The latest study found there may be 200tn cubic feet, enough to meet the UK\u2019s gas demand for around a decade.</p> <p>Prof Colin Snape, of the University of Nottingham, said the BGS\u2019s study had involved desk-based research based on the findings of shale developers in the US rather than actual reserves.

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s underground shale gas reserves may deliver only a fraction of the gas promised by fracking firms and government ministers, according to a study. Research by the University of Nottingham found that early estimates may have exaggerated the UK\u2019s shale reserves up to sixfold. Last week government officials hinted that a review could be launched looking into loosening UK limits on fracking because shale \u201ccould be an important new domestic energy source\u201d. The University of Nottingham said it had used a new technique to measure the shale gas trapped in the Bowland shale basin in central England and found significantly lower levels than was suggested by a widely quoted study six years ago. In 2013 the British Geological Survey (BGS) found there were likely to be 1,300tn cubic feet of gas. The latest study found there may be 200tn cubic feet, enough to meet the UK\u2019s gas demand for around a decade. Prof Colin Snape, of the University of Nottingham, said the BGS\u2019s study had involved desk-based research based on the findings of shale developers in the US rather than actual reserves. The new research was based on studies of actual UK shales, using gas absorption data and field data, he said. \u201cWe have made great strides in developing a laboratory test procedure to determine shale gas potential,\u201d Snape said. \u201cThis can only serve to improve people\u2019s understanding and government decisions around the future of what role shale gas can make to the UK\u2019s energy demand as we move to being carbon neutral by 2050.\u201d It is the second major study in recent years to cast doubt on economic claims made by the shale gas industry. Researchers at Heriot-Watt University said the UK\u2019s most promising shale gas reservoirs had been warped by tectonic shifts that could thwart efforts to tap them. A BEIS spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK has potentially significant shale gas reserves, but exploration is necessary to understand whether it will be possible to safely and economically extract them. The Government is supportive of shale gas exploration in order to understand the size of the opportunity here in the UK.\u201d Last week the government lent its support to the shale industry as Cuadrilla restarted fracking at its Preston New Road site in Lancashire.

      "bodyText": "It is a casting as hotly anticipated as Strictly, but with less sparkle and prurient speculation on potential couplings: the new Great British Bake Off lineup has been announced. That said, this year\u2019s bakers are so young that the tent could well become a canvas-covered Love Island. With seven contestants in their 20s and the oldest, HGV driver Phil, a mere 56, the average age is 31, making it the youngest season by far. Will the delicate GBBO souffl\u00e9 rise without the magic ingredient: older bakers? Previous seasons have seen contestants in their 60s and older triumph over patisserie pretenders young enough to be their grandchildren \u2013 but also, more importantly, bond with them in the loveliest way over split cr\u00e8me pat, deflated choux and Paul Hollywood\u2019s ludicrous posturing. With its multigenerational flapping over pie crust and oven temperature, GBBO paints a picture of Britain we recognise: all ages and ethnicities, prey to anxiety and fond of a bun or six. So, while we prepare to fall in love with this year\u2019s bunch (because we will; we always do), let\u2019s remember some of Bake Off\u2019s older heroes. Val Stones, 66 Seemingly lost in a delightful world of her own, Val danced as she baked, claimed her cakes \u201csang\u201d to her and dropped almost everything without ever losing her beatific smile. Since leaving GBBO, she has received a personalised message from her hero, Ed Sheeran, and remained friends with gloriously laidback Selasi (33), which is exactly as it should be. Howard Middleton, 51 The Alan Bennett of baking, Howard combined endearingly dry humour with a highly relatable anxiety at uncooperative dough and mystery technicals. He faced the (entirely accidental) theft of his custard (who could forget \u201cCustardgate\u201d) with stoic dignity. A titan among bakers. Flo Atkins, 71 Indefatigably perky scouser Flo threw herself into baking after her husband of 48 years died of leukaemia. Despite creating a spectacular watermelon illusion cake, she was eliminated in week three of series eight, but proved the best revenge is ... well, rapping, with a slick performance of Rapper\u2019s Delight on the sister show An Extra Slice. Brendan Lynch, 63 Bake Off legend and series three finalist Brendan\u2019s gentle manner masked a steely determination and spectacular precision. Whether oiling his forearms to stretch strudel dough, wielding a set square and tape measure with the rigour of a Cern physicist, or crafting an exquisitely romantic biscuit bird house, Brendan set the standard for grace under pressure while often clad in fleece. Norman Calder, 66 Series five featured unflappably brilliant winner Nancy (60) and Diana Beard (69) doing terrible things to Iain\u2019s baked Alaska, but retired naval officer Norman Calder and his lumpen, no-nonsense, eminently achievable baking captured our hearts. Overcoming his suspicion of pesto and decorative flourishes, Norman\u2019s biscuit showstopper \u201cZulu Boats at Dawn\u201d sounded like a problematic 50s film, but was basically triangular ginger biscuits on a blue base. Peak Norman, that.",

Get him, Gaz! But then, just as those of a gammon persuasion up and down the country started rubbing their knees in anticipation of a ferocious takedown of Pogba\u2019s outrageous habit of paying someone to cut his hair, Neville simmered down. Further facts had emerged, showing that Rashford had taken the ball off Pogba before the penalty against Chelsea. Oh! Er! Retreat!

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s nuclear watchdog has agreed to allow one of the country\u2019s oldest nuclear reactors to restart, one year after it was shut down to investigate cracks in its graphite core. EDF Energy is expected to restart reactor 4 at its 40-year-old Hunterston B nuclear plant on the Firth of Clyde in North Ayrshire within weeks after the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) said the plant was safe. The regulator will allow the reactor to run for four months after proving that the reactor cores can still fulfil their fundamental safety requirements, despite the cracks in its graphite bricks. Donald Urquhart, the ONR deputy chief inspector, said the regulator had made the decision to give Hunterston B\u2019s reactor 4 the green light after a \u201clong and detailed assessment of the safety case\u201d submitted by EDF Energy. He said: \u201cNuclear safety remains our utmost priority and we would only allow a reactor to restart with clear evidence that it remains safe for workers and the public.\u201d The energy company said it had spent more than \u00a3125m completing the \u201cmost extensive investigation of the reactor core that has ever been undertaken\u201d to prove the Hunterston plant\u2019s safety. The reactor was shut down last March after investigators discovered more than expected cracks in the graphite core of reactor 4 and reactor 3 at the Scottish nuclear plant. Its application to restart reactor 3, which was found to have more than 350 hairline cracks in its graphite core, is still pending. EDF Energy had expected to restart the reactors in November but was forced to delay until the end of April this year. The energy company hopes to be powering homes by the end of August. EDF Energy said it had proved that even in the most extreme conditions, including the unlikely event of an earthquake, its reactors would continue to operate within large safety margins.

Emergency services were called to the Rooms Inn hotel, in the town centre, shortly before 9am on Tuesday to reports of a baby having fallen from a window. Lancashire police said the 18-month-old girl had been airlifted to Alder Hey children\u2019s hospital in Merseyside. The force said the toddler was in a serious condition and inquiries were under way. No arrests have been made. Witnesses told the Blackpool Gazette the girl was feared to have sustained a fractured skull and chest injuries. The owner of the Rooms Inn hotel said the injured girl was part of a family of four who were staying at the 32-room venue. Several police vehicles, including a crime scene investigation van, were parked outside the hotel shortly after the incident. Wendy and Kevin Twiss, who run a neighbouring hotel, raised the alarm after hearing the girl fall into a yard at the back of the building and looked out to see her in distress. Kevin Twiss told the BBC: \u201cWe just said to everyone: \u2018We need to get downstairs. We need to go and help this little girl.\u2019 I looked up and saw who I believed were the parents looking out of the window.\u201d Twiss said he climbed over the wall and picked the injured girl up before a man he believed to be the girl\u2019s father kicked the gate open and took hold of her.

But Brexit \u2013 especially without a deal in place with the European Union \u2013 would be bad for the US-UK special relationship and would make the UK a much less important US ally.</p> \n<p>The ramifications of Brexit \u2013 in particular without a deal with the EU that pleases everyone \u2013 could be explosive. It could hurt the UK economy at a time when Trump\u2019s trade war and economic policies are increasing the risk of a global recession, and threaten the very integrity of the UK amid growing signals that Northern Ireland and Scotland would consider breaking away. Boris Johnson appears willing to drive Britain off this cliff come hell or high water, threatening <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/20/whats-new-in-boris-johnsons-fresh-bid-to-remove-brexit-backstop\" title=\"\">a no-deal Brexit</a> and saying that the UK will leave the EU by the end of October, \u201cdo or die\u201d. Everyone hopes that the UK finds a way out of this mess, but the past few years haven\u2019t provided much evidence to believe that it will end well.</p> \n<p>Trump has long supported Brexit. He made that support clear during his presidential campaign and has expressed it repeatedly as president. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John Bolton, now appears to be doing what he can to ensure Brexit happens. When in the UK recently, Bolton tried to incentivise Brexit by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/12/us-and-britain-could-sign-sector-by-sector-trade-deals-says-bolton\" title=\"\">dangling the possibility</a> of a trade deal with the US after the UK leaves the EU, saying that the UK would be at the \u201cfront of the trade queue\u201d for a deal.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/13/john-bolton-trade-deal-uk-colonise\">John Bolton doesn\u2019t want a trade deal with the UK \u2013 he wants to colonise us | Simon Tisdall</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But that won\u2019t happen. First, the politics in the US right now mean that it is incredibly difficult to pass any trade deals, even with America\u2019s closest allies. Second, and more important, US congressional leaders have already signalled that a deal would be dead on arrival in Congress if Brexit affects the situation in Northern Ireland. As the speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said: \u201cIf Brexit undermines the Good Friday accord, there <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/14/no-chance-of-us-uk-deal-if-northern-ireland-peace-at-risk-pelosi\" title=\"\">will be no chance</a> of a US-UK trade agreement passing the Congress.\u201d</p> \n<p>In fact, the reality of a post-Brexit US-UK alliance could be just the opposite of the false promises being peddled by Trump and Bolton: the longer-term impacts of Brexit could include a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/13/us-no-deal-john-bolton-trade-foreign-policy\" title=\"\">significantly downgraded</a> relationship between the two nations. It\u2019s been a long time since the UK was the global power it once was, but it\u2019s still a vital US ally. From diplomatic cooperation at the UN, to supporting the Iran nuclear deal, to working together in Nato, there are endless examples of how a strong alliance \u2013 and a strong UK \u2013 is in the US interest.</p> \n<p>But if the UK leaves the EU \u2013 especially without a deal \u2013 its influence and power will decrease markedly. It would no longer be able to influence EU decisions on economic matters in a bloc that constitutes the world\u2019s second largest economy and with which the US traded <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/europe-middle-east/europe/european-union\" title=\"\">$1.3tn in goods and services</a> in 2018. It would no longer be able to influence the EU position on challenges such as Russia and China. If a no-deal Brexit causes a rift within the UK by pushing Scotland towards independence or undermining the Good Friday agreement, it will have even less bandwidth to play a positive role around the world. And if Brexit damages the UK economy, it will likely mean a UK with less global economic and military power.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1e9b26cf-83e8-408c-afcd-15cca058d516\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qhj_79tPd-s?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>While a post-Brexit UK is still likely to be one of the world\u2019s largest economies and will retain its seat on the UN security council, it will be less important to US national security and economic interests. In addition, if the UK and EU remain at odds over significant economic and political issues in the wake of Brexit, it could place the US in an awkward position between close allies in the UK and on the rest of the continent.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, Brexit won\u2019t make the serious policy disagreements between the Trump administration and the UK magically disappear. For instance, the two have been at odds over the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and whether to allow the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei to do business in Britain.

      "bodyText": "As the UK races towards a potential no-deal Brexit, President Donald Trump is cheering it on. But Brexit \u2013 especially without a deal in place with the European Union \u2013 would be bad for the US-UK special relationship and would make the UK a much less important US ally. The ramifications of Brexit \u2013 in particular without a deal with the EU that pleases everyone \u2013 could be explosive. It could hurt the UK economy at a time when Trump\u2019s trade war and economic policies are increasing the risk of a global recession, and threaten the very integrity of the UK amid growing signals that Northern Ireland and Scotland would consider breaking away. Boris Johnson appears willing to drive Britain off this cliff come hell or high water, threatening a no-deal Brexit and saying that the UK will leave the EU by the end of October, \u201cdo or die\u201d. Everyone hopes that the UK finds a way out of this mess, but the past few years haven\u2019t provided much evidence to believe that it will end well. Trump has long supported Brexit. He made that support clear during his presidential campaign and has expressed it repeatedly as president. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John Bolton, now appears to be doing what he can to ensure Brexit happens. When in the UK recently, Bolton tried to incentivise Brexit by dangling the possibility of a trade deal with the US after the UK leaves the EU, saying that the UK would be at the \u201cfront of the trade queue\u201d for a deal. But that won\u2019t happen. First, the politics in the US right now mean that it is incredibly difficult to pass any trade deals, even with America\u2019s closest allies. Second, and more important, US congressional leaders have already signalled that a deal would be dead on arrival in Congress if Brexit affects the situation in Northern Ireland. As the speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said: \u201cIf Brexit undermines the Good Friday accord, there will be no chance of a US-UK trade agreement passing the Congress.\u201d In fact, the reality of a post-Brexit US-UK alliance could be just the opposite of the false promises being peddled by Trump and Bolton: the longer-term impacts of Brexit could include a significantly downgraded relationship between the two nations. It\u2019s been a long time since the UK was the global power it once was, but it\u2019s still a vital US ally. From diplomatic cooperation at the UN, to supporting the Iran nuclear deal, to working together in Nato, there are endless examples of how a strong alliance \u2013 and a strong UK \u2013 is in the US interest. But if the UK leaves the EU \u2013 especially without a deal \u2013 its influence and power will decrease markedly. It would no longer be able to influence EU decisions on economic matters in a bloc that constitutes the world\u2019s second largest economy and with which the US traded $1.3tn in goods and services in 2018. It would no longer be able to influence the EU position on challenges such as Russia and China. If a no-deal Brexit causes a rift within the UK by pushing Scotland towards independence or undermining the Good Friday agreement, it will have even less bandwidth to play a positive role around the world. And if Brexit damages the UK economy, it will likely mean a UK with less global economic and military power. While a post-Brexit UK is still likely to be one of the world\u2019s largest economies and will retain its seat on the UN security council, it will be less important to US national security and economic interests. In addition, if the UK and EU remain at odds over significant economic and political issues in the wake of Brexit, it could place the US in an awkward position between close allies in the UK and on the rest of the continent. Furthermore, Brexit won\u2019t make the serious policy disagreements between the Trump administration and the UK magically disappear. For instance, the two have been at odds over the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and whether to allow the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei to do business in Britain. It seems unlikely that the Trump administration would be willing to give the UK a break on those issues in the event of Brexit \u2013 just look at the recent spat with Britain over whether to release an Iranian oil tanker detained in Gibraltar. While some might believe that Trump and Johnson\u2019s relationship as kindred demagogic spirits could help buoy the alliance in the wake of Brexit, it should be clear by now that the two leaders are driven by their own political interests and are willing to damage the special relationship if it advances their own personal positions. Trump has no interest in the US-UK alliance \u2013 he\u2019s an agent of chaos, and supporting Brexit is yet another way for him to upend international norms. Trump\u2019s disdain for allies should be fair warning to those who think the president might be willing to offer fair trade terms to Britain. As analyst Jeremy Shapiro points out, what we know so far about the terms for a US-UK deal \u201creveals that it is very much an \u2018America first\u2019 effort\u201d. Faith in Trump to help a US ally is misplaced. \u201cOur allies take advantage of us far more than our enemies,\u201d Trump said at a recent rally. If the current UK government believes that the US will shower rewards on Britain in the wake of Brexit, or that it will somehow bail Britain out, they\u2019re wrong. Many policymakers in America will stick with the UK because of the longstanding alliance, but it could be a diminished alliance.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a police officer, but I also wanted to experience student life,\u201d says Sophie Parfitt, 21, from Dover, a recent graduate of the Police Studies with Criminal Investigation course at Bucks New Uni, who now works as a police community support officer (PCSO) for Thames Valley police (TVP). \u201cAfter three years, I\u2019ve got a career out of this. If I had chosen a different degree it would\u2019ve been much harder.\u201d Policing has significantly changed over the past decade. The job of being an officer is complex and the demands on the force are increasing as criminals become more sophisticated. As a result, routes into the profession are changing. According to the College of Policing, there are apprenticeships, which normally take three years with both on- and off-the-job learning. Degree-holder entry, whereby anyone with an undergraduate degree (in any subject) can join and follow a work-based programme for two years. There is also a pre-join degree, which is a three-year degree in professional policing followed by a shorter on-the-job training programme. Meanwhile, Ucas says there are approximately 1,000 courses for criminology, including those that are a subset of sociology and social studies courses. Programmes such as these offer something different \u2013 the focus is not just on becoming a police officer, but about keeping options open. \u201cWe look at the broader role of the criminal justice system,\u201d explains Maurice Collins, course leader of the Bucks New Uni Police Studies with Criminal Investigation degree. \u201cWe encourage students to become special constables and get frontline experience before jumping in with both feet.\u201d The course is practical and academic. Alongside operational policing, it covers areas such as the police use of firearms, miscarriages of justice and major crime investigations. There is also exposure to the issues facing the profession today. Students are encouraged to question whether the prison system works, examine the age of criminal responsibility and learn about schemes aimed at steering youngsters away from offending. \u201cPolice are facing massive challenges,\u201d says Collins. \u201cFrom people trafficking to the roles of policing in mental health, it\u2019s a critical time. We need to look at what\u2019s ethical and how it\u2019s gone wrong in the past.\u201d Having said that, policing is not something you can learn just by reading out of a book.

      "bodyText": "Ever dreamed of organising the next Burning Man? Booking the main acts for Primavera? Or building Boomtown\u2019s fictional city? Well, that\u2019s exactly the kind of exciting career path that awaits the alumni of Bucks New Uni\u2019s BA (Hons) Events, Festivals and Venue Management degree. The new three-year course merges two degrees \u2013 BA (Hons) Event and Festivals Management and BA (Hons) Music and Live Events Management \u2013 and promises to equip students with the theoretical and practical nous to work behind-the-scenes for some of the world\u2019s best festivals, run venues across the globe, and even start their own events business. During his Event and Festivals Management degree, Bucks New Uni graduate James Gibson, 41, was given the enviable opportunity to work in Canada for two months to shadow the operations manager at the Vancouver International Jazz Festival. Post-degree, he was headhunted to create a new festival from scratch on an island off the Northumberland coast: the now award-winning Lindisfarne Festival. A mature student at the time, Gibson says he studied at Bucks New Uni in order to build on his 10 years\u2019 experience in the events and music industry. \u201cEven though I had a wealth of experience, I thought it was important to follow that up with academia because I knew that\u2019s the way the industry was going,\u201d says Gibson, now operations manager at Shindig festival in Somerset. \u201cIt fitted in with my career path. I learned all about licensing, planning a major festival from a legal perspective, crowd management, and health and safety.\u201d Gibson, who graduated in 2014, says that the degree also allowed for people in the industry to see how focused he was on his career. Although Jessie Hall is still at the early stages of her career \u2013 she graduates with a first-class honours in Music and Live Events Management this September \u2013 she\u2019s already carving out a strong CV. The events professional is currently working as a freelance production assistant at Festival Republic, organiser of Reading and Leeds festival. Bucks New Uni regularly offers its students internships, and although this particular internship was offered to second-year students, Hall managed to secure a place in her first year. \u201cIt was a money-can\u2019t-buy opportunity that the course offered to its students and I grabbed it with both hands,\u201d she says. \u201cThat summer I managed to spend around nine weeks working on festival sites such as Download, Latitude and Reading and Leeds and found that \u2018site life\u2019 was definitely the environment for me.\u201d The degree offers plenty of hands-on practical experience by throwing students into setting up and running two real-life events: Winterland, a Christmas-style event with fairground rides and a Santa\u2019s grotto; and Bucks Live, a mini community day festival. During the latter event, Hall worked as a production coordinator and event manager, managing more than 3,000 paying customers. \u201cThat experience was genuinely something I could never have gained without the course,\u201d she says. \u201cThose modules prepared me the most for real on-site festival work.\u201d Those graduating with an events degree enter a sector that\u2019s in good shape. According to UK Music, 3.9 million people attended festivals in the UK in 2016, while figures from the Association of Independent Festivals (AIF) show that there are currently 975 UK festivals. \u201cOur 10-year report also confirmed that our members contributed an estimated \u00a31bn in revenue to the UK economy in the three-year period between 2014 and 2017,\u201d says Paul Reed, chief executive of the AIF. He describes the market as: \u201ccrowded but not overcrowded\u201d, with \u201cfestivals investing in delivering an overall experience the ones thriving in the current climate\u201d. \u201cOverall, it is healthy, despite a Brexit-shaped cloud of economic uncertainty hanging over the population,\u201d says Reed. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t seem to have had a significant impact on sales this season. As ever, some festivals are slightly up or down from last year but, generally, there is stability.\u201d Neil Mackey, the course leader of the BA (Hons) Events, Festivals and Venue Management degree at Bucks New Uni, says the degree is \u201cunique [compared with] other courses\u201d, as it provides students with valuable practical experience. \u201cThey will be putting on music events, gigs, club nights and will work closely with the students\u2019 union. Many [of the students who studied for the previous two events degrees that were offered by Bucks New Uni] ended up doing work experience at festivals such as Download and Latitude. Other students might have a degree and have done bar work, but the difference here is [our students] will have the opportunity to run their own festivals, put gigs on and take advantage of work experience opportunities at festivals, events, and theatres.\u201d For Gibson, who has recently been hired as a tour manager for a BBC travel show, the course has led to his dream career. \u201cI love it,\u201d he says. \u201cI love the build-up to an event and then seeing the end product. That\u2019s what the buzz is about.\u201d And it\u2019s Bucks New Uni he thanks for getting him there. \u201cI don\u2019t think my career would have been the same if I hadn\u2019t done the course,\u201d he adds.

She is a dazzling, ravening ego on legs: her signature song is called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOB7zeiTP-o\">Look at Me</a> and repeats the phrase ad absurdum.

This is a woman who has the world where she wants it, and who laughs blithely throughout our chat \u2013 even when discussing the terrifying anxieties she nightly splays across the stage. Alongside Look at Me, her songs include one about murderous revenge on a handsy date, another on her attraction to men who\u2019re indifferent to her, as well as her ditty, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH3tlOTHTL4\">Take My Money</a>, about shopping for plus-size clothes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZidGVbSEzM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BZidGVbSEzM?start=16&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=16\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>\u2018Look at me\u2019 \u2026 <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BZidGVbSEzM?t=2\">watch Cohen performing on YouTube</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>This isn\u2019t traditional musical comedy. \u201cIt\u2019s repetitive, it\u2019s usually one joke. Henry [Koperski, her composer and pianist] always kids around that I refuse to rhyme or to write an actual joke. But it makes me laugh, so I just go with it.\u201d Koperski exaggerates: Cohen has plenty of jokes (\u201cI love sex because it famously has no consequences\u201d), her mannerisms are hilariously arch and she can make her voice funny as well as beautiful. But he\u2019s right that her lyrical schemes are capacious: Cohen often careens off-piste. Witness the riff in Take My Money on the fact that she\u2019s always been larger than her boyfriends: \u201cLike, if I fuck this skinny guy maybe I won\u2019t give birth to a chubby daughter who I\u2019ll have to fight with in the changing room \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Watch the show, and it feels like a satire on \u2013 or expos\u00e9 of \u2013 self-projection millennial-style, in which \u201cI\u2019m wonderful\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m vulnerable\u201d jostle for stage space. Older audiences \u2013 to whom Cohen never usually plays \u2013 can find it overpowering, she reports. \u201cA man stopped me and told me I was talking way too fast and he couldn\u2019t understand what I was saying. I was like, \u2018Thank you for the note, sir!\u2019\u201d Back in the day, performers (and everyone else) kept their dysfunction concealed, or at least buried deep in the subtext. \u201cWhereas I\u2019m like, \u2018What\u2019s subtext?\u2019\u201d Cohen says with a laugh. \u201c\u2018Here\u2019s text.

I really am addicted to my phone, and to male attention. It\u2019s my base desires, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>She hopes audiences might identify with the persona on such lurid display. \u201cHopefully, in sharing some of my selfish or disgusting secrets, people might be like, \u2018I feel that way too,\u2019 and feel less alone. That\u2019s what I look for \u2013 a performer exposing themselves on stage and letting me see my insecurities reflected in them.\u201d But mainly, she wants to make people laugh. And she <em>needs</em> to be on stage. \u201cOn my one day off in this whole festival, I was like, \u2018Why am I <em>so</em> depressed?\u2019 It\u2019s because I didn\u2019t do the show that day.

We meet in the Pleasance\u2019s backstage bar mid-festival and \u2013 notwithstanding her dramatic emotional arc \u2013 she could hardly seem happier. This is a woman who has the world where she wants it, and who laughs blithely throughout our chat \u2013 even when discussing the terrifying anxieties she nightly splays across the stage. Alongside Look at Me, her songs include one about murderous revenge on a handsy date, another on her attraction to men who\u2019re indifferent to her, as well as her ditty, Take My Money, about shopping for plus-size clothes. This isn\u2019t traditional musical comedy. \u201cIt\u2019s repetitive, it\u2019s usually one joke. Henry [Koperski, her composer and pianist] always kids around that I refuse to rhyme or to write an actual joke. But it makes me laugh, so I just go with it.\u201d Koperski exaggerates: Cohen has plenty of jokes (\u201cI love sex because it famously has no consequences\u201d), her mannerisms are hilariously arch and she can make her voice funny as well as beautiful. But he\u2019s right that her lyrical schemes are capacious: Cohen often careens off-piste. Witness the riff in Take My Money on the fact that she\u2019s always been larger than her boyfriends: \u201cLike, if I fuck this skinny guy maybe I won\u2019t give birth to a chubby daughter who I\u2019ll have to fight with in the changing room \u2026\u201d Watch the show, and it feels like a satire on \u2013 or expos\u00e9 of \u2013 self-projection millennial-style, in which \u201cI\u2019m wonderful\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m vulnerable\u201d jostle for stage space. Older audiences \u2013 to whom Cohen never usually plays \u2013 can find it overpowering, she reports. \u201cA man stopped me and told me I was talking way too fast and he couldn\u2019t understand what I was saying. I was like, \u2018Thank you for the note, sir!\u2019\u201d Back in the day, performers (and everyone else) kept their dysfunction concealed, or at least buried deep in the subtext. \u201cWhereas I\u2019m like, \u2018What\u2019s subtext?\u2019\u201d Cohen says with a laugh. \u201c\u2018Here\u2019s text. Here\u2019s some more text\u2019.\u201d She tells me what fellow US comic Naomi Ekperigin told her: \u201c\u2018You\u2019re pure id.\u2019 And I was like, omigod, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing. It\u2019s this pure, \u201cI want, I want\u201d character, and I\u2019ve just been leaning into it and hoping it\u2019s not offputting.\u201d And where does that character come from? \u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019m actually thinking,\u201d she replies, as if it were obvious. \u201cI want everything, I want everyone to pay attention to me. I really am addicted to my phone, and to male attention. It\u2019s my base desires, I guess.\u201d She hopes audiences might identify with the persona on such lurid display. \u201cHopefully, in sharing some of my selfish or disgusting secrets, people might be like, \u2018I feel that way too,\u2019 and feel less alone. That\u2019s what I look for \u2013 a performer exposing themselves on stage and letting me see my insecurities reflected in them.\u201d But mainly, she wants to make people laugh. And she needs to be on stage. \u201cOn my one day off in this whole festival, I was like, \u2018Why am I so depressed?\u2019 It\u2019s because I didn\u2019t do the show that day. I turn to Henry before the show every night and I\u2019m just like, \u2018This gives my life purpose\u2019.\u201d But for how long? Cohen is so clearly a star in the making that I fear we may lose her to the movies or to TV (for which \u2013 after appearances in Broad City and Search Party \u2013 she\u2019s developing a version of her stage show). \u201cI want to be a movie star,\u201d she says, flashing the kind of smile that defies you to bet against it. Then there\u2019s musical theatre, with which she has teenage history and an ambivalent relationship (\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s life-ruining\u201d), but to which her skills \u2013 like erstwhile Edinburgh fringe sensation Tim Minchin before her \u2013 are perfectly suited. \u201cI want to do it all!\u201d she insists \u2013 like her mentor Cumming, a fine template of a self-authored creative career. But first there\u2019s a festival to finish \u2013 if she can muster the emotional strength. \u201cPeople do this multiple years in a row? They have a death wish!\u201d she says. \u201cThis place is crazy. But it\u2019s heaven.\u201d Catherine Cohen is at Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 August.

      "bodyText": "Russia has told international nuclear test ban monitors that it does not have to share information on the blast that caused a brief spike in radiation levels in Arkhangelsk region, bolstering speculation that Russia may have tampered with monitoring stations that failed to transmit scientific data after the accident. Two Russian-operated monitoring stations for the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty ceased transmitting data two days after the 8 August blast, when a projected radioactive plume from the deadly accident would be expected to reach them. The data could have given additional information on the amount and kind of nuclear materials being used in the Russian military tests, indicating the level of danger to local residents and the nature of the Russian testing, including whether a small nuclear reactor was involved. The treaty\u2019s mandate \u201cdoes not cover development of any types of weapons\u201d, said the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, on Tuesday when asked about why the stations had suddenly gone silent. The decision to transmit data is \u201cstrictly voluntary\u201d, he added. On Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported another two monitoring stations had also suddenly gone offline, bringing the total to four. Lassina Zerbo, the executive secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), wrote earlier this week that the agency was analysing the \u201cpotential plume from the explosion\u201d and was \u201caddressing technical problems experienced at two neighbouring stations\u201d. A spokesperson for the CTBTO said that the organisation \u201cstarted experiencing problems with two radionuclide stations \u2013 Dubna and Kirov \u2013 on the morning of 10 August.\u201d The stations reported \u201ccommunication and network issues\u201d and apparently had not been restored to full functionality as of Tuesday evening. The spokesperson also confirmed problems at the Bilibino and Zalesovo radionuclide stations beginning on 13 August. Russia\u2019s atomic agency has said that five of its employees were killed during a test involving a liquid-fuelled rocket and \u201cisotope power sources\u201d at a military testing range. Some analysts have said Russia could have been testing an experimental cruise missile that carries a nuclear reactor on board, although other theories have been suggested. They include a nuclear-powered cooling system for liquid-fuelled rockets or other hypersonic or nuclear-powered missile projects. The comprehensive test ban treaty, signed in 1996, prohibits civilian and military experiments involving nuclear explosions. It is not in force because it has not been signed or ratified by a number of countries, including the US, but Russia has set up monitoring stations that transmit data to the organisation headed by Zerbo in Vienna, Austria. This month\u2019s blast is not believed to have been caused by a nuclear reaction, but by the ignition of rocket fuel being used in the experiment. The CTBTO receives information from approximately 300 stations around the world that identify nuclear testing by providing seismic, hydroacoustic and other data. The monitoring stations at Dubna and Kirov, which ceased transmitting data on 10 August, monitor radionuclide particles in the air. On Tuesday, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said that president Vladimir Putin, was receiving updates about the situation in Severodvinsk, where gamma radiation exceeded the normal level by 16 times after the explosion on 8 August. But Peskov said of the test stations: \u201cI don\u2019t know what those stations are, and what data they transmit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is outside of our purview.\u201d",

As time went on, however, she began to grow anxious about how she slotted into the glossy major-label world. \u201cI\u2019m never going to have another Touch,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was just a magic moment. When you have a viral video that you made yourself, with a budget of 900 quid, it puts you in a good position to be like, \u2018I know what I\u2019m doing.\u2019 Even if you don\u2019t.\u201d Her album peaked at No 13, then disappeared, spending only two weeks in the UK chart. \u201cI was frightened I would lose my leverage because, by the label\u2019s standards, Nothing\u2019s Real wasn\u2019t a roaring success. By mine, it was.\u201d</p> <p>She was relieved when Polydor dropped her. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you\u2019re in a slightly shit relationship,\u201d she jokes. \u201cI got myself dumped.\u201d But stepping away gave her an opportunity to get on with living life unwatched: no more pressure to keep the hype machine fuelled. \u201cI feel like if I had stayed on a major label, I would\u2019ve needed to carry on putting out things,\u201d she says. \u201cWhether it was me singing on someone else\u2019s track, or appearing somewhere, at some event. Doing all these things to remind people you exist. I felt like the most sane thing I could do for myself was to be quiet until I had something to say.\u201d</p> <p>Now signed to the indie label Secretly Canadian, being the sort of pop star who passes slightly under the radar suits Shura more than the prospect of arena tours and big co-signs. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to be in a place where I\u2019m walking past posters of all the records I bought and loved that year: Bon Iver, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/29/angel-olsen-my-woman\">Angel Olsen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jul/13/japanese-breakfast-soft-sounds-from-another-planet-review-dead-oceans\">Japanese Breakfast</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/20/lo-fi-solo-rocker-mitski-new-album-puberty-2\">Mitski</a>, Moses Sumney. I feel like I\u2019m part of this weird family.\u201d</p> <p>She has recently moved to the States. Why? \u201cBodegas,\u201d she deadpans, referring to those Aladdin\u2019s cave delis you get in New York. \u201cI\u2019m just obsessed. If you went to a newsagent\u2019s here, you\u2019d get maybe a Tropicana, if you\u2019re lucky.\u201d It\u2019s not the whole story: after two years of touring her debut, Shura was exhausted and homesick. Still, before catching a flight home, she made a brief detour to Minneapolis, where she holed up to write new material and drink white Russians. It was here she fired up a dating app and swiped right on her now girlfriend, who lives in New York.</p> <p>\u201cTrump getting elected and the [Chicago] Cubs winning the baseball world series, that was the beginning of my relationship,\u201d she says. Spurred on by long-distance lust, Shura hashed out the vague sketch of lead single Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands on Me) \u2013 a desire-drenched slab of slinky funk. \u201cI started writing the song before we met, which is funny, because it\u2019s my most sexy, physically explicit song,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had never seen each other in 3D!\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHI_WpVLT1g\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HHI_WpVLT1g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Shura: Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands on Me) \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Thankfully, their meeting went according to plan (new single The Stage is based on their first date at a gig by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/08/muna-on-harry-styles-imposter-syndrome-and-trump-baiting\">synthpop trio Muna</a>) and so, instead of settling back into her London flat, Shura boxed up her belongings and relocated across the Atlantic. \u201cI should just call [the record] U-Haul,\u201d she jokes, referring to the stereotype of how quickly lesbians can enter into intense relationships, and move in together within a matter of weeks. \u201cI moved to a different country, a different place. I U-Hauled. I can\u2019t think of anything more lesbian than going to New York for a first date.\u201d</p> <p>While debut Nothing\u2019s Real veiled uncertainty, insecurity and debilitating anxiety inside glimmering, pop-shaped Trojan horses, its successor emits the pure blue warmth of its cover image, despite the turmoil in her new home country. \u201cIt\u2019s been very weird to have America as the backdrop to a love affair,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a queer love story, with the backdrop of the US at its most horrific.\u201d Accordingly, Forevher\u2019s love songs are warped and strange, filled with classic, old-timey melodies. Though Shura doesn\u2019t share the acrobatic strut of some of her biggest influences \u2013 Whitney Houston and Patrice Rushen, to name two \u2013 Forevher leans heavily into soul, her unembellished vocal exposed. \u201cPiano in major sevenths, or traditionally jazzy chords borrowed from soul records \u2013 that\u2019s something I would\u2019ve been allergic to in the past,\u201d she says. \u201cWell, not allergic, but afraid.\u201d</p> <p>In essence, she strove to write a traditional love record, with an ambiguous, queered slant. \u201cTaking a classic image and twisting it,\u201d she says. \u201cSo much of pop is geared towards straight desire that queer fans continually make small, mental adjustments to create space for their experiences in the mainstream. We\u2019re so used to doing that. It\u2019s in our programming.\u201d With Forevher, she wondered whether it was possible to do it the other way around. \u201cWould straight people find it as easy to do the same? I\u2019m guessing probably not. Also, maybe they would?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fb02f9dde9e196f057446952737a9de4d28b0fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fb02f9dde9e196f057446952737a9de4d28b0fe/0_174_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shura at the Coachella music festival, 15 April 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shura at the Coachella music festival, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for Coachella</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/18/shura-forevher-review-religion\">Shura: Forevher review \u2013 airy summer jams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the tide is beginning to turn, thanks to a wave of queer artists pouring into the mainstream. Record labels are eager to associate with queer culture. Though she\u2019s not experienced it, Shura finds herself sceptical of marketing teams seizing on sexuality as a selling point. \u201cIt would be really nice to get to a place where we don\u2019t need to write in a press release, \u2018Queer person does \u2026 \u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to be overtly queer. One of the best things about queer culture is overtness. But I would love more room for incidental queerness.\u201d</p> <p>At her new label, Shura is enjoying the opportunity to ask all of these questions. \u201cMusicians are often reduced to the lowest common denominator in general,\u201d she shrugs.</p> <p>If Nothing\u2019s Real was pegged as an album about \u201cbeing a queer woman in London\u201d, now Shura will be \u201cthe person with fancy hats,\u201d she announces, looking pleased, and referring to her new stage gear \u2013 a wide-brimmed number in Yves Klein blue. \u201cIt was really funny thinking about the amount of times Polydor had told me to dress up, front and centre and be a pop star.\u201d</p> <p>And so, of course, for her first video on an indie label, she\u2019s dressing up in a fancy costume \u2013 lesbian pope, is how she bills it \u2013 \u201cand standing there vaping, pretending to be a pop star,\u201d she laughs. \u201cWell, <em>being</em> a pop star.\u201d She pauses and revises her thought. \u201cI have no expectations.\u201d</p>",

I feel like I\u2019m part of this weird family.\u201d She has recently moved to the States. Why? \u201cBodegas,\u201d she deadpans, referring to those Aladdin\u2019s cave delis you get in New York. \u201cI\u2019m just obsessed. If you went to a newsagent\u2019s here, you\u2019d get maybe a Tropicana, if you\u2019re lucky.\u201d It\u2019s not the whole story: after two years of touring her debut, Shura was exhausted and homesick. Still, before catching a flight home, she made a brief detour to Minneapolis, where she holed up to write new material and drink white Russians. It was here she fired up a dating app and swiped right on her now girlfriend, who lives in New York. \u201cTrump getting elected and the [Chicago] Cubs winning the baseball world series, that was the beginning of my relationship,\u201d she says. Spurred on by long-distance lust, Shura hashed out the vague sketch of lead single Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands on Me) \u2013 a desire-drenched slab of slinky funk. \u201cI started writing the song before we met, which is funny, because it\u2019s my most sexy, physically explicit song,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had never seen each other in 3D!\u201d Thankfully, their meeting went according to plan (new single The Stage is based on their first date at a gig by synthpop trio Muna) and so, instead of settling back into her London flat, Shura boxed up her belongings and relocated across the Atlantic. \u201cI should just call [the record] U-Haul,\u201d she jokes, referring to the stereotype of how quickly lesbians can enter into intense relationships, and move in together within a matter of weeks. \u201cI moved to a different country, a different place. I U-Hauled. I can\u2019t think of anything more lesbian than going to New York for a first date.\u201d While debut Nothing\u2019s Real veiled uncertainty, insecurity and debilitating anxiety inside glimmering, pop-shaped Trojan horses, its successor emits the pure blue warmth of its cover image, despite the turmoil in her new home country. \u201cIt\u2019s been very weird to have America as the backdrop to a love affair,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a queer love story, with the backdrop of the US at its most horrific.\u201d Accordingly, Forevher\u2019s love songs are warped and strange, filled with classic, old-timey melodies. Though Shura doesn\u2019t share the acrobatic strut of some of her biggest influences \u2013 Whitney Houston and Patrice Rushen, to name two \u2013 Forevher leans heavily into soul, her unembellished vocal exposed. \u201cPiano in major sevenths, or traditionally jazzy chords borrowed from soul records \u2013 that\u2019s something I would\u2019ve been allergic to in the past,\u201d she says. \u201cWell, not allergic, but afraid.\u201d In essence, she strove to write a traditional love record, with an ambiguous, queered slant. \u201cTaking a classic image and twisting it,\u201d she says. \u201cSo much of pop is geared towards straight desire that queer fans continually make small, mental adjustments to create space for their experiences in the mainstream. We\u2019re so used to doing that. It\u2019s in our programming.\u201d With Forevher, she wondered whether it was possible to do it the other way around. \u201cWould straight people find it as easy to do the same? I\u2019m guessing probably not. Also, maybe they would?\u201d But the tide is beginning to turn, thanks to a wave of queer artists pouring into the mainstream. Record labels are eager to associate with queer culture. Though she\u2019s not experienced it, Shura finds herself sceptical of marketing teams seizing on sexuality as a selling point. \u201cIt would be really nice to get to a place where we don\u2019t need to write in a press release, \u2018Queer person does \u2026 \u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to be overtly queer. One of the best things about queer culture is overtness. But I would love more room for incidental queerness.\u201d At her new label, Shura is enjoying the opportunity to ask all of these questions. \u201cMusicians are often reduced to the lowest common denominator in general,\u201d she shrugs. If Nothing\u2019s Real was pegged as an album about \u201cbeing a queer woman in London\u201d, now Shura will be \u201cthe person with fancy hats,\u201d she announces, looking pleased, and referring to her new stage gear \u2013 a wide-brimmed number in Yves Klein blue. \u201cIt was really funny thinking about the amount of times Polydor had told me to dress up, front and centre and be a pop star.\u201d And so, of course, for her first video on an indie label, she\u2019s dressing up in a fancy costume \u2013 lesbian pope, is how she bills it \u2013 \u201cand standing there vaping, pretending to be a pop star,\u201d she laughs. \u201cWell, being a pop star.\u201d She pauses and revises her thought. \u201cI have no expectations.\u201d",

There he worked to the very end on the film of which he wryly joked: \u201cThe working title is Will I Live to Finish It?\u201d He did not, but the 12 minutes he produced of Lysistrata \u2013 a subject that had interested him since he was a boy \u2013 stand as his most innovative work. Had he not been an animator, Dick might have been a musician, and played the cornet and flugelhorn regularly with his own group, Dix Six. He described himself musically as \u201cNew York-Dixielander ... whatever you call it.\u201d His marriages to Stephanie Ashforth, Lois Steuart and Margaret French ended in divorce. He is survived by Mo and their children, Natasha and Leif; by Alex and Claire, from his marriage to Lois; and by Timothy and Holly, from his marriage to Margaret. \u2022 Richard Edmund Williams, animator, born 19 March 1933; died 16 August 2019 \u2022 This article was amended on 21 August 2019.

He was a successful professional basketball player, signed by CB Murcia in Spain\u2019s top division, the most respected league outside the NBA. He had worked towards a professional career from the age of 13, leaving home in north London at 16 to attend a private school in Virginia, to which he had won a scholarship. After three years of university \u2013 first in Alabama, then Pennsylvania \u2013 he missed out in the 2014 NBA draft, although Golden State Warriors were initially interested in him. So why did he put himself through a notoriously brutal British reality show?</p> <p>\u201cOn a basic level, it was my brother,\u201d says Soko. \u201cIt was a passing comment. He said: \u2018Ovie, you\u2019d be sick on this show,\u2019 when we were watching it last summer.\u201d But there was also a need to distance himself from the sporting world. \u201cThis was an opportunity to be known outside of basketball and to say I\u2019m more than just my sport.\u201d He had also been seriously injured twice, which had got him thinking about his career prospects, while the death of a friend had made him think more existentially. \u201cA close friend of mine passed away playing basketball. He had a heart attack in practice in Macedonia; he was so far from home. That year, I did a lot of thinking; there was a long time to collect my thoughts and reassess everything.\u201d Knowing this, his zen-like appearance on Love Island makes much more sense.</p> <p>Some observers have claimed that Soko\u2019s success is intertwined with his race (he is British-Nigerian). \u201cIt\u2019s simple, really,\u201d <a href=\"https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/in-the-news/ovie-soko-love-island-4/\" title=\"\">wrote Tobi Rachel Akingbade </a><a href=\"https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/in-the-news/ovie-soko-love-island-4/\" title=\"\">in Grazia</a>. \u201cIt starts with the fact that we only get one Ovie per generation \u2026 black men are rarely presented without a tinge of negativity or damaging hypermasculinity.\u201d Soko is careful and considered when discussing the subject of reality TV and race, and how black people are rarely successful on shows on which the public can vote \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/16/alexandra-burke-and-the-trouble-with-reality-tv-and-race-strictly\" title=\"\">take Alexandra Burke on Strictly</a>. \u201cBeing a young black man is something in life that\u2019s on your mind,\u201d he says, before pausing for a few seconds. \u201cIt\u2019s a weird one. It\u2019s important for young black people to know that they can be themselves and you don\u2019t have to fit into a specific mould to be one on TV.</p> <p>\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I hope it did show, it\u2019s that being you is dope. Being original and being yourself is cool. If you\u2019re one of one, think about how valuable that is. Every single person \u2013 regardless of race, colour, gender \u2013 is one of one. Now that is some valuable shit. Excuse me.\u201d</p> <p>Growing up in Tottenham in a tight family unit of mum, dad and older brother Raymond, Soko believes his worldview was shaped by being exposed to art via his father, who made large-scale mixed-media work in his home studio. \u201cEven from that early age, I saw things differently,\u201d he says. He didn\u2019t do well at school, where he struggled to adapt to rigid ideas around learning. \u201cI was mischievous,\u201d he says. His mum says she gave him the nickname Motorola because he used to talk so much as a child.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a812b1af2396172222aea5f3449b5923099e6dd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a812b1af2396172222aea5f3449b5923099e6dd0/0_0_3771_2121/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ovie Soko on Love Island\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Man of many hats ...

What lines are you talking about? Because the border of the pages could be seen as the lines, but they\u2019d say you were wrong if you did that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/27/lena-dunham-love-island-can-you-love-after-hurt\">Lena Dunham on Love Island: \u2018I'm asking the same question they do \u2013 can you love after hurt?\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is definitely a motivational speaker, a Sesame Street presenter or a YouTube philosopher in Soko, waiting to get out. The conversation we have is littered with nuggets of life advice and aphorisms. On manners: \u201cBeing polite to people shows you think [the other person] has worth, and not being polite, it\u2019s like saying: \u2018You\u2019re beneath me.\u2019\u201d On giving advice: \u201cI don\u2019t give the best advice, but when I\u2019m talking to anyone I\u2019ll give you advice exactly how I see it.\u201d On why reality TV relationships can be sustainable: \u201cIf you want to go over the long run, the news and that aren\u2019t going to be interested when you\u2019re 65 or 70.\u201d</p> <p>Soko\u2019s outlook on life is influenced by a heady mix of seemingly incompatible things. There are his parents and big brother, whom he clearly reveres. The church (\u201cSunday was church day; there was no Sunday football for me\u201d). \u201cDo you know ET, <a href=\"https://etinspires.com/start\" title=\"\">Eric Thomas</a>?\u201d he asks. \u201cThe motivational speaker? He\u2019s huge. I listen to a lot of investors\u2019 podcasts. I listen to a lot of people.\u201d He has also spent hours watching documentaries about people including Conor McGregor, Denzel Washington and Idris Elba. It combines to create a worldview rooted in live and let live, minding your own business and believing in yourself.</p> <p>Soko\u2019s parents have been sitting respectfully in near-total silence throughout the interview, while making their way through a bag of snacks. But now their son wants to settle the score. \u201cMy mum creeps on my Instagram and checks on all my stories,\u201d Soko says, bowed but not broken after the earlier dusting down from his parents. \u201cWhen I got back from dinner with India, Amber and Greg, my mum was like: \u2018I know where you went.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had to check on you,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cJust allow it. If you know, I don\u2019t need to know that you know. I\u2019m 28! My dad lets me do my thing, but my mum \u2026\u201d</p> <p>No motivational speaker in the world is going to be able to help Soko get out of that one.</p>",

Because the border of the pages could be seen as the lines, but they\u2019d say you were wrong if you did that.\u201d There is definitely a motivational speaker, a Sesame Street presenter or a YouTube philosopher in Soko, waiting to get out. The conversation we have is littered with nuggets of life advice and aphorisms. On manners: \u201cBeing polite to people shows you think [the other person] has worth, and not being polite, it\u2019s like saying: \u2018You\u2019re beneath me.\u2019\u201d On giving advice: \u201cI don\u2019t give the best advice, but when I\u2019m talking to anyone I\u2019ll give you advice exactly how I see it.\u201d On why reality TV relationships can be sustainable: \u201cIf you want to go over the long run, the news and that aren\u2019t going to be interested when you\u2019re 65 or 70.\u201d Soko\u2019s outlook on life is influenced by a heady mix of seemingly incompatible things. There are his parents and big brother, whom he clearly reveres. The church (\u201cSunday was church day; there was no Sunday football for me\u201d). \u201cDo you know ET, Eric Thomas?\u201d he asks. \u201cThe motivational speaker? He\u2019s huge. I listen to a lot of investors\u2019 podcasts. I listen to a lot of people.\u201d He has also spent hours watching documentaries about people including Conor McGregor, Denzel Washington and Idris Elba. It combines to create a worldview rooted in live and let live, minding your own business and believing in yourself. Soko\u2019s parents have been sitting respectfully in near-total silence throughout the interview, while making their way through a bag of snacks. But now their son wants to settle the score. \u201cMy mum creeps on my Instagram and checks on all my stories,\u201d Soko says, bowed but not broken after the earlier dusting down from his parents. \u201cWhen I got back from dinner with India, Amber and Greg, my mum was like: \u2018I know where you went.\u2019\u201d \u201cI had to check on you,\u201d she says. \u201cJust allow it. If you know, I don\u2019t need to know that you know. I\u2019m 28! My dad lets me do my thing, but my mum \u2026\u201d No motivational speaker in the world is going to be able to help Soko get out of that one.",

It has written to its suppliers to ask them to accept 3% less on the price of their clothes and accessories from 1 September, indicating it is still looking to cut costs to improve profitability.

      "body": "<p>Hundreds of asylum seekers have been crammed into a network of \u201cguest houses\u201d provided by a Home Office contractor that are overrun by cockroaches, rats and mice, the Guardian has learned.</p> \n<p>Lawyers shown footage recorded by the Guardian \u2013 which reveals that families of four are sharing small double beds and are being crammed into spaces so small that they are barely able to walk around their rooms \u2013 said that the conditions could constitute statutory overcrowding and an environment unfit for human habitation.</p> \n<p>One lawyer branded the conditions \u201cdepraved\u201d and accused the home secretary, Priti Patel, of being \u201cslum landlord in chief\u201d.</p> \n<p>The buildings of the Maharaja Guest House in Southall, west London, are infested with tens of thousands of cockroaches, which feed on the residents\u2019 food. In one of the kitchens seen by the Guardian, more than 100 cockroaches scattered when just one cupboard was opened.</p> \n<p>The managers, <a href=\"http://www.mylondonlets.co.uk/\">Mylondonlets.co.uk</a>, advertise rooms priced from \u00a340 per night. The company is paid by the Home Office\u2019s accommodation contractor for Wales and the south of England, Clearsprings Ready Homes, to house asylum seekers. The MyLondonLets website says it is \u201cworking in partnership\u201d with a number of councils including Ealing, where the properties seen by the Guardian are located.</p> \n<p>The website appeals for new properties and states: \u201cHMOs (houses in multiple occupation) are far more profitable to run than other types of residential lettings with rental incomes often two to three times those of single households.\u201d</p> \n<p>But that profitability appears to come at a cost. Residents of the four buildings that constitute the Maharaja Guest House interviewed by the Guardian say that rats gnaw through the plastic of bottles of cooking oil to drink the oil, while mothers reported infestations of mice and say that large rats run up their children\u2019s legs and walk across their faces while they sleep.</p> \n<p>It is understood that there have been recurring issues with the property. The buildings were inspected earlier this year by UK visas and immigration (UKVI). Infestations were found but it was claimed that they had been cleared.</p> \n<p>Ealing council said on Wednesday that it would be organising new inspections as soon as possible.</p> \n<p>One mother of two said: \u201cWe are just breathing here, we are not living. The beds are not just where we sleep but our living room, our dining area, our laundry drying area and the study area for our children.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of asylum seekers have been crammed into a network of \u201cguest houses\u201d provided by a Home Office contractor that are overrun by cockroaches, rats and mice, the Guardian has learned. Lawyers shown footage recorded by the Guardian \u2013 which reveals that families of four are sharing small double beds and are being crammed into spaces so small that they are barely able to walk around their rooms \u2013 said that the conditions could constitute statutory overcrowding and an environment unfit for human habitation. One lawyer branded the conditions \u201cdepraved\u201d and accused the home secretary, Priti Patel, of being \u201cslum landlord in chief\u201d. The buildings of the Maharaja Guest House in Southall, west London, are infested with tens of thousands of cockroaches, which feed on the residents\u2019 food. In one of the kitchens seen by the Guardian, more than 100 cockroaches scattered when just one cupboard was opened. The managers, Mylondonlets.co.uk, advertise rooms priced from \u00a340 per night. The company is paid by the Home Office\u2019s accommodation contractor for Wales and the south of England, Clearsprings Ready Homes, to house asylum seekers. The MyLondonLets website says it is \u201cworking in partnership\u201d with a number of councils including Ealing, where the properties seen by the Guardian are located. The website appeals for new properties and states: \u201cHMOs (houses in multiple occupation) are far more profitable to run than other types of residential lettings with rental incomes often two to three times those of single households.\u201d But that profitability appears to come at a cost. Residents of the four buildings that constitute the Maharaja Guest House interviewed by the Guardian say that rats gnaw through the plastic of bottles of cooking oil to drink the oil, while mothers reported infestations of mice and say that large rats run up their children\u2019s legs and walk across their faces while they sleep. It is understood that there have been recurring issues with the property. The buildings were inspected earlier this year by UK visas and immigration (UKVI). Infestations were found but it was claimed that they had been cleared. Ealing council said on Wednesday that it would be organising new inspections as soon as possible. One mother of two said: \u201cWe are just breathing here, we are not living. The beds are not just where we sleep but our living room, our dining area, our laundry drying area and the study area for our children. The springs on the mattresses are oozing and they are full of bugs. The bed has become our whole world.\u201d She said that the accommodation providers expected her two children, a girl and a boy, aged eight and nine, to share a bed. \u201cI think the Home Office encourages this type of thing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all part of the hostile environment. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re sending a message to us saying: \u2018if you can\u2019t take it here go home\u2019.\u201d The rooms seen by the Guardian are so overcrowded that typically an entire family\u2019s living space is all but taken up by a double bed that they share. There is just one washing machine for hundreds of asylum seekers. A notice in the kitchen threatens anyone who leaves unwashed dishes in the sink with eviction. In some parts of the building up to 10 residents are expected to share one small bathroom. Outside the property, piles of rubbish constituting a fire risk are stacked up behind a gate. Conditions at the Maharaja Guest House have come to light at a time when the Home Office is implementing new accommodation contracts following criticism of previous arrangements.

The Home Office is legally obliged to provide accommodation for destitute asylum seekers \u2013 most fall into this category.

That gives a very different sense of what\u2019s happening in the art world, especially when you compare it with the new, more formal galleries opening up.\u201d Bunting\u2019s parents, Karen and Peter, are both artists and moved into Beck Road in the late 70s under Acme, a housing-for-artists scheme. Back then, Hackney was full of empty houses. Today, the front room gallery is in an area that is way out of the average artist\u2019s rent range, a reminder of how important giving affordable space to artists really is. The cost of space is a reason these galleries exist, but it isn\u2019t the only one. Orme set up Flat38 in her two-bedroom duplex so she could find a community of artists and art lovers. \u201cIt just felt like the right thing to do,\u201d she says, \u201cto invite them into my home, rather than into another space that none of us had a relationship with.\u201d Her most ambitious exhibition so far was Merz, an installation of large paper sculptures by Samuel Keyte that were hung throughout the flat. During the opening, Orme used her bedroom as a bar. Going against the grain of the traditional white cube gallery space is another appeal. Unlike the plain-walled behemoths of the art world, these galleries are maintained by people who are working full-time and have their own art practice, too. \u201cI\u2019m really interested in what a domestic space can be,\u201d says Atacus. \u201cIt is kind of a threshold, neither art setting nor domestic setting. We need spaces where we can have conversations. There is this need, we all feel, to take exhibiting into our own hands.\u201d",

For two years no one knew what she was going through, despite her aggressive outbursts at school, until she slumped into depression and came to the attention of the local child and adolescent mental health services.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/26/crisis-young-carers-uk-child-schools-end-secrecy-stigma\">The crisis of young carers: \u2018Going to school is a break\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What stopped her taking her own life, she says, was her involvement in a drama project based at the Lowry arts centre in Salford in which her desperate experiences as a carer \u2013 and those of three other teenagers \u2013 were crafted into a searing piece of politically driven theatre called Who Cares, which is now playing at the Edinburgh festival.</p> <p>Who Cares aims to raise awareness of the plight of <a href=\"https://carers.org/news-item/young-carers-risk-not-fulfilling-their-dreams-and-ambitions-new-figures-show-young-carers\" title=\"\">the UK\u2019s estimated 700,000 youngsters under 17 providing unpaid care for family</a><a href=\"https://carers.org/news-item/young-carers-risk-not-fulfilling-their-dreams-and-ambitions-new-figures-show-young-carers\" title=\"\">.</a></p> <p>\u201cBeing involved in Who Cares was a way of opening the bottle and releasing my emotions \u2013 but also knowing I was helping other young carers,\u201d says Kerry. \u201cI\u2019m proud of it and the impact it\u2019s had.\u201d</p> <p>Since the play premiered at the Lowry in November 2016, it has been on tour twice \u2013 in schools and youth clubs in 2017, and this year in theatres \u2013 culminating in Edinburgh, and has led to 28 hidden young carers being identified and linked into support services. It has reached over 3,000 children and was performed at the House of Lords where young carers directly lobbied politicians for change.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We know that in Salford there is good support, but down the street in a different postcode there are no services at all</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The play has also spawned a recently launched <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/268610\" title=\"\">petition</a> demanding that councils are given a statutory responsibility to assess the needs of young carers, and that schools be required by Ofsted to include young carers under their definition of vulnerable young people. It also calls for the introduction of a young carers\u2019 identification card.</p> <p>Paige, now 26, whose experience of being a teenage carer is reflected in the Who Cares project, says: \u201cWe want parliament to recognise that young people can be carers and there\u2019s no age limit. We know that in Salford there is good support, but down the street in a different postcode there are no services at all.\u201d</p> <p>Since 2003, Paige has looked after both her father, who is in a wheelchair and traumatised following a traffic accident, and her profoundly deaf brother. From the age of 16 she did it alone, when her mother left home unable to cope. Who Cares was her lifeline, particularly when caring duties forced her to quit her law degree.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very isolating being a young carer, because your priorities are not the same as other people your age. At secondary school I tried to hide my situation because I wanted to be like everyone else, but in the end I couldn\u2019t,\u201d says Paige who now works as an engagement coordinator at the Lowry. </p> <p>When it set up a creative project eight years ago in partnership with <a href=\"https://whocarestour.org.uk/salford-young-carers-service\" title=\"\">Salford</a><a href=\"https://whocarestour.org.uk/salford-young-carers-service\" title=\"\"> Young Carer</a><a href=\"https://whocarestour.org.uk/salford-young-carers-service\" title=\"\">s Service</a>, the Lowry\u2019s initial motivation was to provide an honest platform for young carers. Out of this emerged the idea of commissioning Lung theatre company to make a piece of theatre to identify hidden carers and signpost them to support.</p> <p>The Lowry\u2019s director of learning and engagement, Lynsey O\u2019Sullivan, says: \u201cThis is theatre for social change. The arts are special in allowing children to be seen, to be heard and to make change.\u201d</p> <p>Kerry and Paige, along with Antonia Rae, then aged 12, and Ciaron, then 18, were interviewed by Lung\u2019s director and writer Matt Woodhead and his team every few weeks over two years, yielding 200 hours of material from which to create the three central characters, Nicole, Connor and Jade. The youngsters also helped select the professional actors to play them.</p> <p>Seeing themselves portrayed by actors was both painful and exhilarating, says Paige. \u201cIt\u2019s shiny, it\u2019s exciting and it\u2019s true, but it\u2019s a difficult story to play and I would not have been able to get up on a stage and tell it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb5499fb2dd99f104d5c4205a04a4fa4dada8cd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb5499fb2dd99f104d5c4205a04a4fa4dada8cd5/0_19_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Who Cares being performed at the 2019 Edinburgh festival\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A performance of Who Cares at the Edinburgh festival.

      "bodyText": "Trapped between the demands of school and caring for her stepfather and mother with mental health issues, Salford teenager Kerry was several times pushed to the point of suicide. From the age of 11, Kerry\u2019s weekdays were dominated by a flurry of early morning cooking, cleaning and organisation of medication, before leaving for school \u2013 only to return to more of the same, plus regular battles to fill in benefit and mortgage forms that she didn\u2019t understand. For two years no one knew what she was going through, despite her aggressive outbursts at school, until she slumped into depression and came to the attention of the local child and adolescent mental health services. What stopped her taking her own life, she says, was her involvement in a drama project based at the Lowry arts centre in Salford in which her desperate experiences as a carer \u2013 and those of three other teenagers \u2013 were crafted into a searing piece of politically driven theatre called Who Cares, which is now playing at the Edinburgh festival. Who Cares aims to raise awareness of the plight of the UK\u2019s estimated 700,000 youngsters under 17 providing unpaid care for family. \u201cBeing involved in Who Cares was a way of opening the bottle and releasing my emotions \u2013 but also knowing I was helping other young carers,\u201d says Kerry. \u201cI\u2019m proud of it and the impact it\u2019s had.\u201d Since the play premiered at the Lowry in November 2016, it has been on tour twice \u2013 in schools and youth clubs in 2017, and this year in theatres \u2013 culminating in Edinburgh, and has led to 28 hidden young carers being identified and linked into support services. It has reached over 3,000 children and was performed at the House of Lords where young carers directly lobbied politicians for change. The play has also spawned a recently launched petition demanding that councils are given a statutory responsibility to assess the needs of young carers, and that schools be required by Ofsted to include young carers under their definition of vulnerable young people. It also calls for the introduction of a young carers\u2019 identification card. Paige, now 26, whose experience of being a teenage carer is reflected in the Who Cares project, says: \u201cWe want parliament to recognise that young people can be carers and there\u2019s no age limit. We know that in Salford there is good support, but down the street in a different postcode there are no services at all.\u201d Since 2003, Paige has looked after both her father, who is in a wheelchair and traumatised following a traffic accident, and her profoundly deaf brother. From the age of 16 she did it alone, when her mother left home unable to cope. Who Cares was her lifeline, particularly when caring duties forced her to quit her law degree. \u201cIt\u2019s very isolating being a young carer, because your priorities are not the same as other people your age. At secondary school I tried to hide my situation because I wanted to be like everyone else, but in the end I couldn\u2019t,\u201d says Paige who now works as an engagement coordinator at the Lowry. When it set up a creative project eight years ago in partnership with Salford Young Carers Service, the Lowry\u2019s initial motivation was to provide an honest platform for young carers. Out of this emerged the idea of commissioning Lung theatre company to make a piece of theatre to identify hidden carers and signpost them to support. The Lowry\u2019s director of learning and engagement, Lynsey O\u2019Sullivan, says: \u201cThis is theatre for social change. The arts are special in allowing children to be seen, to be heard and to make change.\u201d Kerry and Paige, along with Antonia Rae, then aged 12, and Ciaron, then 18, were interviewed by Lung\u2019s director and writer Matt Woodhead and his team every few weeks over two years, yielding 200 hours of material from which to create the three central characters, Nicole, Connor and Jade. The youngsters also helped select the professional actors to play them. Seeing themselves portrayed by actors was both painful and exhilarating, says Paige. \u201cIt\u2019s shiny, it\u2019s exciting and it\u2019s true, but it\u2019s a difficult story to play and I would not have been able to get up on a stage and tell it.\u201d It does not make easy watching either, from the moment a school bell rings and the audience is plunged from a Salford school bus dogged by Pok\u00e9mon and fights, to Nicole\u2019s bleak description of her mother\u2019s attempted suicide. Woodhead admits: \u201cThis is a difficult piece of theatre to watch, because you are hearing the powerful voices of the young people. This is a story about the nation.\u201d The play has had rave reviews in Edinburgh. The Stage gave it four stars, calling it \u201csuperb ... emotive, documentary theatre\u201d. The Scotsman also gave it four stars and called it \u201can eye-opening and impactful look at the isolated lives of young carers\u201d. The Guardian also awarded the play four stars and described it as \u201cbrutal but beautifully done, this emotionally raw and theatrically slick verbatim play lays blame on austerity for the agony and overwhelming loneliness young carers are exposed to\u201d. The first time Who Cares toured the UK it went with a backup team to support youngsters affected by the performance. Terrifying stories emerged, such as the 13-year-old girl in Carlisle toileting and bathing her mother for six years unknown to her school, and the five-year-old in Salford administering medication to his sister at night, when his father worked. The Edinburgh fringe marks the end of the run for Who Cares. Audience members will be provided with wristbands giving details of how to access support.

      "bodyText": "Presumably, these days, there is some sort of support group for those who have become overnight internet sensations. Somewhere someone who accidentally invented a new dance move, or tasered their own foot, can go for advice, solace, group counselling. A closed Facebook group where Fenton\u2019s owner or Hot Mugshot Guy warn newcomers of the things no viral superstar realises \u2013 for instance, that life might get unexpectedly expensive. Romania\u2019s cricketer extraordinaire, Pavel Florin, has learned the hard way. Standing in the President\u2019s Box at the Lord\u2019s Ashes Test this weekend, as a cluster of surrounding dignitaries were topped up with champagne, his shoes shone with fresh-from-the-box lustre. When he left his home city of Cluj-Napoca, he hadn\u2019t expected to be invited to the zenith of cricket\u2019s social season. He certainly hadn\u2019t packed for it. \u201cIt was only one day ago I heard I would be coming here,\u201d says Florin, decked in a petrol blue jacket. \u201cI\u2019m a sportsman, I don\u2019t usually wear these clothes. So I needed to buy them!\u201d He looks down at the Prince of Wales check on his new trousers. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if they work.\u201d They do. Florin looks distinctly natty against an assembly of cream linen and egg-and-bacon. It\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s less than three weeks since the world first discovered Florin, when the European Cricket League shot him to insta-fame. But then Florin went from infamy \u2013 \u201ccheck out this Romanian guy\u2019s bowling!\u201d \u2013 to international treasure \u2013 \u201ccheck out this Romanian guy, he\u2019s bowling!\u201d \u2013 in the space of a couple of overs.

On the other hand, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnKX5oJWPgI\">Red Rum would only have been third</a> in the 1977 Grand National and few of us would want to rewrite that particular piece of form.</p> \n<h2>Tuesday\u2019s best bets</h2> \n<p>To Brighton, where hopefully Georgia Dobie will remain firmly atop <strong>Tin Hat (2.40)</strong> in the sprint handicap for which they are being underestimated at 6-1. Trained by Eve Johnson Houghton, Tin Hat has responded well to the fitting of cheekpieces and made it two out of two at this track 11 days ago.</p> \n<p>The winning margin was only a neck but they were nicely clear of a veteran course specialist in third and Tin Hat is still 12lb below the mark he had at this time last year. I think the chestnut will go well again.</p> \n<p>There\u2019s also 6-1 about <strong>Harlequin Rose (4.40)</strong> in the apprentice race at the end of the card. She got her second win at this idiosyncratic track last month, when today\u2019s rider, the promising William Carver, was aboard. Dropped a furlong, she met a lot of trouble in running here a fortnight ago and I\u2019m putting a line through that.</p> \n<p><strong>Lady Mascara (4.10) </strong>should make up into a decent animal and her Sandown third is the best form on offer in a maiden handicap. If you can bear to bet on such a race, the 2-1 looks fair.</p> \n<p>There\u2019s been an early move for <strong>Doctor Look Here (7.05)</strong>, now 9-4 from 4-1 for a handicap hurdle at Newton Abbot. A Sue and Lucy Gardner production, he dropped 12lb for three runs over too short a trip before winning tidily here last month and can probably do it again.</p> \n<p>I napped Magical Rhythms at Kempton on the basis of the promise she showed last time but she seems worryingly weak in the market for this novice contest.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6a615677-2113-4d5a-a208-ebd4316c5812\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Brighton</b>&nbsp;<br><b>1.40 </b>Big Time Maybe <b>2.10</b> Laikaparty <b>2.40</b> Tin Hat <b>3.10 </b>So Macho<b> 3.40</b> Paddy&nbsp;The Chef <b>4.10</b> Lady Mascara<b> 4.40</b> Harlequin Rose<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Kempton</b>&nbsp;<br><b>2.00</b> Pearl Stream <b>2.30</b> Overpriced Mixer <b>3.00</b> Loving Glance <b>3.30</b> Magical&nbsp;Rhythms (nap) <b>4.00</b> Toro Dorado <b>4.30 </b>Chica De La Noche<b> 5.05 </b>Typhoon Ten <b>5.40</b>&nbsp;Wanaasah<br><br><b>Yarmouth</b>&nbsp;<br><b>4.55</b> Simba Samba <b>5.25</b> Pocket Square<b> 5.55</b> Knowing <b>6.25</b> Contrast <b>6.55</b> Capla&nbsp;Berry <b>7.25</b> Queen Of Burgundy <b>7.55</b> Agent Of Fortune<br><br><b>Newton Abbot&nbsp;</b><br><b>5.35</b> Emerald Rocket <b>6.05</b> Triple Chief <b>6.35</b> Empreinte Reconce <b>7.05</b> Doctor&nbsp;Look Here (nb) <b>7.35</b> Bermeo <b>8.05</b> False Getaway</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

On the other hand, Red Rum would only have been third in the 1977 Grand National and few of us would want to rewrite that particular piece of form. Tuesday\u2019s best bets To Brighton, where hopefully Georgia Dobie will remain firmly atop Tin Hat (2.40) in the sprint handicap for which they are being underestimated at 6-1. Trained by Eve Johnson Houghton, Tin Hat has responded well to the fitting of cheekpieces and made it two out of two at this track 11 days ago. The winning margin was only a neck but they were nicely clear of a veteran course specialist in third and Tin Hat is still 12lb below the mark he had at this time last year. I think the chestnut will go well again. There\u2019s also 6-1 about Harlequin Rose (4.40) in the apprentice race at the end of the card. She got her second win at this idiosyncratic track last month, when today\u2019s rider, the promising William Carver, was aboard. Dropped a furlong, she met a lot of trouble in running here a fortnight ago and I\u2019m putting a line through that. Lady Mascara (4.10) should make up into a decent animal and her Sandown third is the best form on offer in a maiden handicap. If you can bear to bet on such a race, the 2-1 looks fair. There\u2019s been an early move for Doctor Look Here (7.05), now 9-4 from 4-1 for a handicap hurdle at Newton Abbot. A Sue and Lucy Gardner production, he dropped 12lb for three runs over too short a trip before winning tidily here last month and can probably do it again. I napped Magical Rhythms at Kempton on the basis of the promise she showed last time but she seems worryingly weak in the market for this novice contest.",

After they married, they moved to the UK with Arnesa\u2019s daughter. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant to be a big statement,\u201d Adam says. \u201cMarriage as an institution is so old-fashioned, but it was a necessity for us \u2013 we at least thought we would modernise it somewhat by me taking Arnesa\u2019s name.

If anything, I understand my wife\u2019s lived experience much better.\u201d</p> <p>For some men, the decision to take their wife\u2019s name begins as an aesthetic one. \u201cShaw sounded so much cooler than my then name, Morley,\u201d says Charlie Shaw. \u201cMy wife, Jade, and I felt the whole tradition of her taking on my name was antiquated, so we wanted to make a stand against that.\u201d Yet, in taking on his wife\u2019s name, Charlie ended up discovering more about his own family identity. \u201cMy grandfather actually did the same thing \u2013 Morley was his wife\u2019s name, and he took it because he was Greek and at the time, just after the second world war, there was prejudice against Greeks because Greece was Nazi-occupied,\u201d he says. This prompted Charlie to take a DNA test and trace his Greek heritage \u2013 the Aspioti family. \u201cI discovered a whole branch of my dad\u2019s side who we didn\u2019t know existed. It led to a big opening up to my familial lineage and tracing back to my great-great-great-grandfather who was a knife thrower \u2013 said to be the best in Europe,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has been really great for my dad since his died when he was a baby, so somehow taking on my wife\u2019s name has revealed so much of his family to him.\u201d</p> <p>What is clear is that for these men, the decision to take on their wives\u2019 names is more nuanced than just protesting against patriarchal systems or responding to their wife\u2019s choice to keep her own name \u2013 albeit one from her father. \u201cPeople get roped into traditions that don\u2019t always make much sense,\u201d Mark says. \u201cWhen the priest announced us at the end of our wedding as Mr and Mrs Cashion, people gasped and thought he had made a terrible mistake. Now, there is a lot more tolerance and understanding of the fact that people should be free to make their own decisions.\u201d Arnesa adds: \u201cWomen should do what they feel is best for them. If you want to take your husband\u2019s name, that\u2019s fine, but so is him taking yours or both of you choosing different ones. People make it out to be this hugely important thing when really it\u2019s just a name; it\u2019s what you do with it and how you give it meaning that truly matters.\u201d</p>",

After they married, they moved to the UK with Arnesa\u2019s daughter. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant to be a big statement,\u201d Adam says. \u201cMarriage as an institution is so old-fashioned, but it was a necessity for us \u2013 we at least thought we would modernise it somewhat by me taking Arnesa\u2019s name. She is from Bosnia and has strong ties there, so I wanted to take the same name as her and her daughter to make us more of a family unit.\u201d Kustura is, in fact, Arnesa\u2019s stepfather\u2019s name; one she adopted in her early 20s. \u201cHe shaped my childhood and my persona in many ways,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen Adam decided to take it, it brought things full circle because he chose it and I chose it, and with it we have been able to forge our own familial identity.\u201d There has also been the unexpected consequence of Adam exchanging his British-sounding birth name \u2013 Cross \u2013 for the Bosnian one of Kustura, in that people have begun to ask him the eternal immigrant question: \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d \u201cThat has been a funny thing, encountering that confusion where people can no longer place me,\u201d he says. \u201cI have to spell the name out now, too, but apart from that, nothing has really changed. If anything, I understand my wife\u2019s lived experience much better.\u201d For some men, the decision to take their wife\u2019s name begins as an aesthetic one. \u201cShaw sounded so much cooler than my then name, Morley,\u201d says Charlie Shaw. \u201cMy wife, Jade, and I felt the whole tradition of her taking on my name was antiquated, so we wanted to make a stand against that.\u201d Yet, in taking on his wife\u2019s name, Charlie ended up discovering more about his own family identity. \u201cMy grandfather actually did the same thing \u2013 Morley was his wife\u2019s name, and he took it because he was Greek and at the time, just after the second world war, there was prejudice against Greeks because Greece was Nazi-occupied,\u201d he says. This prompted Charlie to take a DNA test and trace his Greek heritage \u2013 the Aspioti family. \u201cI discovered a whole branch of my dad\u2019s side who we didn\u2019t know existed. It led to a big opening up to my familial lineage and tracing back to my great-great-great-grandfather who was a knife thrower \u2013 said to be the best in Europe,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has been really great for my dad since his died when he was a baby, so somehow taking on my wife\u2019s name has revealed so much of his family to him.\u201d What is clear is that for these men, the decision to take on their wives\u2019 names is more nuanced than just protesting against patriarchal systems or responding to their wife\u2019s choice to keep her own name \u2013 albeit one from her father. \u201cPeople get roped into traditions that don\u2019t always make much sense,\u201d Mark says. \u201cWhen the priest announced us at the end of our wedding as Mr and Mrs Cashion, people gasped and thought he had made a terrible mistake. Now, there is a lot more tolerance and understanding of the fact that people should be free to make their own decisions.\u201d Arnesa adds: \u201cWomen should do what they feel is best for them. If you want to take your husband\u2019s name, that\u2019s fine, but so is him taking yours or both of you choosing different ones. People make it out to be this hugely important thing when really it\u2019s just a name; it\u2019s what you do with it and how you give it meaning that truly matters.\u201d",

As <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/08/the-lion-king-box-office-animation-record\">Disney\u2019s highest-grossing animated movie of all time</a>, it could have been a real opportunity to talk about the tragic experience the audience shares with the lions: the unprecedented, rapid destruction of earth. In this sense, the movie remained overly faithful to the original script.</p> <p>I\u2019m not asking for a radical rewrite \u2013 just for say, Zazu, the chatty, perennially anxious red-billed hornbill, to have nodded to climate change just once. For example, when Zazu announced, \u201cThe Pride Lands are in imminent danger,\u201d he could have added why.</p> <p>Such a small acknowledgment would have given The Lion King \u2013 a story of ecological loss due to the abuse of power \u2013 more space to resonate with our current moment.</p> <p>To the movie\u2019s credit, the destruction of the Pride Lands is not a natural process, but is rooted in a pattern of overconsumption and the unequal distribution of resources. This pattern is set in motion by Scar, the evil, authoritarian lion king, who rules according to a vow made to the hyenas: \u201cEverything the light touches is yours for the kill.\u201d It\u2019s a drastically different vision from that of the previous lion king, Mufasa, who believed that \u201ceverything the light touches is yours to protect\u201d.</p> <p>It is Scar\u2019s vision of the earth \u2013 as something to consume rather than protect \u2013 that turns the Pride Lands to desert.</p> <p>The Lion King is an opportunity to ask ourselves how we can all better protect everything the light touches. It\u2019s an opportunity to acknowledge the ways that reckless capitalism and climate change are fundamentally entwined. It\u2019s an opportunity to think more closely about our land use and consumption patterns \u2013 major drivers of climate change, as a recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/srccl/\">report</a> lays out.</p> <p>The Lion King also stands to be a lesson in retaining hope, even when everything appears on the path of irreversible doom. When Simba bemoans his inability to change the past, Timon, the optimistic meerkat, chimes in, \u201cBut you know what you can change? The future.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s this hopeful line of questioning \u2013 of exactly how to change the future, of how to restore the viability of the earth \u2013 that couldn\u2019t be more important for everyone today to ask. Yet the new movie falls short of even approaching an answer. Simba could have spent more time grappling with the questions we are dealing with today, before the rain falls and the Pride Lands are restored.</p> <ul> <li><p>Greta Moran is a Queens-based journalist focusing on public health and the climate crisis</p></li> </ul>",

This is in part due to the unnervingly realistic 3D animation, intended to capture the \u201cspectacle of a BBC wildlife documentary\u201d. But it is also because this kind of loss is all too familiar to an audience witnessing the earth hurtle towards a climate breakdown. Yet the climate crisis goes unacknowledged in the reboot. As Disney\u2019s highest-grossing animated movie of all time, it could have been a real opportunity to talk about the tragic experience the audience shares with the lions: the unprecedented, rapid destruction of earth. In this sense, the movie remained overly faithful to the original script. I\u2019m not asking for a radical rewrite \u2013 just for say, Zazu, the chatty, perennially anxious red-billed hornbill, to have nodded to climate change just once. For example, when Zazu announced, \u201cThe Pride Lands are in imminent danger,\u201d he could have added why. Such a small acknowledgment would have given The Lion King \u2013 a story of ecological loss due to the abuse of power \u2013 more space to resonate with our current moment. To the movie\u2019s credit, the destruction of the Pride Lands is not a natural process, but is rooted in a pattern of overconsumption and the unequal distribution of resources. This pattern is set in motion by Scar, the evil, authoritarian lion king, who rules according to a vow made to the hyenas: \u201cEverything the light touches is yours for the kill.\u201d It\u2019s a drastically different vision from that of the previous lion king, Mufasa, who believed that \u201ceverything the light touches is yours to protect\u201d. It is Scar\u2019s vision of the earth \u2013 as something to consume rather than protect \u2013 that turns the Pride Lands to desert. The Lion King is an opportunity to ask ourselves how we can all better protect everything the light touches. It\u2019s an opportunity to acknowledge the ways that reckless capitalism and climate change are fundamentally entwined. It\u2019s an opportunity to think more closely about our land use and consumption patterns \u2013 major drivers of climate change, as a recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report lays out. The Lion King also stands to be a lesson in retaining hope, even when everything appears on the path of irreversible doom. When Simba bemoans his inability to change the past, Timon, the optimistic meerkat, chimes in, \u201cBut you know what you can change? The future.\u201d It\u2019s this hopeful line of questioning \u2013 of exactly how to change the future, of how to restore the viability of the earth \u2013 that couldn\u2019t be more important for everyone today to ask. Yet the new movie falls short of even approaching an answer. Simba could have spent more time grappling with the questions we are dealing with today, before the rain falls and the Pride Lands are restored.

      "body": "<h2>The parade</h2> \n<p>This is the beating heart of Notting Hill Carnival (NHC) and it\u2019s responsible for pumping a steady flow of colour, feathers and good vibes across W10 and W11 over the August bank holiday. The parade \u2013 set to the infectious sounds of soca \u2013 is arguably the star of the weekend.</p> \n<p>Sunday is \u201cfamily day\u201d and the bands on the road are predominantly for children. Beverly Tony, adjudicator for NHC, says: \u201cIt\u2019s really wonderful to see the children and what they produce. They work on their costumes all year and now they get to show you their creativity.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a1ab66669b42d61f99d3278b62b737cdc040c4ec\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1ab66669b42d61f99d3278b62b737cdc040c4ec/0_0_2636_3724/708.jpg\" alt=\"Carnival, 2012\" width=\"708\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Into the waves \u2026 Carnival in 2012.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: lovemax/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Sunday also sees adults playing \u201cdirty mas\u201d, the equivalent of Trinidad\u2019s J\u2019ouvert, where they throw paint or chocolate and dance the whole route. \u201cIt\u2019s a great stress-relieving day,\u201d says Tony. \u201cThen on Monday you wear your costume (pretty mas), and it\u2019s about expressing yourself. You feel total freedom on the road \u2013 how often do you get to do that? It\u2019s a wonderful sight.\u201d</p> \n<p>And you can expect to see thousands of people in costume. Over the weekend more than 70 groups will take to the streets to \u201cplay mas\u201d (take part in the parade). Every group has its own theme and tells a story with their costumes. Lustrous designs march en masse through the borough, each one handmade. (It\u2019s estimated they take a total of 1m hours to make.)</p> \n<p>Ray Mahabir, artistic director of the band Sunshine International Art, says he is obsessed by the costumes. Sunshine is one of a few bands who still manage to bring large costumes to Carnival: at 12-15ft high, these often require extensions and wheels to assist the wearer. Also adding to the spectacle are the elaborately decorated floats carrying teams of people in equally vibrant outfits \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.paraisosamba.co.uk/\">Para\u00edso</a> School of Samba, the winner of last year\u2019s decorated truck category, is one to watch out for.</p> \n<p>This competitive side to the revelry happens by Westbourne Park tube station, where judges score all of the bands as they pass through. This makes it a great spot to catch the parade: either waiting just before the judging point for a slightly quieter viewing spot, or on the stretch afterwards, when the bands are in full swing.</p> \n<p>Ask any regular Carnival-goer the best way to catch the parade and they will be divided in to three camps. You\u2019ve got the \u201clet the parade come to you\u201d approach. To help you pick the right spot, Linett Kamala, an artist and Notting Hill Carnival trustee, says: \u201cArrive early, well before the crowds, to walk around the Carnival footprint.\u201d (The parade starts at about 10.30am on both days.) As well as soaking up the anticipation, \u201cuse this time to locate the nearest toilets\u201d, she says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"04148b58-1cad-4356-aabb-446477311173\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D9hPWioAl1k?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Next, there are the \u201cwalkers\u201d who weave through the parade route via side streets, jumping in with different bands and maybe a soundsystem or two along the way. Finally, there are those who swear the best way to see it is to be it. Melissa Simon-Hartman, an artist and costume designer, says: \u201cTake part! Nothing beats the experience of wearing a costume and participating in a Carnival band. It is safe, fun, and you instantly become part of a new family.\u201d <em>Maxine-Laurie Marshall</em></p> \n<h2>The music: soundsystems, samba, steel bands and more</h2> \n<p>Carnival is a sensory overload, but your ears arguably get it the most.

      "bodyText": "The parade This is the beating heart of Notting Hill Carnival (NHC) and it\u2019s responsible for pumping a steady flow of colour, feathers and good vibes across W10 and W11 over the August bank holiday. The parade \u2013 set to the infectious sounds of soca \u2013 is arguably the star of the weekend. Sunday is \u201cfamily day\u201d and the bands on the road are predominantly for children. Beverly Tony, adjudicator for NHC, says: \u201cIt\u2019s really wonderful to see the children and what they produce. They work on their costumes all year and now they get to show you their creativity.\u201d Sunday also sees adults playing \u201cdirty mas\u201d, the equivalent of Trinidad\u2019s J\u2019ouvert, where they throw paint or chocolate and dance the whole route. \u201cIt\u2019s a great stress-relieving day,\u201d says Tony. \u201cThen on Monday you wear your costume (pretty mas), and it\u2019s about expressing yourself. You feel total freedom on the road \u2013 how often do you get to do that? It\u2019s a wonderful sight.\u201d And you can expect to see thousands of people in costume. Over the weekend more than 70 groups will take to the streets to \u201cplay mas\u201d (take part in the parade). Every group has its own theme and tells a story with their costumes. Lustrous designs march en masse through the borough, each one handmade. (It\u2019s estimated they take a total of 1m hours to make.) Ray Mahabir, artistic director of the band Sunshine International Art, says he is obsessed by the costumes. Sunshine is one of a few bands who still manage to bring large costumes to Carnival: at 12-15ft high, these often require extensions and wheels to assist the wearer. Also adding to the spectacle are the elaborately decorated floats carrying teams of people in equally vibrant outfits \u2013 Para\u00edso School of Samba, the winner of last year\u2019s decorated truck category, is one to watch out for. This competitive side to the revelry happens by Westbourne Park tube station, where judges score all of the bands as they pass through. This makes it a great spot to catch the parade: either waiting just before the judging point for a slightly quieter viewing spot, or on the stretch afterwards, when the bands are in full swing. Ask any regular Carnival-goer the best way to catch the parade and they will be divided in to three camps. You\u2019ve got the \u201clet the parade come to you\u201d approach. To help you pick the right spot, Linett Kamala, an artist and Notting Hill Carnival trustee, says: \u201cArrive early, well before the crowds, to walk around the Carnival footprint.\u201d (The parade starts at about 10.30am on both days.) As well as soaking up the anticipation, \u201cuse this time to locate the nearest toilets\u201d, she says. Next, there are the \u201cwalkers\u201d who weave through the parade route via side streets, jumping in with different bands and maybe a soundsystem or two along the way. Finally, there are those who swear the best way to see it is to be it. Melissa Simon-Hartman, an artist and costume designer, says: \u201cTake part! Nothing beats the experience of wearing a costume and participating in a Carnival band. It is safe, fun, and you instantly become part of a new family.\u201d Maxine-Laurie Marshall The music: soundsystems, samba, steel bands and more Carnival is a sensory overload, but your ears arguably get it the most. The first thing to mention are the soundsystems: 38 sets of speaker stacks installed at various points, with bass set to anywhere from nostril-tickling to aorta-collapsing. Each \u201csound\u201d is run by a different crew, many of whom \u2013 such as Volcano Sound (formerly Mangrove Sound) \u2013 have been doing this since the early 70s. African-Caribbean music is dominant \u2013 historic dub outfits such as Aba-Shanti I, King Tubby\u2019s, and Saxon Studio play stately, skanking tracks, but even these never cleave to one style all weekend long. Classic dancehall cuts and manically energised soca \u2013 often also heard blasting from trucks on the parade route \u2013 sort the real dancers from the amateurs, and roots reggae megastars such as Koffee and Chronixx will no doubt get a good airing. The entire spectrum of black British music gets a look-in, though. No Carnival trip is complete without some time spent at Rampage, the anything-goes sound where you might encounter huge US rap tracks or grime or jungle, as well as PAs from soon-to-be-massive MCs. Afrobeats and funky house are never far away, and Pineapple Tribe and others even venture into hard dance territory. Meanwhile, the Latin Rave Street Jam soundsystem does what it says on the tin, playing salsa, reggaeton and more, adding to the six Brazilian samba groups threaded among the African-Caribbean crews in the parade. Sam Alexander, bandleader of the group Baque de Ax\u00e9, explains the Latin music at Carnival: \u201cBrazilian bands\u2019 musical powerhouse is the drumming band that walks along the road \u2013 anywhere from 30 to 150 people in one block of drummers. As well as that there\u2019ll be dancers, and a soundsystem \u2013 assuming a melody can be amplified above the drums!\u201d It\u2019s not just the classic Rio samba sound. Other bands play reggae-influenced Latin music, while Baque de Ax\u00e9 will feature sub-groups playing maracatu, \u201cthe granddaddy of samba\u201d, from north-eastern Brazil. The bands often feature talent from across the Atlantic. \u201cYou get middle-class people with the nicest drums, nicest sticks, gloves \u2013 and a gnarly favela guy next to them,\u201d says Alexander. \u201cThe idea of cultural appropriation doesn\u2019t occur to us, because we\u2019re involved directly in the culture in Brazil, working with bands. We invite our teachers and masters over, and we go and visit them. We\u2019re encouraging dialogue.\u201d Carnival is also the best place in the UK to watch steel pan bands. The parade route sometimes drowns them out, so the best spot to take them in is at Panorama, the biggest steel band competition in Europe. Held at Emslie Horniman\u2019s Pleasance park on Saturday from 7pm onwards (tickets \u00a310), bands play off against each other, performing tunes from memory. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the only time most people will get to see steel bands playing in such large numbers,\u201d says Chris Storey of the band Pan Nation. \u201cMost people might just see a solo or duet on a cruise ship or in the Caribbean, but to see a massed steel band with 80 to 100 players is awe-inspiring.\u201d It\u2019s a chance, says Storey, for bands to reject \u201cthe run-of-the-mill steel band tunes: Hot Hot Hot or Yellow Bird\u201d \u2013 Pan Nation take on everything from Drake to UK garage hits. \u201cThese are really intricate arrangements, almost like orchestral pieces,\u201d says Storey. Beyond the individual performances, take time to drink in the glorious ambient sound as all the music blends with other noise: car horns, vuvuzelas, the C major chord of loud happy chatter that is the bedrock of Carnival. Ben Beaumont-Thomas The food \u201cCarnival is not just about jerk chicken,\u201d says Levi Roots, who \u2013 despite making his name with jerk sauce and being a proud Jamaican \u2013 thinks that the key to the best culinary experience at Carnival is choosing lesser-known cuisine. \u201cJerk is very Jamaican and so are the soundsystems, the music and the noise that makes Carnival, Carnival,\u201d says Roots. \u201cBut it is a Caribbean festival and the food is very diverse. Jerk chicken is only the Jamaican side of things. Try finding yourself something you\u2019ve never had.\u201d Roots thinks that alongside staples such as jerk chicken and curried goat, festival goers should search for the Trinidadian dish, doubles. A popular street food, it\u2019s made of spicy chickpeas on a roti topped with chutney. \u201cIt\u2019s a wrap filled with delicious caribbean sunshine,\u201d says Roots. \u201cIt\u2019s vegan, too.\u201d Plantain chips also make good food on the go, as an easy-to-eat alternative to the traditional boiled or fried version. \u201cThere\u2019s something called grater cake, which is a Jamaican coconut delicacy that\u2019ll be popular as well,\u201d says Roots, who also recommends sugar cane and jellied coconut. \u201cThat\u2019s very popular at Carnival, and it\u2019s always great fun to see the theatre of the guys who chop the coconut with a machete.\u201d For those looking for something after the music has died down, Roots recommends the long-running Turtle Bay restaurant chain \u2013 which has locations in more than a dozen UK cities \u2013 for cheap and cheerful caribbean cooking, and Usain Bolt\u2019s Tracks and Records in Shoreditch (94 Middlesex St, E1), as well as local restaurants around Notting Hill and Ladbroke Grove, especially on All Saints Road. \u201cIt\u2019s about the islands,\u201d says Roots, when the Guardian asks him how to find food that\u2019s off the beaten track. \u201cLook for where different flags are flying.

But don\u2019t forget that at 3pm on both days there will be a planned silence for the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire. The 72 seconds of silence will honour the 72 people who died in the tower block fire close to the parade route. This sign of respect mirrors the spirit that Carnival is known for: created by locals for the community 53 years ago, and with more than half of attendees being Londoners, the same remains true today.

      "body": "<p>Another year, another series of the Great British Bake Off. You know the deal by now. There\u2019s a tent full of passionate home bakers, and week by week their will to live will be slowly eroded by impossible challenges that ask them to explain the quantum concept of particle-wave duality via the medium of biscuits.</p> <p>The new series of Bake Off begins next week, and it will be identical to every other series of Bake Off, and the only variation will be the influx of new contestants, so let\u2019s rank them in terms of potential from worst to best.</p> <h2>13. Dan, 32, support worker</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90604ede2c0fe90ae785e9fd62e086c333debf72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90604ede2c0fe90ae785e9fd62e086c333debf72/0_103_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a very good chance that Dan is a lovely person. However, between his deep-V shirt, his unguarded beard and his manbun, I am terrified of how much he\u2019s going to shed into his food. Prue Leith is pushing 80, for crying out loud. A clump of hair in a Victoria sponge might finish her off.</p> <h2>12. Rosie, 28, veterinary surgeon</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79720f26f68980633c416b1d8520d799712650f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79720f26f68980633c416b1d8520d799712650f9/0_375_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rosie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rosie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although Rosie routinely performs life-saving surgery on sick animals, something about her demeanour here suggests she deals badly with stress. My guess is that she\u2019ll be escorted from the tent after a fortnight for flinging a pan of boiling sugar at Sandi Toksvig\u2019s head.</p> <h2>11. Jamie, 20, part-time waiter</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"809766a6fb1c6da9268d5aac95a312e769aa3460\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/809766a6fb1c6da9268d5aac95a312e769aa3460/0_99_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jamie looks a bit like a young Joaquin Phoenix. But ask yourself this: what would you do if Joaquin Phoenix gave you a cake? That\u2019s right, you\u2019d throw the cake away and set fire to the bin. It only seems sensible to do this with any cake given to you by this man too.</p> <h2>10. Michael, 26, theatre manager/fitness instructor</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a2c04c2625ffe91ff1e1a187b2ad59182072c3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a2c04c2625ffe91ff1e1a187b2ad59182072c3b/0_196_2000_2737/731.jpg\" alt=\"Michael.\" width=\"731\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No. No. Absolutely not. Let\u2019s just study this picture for a moment. Not only is Michael\u2019s apron absolutely filthy, but he\u2019s also pulling the most terrified facial expression I have ever seen. This man is a complete danger. He has no discipline. He\u2019s going to kill someone.</p> <h2>9. Phil, 56, HGV driver</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"022344a798f5b7e88099f5d3bd4957590702a3d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/022344a798f5b7e88099f5d3bd4957590702a3d4/0_157_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phil.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phil.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the press kit that accompanied the images of the new contestants, Phil is asked about his happiest Bake Off experiences. He replies \u201cBeing minibussed into the site\u201d. That\u2019s his happiest experience. A minibus. The man is the walking manifestation of the concept of doom.</p> <h2>8. Henry, 20, student</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7899d3cf4dac995fbcc8d29279a02ade5c807a78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7899d3cf4dac995fbcc8d29279a02ade5c807a78/0_187_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Henry.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Henry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Henry is appearing on the Great British Bake Off because he was a Great British Bake Off superfan as a child. The Great British Bake Off is now creating its own contestants, and this means that Henry is the GBBO equivalent of Big Brother\u2019s Brian Belo, and this means he is not to be trusted.</p> <h2>7. Steph, 28, shop assistant</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94cbbaa97a8e1ef4c9f918678e53664ba50584e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94cbbaa97a8e1ef4c9f918678e53664ba50584e3/0_187_2000_2795/716.jpg\" alt=\"Steph.\" width=\"716\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steph.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I don\u2019t trust Steph either. In her contestant photo she has made a towering multi-tiered sponge, which seems impressive. But look closer. Those tiers are not tidy at all. She looks like she\u2019s just dustpan-and-brushed a pile of crumbs together. She\u2019s fooling nobody. You\u2019re fooling nobody, Steph.</p> <h2>6. Amelia, 24, fashion designer</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0808f241ce43014e8d8992811e2393931e08fb06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0808f241ce43014e8d8992811e2393931e08fb06/0_255_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amelia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amelia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In her contestant profile, Amelia describes herself as \u2018pretty happy\u2019 and \u2018a positive person\u2019. I am 90% sure that this makes her a psychopath.</p> <h2>5. Helena, 40, online project manager</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25fb71ee65b1d399ccb22c3ed7df2e17b53c1e51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25fb71ee65b1d399ccb22c3ed7df2e17b53c1e51/0_85_2000_2844/703.jpg\" alt=\"Helena.\" width=\"703\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helena.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Why are you making so many notes, Helena? WHY ARE YOU MAKING SO MANY NOTES? Are you collecting data on us? Are you going to sell our secrets to the Russians, Helena? Oh, you\u2019re not actually making notes, you\u2019re just painting some icing with a brush that looks like a pen. Still, I\u2019ve got my eye on you.</p> <h2>4. Michelle, 35, print shop administrator</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"acf3b253107ab33b375736c1b18cd7cf40ee8c4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acf3b253107ab33b375736c1b18cd7cf40ee8c4f/0_246_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michelle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michelle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Michelle didn\u2019t have a wedding cake. She\u2019s a Great British Bake Off contestant and yet, on a day when tradition demands cake, she chose to shun cake. Michelle is clearly some sort of arch cake dissident, and my honest belief is that her one true aim is to destroy Bake Off from the inside out. In which case, I can only applaud her.</p> <h2>3. Alice, 28, geography teacher</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"057e577618bfc131972feb07812d874d6310d22a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/057e577618bfc131972feb07812d874d6310d22a/0_0_2000_3000/667.jpg\" alt=\"Alice.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alice is so beautiful and wholesome that the BBC used a giant photograph of her when it ran a story about the new contestants. This means her progress will inevitably be derailed as bored viewers use social media to concoct a story about how she\u2019s probably having an affair with Paul Hollywood. Same as it ever was.</p> <h2>2. David, 36, international health adviser</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19d33708df20c733676dd3569c65202eb151bd8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19d33708df20c733676dd3569c65202eb151bd8c/0_210_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>David has a very precise look, which quite frankly Dan could learn a thing or two about. He also invented a type of cake that villages in Malawi could steam over an open fire, which means he is already well-versed in international cake outreach. He is the closest thing to a Terminator this year\u2019s batch of contestants can offer.</p> <h2>1. Priya, 34, marketing consultant</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b207e0e3f7c778c0076adf87528d3152459c5501\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b207e0e3f7c778c0076adf87528d3152459c5501/0_227_2000_2773/721.jpg\" alt=\"Priya.\" width=\"721\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Priya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In her contestant profile, Priya is asked who would be most surprised to learn that she had entered Bake Off. She replies \u201cI have kept in touch with people from work,\u201d which means that she\u2019s left work. Why did she leave work? Because she won Bake Off, that\u2019s why.

      "bodyText": "Another year, another series of the Great British Bake Off. You know the deal by now. There\u2019s a tent full of passionate home bakers, and week by week their will to live will be slowly eroded by impossible challenges that ask them to explain the quantum concept of particle-wave duality via the medium of biscuits. The new series of Bake Off begins next week, and it will be identical to every other series of Bake Off, and the only variation will be the influx of new contestants, so let\u2019s rank them in terms of potential from worst to best. 13. Dan, 32, support worker There\u2019s a very good chance that Dan is a lovely person. However, between his deep-V shirt, his unguarded beard and his manbun, I am terrified of how much he\u2019s going to shed into his food. Prue Leith is pushing 80, for crying out loud. A clump of hair in a Victoria sponge might finish her off. 12. Rosie, 28, veterinary surgeon Although Rosie routinely performs life-saving surgery on sick animals, something about her demeanour here suggests she deals badly with stress. My guess is that she\u2019ll be escorted from the tent after a fortnight for flinging a pan of boiling sugar at Sandi Toksvig\u2019s head. 11. Jamie, 20, part-time waiter Jamie looks a bit like a young Joaquin Phoenix. But ask yourself this: what would you do if Joaquin Phoenix gave you a cake? That\u2019s right, you\u2019d throw the cake away and set fire to the bin. It only seems sensible to do this with any cake given to you by this man too. 10. Michael, 26, theatre manager/fitness instructor No. No. Absolutely not. Let\u2019s just study this picture for a moment. Not only is Michael\u2019s apron absolutely filthy, but he\u2019s also pulling the most terrified facial expression I have ever seen. This man is a complete danger. He has no discipline. He\u2019s going to kill someone. 9. Phil, 56, HGV driver In the press kit that accompanied the images of the new contestants, Phil is asked about his happiest Bake Off experiences. He replies \u201cBeing minibussed into the site\u201d. That\u2019s his happiest experience. A minibus. The man is the walking manifestation of the concept of doom. 8. Henry, 20, student Henry is appearing on the Great British Bake Off because he was a Great British Bake Off superfan as a child. The Great British Bake Off is now creating its own contestants, and this means that Henry is the GBBO equivalent of Big Brother\u2019s Brian Belo, and this means he is not to be trusted. 7. Steph, 28, shop assistant I don\u2019t trust Steph either. In her contestant photo she has made a towering multi-tiered sponge, which seems impressive. But look closer. Those tiers are not tidy at all. She looks like she\u2019s just dustpan-and-brushed a pile of crumbs together. She\u2019s fooling nobody. You\u2019re fooling nobody, Steph. 6. Amelia, 24, fashion designer In her contestant profile, Amelia describes herself as \u2018pretty happy\u2019 and \u2018a positive person\u2019. I am 90% sure that this makes her a psychopath. 5. Helena, 40, online project manager Why are you making so many notes, Helena? WHY ARE YOU MAKING SO MANY NOTES? Are you collecting data on us? Are you going to sell our secrets to the Russians, Helena? Oh, you\u2019re not actually making notes, you\u2019re just painting some icing with a brush that looks like a pen. Still, I\u2019ve got my eye on you. 4. Michelle, 35, print shop administrator Michelle didn\u2019t have a wedding cake. She\u2019s a Great British Bake Off contestant and yet, on a day when tradition demands cake, she chose to shun cake. Michelle is clearly some sort of arch cake dissident, and my honest belief is that her one true aim is to destroy Bake Off from the inside out. In which case, I can only applaud her. 3. Alice, 28, geography teacher Alice is so beautiful and wholesome that the BBC used a giant photograph of her when it ran a story about the new contestants. This means her progress will inevitably be derailed as bored viewers use social media to concoct a story about how she\u2019s probably having an affair with Paul Hollywood. Same as it ever was. 2. David, 36, international health adviser David has a very precise look, which quite frankly Dan could learn a thing or two about. He also invented a type of cake that villages in Malawi could steam over an open fire, which means he is already well-versed in international cake outreach. He is the closest thing to a Terminator this year\u2019s batch of contestants can offer. 1. Priya, 34, marketing consultant In her contestant profile, Priya is asked who would be most surprised to learn that she had entered Bake Off. She replies \u201cI have kept in touch with people from work,\u201d which means that she\u2019s left work. Why did she leave work? Because she won Bake Off, that\u2019s why. My logic is watertight, and you may all congratulate me when this series ends.",

The stance of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet secretary, Martin Parkinson, has prompted stern words from the Senate committee chair Jenny McAllister, who has now demanded he appear as requested. The Senate is currently examining Pyne and Bishop\u2019s acceptance of post-politics jobs in fields related to their work as cabinet ministers. Pyne, a former defence minister, joined consulting giant EY to help grow its defence business, and Bishop, the former foreign minister, took a job with one of the Australian government\u2019s biggest private aid contractors, Palladium. Parkinson investigated and cleared the pair of breaching rules in the ministerial standards designed to stop ministers using their inside knowledge and contacts for private gain. The Senate inquiry asked Parkinson to attend and give further evidence about his findings and his role in helping oversee the ministerial standards. But Parkinson declined on Monday. John Reid, a first assistant secretary with the department, wrote to the committee saying it would not be \u201cworthwhile\u201d for Parkinson to give further evidence. \u201cDr Parkinson advises that there is nothing further that he can add to his already-published letter on this subject.

      "bodyText": "At least 11 people have died and three remain missing after groups of pilgrims hiking to a religious celebration in Papua New Guinea got lost in the mountains. At least 21 people were rescued by helicopter on Sunday and Monday from the Sarawaget range in Morobe province. They had been attempting to reach Indagen for a celebration of the 100th anniversary of the arrival of Lutheran missionaries. However according to helicopter pilot Jurgen Ruh, walkers coming from both Pindiu in the south-east and the city of Lae in the south-west became lost or succumbed to the difficult conditions and terrain. On Tuesday the National reported 16 had died. \u201cWalking in from Lae you have to go over 11,000 feet [3,300 metres] which is almost twice as high as Australia\u2019s highest mountain,\u201d Ruh told Guardian Australia. \u201cMorning temperatures are about six or eight degrees, and the conditions, with some rain, will be colder. Then with wind it really gets down to your bones and you won\u2019t last long.\u201d He said many people who had made the journey were city dwellers and were not prepared with appropriate clothing or food. \u201cThe air is thin and everything that could go against you, went against them.\u201d Ruh said his helicopter could only take three people at a time. Nine were rescued on Sunday and another 12 on Monday. Eight people went on foot to search for bodies and to clear a landing area for the helicopter, but he said that after four flyovers he could not find them. \u201cI\u2019ve got a strong suspicion they walked out again, that they didn\u2019t stay as long as they thought they would [overnight],\u201d he said. \u201cEither way we have not found the people \u2026 I\u2019ve now requested for the defence force to take over. It\u2019s beyond my capability now to do anything else.\u201d The PNG prime minister, James Marape, and the governor general, Sir Bob Dadae, both attended the event. On Monday they and the Kabwum MP Patrick Bassa led mourning for the dead and missing walkers. Bassa said the deaths highlighted the difficulties of travel in PNG and appealed to Marape to fund a road from Lae to Kabwum, the National reported.",

More than half a million former students in England overpaid their student loans by an average of nearly \u00a3600, Student Loans Company (SLC) data shows. The figures, obtained via freedom of information requests by the higher education publication Research Professional News, show that a total of \u00a3308m was overpaid between 2009-10 and 2017-18 but almost a tenth of that has not been refunded. Repayments to student loans are governed by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. The poorest students borrow more than \u00a350,000 on average, while interest rates of up to 6.3% increase the amounts owed. The SLC said it contacted everyone who overpaid to arrange refunds and urged all graduates who had taken out loans to keep their contact details up-to-date. A spokesman said: \u201cWe want all customers to repay the right amount and not to over-repay on their loan.\u201d He said the company writes to people who have two years of repayments left to suggest they pay by direct debit rather than through their employer to help prevent over-repayments. \u201cCustomers who do not participate in the direct debit scheme can also claim a refund at any time by contacting us.\u201d The SLC had also started to receive payment information from Revenue and Customs to help \u201cprevent customers from over-repaying and provide them with more up-to-date information about their loan repayment\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Vicky Jones has a lot to celebrate, and yet she has a natural inclination to undersell herself. As well as a playwright in her own right (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/mar/04/the-one-review-curious-litttle-shocker\">2016\u2019s The One</a>), she is the director of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/dec/07/fleabag-five-star-review-phoebe-waller-bridge-soho-london\">Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s hit play Fleabag</a>, a show so popular its title has now become synonymous with every emotionally nuanced female character on screen.</p> <p>The play premiered at the Edinburgh fringe in 2013, bagged a Fringe First award, went on to have two runs at Soho Theatre, a Bafta-winning hit TV spin-off series and a recent, lauded, off-Broadway run. This month, Fleabag has its final victory lap at Wyndham\u2019s Theatre in London. It is a phenomenal success story yet Jones is careful not to overplay things, describing the current West End run as \u201cnerve-wracking; ridiculous; dream-time\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7d08ef5e045ca6eadc2da76566a0bbc83383e70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7d08ef5e045ca6eadc2da76566a0bbc83383e70/0_208_3600_2161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The One with Rufus Wright and Phoebe Waller-Bridge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The One with Rufus Wright and Phoebe Waller-Bridge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: London News Pictures/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jones herself is a bundle of contradictions; part fiery Fleabag and part sensitive best friend Boo, a role that Waller-Bridge based on Jones. She obviously always had a strong idea of what she liked \u2013 and did not like \u2013 from very early on in her career. The friendship between Jones and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/08/phoebe-waller-bridge-fleabag-killing-eve-transgressive-women\">Waller-Bridge</a> began when Jones walked out of theatre rehearsals after clashing with a producer; Waller-Bridge, already a fan of Jones and her work, quit in protest.</p> <p>The friends went on to form the company DryWrite, which hosted an exceptionally talented bunch of emerging playwrights, including Jack Thorne, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/18/albion-review-mike-bartlett-almeida-london\">Mike Bartlett</a>, Lucy Kirkwood and Ella Hickson. The pair goaded their writers with clever provocations: write work that will elicit heckling; get the audience to sympathise with a monster; push the line between what is funny and what is sad.</p> <p>\u201cWe both got a sense of what we liked without knowing what we were going to write ourselves. Phoebe probably did. But she was always telling me that I was a writer, which I refused to believe.\u201d</p> <p>It was a dearth of decent female roles that eventually turned Jones to writing \u2013 a desire, perhaps, to serve her friend rather than serve herself: \u201cI wanted to write for Phoebe because I felt like she was consistently disappointed when she was being offered certain kinds of roles. They weren\u2019t dynamic or exciting enough.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cee851163a60ce19dfafc718dc99542bf81628e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cee851163a60ce19dfafc718dc99542bf81628e3/0_0_1929_2748/702.jpg\" alt=\"Fleabag poster\" width=\"702\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fleabag poster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Soho Theatre</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fleabag was also a result of heated conversations the two friends were having about porn: \u201cWe\u2019re in a much better time for feminism now but [before we started writing it] we both felt like there wasn\u2019t much leadership for feminism. It wasn\u2019t easy to call yourself a feminist. You had to justify yourself. It was difficult to find a language for it and porn was the one thing that kept coming up that made us feel bad.\u201d The character of Fleabag, then, was a feminist thought experiment. What would happen if a girl had access to porn at a young age? How would that make her feel about herself, her body and the value of sex?</p> <p>Despite sexuality being a key theme of the show, Jones believes that the excessive focus by critics on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/08/farewell-fleabag-the-most-electrifying-devastating-tv-in-years\">Fleabag\u2019s</a> exploits has obscured the deeper and darker elements that underpin the show. It\u2019s the kind of limited and limiting response that Jones believes is down to gender bias. And that doesn\u2019t just go for the journalists: \u201cPeople who Phoebe and I really respect, we\u2019ve overheard them say that we\u2019re just out to shock, which is quite hurtful, really.\u201d</p> <p>Jones\u2019s latest work is Run, an upcoming series for HBO and the first TV-producing credit for DryWrite. The show is about a young mum who, \u201ctired and uninspired by her life\u201d, walks away from her kids.

      "bodyText": "Vicky Jones has a lot to celebrate, and yet she has a natural inclination to undersell herself. As well as a playwright in her own right (2016\u2019s The One), she is the director of Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s hit play Fleabag, a show so popular its title has now become synonymous with every emotionally nuanced female character on screen. The play premiered at the Edinburgh fringe in 2013, bagged a Fringe First award, went on to have two runs at Soho Theatre, a Bafta-winning hit TV spin-off series and a recent, lauded, off-Broadway run. This month, Fleabag has its final victory lap at Wyndham\u2019s Theatre in London. It is a phenomenal success story yet Jones is careful not to overplay things, describing the current West End run as \u201cnerve-wracking; ridiculous; dream-time\u201d. Jones herself is a bundle of contradictions; part fiery Fleabag and part sensitive best friend Boo, a role that Waller-Bridge based on Jones. She obviously always had a strong idea of what she liked \u2013 and did not like \u2013 from very early on in her career. The friendship between Jones and Waller-Bridge began when Jones walked out of theatre rehearsals after clashing with a producer; Waller-Bridge, already a fan of Jones and her work, quit in protest. The friends went on to form the company DryWrite, which hosted an exceptionally talented bunch of emerging playwrights, including Jack Thorne, Mike Bartlett, Lucy Kirkwood and Ella Hickson. The pair goaded their writers with clever provocations: write work that will elicit heckling; get the audience to sympathise with a monster; push the line between what is funny and what is sad. \u201cWe both got a sense of what we liked without knowing what we were going to write ourselves. Phoebe probably did. But she was always telling me that I was a writer, which I refused to believe.\u201d It was a dearth of decent female roles that eventually turned Jones to writing \u2013 a desire, perhaps, to serve her friend rather than serve herself: \u201cI wanted to write for Phoebe because I felt like she was consistently disappointed when she was being offered certain kinds of roles. They weren\u2019t dynamic or exciting enough.\u201d Fleabag was also a result of heated conversations the two friends were having about porn: \u201cWe\u2019re in a much better time for feminism now but [before we started writing it] we both felt like there wasn\u2019t much leadership for feminism. It wasn\u2019t easy to call yourself a feminist. You had to justify yourself. It was difficult to find a language for it and porn was the one thing that kept coming up that made us feel bad.\u201d The character of Fleabag, then, was a feminist thought experiment. What would happen if a girl had access to porn at a young age? How would that make her feel about herself, her body and the value of sex? Despite sexuality being a key theme of the show, Jones believes that the excessive focus by critics on Fleabag\u2019s exploits has obscured the deeper and darker elements that underpin the show. It\u2019s the kind of limited and limiting response that Jones believes is down to gender bias. And that doesn\u2019t just go for the journalists: \u201cPeople who Phoebe and I really respect, we\u2019ve overheard them say that we\u2019re just out to shock, which is quite hurtful, really.\u201d Jones\u2019s latest work is Run, an upcoming series for HBO and the first TV-producing credit for DryWrite. The show is about a young mum who, \u201ctired and uninspired by her life\u201d, walks away from her kids. Run is part of a new wave of shows \u2013 think Motherland, and Amy Schumer\u2019s recent standup hour Growing \u2013 that are rewriting the myth of motherhood. Jones has been writing the show while taking care of her first baby and it\u2019s been a slog: \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to find the words. I\u2019ve been going through so many shades of it.

He cringed every time a quarterback of far less ability was signed while you remained sidelined. I remember him becoming ecstatic over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/may/24/colin-kaepernick-seattle-seahawks-workout-nfl\">rumor that you may be signing with the Seattle Seahawks</a> and joining Richard Sherman, Michael Bennett and Russell Wilson.

      "bodyText": "Dear Colin, My son Malcolm and I are big fans of yours. I remember the day when Malcolm, who was around 11 at the time, said that he wanted to write a poem about you for my book, We Matter: Athletes And Activism. I told him OK, but he was going to have to take the time and do the proper research. If he put in the work, I\u2019d let him perform it at events on my book tour. And so Malcolm, inspired by your decision to kneel during the national anthem to draw attention to the extrajudicial killings of unarmed black men in America, did just that and wrote a poem entitled Kaepernick, which he\u2019s since recited to crowds at book fairs, poetry venues and colleges across the country \u2013 including at my alma mater Syracuse University last year \u2013 often proudly wearing his red and white jersey with your name across the back. But last week Malcolm came to me confused. He\u2019d listened as I devoted nearly an hour of my weekly radio show to discussing Jay-Z\u2019s announcement of a business partnership with the NFL to offer advice and strategy for major events like the Super Bowl and to \u201cnurture and strengthen community through football and music\u201d, a marriage that\u2019s felt like at best a mixed message and at worst a betrayal. Malcolm asked me in a serious tone: Should we still be boycotting the NFL? See, after you were whiteballed from professional football back in 2016, Malcolm made the decision to not watch an NFL game until you were picked up by a team. He cringed every time a quarterback of far less ability was signed while you remained sidelined. I remember him becoming ecstatic over the rumor that you may be signing with the Seattle Seahawks and joining Richard Sherman, Michael Bennett and Russell Wilson. I remember him saying how perfectly you would fit in with how woke the team was, a nod to Seattle\u2019s culture of activism and free thought. And I remember how frustrated he was when the invite was reportedly withdrawn because you wouldn\u2019t promise to stand for the anthem. That made him respect you more, and write off the Seahawks organization for good. He\u2019s rolled with you 100%. I remember hearing him adamantly defend you to adults who would recite the \u201cfootball reasons\u201d for your exclusion that you\u2019ve probably heard a thousand times: that if you were an elite-level quarterback \u2026 that if you were a better fit for a pro-style offense \u2026 that if your completion percentage relative to other NFL starters were just a little bit higher \u2026 When it came to you, Malcolm always had the answers. But since last week, he\u2019s only had questions. Why haven\u2019t we heard anything directly from Kaepernick? Why are we only hearing from people close to him, like his girlfriend Nessa or brother-in-arms Eric Reid, but never from him? If he filed a grievance against the NFL\u2019s owners for collusion and they settled out of court, why did he tweet that he was working out and wanted to get back in the league? Why is Jay-Z partnering with the NFL after wearing Kaepernick\u2019s jersey on stage and shaming other rappers for even considering performing at the Super Bowl? Why was the only time we heard Kaepernick say anything outside of his Nike commercial was when he first explained the reasons for his protest more than three years ago? Why doesn\u2019t he say anything? I wish I knew what to tell him. When I spoke on a panel at last year\u2019s AEJMC Conference in Washington, I defended your right to remain silent to a room full of reporters who were criticizing you for not speaking up. I didn\u2019t back down from a pointed exchange with Jerry Brewer of the Washington Post: \u201cWhat else did you want him to say? He specifically told you the reasons why he was taking a knee: to protest political corruption, systemic racism and police brutality, and y\u2019all allowed the narrative to be switched to being disrespectful to the country and the military.\u201d I accused those reporters of lazy journalism for letting your message be hijacked in the absence of your voice. Let\u2019s just say I didn\u2019t receive a standing ovation for my position. But as I\u2019ve contemplated Malcolm\u2019s questions over the last week, I have to admit my son has a point. Why haven\u2019t we heard directly from you?

It doesn\u2019t mean you can no longer speak publicly about anything. You have an entire generation of people out here who want to back you. You mobilized an army of supporters who caused Nike\u2019s share price not to plummet, as countless Fox News commentators gleefully predicted amid their breathless calls for boycotts, but reach an all-time high shortly after you became the face of a campaign for the 30th anniversary of the sneaker company\u2019s \u201cJust Do It\u201d motto in September. You have people ready to cancel the greatest rapper ever \u2013 at least top three \u2013 because they question his motivations in partnering with the NFL, regardless of all the positive he\u2019s quietly done in the community, like raising money for the families of Sean Bell and Trayvon Martin, donating funds for activists in Ferguson and Baltimore and lobbying New York governor Andrew Cuomo to appoint a special prosecutor in the Eric Garner murder case.

No. Do we now have a country that no longer oppresses black and brown people? No. In fact, we now have a man in the White House who derives his power from white nationalism and white supremacy. But what you did was force people to discuss it and deny them the option of looking the other way. That\u2019s why so many took objection to Jay-Z saying \u201cwe\u2019re past kneeling\u201d while seated next to Goodell during last week\u2019s joint announcement at Roc Nation headquarters \u2013 even as we patiently waited to see if Daniel Panteleo would face any consequences for choking Eric Garner to death in broad daylight five years ago.

A third of its surface is made up of rooftops, parking lots, highways and other impervious surfaces that soak up heat. This gives Dallas one of the highest \u201curban heat island\u201d effects in the US, with the city up to 15F warmer than nearby rural areas. Some areas of the city average peak temperatures of 101F for five months of the year.</p> \n<p>Of all US cities, only Phoenix is heating up quicker than Dallas, found <a href=\"https://texastrees.blob.core.windows.net/static/Texas%20Trees%20UHI%20Sudy_Final_v4_title%20change.pdf\">a 2017 report from the Texas Trees Foundation</a>, which recommended the city plant 250,000 trees to alleviate the sweltering conditions.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We are getting diseases like Zika and West Nile that Texans never really used to worry about before</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>James McGuire, City of Dallas</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>McGuire said the city hasn\u2019t decided whether to adopt this goal but admitted Dallas needs \u201ca lot more trees.\u201d A recent giveaway of saplings to residents proved popular but more robust action will need to be undertaken without much state or federal support. McGuire said that officials in Dallas talk to their counterparts in Houston and San Antonio about heat but they may have to wait for a time when \u201cimpacts are so severe everyone will have to do something.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dallas\u2019s summer is set to double in length by the end of the century if radical climate action isn\u2019t taken, according to a major US government assessment released last year.

The homeless outreach coordinatoris headed to the spots where she knows she\u2019ll find people who are living outside. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure they\u2019re not lying down on the ground, and tap their feet for a response,\u201d Williams said. Inside the center, a few dozen people hide from the heat in a windowless room with cafeteria-style tables and loud televisions. Two nearby men\u2019s shelters are also open around-the-clock instead of just at night because of a city-wide heat alert. There\u2019s free lunch, as well as computers for job searching, laundry machines and showers \u2013 but managers say people also visit just to get out of the sun. The center is in the middle of warehouses and near a highway, and all the concrete radiates heat. Matthew King, a 44-year-old who works in a tire shop but is between homes, said he visits regularly, \u201cespecially when it\u2019s hot.\u201d \u201cThis is the hottest I\u2019ve ever seen in July,\u201d said King at the center, which is just a few miles from the White House rose garden where President Trump said in 2017 that the US will leave the Paris climate change accord. Residents of the US capital are regularly baked in heatwaves and endure stiflingly thick humidit. But much like many cities around the world, Washington DC is being slowly cooked by the human-driven climate crisis to the extent its entire character will be transformed. By 2080, researchers recently found, Washington DC\u2019s climate will resemble what northern Mississippi or Dallas is like currently. Unless drastic action is taken to slash greenhouse gases, global heating will transform the climates of almost every community in the US by the time today\u2019s children are entering retirement. Outdoors in Philadelphia will feel more like Memphis; New York City is set to morph into northeastern Arkansas; Houston and Miami have no US comparison, leaping instead deep into climates currently found in Mexico. \u201cEvery city gets warmer, none get cooler,\u201d said Matt Fitzpatrick, a University of Maryland academic who formulated the climate projections for US cities, based on a range of heat and rainfall scenarios. Its research shows how 540 North American urban areas will by 2080 become, on average, \u201cmost like the contemporary climate of locations about 500 miles (805kms) away and mainly to the south.\u201d The average temperature in US cities will rise by a blistering 9F (5C) by the end of the century, compared to the period of 1960-1990, if greenhouse gas emissions aren\u2019t curbed. Some cities will be outliers \u2013 Fairbanks, Alaska, for example, is in danger of heating up by a sweltering 11.8F (6.6C). \u201cCities have built infrastructure for a climate that will no longer be there,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cThey will have to live with more heat and, if they are on the coast, flooding too. In the lifetime of children today, a lot of these places are going to be dramatically transformed.\u201d This new reality of searing heat is an existential one for those most vulnerable \u2013 the sick, the elderly and, in particular, the homeless. Washington officials estimate 6,521 people were experiencing homelessness this year, down 6% from 2018. In the broader metropolitan area, about 9,794 people are without homes. Laura Zeilinger, director of the Department of Human Services, said as the city heats up, her goal stays the same \u2013 to get people into homes.

City will become \u201870% wetter\u2019 It doesn\u2019t take much of a temperature increase to permanently shift the expected climate of a city. Fitzpatrick found that a 9.8F (5.5C) average temperature increase during Washington DC\u2019s winter would plunge it into what the deep south is like today.

It\u2019s going to be very different.\u201d Washington DC has been given a recent glimpse into its future \u2013 a 92F (33C) burst of heat last May saw the city break a 105-year-old record for high temperatures. Sitting on the banks of two tidal rivers \u2013 the Potomac and the Anacostia \u2013 Washington DC is also essentially a delta city at growing risk of flooding as bursts of rainfall become more intense. City leaders have attempted to identify the threat and counter it. A climate resilience plan, released in April, states that DC\u2019s temperature has already risen by 2F (1.1C) over the past 50 years, with a further 4.5F (2.5C) increase to come within 30 years. The number of \u201cheat emergency days\u201d in DC, where the heat index tops 95F (35C), is expected to occur on more than 50 days a year as the century draws to a close. \u201cThat means that, in 2080, our summer will be one long heat emergency,\u201d the DC resilience document warns. This scorching new climate is set to heavily burden DC\u2019s growing population, many of them low-income and struggling with housing affordability. Vulnerable people will likely suffer dehydration or heatstroke, with increasing use of air conditioning placing a strain on the electrical grid. Power outages will probably start to spike. \u201cIt will affect how people live, work and get around in the city,\u201d said Jessica Grannis, adaptation program manager at the Georgetown Climate Center. \u201cIt won\u2019t just be uncomfortable, it will be a life or death challenge for many people. Once it starts getting very hot at night, people without air conditioning are going to be at serious risk if they can\u2019t cool down properly.\u201d Buildings may need removing Kevin Bush, DC\u2019s chief resilience officer, has pledged to \u201cmake the city\u2019s immune system stronger\u201d to cope with this threat, comparing it to how cities in California prepare for the ructions of an earthquake. Under the resilience plan, all DC buildings must be retrofitted to cope with rising heat and flooding threats by 2050, with all new buildings adhering to stricter codes within 13 years. The most at-risk buildings may even be removed. There\u2019s a plan to add more greenery to DC by planting more trees, which will provide shade, and other vegetation that will help soak up stormwater from heavy downpours.

By 2080, according to the University of Maryland research, Dallas is set to become more like New Orleans \u2013 nearly 9F (5C) hotter and nearly three times as wet. \u201cWe had a storm event a few weeks ago where 350,000 people lost power, trees were knocked over. People started to think we maybe aren\u2019t as resilient as we thought, even when it\u2019s not a Hurricane Harvey sort of event,\u201d said James McGuire, director of environmental quality at the City of Dallas. Urban heat island Dallas\u2019 situation is exacerbated by the vast sprawl of concrete at its heart. A third of its surface is made up of rooftops, parking lots, highways and other impervious surfaces that soak up heat. This gives Dallas one of the highest \u201curban heat island\u201d effects in the US, with the city up to 15F warmer than nearby rural areas. Some areas of the city average peak temperatures of 101F for five months of the year. Of all US cities, only Phoenix is heating up quicker than Dallas, found a 2017 report from the Texas Trees Foundation, which recommended the city plant 250,000 trees to alleviate the sweltering conditions. McGuire said the city hasn\u2019t decided whether to adopt this goal but admitted Dallas needs \u201ca lot more trees.\u201d A recent giveaway of saplings to residents proved popular but more robust action will need to be undertaken without much state or federal support. McGuire said that officials in Dallas talk to their counterparts in Houston and San Antonio about heat but they may have to wait for a time when \u201cimpacts are so severe everyone will have to do something.\u201d Dallas\u2019s summer is set to double in length by the end of the century if radical climate action isn\u2019t taken, according to a major US government assessment released last year. The city will also be prone to the whiplash of prolonged droughts interspersed by the drumbeat of heavier rainfall. Property on the banks of Trinity river, that runs through Dallas, has long received billions of dollars of flooding protection but there is less preparation for fresher challenges, such as protecting people working outdoors who risk keeling over in the heat. In January, Dallas City Council kickstarted an attempt to address this manifold problem by passing its first climate resolution. Most of its adaption plans, however, have yet to be formed or funded. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst of all potential worlds, really,\u201d McGuire said. \u201cWe are getting more asthma problems. We are getting more drought. We are getting diseases like Zika and West Nile that Texans never really used to worry about before. We just hope the most dire projections won\u2019t happen.\u201d On another hot day in Washington, Tariq Daniels \u2013 who is currently between homes \u2013 ate lunch and charged his phone at a local grocery store. Daniels said the city has plenty of services, including the day centers, as well as free recreation centers and libraries. Daniels splits his time between the public spaces, his mosque and the grocery store, where he savors the quiet as a contrast to the noise of the shelter in which he currently sleeps. \u201cYou\u2019ve got everything that you need,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cA lot of people have just given up. They\u2019re doing drugs to the point where they\u2019re numb to the outside temperature.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

      "bodyText": "Anti-racism campaigners have called on Unesco to remove a Belgian folklore festival from its cultural heritage list unless organisers stop parading characters in blackface. The four-day carnival in the Belgian town of Ath, which gets under way on Friday, will feature \u201cthe savage\u201d, a white man in blackface, who wears a chain around his neck and a ring through his nose. According to the official festival website, \u201cthe \u2018savage\u2019, chained and agitated, testifies to the taste for the exotic of the 19th century\u201d. In a letter to Unesco, an anti-racist group, the Brussels Panthers, said the character was \u201cadorned with all the humiliating signs that our racist societies have projected on to black people throughout history\u201d. The letter, co-signed by 13 other anti-racism groups, as well as dozens of activists and academics across Europe, describes blackface at Ath and other folkloric events as \u201cacts of symbolic violence towards the black communities of Belgium \u2013 acts that are mirrored by the acts of real physical violence and material discrimination that the same communities also encounter\u201d. Mouhad Reghif, spokesman for the Brussels Panthers, told the Guardian that blackface had very serious consequences on the daily lives of black people in Belgium and elsewhere in Europe. Reghif, who has received dozens of threatening messages since launching the campaign, said blackface helped preserve discrimination and racist attitudes. \u201cThere remains the attitudes of the 1950s and 60s that Belgium brought civilisation to the Congo [its former colony] and colonialism was something good. With this we maintain negrophobia and white supremacy that was born in colonial times.\u201d The \u201csavage\u201d character appears on one of 22 floats that process through the small town of Ath on the last Sunday of August.

Federal cabinet signed off on the proposed new anti-discrimination laws on Tuesday afternoon, agreeing to push ahead with a bill that mirrors other existing anti-discrimination laws, such as those covering age, race and disability. But the decision not to go further could see the party room split over the proposal, with conservatives such as Concetta Fierravanti-Wells and Barnaby Joyce wanting more robust protections in place. The attorney general, Christian Porter, said the government still had some \u201cfine tuning\u201d to do on the bill, but would release the legislation for consultation within the next few weeks. \u201cI am close to finalising a draft bill. There is some fine-tuning now being conducted and I expect a draft bill would be released in the next few weeks, before Parliament resumes in September,\u201d Porter said. But he made clear the government would not be bending to the demands being made by some faith groups and a clutch of conservative MPs for the government to enshrine \u201cpositive\u201d rights through a religious freedom act. \u201cWhat we aim to deliver was rightly described by Anglican Public Affairs Commission chairwoman Carolyn Tan today as being a \u2018shield\u2019 against discrimination, and not a \u2018sword\u2019,\u201d Porter said. \u201cThe laws will protect people from being discriminated against, but will not give them a licence to discriminate against other people.\u201d Porter said the release of the bill would trigger further consultations with MPs and senators from all parties, religious groups and other key stakeholders, including business and LGBTIQ+ groups. Porter has previously told Guardian Australia that he was confident the government\u2019s proposed new laws would provide a \u201cpowerful avenue\u201d for people of faith to be protected against discrimination, suggesting it would prevent a repeat of the high profile Israel Folau sacking. The government hopes the bill will be introduced and considered by both the House and Senate before the end of the year, where it will also be examined by a Senate inquiry. Anglican archbishop of Sydney, Glenn Davies, on Tuesday added his voice to the call for the laws to go beyond protection from discrimination, saying there needed to be rights for religions to \u201cexpress ourselves\u201d. Davies said an example would be a right for an Anglican school to sack teachers who did not \u201cadhere to the Anglican ethos\u201d. Speaking in Sydney to a religious freedom forum organised by New South Wales Labor MP Tania Mihailuk and Liberal MP Damien Tudehope, Davies said it was not enough that religions be granted exemptions from existing anti-discrimination law, because this implied religions were themselves discriminatory. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people who hold religious faith to be seen as an exception in discrimination,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe must have the freedom to express our faith in a positive way, and not be, as it were, marginalised into an exemption, as if we are discriminating, and [people are saying] \u2018We\u2019ll let them do that\u2019. \u201cWe\u2019re not discriminating. We\u2019re just expressing our views and our opinions in a full democratic, free society.\u201d In November last year, 34 Anglican schools in Sydney backtracked over a controversial letter they wrote to the federal education minister, asking him to preserve a clause in the Sex Discrimination Act that allowed religious schools to fire teachers or expel students on the basis of sexuality. Davies and prominent principals later apologised, saying the schools did not want to retain that power, and would prefer to replace it with a positive right about protecting ethos. On Tuesday, he said this should be in the federal legislation. \u201cIn an Anglican school we want to make sure that people are going to adhere to the Anglican ethos of the school. They may not necessarily be Anglican but I do not want them to undermine that. I don\u2019t want them to express views and teach children in a way that is contrary to the ethos and mission of our school. \u201cAustralia is built on diversity of opinion, we\u2019re multicultural and multi-faith. We want the freedom to actually express ourselves in a way in which people can actually understand who we are.\u201d Scott Morrison privately met with 21 leaders of religious groups earlier in August, but Davies said the prime minister had given no indications how far the bill would go. \u201cThe prime minister has not committed to a positive right. But he has committed to consultation. Once the text of the bill is out there in draft legislation, we can then talk to him from there.\u201d \u201cI think he is going to keep his cards close to his chest until he discusses it with the party room and that is fair enough,\u201d he said. Porter made clear that the Australian Law Reform Commission was in the process of inquiring into religious exemptions to discrimination laws, which is designed to ensure that existing legislative exemptions to discrimination based on a person\u2019s identity were limited or removed, while also protecting the right of religious institutions to conduct their affairs in a way \u201cconsistent with their religious ethos\u201d. \u201cThe ALRC inquiry is an entirely separate process which does not cross over with the Religious Discrimination Bill, which is focused on protecting people from discrimination on the basis of their religious belief, or lack thereof,\u201d Porter said.",

      "bodyText": "The non-profit that runs a network of radio stations for Australia\u2019s blind and low vision community says it will be off the air by next year unless the government intervenes to restore its funding. Vision Australia, which operates 10 radio stations across Victoria, southern New South Wales, Adelaide and Perth, says it is facing a $700,000 shortfall after responsibility for disability funding was transferred to the national disability insurance scheme. Vision Australia\u2019s manager of government relations, Chris Edwards, told Guardian Australia the lost funding was an \u201cunintended consequence\u201d of the NDIS. Edwards, who lives with low vision, said the radio station was crucial for the low vision community, particularly among those who had recently lost their sight. \u201cSome people like myself have access to a range of technologies, but what the radio service really does deliver is that people who are newly blinded, that may not have the skills, can turn on a radio,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone knows how to turn on a radio even if you\u2019ve just recently lost your vision.\u201d The network had previously received block funding from state governments, but the money has dried up after the introduction of the NDIS, which provides money to people with disabilities through individualised plans. The issue extends beyond Vision Australia and has affected other advocacy organisations that are poised to lose their funding during the NDIS rollout. In regional areas, the Vision Australia Radio network includes a service where volunteers read out news articles from local newspapers, as well as national publications, including Guardian Australia. The network\u2019s 10 stations are run by about 800 volunteers and the non-profit says its listenership of 700,000 extends beyond the vision impaired community. At least two regional Coalition MPs, the National Damian Drum and the Liberal Russell Broadbent, have said they intend to raise the issue with the minister for the NDIS, Stuart Robert. A spokeswoman for Robert said there had been \u201cno change to funding from the Australian Government to Vision Australia Radio\u201d. \u201cVision Australia Radio and more than 460 community broadcasters continue to receive significant funding from the Australia Government\u2019s independently operated Community Broadcasting program,\u201d she said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The spokeswoman said Vision Australia Radio could apply for grants offered through the NDIS and to the community radio sector. But Edwards said the grants programs suggested by the government would not fund services such as Vision Australia Radio. He said the non-profit remained \u201chopeful\u201d that Robert would agree to meet with the organisation and come to its aid. Labor\u2019s spokesman for the NDIS, Bill Shorten, called on the government to provide \u201cfunding certainty before it\u2019s too late\u201d. \u201cThe government must consider all options to keep this long-running and vital community service from closing down,\u201d Shorten said in a statement with Labor MPs Michelle Rowland and Lisa Chesters. This month, Broadbent called for a meeting between the federal communications department, the National Disability Insurance Agency, and the states. \u201cBut the bottom line is that to supply the radio service they\u2019re going to need nearly another three-quarters of a million dollars,\u201d he told parliament. \u201cThat used to come in block grants. There is no facility in NDIS for that block grant to come. So, we have a problem.

The Australia and New Zealand Ministerial Forum on Food Regulation ordered a review into the proposal, which has been welcomed by public health experts and parents\u2019 groups but has already received pushback from the beverages industry. On Monday the minister\u2019s forum called for a review into the labelling of added sugars in food and drinks, \u201cnoting that the option to quantify added sugars in the nutrition information panel best met the desired outcome\u201d. At present added sugar can be listed in the ingredients list in the nutritional information under at least 40 different names which can be confusing for shoppers. The forum also agreed \u201cthat a pictorial approach applied to sugary beverages / sugar-sweetened beverages warrants further consideration\u201d. The Public Health Association of Australia chief executive, Terry Slevin, said lawmakers should just get on with the job of making sugar labels happen. \u201cThe labelling of sugars on packaged foods and drinks needs to be enacted, rather than merely reviewed,\u201d he said. Curtin University department of health professor Colin Binns said there\u2019s merit in providing consumers with as much information as possible, but he noted industry was likely to put up a fight. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make it fairly simple,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s managed properly it will be fine.

According to Better Health Channel, experts recommend only a \u201cmoderate\u201d amount of sugar - no more than 10% of total energy intake per day should come from added sugars.

There are 15 teaspoons of sugar in a 600ml bottle of soft drink, nine teaspoons in a can and 33 teaspoons in a 1.25 litre bottle.

Adding a further system in addition to the health star rating is likely to confuse consumers,\u201d chief executive Geoff Parker said.

As far as we knew, we were just going camping in various parts of France, Italy or Germany. It was only years later, as I caught the wine bug myself, that I realised how many of the campsites my parents picked \u2013 from Burgundy to the Rheingau \u2013 just happened to be in some of Europe\u2019s most famous wine places.</p> <p>Luckily for my incurious teenage self, wine tourism in Europe in the 1980s didn\u2019t amount to much. For many producers, especially in France, members of the public were about as welcome as a tax inspector. I remember a trip to somewhere in, I think, the Loire where we saw a wobbly VHS film of vines in sunlight with a grandiose voiceover going on incomprehensibly about \u201cnature\u2019s handmaidens and Bacchus and patrimony\u201d. But that was pretty much it. My dad was mostly just happy to be near some famous vineyards, drinking the absurdly cheap wines in almost-always-beautiful situ.</p> <p>That would still be my favoured style of wine holiday: one of afternoons spent lazing around in a pool among the vines in, say, Portugal\u2019s Douro valley, still for me the most beautiful wine country in the world.

Sweating, shaking, constantly on the verge of toppling over, at least here I can partially blame the fact that the room keeps changing hue.</p> <p>That is because I am trying a 90-minute Spectrum yoga and meditation session, conducted in a special colour-shifting studio in Whitechapel, east London (available via <a href=\"https://www.movegb.com/move-more/tower-hamlets\" title=\"\">a MoveGB membership</a>, \u00a319.99 a week). On the wall at the front of the class are panels of large bulbs, emitting bright light. It is very Sunday Night at the London Palladium.

Colour has a biochemical, psychological, emotional effect on us. Think about food, or art, or the eyes of your beloved. The inside of McDonald\u2019s isn\u2019t bright red and yellow because it was designed by a clown; it is because those colours make us feel hungry and eat quickly, encouraging a high turnaround. (Actually, the seating these days is soft green and lower-lit. Nudging our minds to believe they are in Starbucks, perhaps? Why are you so stupid, mind?)</p> <p>After the yoga, there is a 25-minute guided meditation, in which we lie on the floor. This will, I think, be a better way for me to experience the vibrational potentialities of colour and focus on Jhamat\u2019s concept. We are offered the option of a blanket or a weighted eye mask, the latter of which surely defeats the point of bathing yourself in a colour field. Jhamat leads us through a guided meditation exploring our chakras, each of which \u2013 according to tantra \u2013 has a corresponding colour. We start bathed in red, the root chakra, before the bulbs soften into the orange of the sacral chakra and lighten into the yellow of the solar plexus chakra, the best chakra. \u201cTeam Plexus for the win!\u201d I chuckle inside my head, because I have difficulty controlling my stupid thoughts.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Jhamat is having trouble controlling the lights. They are meant to move through the spectrum, but are stuck on the green of the heart chakra. She is talking about the blue of the throat, the purple of the crown, but it doesn\u2019t match the mossy light filling the room. It is like being inside a faulty traffic light. Imagine if all traffic lights were stuck on green, I think, struggling to focus on \u201cthe indigo of my third eye\u201d. That would be the same as having no traffic lights. I see cars piling up on one another; twisted metal. This is not the class\u2019s intended effect.</p> <p>I peek to see Jhamat fiddling with the control box, then turning one of the light panels off and on, then giving up. I feel for her. She continues to talk to the class in a measured way, as if nothing is wrong. Behind me, someone is snoring. It has been an excellent yoga class, followed by a strange meditation experience with some gorgeous nu-rave colours. But I am not sure how much can be said for Spectrum, at least when the equipment isn\u2019t working properly. I am not convinced. Perhaps someone greenlit this too soon.</p> <h2><strong>Open </strong><strong>your </strong><strong>mind</strong></h2> <p>Studies have indicated that if we got rid of traffic lights, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/04/removal-road-markings-safer-fewer-accidents-drivers\" title=\"\">there would </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/04/removal-road-markings-safer-fewer-accidents-drivers\" title=\"\">be fewer accidents</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Wellness or </strong><strong>hellness?</strong></h2> <p>Yellow?

Meanwhile, Jhamat is having trouble controlling the lights. They are meant to move through the spectrum, but are stuck on the green of the heart chakra. She is talking about the blue of the throat, the purple of the crown, but it doesn\u2019t match the mossy light filling the room. It is like being inside a faulty traffic light. Imagine if all traffic lights were stuck on green, I think, struggling to focus on \u201cthe indigo of my third eye\u201d. That would be the same as having no traffic lights. I see cars piling up on one another; twisted metal. This is not the class\u2019s intended effect. I peek to see Jhamat fiddling with the control box, then turning one of the light panels off and on, then giving up. I feel for her. She continues to talk to the class in a measured way, as if nothing is wrong. Behind me, someone is snoring. It has been an excellent yoga class, followed by a strange meditation experience with some gorgeous nu-rave colours. But I am not sure how much can be said for Spectrum, at least when the equipment isn\u2019t working properly. I am not convinced. Perhaps someone greenlit this too soon. Open your mind Studies have indicated that if we got rid of traffic lights, there would be fewer accidents. Wellness or hellness? Yellow? Is it me you\u2019re looking for? No. 2/5",

      "bodyText": "Australia is taking at least six years to list habitats as threatened under national environment laws, an inquiry examining the country\u2019s extinction crisis has heard. The Humane Society International (HSI) also said that potential major threats to Australia\u2019s wildlife are going unexamined because \u201cwe\u2019re not even spending the meagre funds required\u201d to look into them. A Senate committee has been examining Australia\u2019s high rate of fauna extinction, which scientists have labelled a \u201cnational disgrace\u201d. An interim report tabled before the election recommended an overhaul of the country\u2019s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act and an independent national environmental authority. Evan Quartermain, the HSI\u2019s Australian head of programs, told a hearing in Sydney on Tuesday that cuts to the environment department\u2019s budget had caused the timeframe for listing ecological communities as threatened under the act to blow out and fewer assessments were occurring. Ecological communities are groups of plants, animals, and other organisms that are protected as a single habitat. HSI has been behind the nomination of 33 of the communities that are currently listed under federal law, as well as 73 individual threatened species. \u201cBut over the last decades of our involvement we\u2019ve unfortunately seen that there\u2019s much to be desired in the process of getting them listed and then how they\u2019re treated after that,\u201d Quartermain told the hearing. \u201cFrom the point where we nominate an ecological community, for example, we\u2019re expecting best case scenario that it\u2019s going to take six or seven years before that\u2019s actually on the list and receiving any protection.\u201d The most recent ecological communities listed as threatened under the act were two woodlands, one in Tasmania and the other in NSW and Queensland, that had been eligible for either a critically endangered or endangered status for years. But a decision on those listings was delayed by environment minister Sussan Ley\u2019s predecessors Josh Frydenberg and Melissa Price after lobbying from industry groups and MPs. Quartermain said there was a \u201cconsiderable risk\u201d to habitats already under stress when such time lags were allowed \u201cwith no scientific justification\u201d. The committee also heard from Tim Stephens, a professor of law at Sydney university, that Australia was failing to recognise key threatening processes, which are driving declines in endangered wildlife. A key threatening process is anything that threatens the survival of native species and it can be formally designated under the EPBC Act. Feral cats, introduced grasses, and incidental bycatch of birds or marine life are examples of threatening processes listed under the act. But Stephens told the committee that there had been \u201cinadequacies\u201d in the recognition of threatening processes under the act in recent years, and that some serious threats \u2013 such as ocean acidification \u2013 had not been given this formal designation. He said governments were also failing to match the listing of some threatening processes \u201cwith a threat abatement plan\u201d. Quartermain told senators that it had been almost a decade since a threatening process had been prioritised for assessment. \u201cWe know of at least one example of when the threatened species scientific committee has recommended a key threatening process be assessed but that was rebuffed by the department who said it would be too expensive,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "National Grid has blamed a lightning strike for Britain\u2019s biggest blackout in more than a decade after it caused two power generators to go offline. The strike was one of many to hit the grid on the same day as the 9 August blackouts but National Grid claims the bolt hit a transmission circuit north of London and managed to bring down two electricity generators more than 100 miles apart in an \u201cextremely rare and unexpected event\u201d. A report revealed National Grid was unable to cover the twin outages at a gas-fired power plant in Bedfordshire and an offshore wind farm off the east coast of England because it did not have enough backup. The outages took place within seconds of each other immediately after the strike, according to the report, causing disruptions across much of England and Wales. The report said the Hornsea offshore windfarm shut down after experiencing an unusual voltage fluctuation \u201ccoincident with the lightning\u201d. A spokeswoman for \u00d8rsted, the windfarm owner, declined to comment. RWE, the owner of the gas plant, has warned that it is too soon to say whether lightning had any impact on its operations because investigations into the root cause of its outage are ongoing. Prof Dieter Helm, a government adviser on energy policy, said: \u201cThe key point is that the power cut should never have happened in the first place. If power cuts can happen when just two power generators drop off, then something fundamental has gone wrong.\u201d National Grid had only 1,000MW in reserve as backup supply when the outages took place. The combined power capacity lost in the twin outages was more than 1,300MW. In addition, the strike may have also triggered outages at a string of \u201cembedded\u201d generators \u2013 such as small-scale renewables and diesel farms \u2013 totalling an estimated 500MW. These off-grid generators are not visible to National Grid, which can only estimate the amount of electricity they add by noting a fall in demand for on-grid electricity when they run and a rise in demand when they shut off. The energy regulator has responded by launching an investigation into whether National Grid\u2019s statutory requirements, which are set by Ofgem, require it to hold enough reserve electricity supplies to stabilise the grid following outages. The Guardian revealed National Grid had suffered three blackout \u201cnear misses\u201d in as many months after similar-sized outages in May, June and July, which were all greater than 1,000MW. Ofgem will also investigate whether the energy generators and regional energy networks responded correctly to the sudden loss in frequency caused by the power plants\u2019 trips. Jonathan Brearley, a senior executive at Ofgem, said the regulator had received the report and believed there were still areas that needed to be investigated. \u201cThis will ensure the industry learns the relevant lessons and clearly establish whether any firm breached their obligations to deliver secure power supplies to consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe power cuts of Friday 9 August caused interruptions to consumers\u2019 energy and significant disruption to commuters.

      "bodyText": "An employee at the UK\u2019s consulate in Hong Kong has been detained by mainland Chinese authorities on his way back to the city, his girlfriend has said. Simon Cheng, 28, was returning from a trip in Shenzhen to his native Hong Kong on 8 August when his girlfriend, Li, stopped receiving communications from him. A spokesman for the UK\u2019s Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: \u201cWe are extremely concerned by reports that a member of our team has been detained returning to Hong Kong from Shenzhen \u2026 We are providing support to his family and seeking further information from authorities in Guangdong province and Hong Kong.\u201d Li said Cheng had messaged her just before he went silent. \u201cReady to pass through the border \u2026 pray for me,\u201d he had written. More than 10 days later, Li and Cheng\u2019s family have not been able to get in touch with him. Li said Hong Kong immigration authorities had told her Cheng had been placed under \u201cadministrative detention\u201d in mainland China in an unknown location and for unknown reasons. The detention of Cheng, who works in the British consulate as a trade and investment officer for Scottish Development International, comes amid more than two months of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong that have threatened Beijing\u2019s authority over the city. In a separate development on Tuesday, two police officers were arrested after video emerged of them beating an older man on a hospital trolley, heaping further pressure on a force already facing accusations of brutality. The footage, recorded in late June, shows two uniformed officers assaulting the man with batons and holding a cloth over his mouth. There are no other people in the room as the officers abuse the patient over several minutes. Police said the man was under arrest at the time. Cheng\u2019s detention was first reported by the Hong Kong news site HK01. According to Li, he regularly travels to mainland China for meetings and had gone there most recently for work. Hong Kong immigration officials said in an emailed statement that they had contacted the city\u2019s liaison office in Guangdong province as well as the Hong Kong government \u201cto understand the situation\u201d and provide further assistance to the family. Hong Kong has been rocked by mass protests triggered by a bill that would allow the extradition of suspects to mainland China. Cheng\u2019s case further underlines fears of a lack of transparency and fairness in the mainland Chinese judicial system and the possibility that Hongkongers may be detained for political reasons. Under administrative detention, under which authorities can detain and interrogate people for a broad number of offences, Cheng can be held for up to 15 days without charge. Human rights advocates say torture and other forms of ill treatment are common under this type of detention. Li said she was not aware of Cheng participating in the protests or expressed his position on the movement in any public forums. \u201cAs far as I know, he did not attend any of the protests, even the 1 million march. I am just worried about him,\u201d she said. Cheng, who studied political economy at the London School of Economics, described himself as a \u201csocial activist\u201d on his Facebook page. In early June, just before the mass protests began, he posted a yellow sign with people holding umbrellas \u2013 possibly a reference to the 2014 pro-democracy \u201cUmbrella movement\u201d in Hong Kong \u2013 and the words: \u201cIt\u2019s the spirit that defines us.\u201d Li, who met Cheng while he was studying in Taiwan \u2013 where she is from \u2013 has been calling and writing to British, Chinese, and Hong Kong officials for help. \u201cHe grew up to be a very caring, diligent and hardworking person,\u201d Li said. \u201cNow, he is missing and detained for no reason. This is deeply distressing for his family and friends.\u201d Li said she and Cheng had discussed marriage, and possibly moving back to Taiwan, but Cheng wanted to remain in Hong Kong. \u201cHe said he loves Hong Kong and wanted to sacrifice all he has for his motherland.\u201d More than a million Hong Kong residents defied a police ban and poured into the streets on Sunday in a peaceful march, calling for the withdrawal of the extradition bill and other demands. Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said on Tuesday she would set up \u201ca platform for dialogue\u201d to tackle complaints against the police in the government\u2019s first attempt at conciliation in weeks. A rally in Cheng\u2019s name has been called for outside the British consulate on Wednesday. In recent weeks, Beijing has taken an increasingly hard line against the protests, which it has described as an attempt to start a \u201ccolour revolution\u201d. Twitter blocked almost 1,000 accounts associated with the Chinese government on Monday while Facebook also removed seven pages, three groups and five accounts that originated in China. China has repeatedly warned Britain \u2013 the former colonial ruler of Hong Kong \u2013 against \u201cinterference\u201d. Chinese immigration officials have increased checks at the border between mainland China and Hong Kong, detaining people and checking their phones and other devices.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has written to the EU suggesting the backstop could be replaced by some form of commitment to prevent a hard Irish border in his first major move to explain the UK government\u2019s new position to Brussels. Ahead of talks with Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, Johnson released a four-page letter setting out his position that the backstop is \u201canti-democratic and inconsistent with the sovereignty of the UK\u201d, because it could keep the UK indefinitely in a customs union with no means of exit. He proposed that alternative customs arrangements could be put in place at the Irish border within the two-year transitional period after Brexit, but suggested some unspecified commitments could give confidence that there will be no hard border on the island if this system is not ready by that point. The release of the letter, addressed to Donald Tusk, the European council president, appears intended to portray Johnson as willing to negotiate with Brussels, even though he is making a demand for the abolition of the backstop that they have repeatedly rebuffed. On Monday night Brussels sources once again ruled out any renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop. \u201cThere was a two and a half year negotiating process in which the EU compromised, including on the question of the backstop,\u201d a well-informed source told the Guardian. \u201cThe withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation and the backstop is not open for change. A legally operable backstop to avoid a hard border remains central to the withdrawal agreement for the EU27.\u201d Earlier in the day, the prime minister claimed to be confident that EU leaders would be receptive to his arguments, but said he was still willing to pursue a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, despite the leak of a confidential Operation Yellowhammer paper predicting it would cause food, medicine and petrol shortages as well as public unrest.

The EU did not immediately respond to the letter but the bloc has been clear from the start it will not reopen the withdrawal agreement and the backstop is not up for negotiation. Johnson\u2019s proposal of alternative arrangements is a longstanding demand of Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs who claim solutions can be found to get around the need for checks and infrastructure at the border, despite critics saying the technology does not exist. However, the idea of commitments to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland appears to be a new proposal and may fuel speculation that Johnson would be open to a device similar to the backstop that he can rebadge as a concession.

      "body": "<p>If you have booked a hire car for your summer holiday, beware. Although rental firms know full well that flights are subject to delays and cancellations, some are profiting extortionately from passengers who arrive later or earlier than expected.</p> <p>The sorry tales below suggest that, as with flight tickets, it can be best to avoid third-party brokers and book directly through the hire company so you can liaise directly.</p> <p><strong>My easyJet flight to Barcelona in September has been cancelled and I\u2019ve had to rebook a flight that arrives two hours earlier.</strong></p> <p><strong>I already had a reservation with Europcar made through Enjoy Car Hire, and I told the latter of the earlier arrival time. A prompt reply informed me I would have to pay an additional \u00a3590.46 (three times the original contract price) to make the change. Thus, to save waiting for two hours, I would have to pay \u00a34.92 a minute for 120 minutes!</strong></p> <p><strong>Enjoy advised me to contact Europcar direct, which I did. It confirmed I would have to cancel and rebook to make the amendment, but it couldn\u2019t help as I\u2019d booked through Enjoy.</strong></p> <p><strong>Obviously, I will not pay this absurd amount and therefore face wasting two hours in the Europcar office waiting for the magic hour.</strong><br><em><strong>DH, London</strong></em></p> <p>Enjoy declined to comment, but its response to you explained that if a customer changes the time on a reservation, the entire booking is recalculated at current prices, which means your deal soared from \u00a3198 to \u00a3786. Its T&amp;Cs state amendments can be made for no charge, unless they are \u201ca material change to the booking such as its duration\u201d or if the hire company changes its rates after the original booking.</p> <p>A two-hour alteration caused by a cancelled flight ought not to be deemed \u201cmaterial\u201d for a company that operates from an airport, and Enjoy\u2019s FAQs on cancelled flights makes no mention of extra costs.</p> <p>Europcar\u2019s response would appear to bear out Enjoy\u2019s stance.</p> <p>However, Europcar insists that it makes no charge for changes to collection or drop-off times within a 24-hour period provided the number of booking days remains the same. \u201cAs he did not book direct with Europcar, the company cannot comment on the rental broker\u2019s response to his request,\u201d it says.</p> <p>After the <em>Observer </em>stepped in, it agreed to make the amendment at no cost.</p> <p><strong>We booked our hire car with Goldcar via Holiday Autos to be collected from Antalya Airport. Our flight was delayed by an hour and the hire desk had closed when we reached it. We tried Holiday Autos \u201c24/7\u201d helpline, but no answer. We therefore had get a taxi to Antalya and scrambled around to find a hotel. The next morning we took a taxi back to the Goldcar desk where we learned that our car had been given away as we were down as a \u201cno show\u201d, despite the fact that we had supplied our flight number when we booked.</strong></p> <p><strong>Holiday Autos insisted there was nothing that could be done at their end and it was down to the local rental company to resolve.</strong></p> <p><strong>Goldcar eventually said we could pay extra to rent a higher grade vehicle, and we reluctantly agreed so we could get on with our holiday.</strong></p> <p><strong>Holiday Autos refused to refund the extra cost and pointed us to its Ts&amp;Cs which state that if the vehicle is not released due to a late arrival, no funds will be reimbursed. This is crazy, as I am sure I am not the first person to have a delay to our flight!</strong><br><em><strong>JL, Cardiff</strong></em></p> <p>Holiday Autos did not respond to a request for a comment. Goldcar blames the fact you booked through a third party and claims it could not get in touch with you when you were delayed because, bizarrely, brokers do not pass on customer contact details. \u201cThis is an ongoing industry-wide issue car rental firms are looking to address, particularly with late-night bookings when offices are closing,\u201d it says.</p> <p>The firm admits it had your flight number so would have known you were going to be late, but that didn\u2019t stop it voiding your reservation.</p> <p>Goldcar has form on this. I reported in May the experience of a reader who was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/may/05/goldcar-holiday-car-hire-cheap-deal-cancel-change-booking\" title=\"\"> denied his hire car and a refund </a>after he forewarned them his flight had been rescheduled. </p> <p>Goldcar, recently taken over by Europcar, admits there is a problem with its policies and its customer service, but seems to class delayed flights as rare events. \u201cWe recognise that our existing terms and conditions do not adequately deal with this specific situation,\u201d it says. \u201cIn February we announced a programme of change to ensure that our leading low-cost offer is matched by good customer experience. The scale of this overhaul should not be underestimated. Clarification of our T&amp;Cs is a part of this ongoing change programme.\u201d</p> <p>After pressure from the <em>Observer </em>it agreed to refund the upgrade \u2013 but as a \u201cgesture of goodwill\u201d rather than because it failed you.</p> <p><em>If you need help email Anna Tims at <a href=\"mailto:your.problems@observer.co.uk\">your.problems@observer.co.uk</a> or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

      "bodyText": "If you have booked a hire car for your summer holiday, beware. Although rental firms know full well that flights are subject to delays and cancellations, some are profiting extortionately from passengers who arrive later or earlier than expected. The sorry tales below suggest that, as with flight tickets, it can be best to avoid third-party brokers and book directly through the hire company so you can liaise directly. My easyJet flight to Barcelona in September has been cancelled and I\u2019ve had to rebook a flight that arrives two hours earlier. I already had a reservation with Europcar made through Enjoy Car Hire, and I told the latter of the earlier arrival time. A prompt reply informed me I would have to pay an additional \u00a3590.46 (three times the original contract price) to make the change. Thus, to save waiting for two hours, I would have to pay \u00a34.92 a minute for 120 minutes! Enjoy advised me to contact Europcar direct, which I did. It confirmed I would have to cancel and rebook to make the amendment, but it couldn\u2019t help as I\u2019d booked through Enjoy. Obviously, I will not pay this absurd amount and therefore face wasting two hours in the Europcar office waiting for the magic hour. DH, London Enjoy declined to comment, but its response to you explained that if a customer changes the time on a reservation, the entire booking is recalculated at current prices, which means your deal soared from \u00a3198 to \u00a3786. Its T&amp;Cs state amendments can be made for no charge, unless they are \u201ca material change to the booking such as its duration\u201d or if the hire company changes its rates after the original booking. A two-hour alteration caused by a cancelled flight ought not to be deemed \u201cmaterial\u201d for a company that operates from an airport, and Enjoy\u2019s FAQs on cancelled flights makes no mention of extra costs. Europcar\u2019s response would appear to bear out Enjoy\u2019s stance. However, Europcar insists that it makes no charge for changes to collection or drop-off times within a 24-hour period provided the number of booking days remains the same. \u201cAs he did not book direct with Europcar, the company cannot comment on the rental broker\u2019s response to his request,\u201d it says. After the Observer stepped in, it agreed to make the amendment at no cost. We booked our hire car with Goldcar via Holiday Autos to be collected from Antalya Airport. Our flight was delayed by an hour and the hire desk had closed when we reached it. We tried Holiday Autos \u201c24/7\u201d helpline, but no answer. We therefore had get a taxi to Antalya and scrambled around to find a hotel. The next morning we took a taxi back to the Goldcar desk where we learned that our car had been given away as we were down as a \u201cno show\u201d, despite the fact that we had supplied our flight number when we booked. Holiday Autos insisted there was nothing that could be done at their end and it was down to the local rental company to resolve. Goldcar eventually said we could pay extra to rent a higher grade vehicle, and we reluctantly agreed so we could get on with our holiday. Holiday Autos refused to refund the extra cost and pointed us to its Ts&amp;Cs which state that if the vehicle is not released due to a late arrival, no funds will be reimbursed. This is crazy, as I am sure I am not the first person to have a delay to our flight! JL, Cardiff Holiday Autos did not respond to a request for a comment. Goldcar blames the fact you booked through a third party and claims it could not get in touch with you when you were delayed because, bizarrely, brokers do not pass on customer contact details. \u201cThis is an ongoing industry-wide issue car rental firms are looking to address, particularly with late-night bookings when offices are closing,\u201d it says. The firm admits it had your flight number so would have known you were going to be late, but that didn\u2019t stop it voiding your reservation. Goldcar has form on this. I reported in May the experience of a reader who was denied his hire car and a refund after he forewarned them his flight had been rescheduled. Goldcar, recently taken over by Europcar, admits there is a problem with its policies and its customer service, but seems to class delayed flights as rare events. \u201cWe recognise that our existing terms and conditions do not adequately deal with this specific situation,\u201d it says. \u201cIn February we announced a programme of change to ensure that our leading low-cost offer is matched by good customer experience. The scale of this overhaul should not be underestimated. Clarification of our T&amp;Cs is a part of this ongoing change programme.\u201d After pressure from the Observer it agreed to refund the upgrade \u2013 but as a \u201cgesture of goodwill\u201d rather than because it failed you.

She was also forced to have sex with soldiers.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we reached the military base, I was assigned to a certain soldier as his wife. He was older [about 40]. But I refused and I was beaten,\u201d says Patricia, now 17, sitting under a mango tree at her parents\u2019 home.</p> <p>\u201cI resisted for two weeks. But one night this man came and grabbed me. I tried to fight and wrestle with him. But he was strong and overpowered me. I tried making noise and alarm, but nobody came to my rescue.\u201d</p> <p>Her sister sat helplessly as Patricia was raped. After that, the rapes continued almost daily.</p> <p>On 7 February 2018, her ordeal at the hands of the rebel soldiers came to an end. She was released in Yambio as part of the deal reached by authorities in Juba and the rebel group. When she went home, she was four months pregnant.</p> <p>The number of children used in armed conflict worldwide has more than doubled since 2012, with a 159% rise and almost 30,000 children recruited, according to <a href=\"https://www.child-soldiers.org/News/child-soldier-levels-have-doubled-since-2012-and-girls-exploitation-is-rising\">Child Soldiers International</a>.</p> <p>As a child soldier, Patricia was entitled to receive emotional, physical and practical support from UN and child protection agencies. </p> <p>But almost 18 months on, she\u2019s still struggling to come to terms with the trauma of what happened to her, and finding it hard to earn money to support herself and her one-year-old son.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ee6057061a06d89d33f182b9be9dc6a25dd9c57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ee6057061a06d89d33f182b9be9dc6a25dd9c57/0_111_4022_2414/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patricia* with her baby at their home in Yambio, west of Juba\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patricia* with her baby at their home in Yambio, west of Juba.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Okiror</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI keep having flashbacks.

Girls are often subjected to sexual violence. Recruiting children under 15 constitutes a war crime, although despite an international focus on ending impunity, very few war crimes are investigated.</p> <p>Since February last year, 360 girls and 610 boys have been released in Yambio through the National Demobilisation, Disarmament and Reintegration Commission (DDR), in partnership with Unicef and the UN mission in South Sudan. More than 3,000 children have been released in other states.</p> <p>When she was demobbed, Patricia, like other child combatants, received a reintegration package including clothes, bed sheets, shoes, three months of food rations and other basic items. She was assessed by staff at M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) and has been assigned a social worker. It is hoped that with the support of the social worker and her family, Patricia will be able to move on with her life.</p> <p>\u201cPatricia sometimes talks to her mother about her past, which is one of the best support circles for psychosocial support wellbeing. She is responsive and developing her relationship with her sister which is also a good sign,\u201d says Vanessa Saraiva, World Vision senior adviser in South Sudan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f80a1a7ffc0e500a4bedeab06367243b22dec704\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f80a1a7ffc0e500a4bedeab06367243b22dec704/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman who was abducted in South Sudan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Community support is crucial in helping children reintegrate\u2019, says Vanessa Saraiva, World Vision.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Holt/Unicef</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOver time, these [counselling] sessions will enable Patricia to process what has happened, heal from those experiences and build a resilience to move on in normality,\u201d says Saraiva.</p> <p>\u201cCommunity support is also crucial, especially in helping children reintegrate back into their own communities and their families,\u201d she says.</p> <p>At least 752 former child soldiers in Yambio have received psychosocial support and case management services through World Vision.

It is, however, recognised as a problem, in certain areas, to identify girls leaving the armed forces and groups, because they do not want the stigma of being identified,\u201d said<strong> </strong>Lieby.</p> <p>\u201cGirls, therefore, often return to the community by themselves and do not come forward to be identified for assistance.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a20d25308f3587bdac47d5c784094207fdfa5085\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a20d25308f3587bdac47d5c784094207fdfa5085/0_305_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children take part in a ceremony in which more than 100 children were released by two armed groups in Yambio in South Sudan on 7 August 2018, bringing the total number released in 2018 to more than 900.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demobbed girls are offered vocational training under UN guidelines.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Aldworth/Unicef</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.unddr.org/uploads/documents/Operational%20Guide.pdf\">UN guidelines</a>, demobbed girls should be offered vocational training \u201cin all types of occupations, including those traditionally limited to men and boys\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Late one night in April 2015, 13-year-old Patricia* and her sister, who was 11, were kidnapped from their beds by rebel forces fighting the government in South Sudan. The girls were taken from their home in a raid on their village by the South Sudan National Liberation Movement in Yambio county, not far from the border of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Although she spied on government troops during her captivity, Patricia\u2019s main job was carrying food and cooking. She was also forced to have sex with soldiers. \u201cWhen we reached the military base, I was assigned to a certain soldier as his wife. He was older [about 40]. But I refused and I was beaten,\u201d says Patricia, now 17, sitting under a mango tree at her parents\u2019 home. \u201cI resisted for two weeks. But one night this man came and grabbed me. I tried to fight and wrestle with him. But he was strong and overpowered me. I tried making noise and alarm, but nobody came to my rescue.\u201d Her sister sat helplessly as Patricia was raped. After that, the rapes continued almost daily. On 7 February 2018, her ordeal at the hands of the rebel soldiers came to an end. She was released in Yambio as part of the deal reached by authorities in Juba and the rebel group. When she went home, she was four months pregnant. The number of children used in armed conflict worldwide has more than doubled since 2012, with a 159% rise and almost 30,000 children recruited, according to Child Soldiers International. As a child soldier, Patricia was entitled to receive emotional, physical and practical support from UN and child protection agencies. But almost 18 months on, she\u2019s still struggling to come to terms with the trauma of what happened to her, and finding it hard to earn money to support herself and her one-year-old son. \u201cI keep having flashbacks. At times I feel so bad and frustrated. I isolate myself from people,\u201d says Patricia. \u201cIt\u2019s mum who tries to counsel and advise me to forget about the past and move on. But it\u2019s difficult. I need medication to help me.\u201d Since fighting broke out in South Sudan in December 2013, more than 19,000 children are understood to have been \u201crecruited\u201d by armed forces and groups, according to a briefing published by the UN children\u2019s fund, Unicef, in March. Children can be used as fighters, cooks, porters, messengers and spies. Girls are often subjected to sexual violence. Recruiting children under 15 constitutes a war crime, although despite an international focus on ending impunity, very few war crimes are investigated. Since February last year, 360 girls and 610 boys have been released in Yambio through the National Demobilisation, Disarmament and Reintegration Commission (DDR), in partnership with Unicef and the UN mission in South Sudan. More than 3,000 children have been released in other states. When she was demobbed, Patricia, like other child combatants, received a reintegration package including clothes, bed sheets, shoes, three months of food rations and other basic items. She was assessed by staff at M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) and has been assigned a social worker. It is hoped that with the support of the social worker and her family, Patricia will be able to move on with her life. \u201cPatricia sometimes talks to her mother about her past, which is one of the best support circles for psychosocial support wellbeing. She is responsive and developing her relationship with her sister which is also a good sign,\u201d says Vanessa Saraiva, World Vision senior adviser in South Sudan. \u201cOver time, these [counselling] sessions will enable Patricia to process what has happened, heal from those experiences and build a resilience to move on in normality,\u201d says Saraiva. \u201cCommunity support is also crucial, especially in helping children reintegrate back into their own communities and their families,\u201d she says. At least 752 former child soldiers in Yambio have received psychosocial support and case management services through World Vision. In addition, 200 have graduated from vocational skills training, 80 have been given support to start small businesses, and 60 have been given the resources they need to work in agriculture through the charity, which is campaigning for more UK aid money to be spent on protecting children in crises. However, Luciano Damian Canchelara, an MSF mental health activity manager, based in Yambio, says this is not enough. \u201cOrganisations are providing some services but in some cases this is not enough, and the children still struggle a lot.\u201d Jean Lieby, chief of child protection for Unicef in South Sudan, said fear and stigma sometimes mean girls and women miss out on getting the full support they need. \u201cGirls are given special attention, and offered counselling following the screening. It is, however, recognised as a problem, in certain areas, to identify girls leaving the armed forces and groups, because they do not want the stigma of being identified,\u201d said Lieby. \u201cGirls, therefore, often return to the community by themselves and do not come forward to be identified for assistance.\u201d According to UN guidelines, demobbed girls should be offered vocational training \u201cin all types of occupations, including those traditionally limited to men and boys\u201d. Such support should be boosted with resources to help improve girls\u2019 education. Patricia says she doesn\u2019t feel she has received adequate support to cope with her experiences and to deal with life back home with a baby. \u201cI feel frustrated. I find it hard to take care of myself and the baby. I have to do casual work to get money. I have to do farming to get money for food, treatment and buying baby clothes. \u201cI have no one to assist me. My parents are poor. They can\u2019t support me and the baby adequately. I need help,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore I was kidnapped I had friends. But when I returned from captivity nobody wanted to be close to me.\u201d Despite returning home last year, Patricia had to wait until July before she could enrol on a six-month sewing course that could help her earn a living as a tailor. After she finishes the training, she will be given a start-up kit so she can start her own business. \u201cI can\u2019t manage to go back to school. But I want to support my sister with her education. If she studies, she will help our parents who didn\u2019t go to school,\u201d she says. * Names have been changed to protect identities",

If you approach love-making as though there is a goal to achieve \u2013 or even with the main intention of being good at it \u2013 you will fail to enjoy it fully. During lovemaking, try to make your principal aim simply giving and receiving pleasure. Approach sex in the knowledge that it is common and normative to lose your erection from time to time \u2013 and that erectile failure is more likely to happen if you are nervous and goal-oriented. Instead of trying to even the score, simply allow yourself to receive pleasure as well as give it. You are married to someone you love and she seems to be sexually fulfilled; all you have to do is to relax and enjoy being with her ... without counting climaxes. \u2022Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders. \u2022If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don\u2019t send attachments).

Several casino workers have alleged wrongful terminations for engaging in union activity at Station Casino properties, and current workers report that the company continues to fire workers without just cause as Nevada is an employment \u201cat will\u201d state, which grants employers the right to terminate employment at anytime for any reason. \u201cThe management hasn\u2019t recognized the union because they do whatever they want to workers and with the union, they won\u2019t be able to do that anymore,\u201d said Paola Felix, a guest room attendant at Green Valley Ranch Resort. \u201cWithout a union contract to protect you, you don\u2019t get a chance to defend yourself, they just terminate you for no reason.\u201d When the first Station Casinos property voted to unionize in September 2016, company management sent out memos to all its employees that health benefits would be increased for all employees except those who had unionized. As part of an NLRB settlement in March 2017, Station Casinos agreed to recognize the union at Palace Station Casino and reimburse the workers at Boulder Station for lower healthcare premiums they were denied. \u201cThey\u2019ve filed legal challenge after legal challenge,\u201d said Gunaydin Milli, a uniform room attendant at Palms Resort &amp; Casino since 2008, where around 900 workers voted to unionize in April 2018. In May 2019, the NLRB ruled the resort was violating federal labor law by refusing to bargain with the union, but a union contract has still yet to be negotiated as Station Casinos is appealing the ruling in federal court. \u201cThey\u2019ve refused to negotiate with us and they\u2019re breaking the law. The hard work we do everyday makes the company successful. We deserve to have something to show for it too,\u201d said Milli. The most recent union elections occurred at Station Casinos\u2019 Sunset Hotel &amp; Casino, with 83% voting in favor of the union, and Fiesta Rancho Hotel &amp; Casino, with 85% voting for the union. Casino workers have held numerous protests and rallies calling on Station Casinos to negotiate with the unions and to cease union busting at properties where union organizing drives are ongoing. \u201cThe company has been fighting these workers for a long time,\u201d said Geoconda Arg\u00fcello-Kline, secretary-treasurer for the Culinary Workers Union, Local 226. \u201cWhat the company has been doing is sending a message to workers they do not respect the democratic way these workers voted \u2018yes\u2019 to be represented by the Culinary Union.\u201d 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro has recently called on Station Casinos to negotiate with the six unions. Senator Bernie Sanders has also publicly called on the Trump-supporting casino owners to negotiate. The struggle is expected to gain more attention as Democratic presidential candidates compete for support from the Culinary Union ahead of the Nevada Democratic Caucuses in February 2020. A spokesperson for Red Rock Resorts, the parent company of Station Casinos, Michael Britt told the Guardian in an email: \u201cWith respect to both Palms and Green Valley Ranch, although the union would clearly prefer that we not exercise our legal right to challenge the National Labor Review Board\u2019s (NLRB) decisions regarding those properties in the United States federal courts \u2013 we have every right to do so and our challenges are both legal and appropriate.\u201d They declined to clarify the reasons behind those challenges. In Red Rock Resort\u2019s most recent annual report, the company claimed, \u201cUnion organization activities could disrupt our business by discouraging patrons from visiting our properties, causing labor disputes or work stoppages, and, if successful, could significantly increase our labor costs.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Back in the early 1990s, a lone Pakistani boy appeared in my otherwise entirely white primary school class. If that wasn\u2019t isolating enough for him, each week, as we went into the assembly hall for hymn practice, he would be quietly ushered away. An hour later, we were reunited \u2013 the rest of us with heightened voices, him with a box of freshly sharpened pencils, which he had laboured at while we were gone. Every week, for an hour a week, over four school years. That\u2019s 156 hours of sharpening pencils on his own. Just for being Muslim, in a school that was supposed to cater for everyone.</p> <p>This bonkers situation occurred because of a rule passed in 1944 as part of the settlement that brought religious schools under the state\u2019s jurisdiction. Every English school is legally required to have its children take part in \u201ccollective daily worship\u201d every day. Even if the school is secular, even if the school is packed to the rafters with atheists.</p> <p>In faith schools, this makes sense. They do faith-based assembly, of whatever religion, and get on with the day. But even in secular schools, which are the majority of state schools, teachers are supposed to lead children in a \u201cbroadly Christian\u201d daily act of worship, which really means that for at least 51% of the time God must be involved.</p> <p>Happily, the rule is regularly flouted. My primary school did its weekly hymn-singing session instead of daily prayers. Around half of primary schools are thought to have <a href=\"https://teachertapp.co.uk/teachers-are-losing-their-religion-how-religious-are-teachers/\" title=\"\">no daily worship</a>, and almost no secular secondary schools seem to bother. Ofsted, the schools inspectorate, declared in 2004 that it would stop even checking.</p> <p>But while half of secular primary schools completely ignore the rule, the other half don\u2019t. Which is why two parents, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/29/parents-launch-court-action-over-christian-school-assemblies\" title=\"\">Lee and Lizanne Harris</a>, are taking a case to court in the autumn after their children were made to take part in Christian prayers during school assemblies even though Burford primary school is a community school with no religious character. They withdrew their children from the assemblies, but the Harris family say the children were then put in a room with an iPad and a supervisor. Better than sharpening pencils, but not by much.</p> <p>The Harrises believe their children should be provided with an alternative, inclusive assembly. If that sounds like a hippy impossibility, I can promise it\u2019s not. See, there\u2019s a further quirk in the law.

      "bodyText": "Back in the early 1990s, a lone Pakistani boy appeared in my otherwise entirely white primary school class. If that wasn\u2019t isolating enough for him, each week, as we went into the assembly hall for hymn practice, he would be quietly ushered away. An hour later, we were reunited \u2013 the rest of us with heightened voices, him with a box of freshly sharpened pencils, which he had laboured at while we were gone. Every week, for an hour a week, over four school years. That\u2019s 156 hours of sharpening pencils on his own. Just for being Muslim, in a school that was supposed to cater for everyone. This bonkers situation occurred because of a rule passed in 1944 as part of the settlement that brought religious schools under the state\u2019s jurisdiction. Every English school is legally required to have its children take part in \u201ccollective daily worship\u201d every day. Even if the school is secular, even if the school is packed to the rafters with atheists. In faith schools, this makes sense. They do faith-based assembly, of whatever religion, and get on with the day. But even in secular schools, which are the majority of state schools, teachers are supposed to lead children in a \u201cbroadly Christian\u201d daily act of worship, which really means that for at least 51% of the time God must be involved. Happily, the rule is regularly flouted. My primary school did its weekly hymn-singing session instead of daily prayers. Around half of primary schools are thought to have no daily worship, and almost no secular secondary schools seem to bother. Ofsted, the schools inspectorate, declared in 2004 that it would stop even checking. But while half of secular primary schools completely ignore the rule, the other half don\u2019t. Which is why two parents, Lee and Lizanne Harris, are taking a case to court in the autumn after their children were made to take part in Christian prayers during school assemblies even though Burford primary school is a community school with no religious character. They withdrew their children from the assemblies, but the Harris family say the children were then put in a room with an iPad and a supervisor. Better than sharpening pencils, but not by much. The Harrises believe their children should be provided with an alternative, inclusive assembly. If that sounds like a hippy impossibility, I can promise it\u2019s not. See, there\u2019s a further quirk in the law. If a school doesn\u2019t want to do Christian daily worship, it can apply to the local authority to carry out \u2013 I kid you not \u2013 daily \u201cworship\u201d of a non-religious nature. The process is incredibly onerous but a few hundred schools have taken this step. I know this because the school where I first taught dug in, did the lengthy form-filling, and received the exemption.

Tougher building rules for skyscrapers have been drawn up by the City of London to stem the creation of \u201cconcrete canyons\u201d that generate winds capable of knocking over a pedestrian or cyclist. Developers will have to use wind tunnels, computer simulations and scale models, and will have to change designs if they are likely to affect passersby. A host of skyscrapers have joined the London skyline in recent years including the Leadenhall Building, known locally as the \u201cCheesegrater\u201d, and the notorious \u201cWalkie-Talkie\u201d at 20 Fenchurch Street where fierce downdraughts have been reported. In Leeds, the Bridgewater Place tower has caused multiple road closures and a pedestrian died when a lorry was blown over.

Because I am unfashionably \u2013 freakishly \u2013 early. The small resort of San Jos\u00e9, the most accessible of the Cabo de Gata bays, is packed, but in Spain rising early to grab a spot, communing with nature and enjoying the relative balminess isn\u2019t a thing. So, while hotels and apartments are stuffed to the gills, at 9am the town is still quiet: the bucket-and-spade kiosk shuttered, sparrows pecking below the swings, tomatoes still being grated for the breakfast <em>tostadas</em> at the beachfront Vittoria cafe, and zero action at the churreria truck.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/aug/2019-08-19T16:38:34.html\" data-alt=\"Spain map.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/aug/2019-08-19T16:38:34.html\">Spain map.</a> </figure>  <p>Aside from three women neck deep in water, my fellow early-birders are non-natives: Alain, crossing the calm bay in a slow crawl, is French, and Maria Carmen, her deckchair facing east, is an Argentinian spending the summer with her niece who works in town. \u201cShe drops me off at 8am and picks me up at midday.

      "bodyText": "Morning It\u2019s peak holiday week, 28C on the coast of Almer\u00eda, but I am one of only six people on the beach. Why? Because I am unfashionably \u2013 freakishly \u2013 early. The small resort of San Jos\u00e9, the most accessible of the Cabo de Gata bays, is packed, but in Spain rising early to grab a spot, communing with nature and enjoying the relative balminess isn\u2019t a thing. So, while hotels and apartments are stuffed to the gills, at 9am the town is still quiet: the bucket-and-spade kiosk shuttered, sparrows pecking below the swings, tomatoes still being grated for the breakfast tostadas at the beachfront Vittoria cafe, and zero action at the churreria truck. Aside from three women neck deep in water, my fellow early-birders are non-natives: Alain, crossing the calm bay in a slow crawl, is French, and Maria Carmen, her deckchair facing east, is an Argentinian spending the summer with her niece who works in town. \u201cShe drops me off at 8am and picks me up at midday. It\u2019s ideal. The beach, at this time is beautiful, charming. Later on, it\u2019s too much.\u201d Or certainly different. While Cabo is off-the-beaten track in winter, in peak summer Spanish city-dwellers flock here to embrace the idea of traditional family seaside fun on a packed beaches. The easy, child-centric sociability of a Spanish crowd, the noise, happiness and total annihilation of personal space is, weirdly, hard not to love. \u201cSome foreigners come to read a book or look at an iPad, and shush their kids,\u201d says Maria from Zaragoza, baffled. \u201cThey\u2019re crazy!\u201d By mid-morning, turquoise, yellow and green beach umbrellas stretch from end to end, and the shoreline paseo begins: fit posers, paunchy men in Speedos, kids, women of all ages in bikinis, or topless, all striding by with loose-limbed barefoot grace. A vendor passes selling sarongs, leather wristbands, CDs, and boxes of Y-fronts. Tourists assemble at wooden kiosks offering paddleboarding, boat tours and kayaking. Happy Kayak\u2019s affable instructor Enol shows a group how to paddle and stay afloat and, soon after, a vermilion flotilla wobbles along an avenue of buoys to the caves and crystalline snorkelling spots that the rocky coastline is famed for. All this I observe from my shady tumbona, one half of 40 pairs of loungers set under straw parasols, and at \u20ac5 a day an excellent investment \u2013 no matter they are so closely packed I can read my neighbour\u2019s Rumore gossip magazine and have to duck when his wife bends over to adjust her towel. Most beach-lovers drag their own furniture across the smouldering sand. Natalia from Barcelona and her 17 friends and family have a solid bench-table-umbrella combo flanked by tent camp and industrial-size cold boxes. \u201cWe\u2019ve brought everything, including too much food: tuna, tortilla, bread, oil, my aunt\u2019s pasta salad,\u201d she says. \u201cBut\u201d, she adds, laughing, \u201calso lots of fit men to carry it.\u201d Similar encampments line the shore, eight deep, and all groups are huge.

She has elicited a world-class performance from Franciosi, in a demanding and harrowing role. Ganambarr is charismatic, with strong physicality, and Kent\u2019s collaboration with the Tasmanian Aboriginal community \u2013 including elder Jim Everett \u2013 brings cultural authenticity to his characterisation. (The Nightingale also claims to be the first full-length feature to use Palawa Kani, a dialect reconstructed from near-extinct Indigenous Tasmanian languages). Claflin, Damon Herriman and Harry Greenwood make sinister colonialists, and Charlie Shotwell, as the young orphan Eddie, is captivating each time he appears.</p> <p>All these white men grow more inhumane as they undertake the callous, violent work of clearing the colony of Aboriginal people and their culture, through point blank mass murders, sexual assaults, and the debasement and defiling of men, women and children.</p> <p>Violence in The Nightingale<em> </em>is unrelenting.

The audience is left in no doubt about the savagery by which Aboriginal people were dispossessed of the land during the ferocious inhumanity and genocide that Australia was founded on \u2013 an important acknowledgement as the country continues to engage in discussions about constitutional recognition and treaty.</p> <p>But in its ambitious attempt to interrogate the complex power dynamics between the coloniser and the colonised, Clare\u2019s story steps into murkier territory, which it traverses it less successfully.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/mar/04/the-killing-times-the-massacres-of-aboriginal-people-australia-must-confront\">The Killing Times: the massacres of Aboriginal people Australia must confront</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And this is clearly Clare\u2019s story: the film starts with Clare and ends on her gaze, privileging her point of view. It is from Clare\u2019s perspective that the connections between her situation and that of Aboriginal people like Billy are explored. The viewer is asked to sympathise with the similarities of their plights: both have had their families taken from them, both sing in their traditional tongues (Clare in Gaelic), both are powerless within the colonial society being imposed on them. Clare goes to great lengths to explain that she is Irish, <em>not</em> English: she hates the English, she is also of a conquered people. We have witnessed her callous torture within the new colony. In these very real ways, she is a victim.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f855f0f8fec11d1ca1866a6c89003ff9da5a95c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f855f0f8fec11d1ca1866a6c89003ff9da5a95c0/0_0_2200_1606/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aisling Franciosi in The Nightingale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"730\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This is clearly Clare\u2019s story\u2019: Aisling Franciosi in The Nightingale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Nettheim</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But while comparing the exploitation of Aboriginal people with other groups oppressed within the colonial system (women, convicts, the Irish) is fertile ground for dramatic exploration, it is also a minefield \u2013 one which Kent navigates misguidedly. Clare is still a part of the colonising force. She had her own hut and ambitions for life on Australian soil, land cleared of Aboriginal people. She is a racist \u2013 she calls Billy \u201cboy\u201d; she initially believes him to be a cannibal, and keeps a gun pointed on him; she is indifferent to the lethal consequences her impulsive decisions have on him. However little power she has, he has much, much less.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>However little power she has, he has much, much less.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Every societal group that is co-opted in the colonial process suffers in a different way, but it is dangerous to link those marginalised within the colonial state to those being colonised. The sliding scale of suffering among those within the colony makes little difference to the Aboriginal group whose land they stole.</p> <p>Aboriginal women, meanwhile, are left in the usual trope. We see only one. Lowanna (brought to life by the luminous Magnolia Maymuru) is raped and then murdered, with no characterisation. All we know is that she is even more disposable than both white women and black men. For a film so focused on colonial violence against women, the perfunctory and superficial interrogation of how that dynamic plays out for Aboriginal women is a serious flaw that plays into a colonial cinematic tradition. Lowanna\u2019s ephemeral portrayal in the Nightingale begs the question: who is the intended audience for this film? It may well hit raw nerves with Indigenous women, who have long felt marginalised in Australian cinema.</p> <p>The film\u2019s final scene seems to undercut the comparisons it made between the plights of its two leads.<strong> </strong>During what feels like Billy\u2019s inevitable death, Clare sings her Irish song in Gaelic. It\u2019s not English, but in Australia it\u2019s still a foreign, colonising language that she is singing on his traditional land.</p> <p>In the end, there is no way to escape your own complicity when you are part of the colonial system \u2013 no matter how powerless you yourself are. That is another brutal aspect of colonisation \u2013 and credit to Kent for exploring it. It takes a bold and brave storyteller to begin these difficult and complex but urgent conversations.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Nightingale has been released in the UK and US, and opens in Australian cinemas from Thursday 29 August</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 Larissa Behrendt is a Eualeyai/Kamillaroi lawyer, academic, novelist and film-maker</em></p>",

His abuse of power culminates in horrific sexual and physical violence \u2013 depicted so unflinchingly by Kent that some viewers have walked out of cinemas \u2013 that strips Clare of everything she holds dear. Hiring a black guide Billy (Baykali Ganambarr), Clare stalks Hawkins and his small party to Launceston \u2013 where they are being guided by Uncle Charlie (Charlie Jampijinpa Brown) \u2013 in order to punish them. Vengeance is a driving force in Clare\u2019s story, but The Nightingale \u2013 which won the special jury prize when it premiered in Venice, and just took home the critics\u2019 prize at Melbourne film festival \u2013 is more layered than a simple revenge tale. Billy is a Letteremairrener man, whose family have also been murdered by the colonists \u2013 and as he and Clare travel across the country, her racism softens, and their relationship becomes a space in which to explore the shared trauma and loss they have both suffered at the hands of white men. Kent\u2019s extraordinary craft shines through the world she has recreated, and in her seamless use of magic realism to reveal Clare\u2019s psychological world. She has elicited a world-class performance from Franciosi, in a demanding and harrowing role. Ganambarr is charismatic, with strong physicality, and Kent\u2019s collaboration with the Tasmanian Aboriginal community \u2013 including elder Jim Everett \u2013 brings cultural authenticity to his characterisation. (The Nightingale also claims to be the first full-length feature to use Palawa Kani, a dialect reconstructed from near-extinct Indigenous Tasmanian languages). Claflin, Damon Herriman and Harry Greenwood make sinister colonialists, and Charlie Shotwell, as the young orphan Eddie, is captivating each time he appears. All these white men grow more inhumane as they undertake the callous, violent work of clearing the colony of Aboriginal people and their culture, through point blank mass murders, sexual assaults, and the debasement and defiling of men, women and children. Violence in The Nightingale is unrelenting. It is graphic but, given the world the film takes place in, rarely gratuitous. The audience is left in no doubt about the savagery by which Aboriginal people were dispossessed of the land during the ferocious inhumanity and genocide that Australia was founded on \u2013 an important acknowledgement as the country continues to engage in discussions about constitutional recognition and treaty. But in its ambitious attempt to interrogate the complex power dynamics between the coloniser and the colonised, Clare\u2019s story steps into murkier territory, which it traverses it less successfully. And this is clearly Clare\u2019s story: the film starts with Clare and ends on her gaze, privileging her point of view. It is from Clare\u2019s perspective that the connections between her situation and that of Aboriginal people like Billy are explored. The viewer is asked to sympathise with the similarities of their plights: both have had their families taken from them, both sing in their traditional tongues (Clare in Gaelic), both are powerless within the colonial society being imposed on them. Clare goes to great lengths to explain that she is Irish, not English: she hates the English, she is also of a conquered people. We have witnessed her callous torture within the new colony. In these very real ways, she is a victim. But while comparing the exploitation of Aboriginal people with other groups oppressed within the colonial system (women, convicts, the Irish) is fertile ground for dramatic exploration, it is also a minefield \u2013 one which Kent navigates misguidedly. Clare is still a part of the colonising force. She had her own hut and ambitions for life on Australian soil, land cleared of Aboriginal people. She is a racist \u2013 she calls Billy \u201cboy\u201d; she initially believes him to be a cannibal, and keeps a gun pointed on him; she is indifferent to the lethal consequences her impulsive decisions have on him. However little power she has, he has much, much less. Every societal group that is co-opted in the colonial process suffers in a different way, but it is dangerous to link those marginalised within the colonial state to those being colonised. The sliding scale of suffering among those within the colony makes little difference to the Aboriginal group whose land they stole. Aboriginal women, meanwhile, are left in the usual trope. We see only one. Lowanna (brought to life by the luminous Magnolia Maymuru) is raped and then murdered, with no characterisation. All we know is that she is even more disposable than both white women and black men. For a film so focused on colonial violence against women, the perfunctory and superficial interrogation of how that dynamic plays out for Aboriginal women is a serious flaw that plays into a colonial cinematic tradition. Lowanna\u2019s ephemeral portrayal in the Nightingale begs the question: who is the intended audience for this film? It may well hit raw nerves with Indigenous women, who have long felt marginalised in Australian cinema. The film\u2019s final scene seems to undercut the comparisons it made between the plights of its two leads. During what feels like Billy\u2019s inevitable death, Clare sings her Irish song in Gaelic. It\u2019s not English, but in Australia it\u2019s still a foreign, colonising language that she is singing on his traditional land. In the end, there is no way to escape your own complicity when you are part of the colonial system \u2013 no matter how powerless you yourself are. That is another brutal aspect of colonisation \u2013 and credit to Kent for exploring it. It takes a bold and brave storyteller to begin these difficult and complex but urgent conversations. \u2022 The Nightingale has been released in the UK and US, and opens in Australian cinemas from Thursday 29 August \u2022 Larissa Behrendt is a Eualeyai/Kamillaroi lawyer, academic, novelist and film-maker",

When we speak, the week before James\u2019s anniversary, the latest Rajar audience figures show that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2019/rajar-2019-q2\" title=\"\">he has attracted 250,000 new listeners in his first year</a>.</p> <p>It is a rare success story in radio, with Zoe Ball\u2019s Radio 2 Breakfast show \u2013 the country\u2019s most popular \u2013 losing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/aug/01/zoe-ball-bbc-radio-2-breakfast-show-loses-listeners\" title=\"\">780,000 listeners since January</a> to record an audience of 8.27 million in the second quarter of 2019. James\u2019s show has a weekly audience of 5.69 million listeners aged 10-plus, up from 5.44 million last August. Presumably, everyone is very happy with him? \u201cI knew it was good when I heard from every single big BBC boss on Rajar day.\u201d</p> <p>Had he really had no idea that the show had been a success before then? \u201cWe felt it,\u201d says James, cautiously. \u201cWe felt like it\u2019s been a really successful year. We attacked the show, the brief of the show, with confidence.\u201d The kind of confidence that led them to propose, just weeks after taking over, a nationwide endeavour to get a Cornish pasty to a listener in Scotland, who said she had never had one. Handed between listeners like an Olympic torch, the pasty reached her after 19 stops, travelling 674 miles in four days.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCR1/status/1036554705344901120\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/gregjames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@gregjames</a> is sending a pasty from Cornwall to listener Sarah in Aberdeenshire, who has never had a pasty before!

Are you on board?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It was a huge hit with listeners and followed up with more \u2013 in James\u2019s words \u2013 deeply stupid stunts. The highest-profile moments of his year on Breakfast have included roping in listeners to break him out of an escape room (<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2L1dSypzdT2V2pnnmQlstVS/heres-what-happened-when-we-locked-greg-james-into-the-radio-1-escape-room\" title=\"\">it took 30 hours</a>) and, last month, a nationwide game of hide-and-seek with Grimshaw (they <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/ew9hj5/live/czvfhn\" title=\"\">were eventually found in</a> Weston-super-Mare).</p> <p>The other thing my BBC friend had told me, beyond his unhelpful \u201clovely man\u201d remark, was that Breakfast was bucking the trend in BBC Radio in that it was having money spent on it; James concedes this. \u201cThey don\u2019t say no now,\u201d he says, a bit wonderingly. \u201cThere will be a fall at some point \u2013 we\u2019ll mess one up. And that\u2019s fine!\u201d In fact, the stunts are now held up internally as a benchmark of broadcasting success, says James, somewhat incredulously. He adopts the same stuffy, officious voice with which he gently ribs his employer on air: \u201c\u2018We need another Pass the Pasty!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t tell if James is being unnecessarily self-effacing when he says he had \u201chad an inkling\u201d that he would be taking over from Grimshaw when he was asked to put together a pitch for his hypothetical Breakfast show. But, after six years on Drivetime, he says he \u201cdesperately needed a new challenge\u201d. When he sat down to think about what he would do, and his favourite on-air moments \u2013 including <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01cn0pz/p01cn0gm\" title=\"\">sofa-surfing his way from</a> London to T in the Park near Kinross in 2013 \u2013 the consistent thread was listeners.</p> <p>When, early last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/16/radio-1s-greg-james-it-was-like-a-balloon-popping-i-was-choked-up\" title=\"\">his gruelling \u201cGregathlon\u201d fundraiser</a> for Sport Relief \u2013 scaling three peaks and cycling 500 miles in five days \u2013 was derailed by wild weather, he spoke emotionally on Drivetime about the impact it had had on his mental health. It sparked \u201cunbelievable conversations\u201d with listeners about their own experience of depression, unemployment and postnatal depression. In his first-ever hour on Breakfast, he said he wanted it to be a \u201csafe place for people to confess things and be weird\u201d.</p> <p>Since then, he has regularly spoken on air about mental health, and his own experience of anxiety; he continues to see a therapist every few months. He credits his wife, the writer (and former Guardian journalist) Bella Mackie, with helping to build his empathy and confidence. \u201cI can\u2019t stand up and be an advocate for people, particularly men, talking about their brains if I\u2019m not willing to be open about how I am every now and then. It\u2019s about meeting listeners halfway.\u201d</p> <p>After one year, James\u2019s characterisation of himself as their \u201cringleader\u201d rings true. It is a big jump from the A-list access of Grimshaw\u2019s years. Whereas Grimmy might have had Kate Moss or (more likely) Rita Ora on line one, on the morning we meet James has spoken to Hannah, a teacher mortified that her class didn\u2019t get the reference she made to Steps in her lesson on tragedy.</p> <p>Before he took over Breakfast, he says, he had had an \u201cepiphany\u201d that there was no way that he \u2013 or any celebrity with a rubbish book to plug \u2013 could be more interesting, funny or relevant than the audience. This might seem glib, a tokenistic nod to those who pay the licence fee (James\u2019s salary is between \u00a3225,000 and \u00a3229,999), but the proof is in the programme, which is substantively listener-led.</p> <p>James often makes it explicit, I note, saying on air: \u201cThis show is for you.\u201d He considers that thoughtfully. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s sort of cynical in a way, in that you want people to know that \u2013 but that is also a True Thing \u2026\u201d When he asks them to talk to him \u2013 this morning, about what they do when they\u2019re bored at work \u2013 they do so in droves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89157882432e1d8b38f4ac20e28f2e7c409c9f99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89157882432e1d8b38f4ac20e28f2e7c409c9f99/0_85_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James hosting his first Radio 1 Breakfast show in August 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James hosting his first Radio 1 Breakfast show in August 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Allan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s not always especially starry or high-octane, but it\u2019s human, and surprisingly compelling \u2013 creating the sense that we are all in this together. James says he works hard to make the show inclusive, prioritising women\u2019s voices and rejecting an early jingle for being \u201ctoo laddy\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m a white bloke doing a breakfast show in 2019. You should just naturally be mindful that that is what you are. You don\u2019t want it to ever be a boys\u2019 club.\u201d Radio has been in the past, though \u2013 and British popular culture generally. \u201cYes, it has. And it was something that I never particularly enjoyed.\u201d</p> <p>James marvels at Yorkie bar\u2019s former tagline \u201cNot For Girls\u201d: \u201cWeirdly recent, that! Nuts magazine, and Max Power \u2013 all those things were around when I was a teenager and definitely conditioned me to think that that was fine.\u201d As many generations did, he adds. But \u2013 as a cricket fan (he co-hosts Radio 5 Live\u2019s cricket podcast, Tailenders), a drama graduate and someone who was \u201cnever cool at school\u201d \u2013 James says he feels as if he can \u201cfloat around a little bit\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not naturally \u2018stag do\u2019 \u2026 You distil it and go: what are the nice bits of that? There\u2019s camaraderie, there are in-jokes, there are silly catchphrases. And those things, we\u2019ve added into the show.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b5fdfefc24d35be0b5b6288548668ccc130a7be2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5fdfefc24d35be0b5b6288548668ccc130a7be2/1125_757_1661_1661/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James with Millie Bobby Brown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James with Millie Bobby Brown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Jeynes/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That inclusive spirit extends to age. Although Radio 1 is considered (<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/aboutthebbc/entries/05c44b36-3ab9-4ef2-af50-e8087a7738ea\" title=\"\">at least by Radio 1</a>) \u201cthe most important platform for youth culture in the UK\u201d, for 34-year-old James, the age of his audience is less important than a shared sensibility: an interest in \u201csilly, fun topical stuff\u201d.</p> <p>He scoffs at the statistic I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/feb/08/is-streaming-killing-the-radio-star\" title=\"\">pull up from Enders Analysis</a>, stating that around 840,000 15- to 24-year-olds have turned off radio for good since 2010. \u201cFor good!\u201d What about this one, then, that <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4532266/75-cent-children-want-YouTubers-vloggers.html\" title=\"\">75% of children surveyed</a> want to be YouTubers and vloggers when they grow up? It\u2019s very different from being a radio presenter, James agrees \u2013 adding, rather devastatingly, that many YouTubers find that out \u201cwhen their four or five years come to an end\u201d and they have to assess their transferable skills. The best radio presenters are passionate about that medium, he says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t love it, you can instantly tell that they\u2019re not really there. It just feels like they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d The podcast boom is helping to keep audio essential, \u201cand that\u2019s a brilliant thing for everyone \u2013 but there are a lot of bad podcasts\u201d.</p> <p>The world may have moved on, says James, but he is confident in the next generation of radio presenters. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if everyone wanted to be a radio presenter in the 80s. You could just substitute \u2018YouTuber\u2019 for: \u2018I want to be famous.\u2019\u201d Was that his motivation? \u201cNever. I wanted to be well known for being funny.\u201d And he loved radio, in a deeply uncool, anoraky way. He pokes fun at the press cliche of presenters having recorded jingles in their childhood bedrooms \u2013 but he really did.</p> <p>James\u2019s parents, Rosemary and Alan, were both teachers, and mostly happy to leave him to his interests: \u201cWhether it was squirrelling away upstairs recording radio shows, or pretending to revise, or going to play cricket, or whatever. They were happy to leave me alone: \u2018Go out and get drunk, but don\u2019t be an idiot.\u2019\u201d A few years ago, James and his older sister clubbed together to pay off their mum and dad\u2019s mortgage. They still tune in at 6.30am every morning, he says, \u201cto check I turned up\u201d.</p> <p>Although it was Terry Wogan he was \u201cobsessed\u201d with, he gets misty-eyed about being driven to school by his mum, listening to Chris Evans \u201cbeing mad\u201d on Virgin 1215: \u201cAlanis Morissette\u2019s Ironic automatically takes me back to being that age.\u201d</p> <p>These days, though, media is so fragmented \u2013 I wonder if you can ever assume that everyone is listening to any one song, except <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/29/lil-nas-xs-old-town-road-sets-new-record-for-most-weeks-at-no-1\" title=\"\">Lil Nas X, on repeat, for ever</a>? \u201cI do believe this, but I also have to believe this: you can get new people listening to radio. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve proven, to a certain extent, so far.\u201d</p> <p>Extending jokes from Monday\u2019s show into Tuesday, and regular segments such as Yesterday\u2019s Quiz and the Ten Minute Takeover reward returning listeners. James calls those \u201cthe basics\u201d, just classic radio tricks that weren\u2019t put front and centre on Radio 1 as they should have been for a few years.\u201dIf he\u2019s a touch dismissive, I locate it in the same high standards, informed by years of wonkery; he describes himself as critical, cynical, strategic and quite possibly a workaholic. \u201cI\u2019m doing the best radio shows I\u2019ve ever done, and I\u2019m getting better every single week, I think. I\u2019m learning and I\u2019m practising and I\u2019m trying stuff out.\u201d In May, he made his Radio 4 debut with a series called <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00055q2\" title=\"\">Rewinder</a>, presenting a Radio 1-style sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of the BBC\u2019s newly digitised archive. It was a bid \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2019/greg-james-on-radio-4?lang=cy\" title=\"\">backed by Radio 4 bosses</a> \u2013 to shake up the station a little bit, says James: \u201cI didn\u2019t know what the reaction would be, but I am respectful of it. I didn\u2019t want to go on there and start doing ridiculous phone-ins \u2013 you do have to change your act.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I can\u2019t be an advocate for people, particularly men, if I\u2019m not willing to be open  about how I am every now and then</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Although James says Rewinder was a success, not every new voice is embraced on Radio 4. When we speak, the Desert Island Discs presenter Lauren Laverne has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/10/fans-defend-laverne-desert-island-discs-radio-host\" title=\"\">just been accused by the Spectator</a> of embodying the \u201ccultural problem at the BBC\u201d where standards are allowed to drop in the drive for younger listeners. The columnist Melanie McDonagh said Laverne was \u201clightweight and uncerebral\u201d, a poor interviewer, and too nice to make compelling radio. \u201cI think that article was needlessly nasty,\u201d says James. \u201cLauren is wonderful. She\u2019s overqualified and has done a brilliant job. I thought that whole thing was a bit clickbaity.\u201d</p> <p>He says he has no aspiration to host a particular show on the BBC (perhaps just as well, given the complaint over Laverne: he says he would throw out the Bible and the complete works of Shakespeare were he to host Desert Island Discs), nor does he want to try TV or be any more of a celebrity: \u201cI\u2019m really proud not to be tabloid fodder.\u201d He writes the children\u2019s book series Kid Normal, with the newsreader Chris Smith, and is working on two sitcom ideas: one about a group of people who try to complete their dead friend\u2019s bucket list (a completed pilot, written with the comedians John Kearns and Pat Cahill, whom he went to university with); and another about a community cricket team.</p> <p>For now, the only goal that comes to mind is to be a guest on I\u2019m Sorry I Haven\u2019t a Clue (\u201cPut that in!\u201d) and to continue to build on his wins at Breakfast. James says he is pushing himself to improve every week. \u201cThere will probably be a shit Rajar at some point, but I will deal with that as I did the good one, which is: \u2018OK, cool, keep going.\u2019 That\u2019s not going to be the marker of success for me. To be candid about it, it gives us another three months where everyone leaves us alone.\u201d</p> <p>James is clearly uncompromising about quality, while creating a show that feels like an escape from reality, a welcome injection of silliness. He does makes the odd stand, calling the men who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/shortcuts/2019/jul/15/why-do-so-many-men-think-they-could-win-a-point-off-serena-williams\" title=\"\">told YouGov they would score a point</a> off Serena Williams \u201cpricks\u201d on Twitter and chiding those who said that the rapper Dave\u2019s song Black was racist against white people. James <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-47372175\" title=\"\">told them</a> \u201cto go and read up and educate yourself a bit\u201d. He is optimistic about people\u2019s ability to change their minds, grow, \u201cbe better\u201d \u2013 and Breakfast, \u201cwith its mainstream audience of people who are not ignorant on purpose\u201d, plays a part.</p> <p>The show can\u2019t ignore Brexit, Boris Johnson and Donald Trump \u2013 but the BBC\u2019s impartiality clause is a restriction. In these desperate, often dire times, does fishing for fun in rubbish bins ever feel like an uphill battle \u2013 or even appropriate? \u201cI flip between two thoughts on this: sometimes it does feel like you\u2019re really pushing against dread and toxicity and a world full of charlatans and fraudsters and madness \u2026\u201d His tone brightens. \u201cBut the flip side of that is: isn\u2019t it such a great time to be silly?\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The BBC Radio 1 Breakfast show, says its host, Greg James, is about \u201cfun for fun\u2019s sake\u201d. This Wednesday morning, not long after dawn, that involves a lot of chat about bins. There are a couple of stories knocking about, James explains on air. A Nuneaton family accused of having smelly bins have defended themselves on TV. A binman has bought a birthday cake for a woman on his route who was turning 100. Plus, it is James\u2019s bin day today. \u201cAnd yes, I did remember to put them out before I came in.\u201d James\u2019s day starts at 5.30am, four days a week, with his show on air from 6.30am to 10am. As I listen at home, getting ready to join him in the studio for his final hour, it occurs to me: sometimes it is not enough just to go out in search of fun, it is more often about making your own \u2013 and hoping it translates. \u201cOur rule is that we all have to be laughing at half five, if possible,\u201d James says later, in a BBC boardroom after the show. \u201cEven if it\u2019s just doing a stupid impression, or saying a filthy joke or doing a dance \u2013 we have to be in that mindset of: \u2018It\u2019s shit o\u2019clock in the morning, but all of the people listening are having much less fun.\u2019\u201d Privately, I struggle to think of anything worse than riffing before 7am \u2013 but it is working for James. The announcement last year that he would be taking over from Nick Grimshaw on Breakfast was not met with surprise. James had been in the mix to replace Chris Moyles in September 2012, but had lost out to \u201cGrimmy\u201d, thought to be the man to bring in the coveted \u201cyouth audience\u201d. He did, according to metrics such as YouTube views and social engagement \u2013 but struggled on broadcast, with Breakfast slumping from a weekly audience of 7 million people aged over 10 to record lows of about 5 million during Grimshaw\u2019s five-year run. James, who took over a year ago today, was a relative everyman: handsome, capable, the type of man who sincerely says: \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be nice,\u201d and is, right now, wearing bright pink socks with bananas on them. When I had asked a friend at the Beeb for internal intel, the best he could come up with was that James was a \u201clovely man\u201d. It is not necessarily what you would imagine turning the dial for \u2013 but people have done, in droves. When we speak, the week before James\u2019s anniversary, the latest Rajar audience figures show that he has attracted 250,000 new listeners in his first year. It is a rare success story in radio, with Zoe Ball\u2019s Radio 2 Breakfast show \u2013 the country\u2019s most popular \u2013 losing 780,000 listeners since January to record an audience of 8.27 million in the second quarter of 2019. James\u2019s show has a weekly audience of 5.69 million listeners aged 10-plus, up from 5.44 million last August. Presumably, everyone is very happy with him? \u201cI knew it was good when I heard from every single big BBC boss on Rajar day.\u201d Had he really had no idea that the show had been a success before then? \u201cWe felt it,\u201d says James, cautiously. \u201cWe felt like it\u2019s been a really successful year. We attacked the show, the brief of the show, with confidence.\u201d The kind of confidence that led them to propose, just weeks after taking over, a nationwide endeavour to get a Cornish pasty to a listener in Scotland, who said she had never had one. Handed between listeners like an Olympic torch, the pasty reached her after 19 stops, travelling 674 miles in four days. His bosses were initially sceptical of the \u201cPass the Pasty\u201d idea, says James, but were won over by his conviction, his team\u2019s experience, and the health and safety documents they assembled. \u201cYou don\u2019t ever say: \u2018This is going to be the best thing in the whole world.\u2019 You go: \u2018We\u2019re trying to get a pasty from Cornwall to Aberdeenshire. Are you on board?\u2019\u201d It was a huge hit with listeners and followed up with more \u2013 in James\u2019s words \u2013 deeply stupid stunts. The highest-profile moments of his year on Breakfast have included roping in listeners to break him out of an escape room (it took 30 hours) and, last month, a nationwide game of hide-and-seek with Grimshaw (they were eventually found in Weston-super-Mare). The other thing my BBC friend had told me, beyond his unhelpful \u201clovely man\u201d remark, was that Breakfast was bucking the trend in BBC Radio in that it was having money spent on it; James concedes this. \u201cThey don\u2019t say no now,\u201d he says, a bit wonderingly. \u201cThere will be a fall at some point \u2013 we\u2019ll mess one up. And that\u2019s fine!\u201d In fact, the stunts are now held up internally as a benchmark of broadcasting success, says James, somewhat incredulously. He adopts the same stuffy, officious voice with which he gently ribs his employer on air: \u201c\u2018We need another Pass the Pasty!\u2019\u201d I can\u2019t tell if James is being unnecessarily self-effacing when he says he had \u201chad an inkling\u201d that he would be taking over from Grimshaw when he was asked to put together a pitch for his hypothetical Breakfast show. But, after six years on Drivetime, he says he \u201cdesperately needed a new challenge\u201d. When he sat down to think about what he would do, and his favourite on-air moments \u2013 including sofa-surfing his way from London to T in the Park near Kinross in 2013 \u2013 the consistent thread was listeners. When, early last year, his gruelling \u201cGregathlon\u201d fundraiser for Sport Relief \u2013 scaling three peaks and cycling 500 miles in five days \u2013 was derailed by wild weather, he spoke emotionally on Drivetime about the impact it had had on his mental health. It sparked \u201cunbelievable conversations\u201d with listeners about their own experience of depression, unemployment and postnatal depression. In his first-ever hour on Breakfast, he said he wanted it to be a \u201csafe place for people to confess things and be weird\u201d. Since then, he has regularly spoken on air about mental health, and his own experience of anxiety; he continues to see a therapist every few months. He credits his wife, the writer (and former Guardian journalist) Bella Mackie, with helping to build his empathy and confidence. \u201cI can\u2019t stand up and be an advocate for people, particularly men, talking about their brains if I\u2019m not willing to be open about how I am every now and then. It\u2019s about meeting listeners halfway.\u201d After one year, James\u2019s characterisation of himself as their \u201cringleader\u201d rings true. It is a big jump from the A-list access of Grimshaw\u2019s years. Whereas Grimmy might have had Kate Moss or (more likely) Rita Ora on line one, on the morning we meet James has spoken to Hannah, a teacher mortified that her class didn\u2019t get the reference she made to Steps in her lesson on tragedy. Before he took over Breakfast, he says, he had had an \u201cepiphany\u201d that there was no way that he \u2013 or any celebrity with a rubbish book to plug \u2013 could be more interesting, funny or relevant than the audience. This might seem glib, a tokenistic nod to those who pay the licence fee (James\u2019s salary is between \u00a3225,000 and \u00a3229,999), but the proof is in the programme, which is substantively listener-led. James often makes it explicit, I note, saying on air: \u201cThis show is for you.\u201d He considers that thoughtfully. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s sort of cynical in a way, in that you want people to know that \u2013 but that is also a True Thing \u2026\u201d When he asks them to talk to him \u2013 this morning, about what they do when they\u2019re bored at work \u2013 they do so in droves. It\u2019s not always especially starry or high-octane, but it\u2019s human, and surprisingly compelling \u2013 creating the sense that we are all in this together. James says he works hard to make the show inclusive, prioritising women\u2019s voices and rejecting an early jingle for being \u201ctoo laddy\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m a white bloke doing a breakfast show in 2019. You should just naturally be mindful that that is what you are. You don\u2019t want it to ever be a boys\u2019 club.\u201d Radio has been in the past, though \u2013 and British popular culture generally. \u201cYes, it has. And it was something that I never particularly enjoyed.\u201d James marvels at Yorkie bar\u2019s former tagline \u201cNot For Girls\u201d: \u201cWeirdly recent, that! Nuts magazine, and Max Power \u2013 all those things were around when I was a teenager and definitely conditioned me to think that that was fine.\u201d As many generations did, he adds. But \u2013 as a cricket fan (he co-hosts Radio 5 Live\u2019s cricket podcast, Tailenders), a drama graduate and someone who was \u201cnever cool at school\u201d \u2013 James says he feels as if he can \u201cfloat around a little bit\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not naturally \u2018stag do\u2019 \u2026 You distil it and go: what are the nice bits of that? There\u2019s camaraderie, there are in-jokes, there are silly catchphrases. And those things, we\u2019ve added into the show.\u201d That inclusive spirit extends to age. Although Radio 1 is considered (at least by Radio 1) \u201cthe most important platform for youth culture in the UK\u201d, for 34-year-old James, the age of his audience is less important than a shared sensibility: an interest in \u201csilly, fun topical stuff\u201d. He scoffs at the statistic I pull up from Enders Analysis, stating that around 840,000 15- to 24-year-olds have turned off radio for good since 2010. \u201cFor good!\u201d What about this one, then, that 75% of children surveyed want to be YouTubers and vloggers when they grow up? It\u2019s very different from being a radio presenter, James agrees \u2013 adding, rather devastatingly, that many YouTubers find that out \u201cwhen their four or five years come to an end\u201d and they have to assess their transferable skills. The best radio presenters are passionate about that medium, he says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t love it, you can instantly tell that they\u2019re not really there. It just feels like they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d The podcast boom is helping to keep audio essential, \u201cand that\u2019s a brilliant thing for everyone \u2013 but there are a lot of bad podcasts\u201d. The world may have moved on, says James, but he is confident in the next generation of radio presenters. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if everyone wanted to be a radio presenter in the 80s. You could just substitute \u2018YouTuber\u2019 for: \u2018I want to be famous.\u2019\u201d Was that his motivation? \u201cNever. I wanted to be well known for being funny.\u201d And he loved radio, in a deeply uncool, anoraky way. He pokes fun at the press cliche of presenters having recorded jingles in their childhood bedrooms \u2013 but he really did. James\u2019s parents, Rosemary and Alan, were both teachers, and mostly happy to leave him to his interests: \u201cWhether it was squirrelling away upstairs recording radio shows, or pretending to revise, or going to play cricket, or whatever. They were happy to leave me alone: \u2018Go out and get drunk, but don\u2019t be an idiot.\u2019\u201d A few years ago, James and his older sister clubbed together to pay off their mum and dad\u2019s mortgage. They still tune in at 6.30am every morning, he says, \u201cto check I turned up\u201d. Although it was Terry Wogan he was \u201cobsessed\u201d with, he gets misty-eyed about being driven to school by his mum, listening to Chris Evans \u201cbeing mad\u201d on Virgin 1215: \u201cAlanis Morissette\u2019s Ironic automatically takes me back to being that age.\u201d These days, though, media is so fragmented \u2013 I wonder if you can ever assume that everyone is listening to any one song, except Lil Nas X, on repeat, for ever? \u201cI do believe this, but I also have to believe this: you can get new people listening to radio. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve proven, to a certain extent, so far.\u201d Extending jokes from Monday\u2019s show into Tuesday, and regular segments such as Yesterday\u2019s Quiz and the Ten Minute Takeover reward returning listeners. James calls those \u201cthe basics\u201d, just classic radio tricks that weren\u2019t put front and centre on Radio 1 as they should have been for a few years.\u201dIf he\u2019s a touch dismissive, I locate it in the same high standards, informed by years of wonkery; he describes himself as critical, cynical, strategic and quite possibly a workaholic. \u201cI\u2019m doing the best radio shows I\u2019ve ever done, and I\u2019m getting better every single week, I think. I\u2019m learning and I\u2019m practising and I\u2019m trying stuff out.\u201d In May, he made his Radio 4 debut with a series called Rewinder, presenting a Radio 1-style sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of the BBC\u2019s newly digitised archive. It was a bid \u2013 backed by Radio 4 bosses \u2013 to shake up the station a little bit, says James: \u201cI didn\u2019t know what the reaction would be, but I am respectful of it. I didn\u2019t want to go on there and start doing ridiculous phone-ins \u2013 you do have to change your act.\u201d Although James says Rewinder was a success, not every new voice is embraced on Radio 4. When we speak, the Desert Island Discs presenter Lauren Laverne has just been accused by the Spectator of embodying the \u201ccultural problem at the BBC\u201d where standards are allowed to drop in the drive for younger listeners. The columnist Melanie McDonagh said Laverne was \u201clightweight and uncerebral\u201d, a poor interviewer, and too nice to make compelling radio. \u201cI think that article was needlessly nasty,\u201d says James. \u201cLauren is wonderful. She\u2019s overqualified and has done a brilliant job. I thought that whole thing was a bit clickbaity.\u201d He says he has no aspiration to host a particular show on the BBC (perhaps just as well, given the complaint over Laverne: he says he would throw out the Bible and the complete works of Shakespeare were he to host Desert Island Discs), nor does he want to try TV or be any more of a celebrity: \u201cI\u2019m really proud not to be tabloid fodder.\u201d He writes the children\u2019s book series Kid Normal, with the newsreader Chris Smith, and is working on two sitcom ideas: one about a group of people who try to complete their dead friend\u2019s bucket list (a completed pilot, written with the comedians John Kearns and Pat Cahill, whom he went to university with); and another about a community cricket team. For now, the only goal that comes to mind is to be a guest on I\u2019m Sorry I Haven\u2019t a Clue (\u201cPut that in!\u201d) and to continue to build on his wins at Breakfast. James says he is pushing himself to improve every week. \u201cThere will probably be a shit Rajar at some point, but I will deal with that as I did the good one, which is: \u2018OK, cool, keep going.\u2019 That\u2019s not going to be the marker of success for me. To be candid about it, it gives us another three months where everyone leaves us alone.\u201d James is clearly uncompromising about quality, while creating a show that feels like an escape from reality, a welcome injection of silliness. He does makes the odd stand, calling the men who told YouGov they would score a point off Serena Williams \u201cpricks\u201d on Twitter and chiding those who said that the rapper Dave\u2019s song Black was racist against white people. James told them \u201cto go and read up and educate yourself a bit\u201d. He is optimistic about people\u2019s ability to change their minds, grow, \u201cbe better\u201d \u2013 and Breakfast, \u201cwith its mainstream audience of people who are not ignorant on purpose\u201d, plays a part. The show can\u2019t ignore Brexit, Boris Johnson and Donald Trump \u2013 but the BBC\u2019s impartiality clause is a restriction. In these desperate, often dire times, does fishing for fun in rubbish bins ever feel like an uphill battle \u2013 or even appropriate? \u201cI flip between two thoughts on this: sometimes it does feel like you\u2019re really pushing against dread and toxicity and a world full of charlatans and fraudsters and madness \u2026\u201d His tone brightens. \u201cBut the flip side of that is: isn\u2019t it such a great time to be silly?\u201d",

He takes to the stage in a Lonsdale tracksuit, and at one point dons boxing gloves, to play a heightened version of Downes. These character-comedy scenes about \u201cPop\u201d, as McNicholas always knew him, are intercut with more traditional standup routines in which he compares his achievements with those of his grandad.

The 60-minute tale blurs comedy and theatre. \u201cI\u2019m pleased that it slightly defies genre in that way,\u201d says McNicholas, who started out as an actor. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of cynicism within comedy about theatre but a bit of aspiration, too \u2013 theatre has a credibility that comedy in some ways aspires towards.

But while there are plenty of laughs in the show, it is clearly made with heart and honours Downes, delighting in his success and never making fun of him. Its resolution is particularly emotional.</p> <p>As a child, McNicholas would visit Downes most weekends. \u201cHe was very brusque and would tell me in no uncertain terms that I\u2019d be helping him paint a fence or mow the lawn. I knew a very different person to the man I portray in the show \u2013 I knew an old man with a pipe and a stick. Who was that man in his 20s and 30s? We know our grandparents, but we know a version of them.

He turned professional back in Britain and was world middleweight champion for nine months. Retiring in 1964, he went on to star in films including A Study in Terror, opposite Barbara Windsor, and Dance of the Vampires, directed by Roman Polanski.</p> <p>\u201cHe was always coming out with these little quips and one-liners. That was part of the inspiration for me,\u201d says McNicholas, who also writes about football. He is an Arsenal fan and is directing a show at the fringe by the young comedian Raphael Wakefield called <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/raphael-wakefield-wengerball\">Wengerball</a>, charting the rise and fall of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. McNicholas\u2019s whole family is sporty: his brother is a football agent and their cousin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/12/wally-downes-carabao-cup\">Wally Downes</a>, is a footballer turned manager. But the standup was hopeless at sport when he was younger. \u201cThat\u2019s another project I want to pursue, asking people what they were like at sport in school. I think it\u2019s really funny and formative.\u201d</p> <p>McNicholas is still close to his fellow Beasts: he directed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/03/owen-roberts-standup-let-six-year-old-write-comedy-show-edinburgh\">Owen Roberts\u2019 first solo comedy show</a> in 2018 and before this year\u2019s fringe, he and the third Beast, <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/ciaran-dowd-padre-rodolfo\">Ciar\u00e1n Dowd</a>, sent each other recordings of their new shows. \u201cYou see one man on stage but a lot of comedy benefits from a slightly more collaborative process,\u201d McNicholas says, \u201ceven if it\u2019s just someone throwing you an idea for a line. Emotionally it\u2019s massive to have that support.\u201d</p> <p>No boxing movie would be complete without a montage showing the plucky hero\u2019s training sessions \u2013 and the fringe is a gruelling challenge for standups. What is McNicholas\u2019s regime? \u201cThere have been a lot of broken promises,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI was going to join the gym, run every day. It\u2019s incredible how quickly the plan disintegrated.\u201d He\u2019s given up on getting in his five portions of fruit and veg and is mainly concerned with looking after his voice. \u201cI\u2019m trying to drink only clear spirits because someone told me that was better for your voice than beer.

The 60-minute tale blurs comedy and theatre. \u201cI\u2019m pleased that it slightly defies genre in that way,\u201d says McNicholas, who started out as an actor. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of cynicism within comedy about theatre but a bit of aspiration, too \u2013 theatre has a credibility that comedy in some ways aspires towards. But there\u2019s a suspicion of deep pretentiousness.\u201d For research McNicholas reread Downes\u2019s colourful autobiography, My Bleeding Business, and spoke at length to his grandmother, Terry\u2019s wife Barbara, whose voice can be heard in the show. \u201cWhen I told my family I was going to do this, there was a bit of dissent,\u201d he admits. But while there are plenty of laughs in the show, it is clearly made with heart and honours Downes, delighting in his success and never making fun of him. Its resolution is particularly emotional. As a child, McNicholas would visit Downes most weekends. \u201cHe was very brusque and would tell me in no uncertain terms that I\u2019d be helping him paint a fence or mow the lawn. I knew a very different person to the man I portray in the show \u2013 I knew an old man with a pipe and a stick. Who was that man in his 20s and 30s? We know our grandparents, but we know a version of them. To rejuvenate him was a nice thing to be able to do.\u201d Downes boxed for the US Marines and, had he resided in America a little longer, would have qualified to represent the country in the 1956 Olympics. He turned professional back in Britain and was world middleweight champion for nine months. Retiring in 1964, he went on to star in films including A Study in Terror, opposite Barbara Windsor, and Dance of the Vampires, directed by Roman Polanski. \u201cHe was always coming out with these little quips and one-liners. That was part of the inspiration for me,\u201d says McNicholas, who also writes about football. He is an Arsenal fan and is directing a show at the fringe by the young comedian Raphael Wakefield called Wengerball, charting the rise and fall of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. McNicholas\u2019s whole family is sporty: his brother is a football agent and their cousin, Wally Downes, is a footballer turned manager. But the standup was hopeless at sport when he was younger. \u201cThat\u2019s another project I want to pursue, asking people what they were like at sport in school. I think it\u2019s really funny and formative.\u201d McNicholas is still close to his fellow Beasts: he directed Owen Roberts\u2019 first solo comedy show in 2018 and before this year\u2019s fringe, he and the third Beast, Ciar\u00e1n Dowd, sent each other recordings of their new shows. \u201cYou see one man on stage but a lot of comedy benefits from a slightly more collaborative process,\u201d McNicholas says, \u201ceven if it\u2019s just someone throwing you an idea for a line. Emotionally it\u2019s massive to have that support.\u201d No boxing movie would be complete without a montage showing the plucky hero\u2019s training sessions \u2013 and the fringe is a gruelling challenge for standups. What is McNicholas\u2019s regime? \u201cThere have been a lot of broken promises,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI was going to join the gym, run every day. It\u2019s incredible how quickly the plan disintegrated.\u201d He\u2019s given up on getting in his five portions of fruit and veg and is mainly concerned with looking after his voice. \u201cI\u2019m trying to drink only clear spirits because someone told me that was better for your voice than beer. That\u2019s as healthy as it gets: drinking exclusively clear spirits!\u201d James McNicholas: The Boxer is at the Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 August.",

      "bodyText": "Documentary film cameras are to go behind the scenes at the V&amp;A to tell stories from one of the world\u2019s most eclectic museum collections, which spans ancient Chinese ceramics to Bradley Wiggins\u2019 handlebars. BBC Two has announced it is to screen a six-part series exploring the work of the hundreds of curators, conservators and technicians who work there. The show is being made by Blast! Films, whose factual series back catalogue includes The Secret Life of the Zoo, Saving Lives at Sea and The Supervet. Alistair Pegg, Blast\u2019s director of programmes, said getting this type of access inside the V&amp;A was a documentary-maker\u2019s dream. \u201cIt felt like an opportunity to make a different kind of documentary series,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we will be focusing on the secret life of the objects themselves and the work that is going on unbeknown to the millions of visitors who go there. We are trying to take people to a world that you would never see as a visitor.\u201d Each programme will feature several objects that might be being conserved, redisplayed or loaned out. \u201cWe hopefully will uncover some hidden history about each piece,\u201d said Pegg. Among the stories expected to be told will be a project examining original manuscripts by Charles Dickens, revealing in startling detail his crossings out and amendments and what they can tell us about his mindset. Another will follow the 3D and infrared scanning of the Raphael Cartoons to better understand the story of how they were created. Filming has already started and is expected to take several months with a hoped-for transmission date of next year. Inviting documentary-makers in to film your everyday work can be a perilous experience for arts organisations. The BBC documentary series The House, which in 1995 went behind the scenes at the Royal Opera House, was widely considered a disaster for Covent Garden, showing squabbling, backstabbing, chaos and incompetence on a staggering level. It also made for brilliant, compelling viewing. The National Gallery had a much happier experience as the subject of Fred Wiseman\u2019s three-hour 2014 film which opened at Cannes before a cinema release. The V&amp;A\u2019s director, Tristram Hunt, said the museum\u2019s aim was to \u201cchampion creative industry, inspire a new generation of designers and makers and enrich everyone\u2019s imagination. \u201cWe hope this series will inspire a new generation of designers and makers, museum-goers and day-trippers to fall in love with the V&amp;A and its remarkable collection.\u201d Patrick Holland, the controller of BBC Two, said the series \u201cpromises to be an absolute treat\u201d taking \u201cthe audience behind the scenes of the museum in a unique BBC Two way\u201d. The documentary makers are not the first to be allowed behind the scenes at the V&amp;A. At the Venice Biennale this summer is a work by the artist Marysia Lewandowska who found in the museum stores, by chance, cans of celluloid not in the inventory. They contained footage made by a team for a 1978 BBC documentary Museum at Work and includes a scene in a smoke-filled boardroom of mostly grey-haired men cheerfully inspecting an architectural model of an exhibition design. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about that,\u201d said Pegg. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the original film but I\u2019d love to have some of that footage in our series.\u201d",

Reading a true crime story about a stalker who murdered his girlfriend might be a way for a woman to process her own anxieties.</p> <p>But I think there\u2019s a danger in that formulation. It risks replicating cultural ideas about who is the most dangerous and who deserves protection and who doesn\u2019t.

I think it\u2019s inherently emotionally and ethically complicated.

In Savage Appetites: Four True Stories of Women, Crime and Obsession (Scribner, 20 August), journalist Rachel Monroe weaves crime reporting, cultural criticism and personal essay into a study of true crime and its seductive power. The book\u2019s subjects include an industrial heiress who revolutionizes American forensic science; a woman whose life becomes strangely intertwined with the victims of the Manson murders; a landscape architect who falls in love with a wrongly convicted prisoner; and a Columbine fangirl who decides to plan her own mass killing. Your book is both a work of true crime and a kind of meta-analysis of true crime as a cultural phenomenon. How did the book come about?

Since that time, there\u2019s been a huge increase in awareness of heat and urban heat islands, he says. \u201cThe issue now is, \u2018OK, this is a uniquely challenging problem, and how do we develop policy and implement solutions\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<h2>How the climate crisis will impact US cities</h2> \n<p>With a string of subsequent record hot years and increasing flooding, cities are already dealing with the impacts of a changing climate:</p> \n<p><strong>Deaths. </strong>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an average of 658 people die every year from heat-related causes. From 1999 to 2010, 8,081 heat-related deaths were reported in the United States and occurred more commonly among older, younger and poorer populations. Urban heat islands retain heat overnight, preventing people from sleeping well and leading to even more health problems, says Lucy Hutyra, an associate professor of earth and environment at Boston University. Air pollution is often worst on hot days, and when people leave windows open for air flow, the quality of the air can cause respiratory problems. Warmer, moister conditions also mean that heavy rainfall and subsequent flooding is on the rise; so far this year 78 people have died as a result, according to the National Weather Service.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c468d09923f865704073e8e8c09d99d499057d1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c468d09923f865704073e8e8c09d99d499057d1/0_82_6351_3811/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flooding in Wilmington, North Carolina during Hurricane Florence in September 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flooding in Wilmington, North Carolina during Hurricane Florence in September 2018.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Power outages</strong>. As experienced by New Yorkers this year, excessive heat in conjunction with excess demand for electricity for air conditioning can cause the grid \u2013 or portions of it \u2013 to fail. \u201cEnergy demand is going to go up,\u201d says Shickman. \u201cIt\u2019s a substantial and nonlinear reaction. Our grid is going to be taxed in ways I don\u2019t think we are prepared for.\u201d Shickman says that going from an 80F day to a 90F day would require an additional 20-25% power. Going to 95F requires almost 40% more power. Excess heat can also evaporate water needed to cool power plants, forcing some out of commission.</p> \n<p><strong>Infrastructure failures</strong>. In addition to electricity grid problems, asphalt can melt in excess temperatures; rail tracks expand; and can even affect airports \u2013 currently some airplanes can\u2019t take off from Phoenix airport, for example, when the temperature exceeds 118F because the air is too thin. Heat is a problem for all areas of city governance, said Shickman. \u201cIf you ask any sort of department head what is your biggest challenge, heat is probably not number one, but I guarantee you it\u2019s somewhere between number two and number five.\u201d But, he says, unfortunately there are no \u201cheat czars\u201d to manage the issue. Flooding, too, can wreak havoc on a city\u2019s infrastructure, from blowing out bridges and roads to inundating water treatment plants.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"65d779c7-4421-4f64-b998-d653ef2aa081\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ErY8-ZYQzAI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Economic Impact</strong>. According to a 2018 study by Texas A&amp;M University: \u201cThe growing number of extreme rainfall events that produce intense precipitation are resulting in \u2013and will continue to result in \u2013 increased urban flooding unless steps are taken to mitigate their impacts.\u201d The 2017 National Climate Assessment concluded: \u201cHeavy downpours are increasing nationally, especially over the last three to five decades \u2026[and that] \u2026 increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events are projected for all U.S. regions.\u201d Between 2007 and 2011 alone, urban flooding in Cook County, Illinois, resulted in over 176,000 claims or flood losses at a cost of $660m (\u00a3545m).</p> \n<h2>How US cities are trying to respond</h2> \n<p>Becoming aware of the threat of heat and other climate changes is one thing. But doing something about it is difficult with limited budgets and multiple priorities, and \u201cthere is no one solution,\u201d says Shickman. With that in mind, here are some of the ways cities are addressing heat and extreme precipitation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6cd9b23ee45b7688ed388a243693cb071a771448\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cd9b23ee45b7688ed388a243693cb071a771448/0_0_1500_2258/664.jpg\" alt=\"A tree planted as part of the Million Trees New York project.\" width=\"664\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A tree planted as part of the Million Trees New York project.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Avila/NYC Dept. of Parks and Recreation</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Communication</strong>. In New York City, home health aides are being trained to recognize the signs of heat stress with their clients. In Auburn and Birmingham, Mitra talks to churches, service groups and individuals about urban heat islands, individual carbon footprints and solutions. One of her students is developing an app around the issue, while another group is working on an Alabama specific YouTube channel to communicate about climate breakdown-related problems and solutions. \u201cMany people in Alabama have yet to realize the rate at which things have been changing,\u201d Mitra says. The Texas A&amp;M study recommends better communication and coordination between federal, state and local agencies to address the problem of urban flooding.</p> \n<p><strong>Trees, plants and green infrastructure</strong>. Trees not only offer shade, but they cool the air by evaporating water. Adding more plants and trees, like New York City has done with its million tree program, can reduce the temperature of a city as well as soak up excess stormwater. Hutyra says such an approach won\u2019t work everywhere \u2013 Los Angeles had numerous problems with its one million tree program in part, because of the city\u2019s water scarcity. But areas of the northeast with plenty of water can fill empty tree wells and better develop parks and greenways to mitigate the heat. One of Mitra\u2019s favorite solutions is urban gardens. She points to Atlanta, which is working to develop a <a href=\"https://www.aglanta.org/urban-food-forest-at-browns-mill-1\">seven</a><a href=\"https://www.aglanta.org/urban-food-forest-at-browns-mill-1\"> acre food forest</a> that will also help reduce carbon footprint. Restoring or widening waterways, as is being done with <a href=\"https://www.projectbrays.org/\">Houston\u2019s Bray</a><a href=\"https://www.projectbrays.org/\">s Bayou</a>, can provide cooler greenspaces, as well as capacity for excess stormwater.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e7a140a477aef884fbaf9e87c12e92bbb188e127\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7a140a477aef884fbaf9e87c12e92bbb188e127/0_0_4285_2571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volunteers paint a roof in New York with reflective material.

White or light colored roofs reflect heat and can lower the overall temperature in a city as well as making individual buildings and homes cooler. According to one study, significant lightening of roofs and pavements could reduce temperatures in Chicago by 2.7F (1.5C). After Louisville, Kentucky, was identified as one of the fastest heating cities, local government began offering rebates for cool roofs in low income communities. San Antonio offers help for low-income residents to replace older roofs with lighter colored shingles and a thermal barrier, providing up to $1,000 per household a year in energy savings, Shickman says. He adds that in terms of infrastructure changes, Los Angeles is leading efforts on cool pavements, testing reflective coating on 17 blocks of the city and helping to refine pavement products.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/aug/20/how-us-cities-are-scrambling-to-protect-people-from-extreme-heat\">How US cities are scrambling to protect people from extreme heat</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Air conditioning</strong>. While the least optimal solution, air conditioning is the most realistic one to beat the heat, says Hutyra.

      "bodyText": "Between record heat and rain, this summer\u2019s weather patterns have indicated, once again, that the climate is changing. US cities, where more than 80% of the nation\u2019s population lives, are disproportionately hit by these changes, not only because of their huge populations but because of their existing \u2013 often inadequate \u2013 infrastructure. In urban areas, heatwaves are exacerbated by vehicles, industrial processes and the presence of heat-retaining concrete and asphalt. And it is in cities \u2013 especially in low-lying poorer areas \u2013 where record rainfall often accumulates. \u201cPeople are coming into urban areas and they cannot be stopped,\u201d says Chandana Mitra, an associate professor of geosciences at Auburn University, who studies the impact of heat on cities. Mitra has experienced the impact of climate change in her hometown of Kolkata, India, and is now observing it in Auburn, Alabama, and nearby Birmingham. \u201cEveryone aspires to be in an urban area and there is chaos.\u201d While the impacts of climate change are fundamentally local, experts say heat is one of the most concerning, especially in cities. \u201cFrom a disaster perspective, [heat] is invisible,\u201d says Kurt Shickman, executive director of the Global Cool Cities Alliance. Mitra likens the problem to having a finger in a pan of water while someone gradually turns up the heat. \u201cMaybe in 50 or 60 years, living in some cities will be unbearable. There could be a tipping point of no return.\u201d A study by the University of Maryland published this year predicts that by 2080, Denver will be as hot and wet as Borger, Texas, about 50 miles (80km) north of Amarillo; Philadelphia will feel warmer and drier \u2013 more like Memphis, Tennessee, and New York City will be up to 9F (5C) warmer, with a climate similar to Jonesboro, Arkansas. The study, which accompanies a tool that allows US users to find what their city will be like by 2080, shows that if emissions continue at the current pace residents in cities around the nation will: \u2022 Experience an average temperature increase of 8.2F (4.5C) \u2022 Live in climates similar to the current climates of cities 528 miles (850kms) south of their hometowns Increasing heat, either now or in the future, is an issue cities are beginning to understand better, says Shickman who started the Global Cool Cities Alliance in 2011. Since that time, there\u2019s been a huge increase in awareness of heat and urban heat islands, he says. \u201cThe issue now is, \u2018OK, this is a uniquely challenging problem, and how do we develop policy and implement solutions\u2019.\u201d How the climate crisis will impact US cities With a string of subsequent record hot years and increasing flooding, cities are already dealing with the impacts of a changing climate: Deaths. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an average of 658 people die every year from heat-related causes. From 1999 to 2010, 8,081 heat-related deaths were reported in the United States and occurred more commonly among older, younger and poorer populations. Urban heat islands retain heat overnight, preventing people from sleeping well and leading to even more health problems, says Lucy Hutyra, an associate professor of earth and environment at Boston University. Air pollution is often worst on hot days, and when people leave windows open for air flow, the quality of the air can cause respiratory problems. Warmer, moister conditions also mean that heavy rainfall and subsequent flooding is on the rise; so far this year 78 people have died as a result, according to the National Weather Service. Power outages. As experienced by New Yorkers this year, excessive heat in conjunction with excess demand for electricity for air conditioning can cause the grid \u2013 or portions of it \u2013 to fail. \u201cEnergy demand is going to go up,\u201d says Shickman. \u201cIt\u2019s a substantial and nonlinear reaction. Our grid is going to be taxed in ways I don\u2019t think we are prepared for.\u201d Shickman says that going from an 80F day to a 90F day would require an additional 20-25% power. Going to 95F requires almost 40% more power. Excess heat can also evaporate water needed to cool power plants, forcing some out of commission. Infrastructure failures. In addition to electricity grid problems, asphalt can melt in excess temperatures; rail tracks expand; and can even affect airports \u2013 currently some airplanes can\u2019t take off from Phoenix airport, for example, when the temperature exceeds 118F because the air is too thin. Heat is a problem for all areas of city governance, said Shickman. \u201cIf you ask any sort of department head what is your biggest challenge, heat is probably not number one, but I guarantee you it\u2019s somewhere between number two and number five.\u201d But, he says, unfortunately there are no \u201cheat czars\u201d to manage the issue. Flooding, too, can wreak havoc on a city\u2019s infrastructure, from blowing out bridges and roads to inundating water treatment plants. Economic Impact. According to a 2018 study by Texas A&amp;M University: \u201cThe growing number of extreme rainfall events that produce intense precipitation are resulting in \u2013and will continue to result in \u2013 increased urban flooding unless steps are taken to mitigate their impacts.\u201d The 2017 National Climate Assessment concluded: \u201cHeavy downpours are increasing nationally, especially over the last three to five decades \u2026[and that] \u2026 increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events are projected for all U.S. regions.\u201d Between 2007 and 2011 alone, urban flooding in Cook County, Illinois, resulted in over 176,000 claims or flood losses at a cost of $660m (\u00a3545m). How US cities are trying to respond Becoming aware of the threat of heat and other climate changes is one thing. But doing something about it is difficult with limited budgets and multiple priorities, and \u201cthere is no one solution,\u201d says Shickman. With that in mind, here are some of the ways cities are addressing heat and extreme precipitation. Communication. In New York City, home health aides are being trained to recognize the signs of heat stress with their clients. In Auburn and Birmingham, Mitra talks to churches, service groups and individuals about urban heat islands, individual carbon footprints and solutions. One of her students is developing an app around the issue, while another group is working on an Alabama specific YouTube channel to communicate about climate breakdown-related problems and solutions. \u201cMany people in Alabama have yet to realize the rate at which things have been changing,\u201d Mitra says. The Texas A&amp;M study recommends better communication and coordination between federal, state and local agencies to address the problem of urban flooding. Trees, plants and green infrastructure. Trees not only offer shade, but they cool the air by evaporating water. Adding more plants and trees, like New York City has done with its million tree program, can reduce the temperature of a city as well as soak up excess stormwater. Hutyra says such an approach won\u2019t work everywhere \u2013 Los Angeles had numerous problems with its one million tree program in part, because of the city\u2019s water scarcity. But areas of the northeast with plenty of water can fill empty tree wells and better develop parks and greenways to mitigate the heat. One of Mitra\u2019s favorite solutions is urban gardens. She points to Atlanta, which is working to develop a seven acre food forest that will also help reduce carbon footprint. Restoring or widening waterways, as is being done with Houston\u2019s Brays Bayou, can provide cooler greenspaces, as well as capacity for excess stormwater. Cool roofs and pavement. \u201cAt a minimum all roofs should be white with the exception of solar and green roofs,\u201d says Shickman, whose Global Cool Cities Alliance has launched the One Million Cool Roofs Challenge. White or light colored roofs reflect heat and can lower the overall temperature in a city as well as making individual buildings and homes cooler. According to one study, significant lightening of roofs and pavements could reduce temperatures in Chicago by 2.7F (1.5C). After Louisville, Kentucky, was identified as one of the fastest heating cities, local government began offering rebates for cool roofs in low income communities. San Antonio offers help for low-income residents to replace older roofs with lighter colored shingles and a thermal barrier, providing up to $1,000 per household a year in energy savings, Shickman says. He adds that in terms of infrastructure changes, Los Angeles is leading efforts on cool pavements, testing reflective coating on 17 blocks of the city and helping to refine pavement products. Air conditioning. While the least optimal solution, air conditioning is the most realistic one to beat the heat, says Hutyra. Air conditioning can raise the temperatures within cities through its waste heat and, when powered by fossil fuels, can contribute to the problem of climate change. But Hutyra says a more distributed electricity grid with energy from renewable sources could help alleviate some of those concerns. Cities in the future, Hutyra says, won\u2019t be unliveable, \u201cThey just will be different. I think how we play and live and move in cities today isn\u2019t how we did 20 years ago. I think in the face of these large changes in climate coming our way ... I think it will reshape what our cities look like and how we live in them.\u201d Pam Radtke Russell is a senior editor at Engineering News-Record, in New Orleans and a specialist on climate adaptation Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

There is much debate about how the legal requirement to leave on the 31 October can be upended. I\u2019ll leave that to one side. That\u2019s a practical question with a practical answer, and the various options will be played out soon enough. But this is also a question of principles and sticking to them. Or not.</p> <p>Last week there was another leak. The former chancellor and my former boss, Philip Hammond, along with 19 other MPs, wrote to Johnson to remind him of his promise that no deal was an unlikely outcome \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/boris-johnson-chances-of-no-deal-brexit-are-a-million-to-one-against\" title=\"\">a million to one</a>\u201d in the prime minister\u2019s own words. The letter encouraged him to make good on these odds.</p> <p>All well and good. But we have only two months before a hard Brexit becomes reality. So enough with the epistolary efforts. It\u2019s time for senior Conservatives who know that no deal would be a disaster to get their hands dirty. It\u2019s time to shout the message from the rooftops; to campaign and cajole until it is clear to this government that parliament won\u2019t impose this risk on its people.</p> <p>Last April, parliament successfully forced through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/apr/08/brexit-latest-news-live-theresa-may-union-most-likely-outcome-if-labour-and-government-can-compromise-says-minister-live-news\" title=\"\">an emergency bill</a> to see off the threat of no deal under Theresa May.</p> <p>But I am worried that, when the House of Commons returns in a fortnight, fewer and fewer MPs will muster the courage to speak in favour of blocking no deal and then to organise to prevent it. A majority in the Commons remains opposed to a hard Brexit. But I fear that, on the Tory side, too many may see blocking it as career suicide in the Johnson era.</p> <p>How would we ever be able to trust these senior politicians again, when it would appear that a short summer break was all it took to convert them to the ruthless rhetoric of the prime minister\u2019s approach?</p> <p>Hammond has always said what he thinks. He\u2019s authentically committed to the things he says he believes. As his communications director, my job was hair-raising at times. But it makes his job this September a straightforward one. What about former ministers Rory Stewart, Greg Clark, and David Gauke? Or Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson? They need now to step into the glare of the spotlight to lend the campaign against no deal some serious firepower.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/18/number-10-furious-leak-document-predicting-no-deal-brexit-shortages\">No 10 furious at leak of paper predicting shortages after no-deal Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stewart, Clark and Gauke signed the Hammond letter. I expect they\u2019ll continue to speak out against a hard exit. But they\u2019ll not turn the worm.</p> <p>Davidson may be the key to all this. Less than a week after Johnson was elected leader she made a public commitment that she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/28/support-no-deal-brexit-scottish-ruth-davidson-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">wouldn\u2019t support no deal</a>. She says she also told Johnson this to his face in their first meeting following his win. Will she be as vociferous and vocal this autumn? I hope so.</p> <p>But the most difficult questions are reserved for those who have chosen to remain inside the bunker. If you think leaving without a deal is a disaster, can you really have a clear conscience about staying in the cabinet?</p> <p>Rudd has told colleagues she\u2019s better able to influence Johnson\u2019s hard Brexit instincts from inside government. But was the prospect of losing a second secretary of state job in such short order also a factor?</p> <p>Rudd has sent mixed signals of late. First she declared that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49337343\" title=\"\">\u201cI will play my part in \u2026 arguing strongly for respecting parliamentary sovereignty.\u201d</a> The next morning she doubled down on the no-deal message, writing in the Telegraph: \u201cWe will deliver Brexit by the end of October whatever the circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>Morgan\u2019s website states she had concerns about \u201cthe uncertainty surrounding a no-deal Brexit,\u201d and has made her views heard on the backbenches.

I\u2019ll leave that to one side. That\u2019s a practical question with a practical answer, and the various options will be played out soon enough. But this is also a question of principles and sticking to them. Or not. Last week there was another leak. The former chancellor and my former boss, Philip Hammond, along with 19 other MPs, wrote to Johnson to remind him of his promise that no deal was an unlikely outcome \u2013 \u201ca million to one\u201d in the prime minister\u2019s own words. The letter encouraged him to make good on these odds. All well and good. But we have only two months before a hard Brexit becomes reality. So enough with the epistolary efforts. It\u2019s time for senior Conservatives who know that no deal would be a disaster to get their hands dirty. It\u2019s time to shout the message from the rooftops; to campaign and cajole until it is clear to this government that parliament won\u2019t impose this risk on its people. Last April, parliament successfully forced through an emergency bill to see off the threat of no deal under Theresa May. But I am worried that, when the House of Commons returns in a fortnight, fewer and fewer MPs will muster the courage to speak in favour of blocking no deal and then to organise to prevent it. A majority in the Commons remains opposed to a hard Brexit. But I fear that, on the Tory side, too many may see blocking it as career suicide in the Johnson era. How would we ever be able to trust these senior politicians again, when it would appear that a short summer break was all it took to convert them to the ruthless rhetoric of the prime minister\u2019s approach? Hammond has always said what he thinks. He\u2019s authentically committed to the things he says he believes. As his communications director, my job was hair-raising at times. But it makes his job this September a straightforward one. What about former ministers Rory Stewart, Greg Clark, and David Gauke? Or Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson? They need now to step into the glare of the spotlight to lend the campaign against no deal some serious firepower. Stewart, Clark and Gauke signed the Hammond letter. I expect they\u2019ll continue to speak out against a hard exit. But they\u2019ll not turn the worm. Davidson may be the key to all this. Less than a week after Johnson was elected leader she made a public commitment that she wouldn\u2019t support no deal. She says she also told Johnson this to his face in their first meeting following his win. Will she be as vociferous and vocal this autumn? I hope so. But the most difficult questions are reserved for those who have chosen to remain inside the bunker. If you think leaving without a deal is a disaster, can you really have a clear conscience about staying in the cabinet? Rudd has told colleagues she\u2019s better able to influence Johnson\u2019s hard Brexit instincts from inside government. But was the prospect of losing a second secretary of state job in such short order also a factor? Rudd has sent mixed signals of late. First she declared that \u201cI will play my part in \u2026 arguing strongly for respecting parliamentary sovereignty.\u201d The next morning she doubled down on the no-deal message, writing in the Telegraph: \u201cWe will deliver Brexit by the end of October whatever the circumstances.\u201d Morgan\u2019s website states she had concerns about \u201cthe uncertainty surrounding a no-deal Brexit,\u201d and has made her views heard on the backbenches. But now, after three years of the UK stuck in a \u201cholding pattern\u201d, she says she \u201cbelieve[s] we need to get the withdrawal phase concluded\u201d. Careers, consciences and credibility: in the Conservative party this autumn all three will be tested as never before. \u2022 Poppy Trowbridge was special adviser to Philip Hammond from September 2016 to July 2019",

The narrow strip of land between wheat and the footpath with its encroaching flora is the province of annual arable weeds, constant companions of crops grown here since this land was first tilled. It is the passage of the plough that brings buried seeds of corn poppy (Papaver rhoeas) to the surface, exposing them to the light that triggers their germination. Already the last scarlet petals are falling and their pepper-pot capsules tremble and scatter their contents in the slightest breeze. The fruits of field pansy (Viola arvensis) have split into three boat-shaped segments, whose edges curl inwards, wither and shrink. Their neat rows of egg-shaped seeds, so smooth and shiny that they are as slippery as wet soap, are squeezed ever tighter until they are shot skywards, to patter down to earth among the corn stalks. The pansy\u2019s dispersal mechanism is crude compared with the elegant artillery of cut-leaved cranesbill (Geranium dissectum), also entwined among the wheat stalks. A circle of five seed-capsules sits at the base of the beak-shaped fruit, attached to its tip by a slender strip of tissue that becomes as tense as a tightly wound clock spring as it dries. One by one they break free from their anchorage and are flicked upwards and outwards, like boulders hurled from medieval siege catapults. Discharged capsules, still attached on their curled springs, are arrayed along the cranesbill stems, like an elegant row of miniature chandeliers. The arrival of the combine harvester is only a few days away but these insouciant little weeds, whose survival depends on annual disturbance of the soil, have already staked their claim for territory in the next cycle of the seasons. They will be back next spring in this no-man\u2019s land between cultivation and wildness, herbicide spray permitting.",

The videos, many of which are over eery music, show images of missing people, with a photograph or video of the person posting the clip superimposed over the top.

China continues to insist that the detention centres in the western province of Xinjiang are vocational training facilities and has conducted a propaganda blitz about them, taking journalists on tours and releasing upbeat videos showing inmates in lessons, participating in cultural activities and working in factory jobs. At a briefing at the end of July, Shohrat Zakir, chairman of the regional government, said about 90% of the people who had been released from the centres had gone on to find suitable jobs and were earning \u201cconsiderable money\u201d. In response, people started sharing pictures on social media of their loved ones, who were still missing, with the hashtag: \u201cProveThe90\u201d. In February, in an effort to dispel rumours of the death of the famous Uighur musician Abdurehim Heyit, who disappeared in Xinjiang in 2017, Chinese state media released a video of Heyit attesting to his health. In the video, he said he is in police custody and has \u201cnever been abused\u201d. In response, activists and members of the Uighur diaspora called for proof of life videos of their relatives under the hashtag #MeTooUyghur. Uighurs have been cautious about communicating on the Chinese social media app, WeChat, because it is closely monitored by Beijing. Uighurs outside of China have struggled to access information about family members who have been sent to the camps. It is dangerous for those in Xinjiang to make contact with people outside of China, meaning that even those who have not been detained cannot contact family members around the world for fear it could put them in danger.",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s diplomatic imperative of strategic avoidance, its quest to not have to choose between the last remaining superpower of the 20th century and the emerging one of this century, is coming under increasing pressure. With a bellicose White House whipping up a trade war, the Red Army bearing down on Hong Kong and the rising influence of China in the Pacific, a series of flashpoints are challenging Australia\u2019s determination not to have to pick a team. At home, politicians from across the aisle have been amping up the rhetoric, one backbencher likening the rise of China to that of Nazi Germany, while the influence of Chinese money on both sides of politics comes under heightened scrutiny. Implicit in these interventions is an assumption that, if push comes to geopolitical shove, Australians will come to their senses and revert to their traditional western ally. But findings in this week\u2019s Essential report suggest that the public mood may not be so clearcut. When it comes to the United States of America, we remain largely positive about the republic that gave the world the Declaration of Independence, came to our defence in the second world war and provided a cultural soundtrack from Hollywood to Facebook. The strongest endorsement of US influence is in our national security and, to a slightly lesser extent, trade. Less clearcut are our judgments on the influence of the US on Australian culture and politics, where a sizeable minority are perturbed about the American influence. In contrast, attitudes to China\u2019s relationship with Australia are more conflicted. Having ridden the wave of China\u2019s appetite for natural resources for nearly two decades, we recognise the importance of Chinese trade with our economy but there is significant concern about the impact of the relationship on national security and Australian politics. Read together, these findings reflect nuance in our attitudes to both the superpowers and their relative contribution to our national interest. Even at a time of heightened theatrics in both Washington and Beijing, we seem capable of breaking the relationships down to their component parts. The most interesting table in this series though is what I will call our \u201cpreferred superpower index\u201d. If forced to choose between one of the superpowers we are less emphatically American than many would have predicted. The attitude of voters from the progressive side of politics are particularly conflicted, with Greens voters prioritising relationships with China over the US and Labor voters evenly split. This suggests the reflex glance across the Pacific is no longer our default national geopolitical setting and, with it, assumptions about western cultural asymmetry may no longer be as profound as they once were. It also suggests we are capable of separating out concerns about the operation of the communist state and the lived experience of a society that is being increasingly integrated within its regional sphere of influence. Maybe this can simply be read as a particular reaction to the current president and his self-defeating reimagining of American exceptionalism, but I suspect there is something more profound at play. Perhaps our western chickens are coming home to roost; as Trump and the Brexiteers and, to a lesser extent, our own motley local crew construct political agendas by dumping on the institutions of liberal democracy, they are doing more long-term damage. Because if our leaders don\u2019t embrace a free press, international conventions on human rights, climate change and separation of powers, then the comparative cost of transition to something less open is not so great. As western leaders look more and more like despots with little regard for the institutions of liberal democracy, why wouldn\u2019t global politics just become a zero sum game of economic self-interest? Sure, a dictatorship of engineers may monitor its citizens, repress free speech and expand its economic interest, but absent a clear and functioning alternative maybe we will all just shrug our collective shoulders and look after Number One. \u2022 Peter Lewis is an executive director of Essential",

      "bodyText": "The new Seven West Media chief executive, James Warburton, is pinning his hopes on entrepreneurial thinking to turn around the ailing media group, saying he will shake up some of the company\u2019s \u201ctired\u201d television shows and look for mergers and acquisitions at the same time as continuing to slash costs. On Tuesday Warburton, who became CEO five days ago after the sudden and unexplained exit of Tim Worner, repeatedly said all options were on the table to fix the mess at Seven, refusing to rule out going back to shareholders for a cash injection or a merger with Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp. Investors who had been expecting a financial result soaked with red ink were not disappointed, with Seven declaring a loss of almost $445m, down from a profit of $134m the previous year, after it carved $574m from the carrying value of its TV licences and its print outlets, the Pacific magazine group and the West Australian newspaper. Despite the company\u2019s dismal performance, Worner\u2019s total pay went up from $2.89m to $3.15m, more than $2.5m of which he trousered in cash. And he may still collect an additional $2.5m as a \u201ctermination payment\u201d in lieu of the 12 months\u2019 notice required by his employment contract. But he missed out on a bonus that was worth about $179,000 last year, and about $900,000 worth of stock options lapsed because of Seven\u2019s collapsing share price. Seven\u2019s chairman and 40% owner, Kerry Stokes, who just two years ago defended Worner\u2019s performance at a time when the chief executive was mired in scandal over the media company\u2019s treatment of an employee with whom he had an affair, did not take part in a question-and-answer session with reporters and analysts on Tuesday. Warburton, who is under pressure to pay down the company\u2019s $650m debt pile, will receive substantially less than Worner as he strives to fix Seven: $1.35m in cash a year, plus a bonus of up to $2m a year and shares worth up to $4.05m over the next four years. He pinned his hopes for a revival on TV, where revenue across the industry is in steady decline, on the 2020 Olympics in Japan, which has a time difference of just an hour with Australia, and a shake-up of other programming. \u201cWe have some tired formats and we are skewing too old in some areas,\u201d he said. While pledging to continue an austerity program that last year slashed $38m in costs, he said the company \u201ccannot cost-cut our way to success\u201d. He said it would be a \u201chunter\u201d for mergers and acquisitions, and was keen for a partnership with one of the video-on-demand providers. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Challenged on how Seven could achieve this when it had just $90m in cash and was committed to paying down hundreds of millions in debt, Warburton said the company had \u201ca whole range of options to look at\u201d. \u201cWhether it\u2019s scrip, whether its other areas of mergers, cost out and operational improvement,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately it\u2019s that type of non-thinking or non-entrepreneurial dealmaking that stagnates businesses. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to focus on the business, work out a path and increase the value for shareholders.\u201d Of the $650m Seven owes the banks, $400m falls due in two years\u2019 time \u2013 in November 2021 \u2013 said its chief financial officer, Warwick Lynch. As Warburton pledged to reduce costs, Seven\u2019s annual report revealed that the company had paid the director and former Liberal premier of Victoria Jeff Kennett a total of $365,000 a year, made up of $145,000 for sitting on the board and an additional $220,000 for giving political commentary on air.",

      "bodyText": "Western Sydney composer Holly Harrison grew up wanting to make music. But she cannot remember learning about a single female composer at school \u2013 except, that is, Clara Schumann. Schumann was a child prodigy, a pianist and a composer who had a profound influence on the Romantic era. It was her love letters to Johannes Brahms, however, that became the focus during lessons. The takeaway was clear: a woman\u2019s worth came down to her relationships with men. Not her music. That legacy continues. In 2018-19, only 76 classical concerts out of 1,445 performed worldwide included a work by a woman, according to the Donne: Women in Music project. Put another way: 95% of concerts globally contained only music composed by men. Harrison is now one of the women included in Offspring Bites 2, an album made up entirely of work by female composers, released by the Sydney-based music group Ensemble Offspring. The album, which was released in June and will have a European tour in September, is a continuation of Ensemble Offspring\u2019s pledge to create more works by women. In 2017, the group dedicated their entire season to performing the work of female composers; in the same year, they commissioned 17 new works. Not only that. Through the international initiative Keychange, Ensemble Offspring has promised that at least 50% of their programming will be work by female composers. (Half of their board and staff will also be made up of women.) In doing so, they are joining an international call to arms. In one high-profile example, both the BBC Proms and Sound and Music, the UK\u2019s national development agency for new music, have pledged that by 2022 half of all their new commissions will be by female composers. Yet a very real challenge for classical music is how to navigate the historical canon \u2013 a canon overwhelmingly made up of men. \u201cThere are standout female artists in all fields who have made a wonderful contribution despite many odds, but we just don\u2019t know much about these trailblazing women or their work,\u201d says Hilary Kleinig, artistic director of Adelaide-based string ensemble the Zephyr Quartet. \u201cIt then becomes a vicious cycle because for the most part their work is not celebrated or recognised historically, so it doesn\u2019t get discussed, played, taught or programmed.\u201d While the \u201cgreatest hits\u201d of the canon are by men \u2013 due, largely, to women traditionally not having the same opportunities \u2013 the future need not follow the same pattern. \u201cIt sounds so simple, but program it or commission it. With one in three Australian composers being women, there\u2019s an abundance of repertoire to choose from,\u201d insists Harrison. For Kleinig, female role models are key: \u201cIf you have never seen a woman conduct or lead an orchestra, do you imagine that that could be your future?\u201d This matters when women tend to put themselves forward less for opportunities, grants, prizes and scholarships. Ensemble Offspring receives 30% less female applications than male for their emerging artist development program Hatched Academy. Ensemble Offspring\u2019s artistic director Claire Edwardes puts this down to some \u201cdoubt there in terms of the worth of their art \u2013 and that would no doubt be because of the years and years preceding this point in time, whereby pretty much the only composers being performed were male\u201d. Female-only prizes \u2013 such as Sydney University\u2019s Sue W Chamber Music Composition prize, or Melbourne ensemble Rubiks\u2019 Pythia prize, both awarded to female composers \u2013 provides one remedy, as does affirmative action. Blind auditions have helped even out gender imbalances within orchestras, too. But for many composers, the ultimate luxury will be when they are judged on their art alone, not on their gender. Composer Nicole Murphy, who was awarded the Noisy Women Commission from Ensemble Offspring last year, is asked in nearly every interview about what it is like to be a woman working in music. \u201cThis is fantastic because we need to discuss this if change is going to occur.

      "bodyText": "The rise of nationalism and governments that interfere in markets pose a threat to the global economic system, the boss of BHP, the world\u2019s biggest mining company, has warned. Despite announcing a 124% rise in profits to $US8.31bn (\u00a36.84bn), helped by booming iron ore sales to China, Andrew Mackenzie said on Tuesday that there were \u201ca number of things abroad\u201d that were causing concern for the Anglo-Australian behemoth. The standoff between the US and China was a concern for the company, he said, and could threaten the company\u2019s bottom line and the wider global economy trade. \u201cThe US-China relationship is a consideration for us,\u201d Mackenzie told reporters on a media call in Melbourne. \u201cWe continue to enjoy strong sales to China. But no doubt this [trade standoff] will put a dampener on world economic growth. Ultimately it will impact demand for our products. \u201cMore generally there are number of things abroad \u2026 increased nationalism, increased assertion by governments to interfere in global supply chains and capitalism \u2026 that is a consideration.\u201d The chief executive\u2019s thinly veiled reference to Donald Trump\u2019s decision to impose tariffs on Chinese imports into the US reflects BHP\u2019s delicate position straddling the world economy. BHP\u2019s huge profits come from operations around the globe, and the company and its shareholders have benefited enormously as it has fuelled China\u2019s expansion with raw materials such as iron ore, coking coal and copper. The final payout of $4bn to shareholders announced on Tuesday makes a record total of $17bn for the year, with final dividend of US78c per share. But as the US-China trade standoff develops into a broader clash over currencies and regulation, it appears to threaten the rules-based order that has paved the way for the rapid growth of emerging economies in the past 30 years. Mackenzie said that BHP enjoyed a healthy and balanced relationship with Beijing, but that he \u201ccompletely gets\u201d the need for countries such as Australia, whose biggest trading partner is China, to respect traditional alliances that had \u201cunderpinned and given rise to the liberal approach\u201d enjoyed in the west. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy balance to manage,\u201d he said, adding that he thought politicians in Australia, where BHP has its operational headquarters, were doing a \u201creasonable\u201d job. Mackenzie also faces a conflict over the need to develop resources while taking what he called a \u201cresponsible approach to global warming\u201d. In July he said the impact of climate change was \u201cindisputable\u201d and although the company is planning to wind down its thermal coal business \u2013 ie, coal used for power generation \u2013 he would not be drawn on a timetable. \u201cWe don\u2019t intend to invest and grow the business,\u201d he said, but the company would continue to review its portfolio of assets. Mackenzie\u2019s remarks about China came as Scott Morrison, the Australian prime minister, called on Tuesday for a \u201cnew set of rules\u201d to manage world trade. The Australian government faces the same delicate balancing act as BHP in its approach to China, especially as the mounting political crisis in Hong Kong brings the prospect of some form of intervention by Beijing to quell the protests. Having taken millions out of poverty, China needed to enter a new phase, Morrison said. \u201cHaving achieved that critical mass of economic performance, the rules that apply to all of us \u2013 the US \u2013 have got to apply in China as well,\u201d he told Channel Seven . Morrison said both China and the US were \u201cwrestling with this massive change\u201d, arguing there is \u201cno doubt that the economic rise of China has had a profound impact for processing and manufacturing in the US\u201d. \u201cThe US has made some very legitimate points about the nature of trading relationship. And so we just engage in both.\u201d Minutes released on Tuesday from the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s board meeting earlier this month showed the the US-China dispute was a factor in the bank\u2019s downgrade of Australia\u2019s growth outlook. \u201cUncertainty about how these disputes would play out and how effective domestic policy measures would be in supporting Chinese demand continued to be an important consideration for the global growth outlook and, from an Australian perspective, the future demand for steel and bulk commodities,\u201d they said.",

Here are seven words that would have come in handy if you were living a shady life in the British penal colonies of 19th century Australia \u2014 Vaux\u2019s original text, in bold, followed by some explanation and illustration of the terms from the convict record.</p> <h2><strong>Bum traps</strong></h2> <p><strong>A sheriff\u2019s officer or his follower</strong></p> <p>A sheriff\u2019s officer, more commonly termed a bailiff, was notorious for following closely at a sheriff\u2019s bum. For this reason, bailiffs were called bum-bailiffs and members of the \u201ccatch club\u201d (because they were said to \u201ccatch\u201d farts.) But they were also known as bull-dogs, hawks, lurchers and, from the manner in which they escorted debtors, shoulder clappers. Bailiffs were unpopular; colonists attacked them with knives, swords and pistols. In 1853 a South Australian, John Bevis, was fined \u00a31 for kicking a \u201cbum bailiff\u201d and pelting him with stones.</p> <h2><strong>Chiv</strong></h2> <p><strong>A knife; to chiv a person is to stab or cut him with a knife</strong></p> <p>Chiv, a term applied to any improvised bladed weapon, may derive from <em>chivomengro</em>, a Romany word for knife. William Courtney accused George Bradley of stabbing him in his chest at the Impression Bay probation station in Van Diemen\u2019s Land. According to Courtney\u2019s testimony, Bradley\u2019s accomplice, Charles Fisher, instructed him to \u201cding the chiv\u201d. Bradley and Fisher were convicted of attempted murder, with the jury recommending that they be executed. But the two convicts appealed the sentence and successfully argued that Courtney had stabbed himself. They were pardoned and Courtney was sentenced to nine months\u2019 hard labour in chains. Courtney had a history of self-harm \u2013 during his imprisonment he was punished for rubbing caustic lime into his eyes, injuring his foot and cutting his own throat.</p> <h2><strong>Finger-smith</strong></h2> <p><strong>A midwife</strong></p> <p>Midwives were nicknamed finger-smiths because they worked with their fingers, and because smith means \u201cmaker\u201d and \u201cworker\u201d. Convicts were the first finger-smiths to arrive in Australia from Britain. Babies were delivered on board transport ships and in prisons. When Jane Skinner went into labour at Richmond gaol in Van Diemen\u2019s Land, Mary Ann Watson was released from solitary confinement to act as her finger-smith. But Skinner\u2019s baby died soon after it was born. Because of unwholesome living conditions and insufficient or inadequate medical training and equipment, the infant mortality rate among convicts was notoriously high. Watson, whose trade was listed as \u201cwasherwoman\u201d, may not have been experienced in midwifery. She did, however, have finger-smith expertise \u2013 finger-smith is also slang for \u201cpickpocket\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Flesh-bag</strong></h2> <p><strong>A shirt</strong></p> <p>In 1844 the governor of Oakham gaol overheard an inmate and burglar, William Bats, divulge that, despite wearing his \u201cflesh-bag\u201d over his clothes to alter his appearance, his victim had recognised him at his preliminary hearing before the \u201cbeaks\u201d (magistrates). Bates was charged with burglary and transported to Van Diemen\u2019s Land for life.</p> <h2><strong>Hopper-dockers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Shoes</strong></p> <p>Shoes may have been nicknamed hopper-dockers because barefoot people hop to \u201cdock\u201d their feet. But shoes also were nicknamed hock-dockers, after hock, \u201cthe joint in a quadruped\u2019s hind leg\u201d, and clod-hoppers, because people hop over earthen clods. In 1827, at Parramatta, convicts \u201cshook\u201d the \u201cclod-hoppers\u201d and \u201ckicksers\u201d belonging to convict Nicholas Doyle, a so-called \u201cflat\u201d. The thieves also stole Doyle\u2019s certificate of freedom. A convict, Robert Goodwin, offered to \u201cspring the plant\u201d if Doyle paid him \u201cblunt\u201d, but because Doyle was penniless he prosecuted Goodwin to recover his possessions. Doyle failed to prove that Goodwin was the thief, so the judge dismissed the case for lack of evidence.</p> <h2><strong>Quod</strong></h2> <p><strong>A gaol. To quod a person is to send him to gaol. In quod, is in gaol</strong></p> <p>Quod comes from quadrangle, a square or rectangular space or courtyard enclosed by buildings. When Frances Stewart was charged with drunkenness in 1840, the Sydney Monitor and Commercial Advertiser described her as \u201can old and multitudinous offender, with face as red as scarlet, and nose blue as bilberry\u201d. Stewart explained to the judge that she drank to cope with the loss of her lover, and, in summing up her sorry plight, stated: \u201cI expects you won\u2019t send me to quod.\u201d But Stewart was \u201cordered to study Zimmerman for 120 hours, in Mr Keck\u2019s library\u201d \u2013 five days\u2019 solitary confinement in Sydney gaol, supervised by the gaoler Henry Keck. Zimmerman refers to Solitude, a book written by John George Zimmerman.</p> <h2><strong>Spoony</strong></h2> <p><strong>Foolish, half-witted, nonsensical; a man who has been drinking till he becomes disgusting by his very ridiculous behaviour, is said to be \u201cspoony\u201d drunk; and, from hence it is usual to call a very prating shallow fellow \u201ca rank spoon\u201d</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a9e322efeae5dafa1f7952f3211f60218a8fd444\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9e322efeae5dafa1f7952f3211f60218a8fd444/0_0_1878_2834/663.jpg\" alt=\"the dictionary\" width=\"663\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Foolish people may have been called spoony because, like the bowl of a spoon, they are shallow and lack depth.

Graham, however, made his way to a police station where he persuaded a constable to assist him in recovering his property. Graham\u2019s purse and cash were discovered wedged in a stack of five mattresses in the bedroom of a sex worker, Mary Jane Reily.

Spoony Foolish, half-witted, nonsensical; a man who has been drinking till he becomes disgusting by his very ridiculous behaviour, is said to be \u201cspoony\u201d drunk; and, from hence it is usual to call a very prating shallow fellow \u201ca rank spoon\u201d Foolish people may have been called spoony because, like the bowl of a spoon, they are shallow and lack depth.

Graham, however, made his way to a police station where he persuaded a constable to assist him in recovering his property. Graham\u2019s purse and cash were discovered wedged in a stack of five mattresses in the bedroom of a sex worker, Mary Jane Reily. Reily was arrested and sentenced to eight months\u2019 imprisonment. \u2022 Simon Barnard\u2019s verbosely titled new book \u2013 James Hardy Vaux\u2019s 1819 Dictionary of Criminal Slang and Other Impolite Terms as Used by the Convicts of the British Colonies of Australia with Additional True Stories, Remarkable Facts and Illustrations \u2013 is out now through Text Publishing",

Acting opposition leader Richard Marles made the call on Tuesday after the Australian Financial Review revealed the loan request. The PNG commerce minister, Wera Mori, reportedly said PNG would like the loan to be provided \u201cby Australia alone\u201d, but questioned \u201cwhere else can we go\u201d if Australia refused \u2013 widely interpreted as a suggestion it would be forced to turn to China instead. Australia\u2019s planned \u201cstep up\u201d of engagement with the Pacific has suffered in recent days after it watered down a communique from the Pacific Islands Forum despite overwhelming support from regional leaders for stronger action on the climate crisis. Labor has taken aim at the Coalition for its record presiding over increasing emissions and unfortunate gaffes such as deputy prime minister Michael McCormack\u2019s suggestion that Pacific islands will survive climate crisis \u2013 in part \u2013 because they \u201cpick our fruit\u201d.

Australia provides annual aid to Papua New Guinea of $608m through direct funding of aid programs. In 2017 the Turnbull government rejected a request from PNG to provide the aid in the form of direct support to its budget, with former international development minister Concetta Fierravanti-Wells warning that aid is not \u201ccharity\u201d. Marles said Australia should not be \u201cfundamentalist\u201d about the form aid takes but rather be \u201ccapable of delivering it in different ways\u201d, while taking each request on its merits. \u201cThe size of development assistance matters, but it doesn\u2019t define the relationship,\u201d Marles said. \u201cWe need to be deeply focused on building our relationship with the Pacific on its own terms.\u201d Marles said that Australia should not engage with the Pacific \u201cby reference to China\u201d, suggesting that \u201csometimes that\u2019s the way Australia has gone about things\u201d. The shadow minister for defence rejected the view that PNG\u2019s terms for the loan amounted to a demand for the money or else it would turn to China, but said he was not surprised \u201cyou get comments of that kind coming back from the Pacific\u201d, given Australia has framed its Pacific policy with reference to China. Marles said that a Pacific policy determined by a \u201cstrategic denial of China\u201d would not work because \u201cit will be viewed really cynically\u201d. \u201cWe can\u2019t be there because we don\u2019t want somebody else to be there, we should be there because it\u2019s a part of the world that\u2019s very central to us.\u201d Marles said that McCormack\u2019s comments were \u201cdeeply offensive\u201d and ignored the \u201cexistential threat\u201d posed by the climate crisis to Pacific nations.

An increasing number of economists see a recession looming in the US, according to a new report, while Donald Trump \u2013 whose erratic course on trade and monetary policy has shaken markets, analysts say \u2013 sees a conspiracy afoot.</p> \n  <p>Thirty-four percent of economists surveyed by the National Association for Business Economics, in a report being released Monday, said they believe a slowing economy will tip into recession in 2021, the Associated Press reports:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That\u2019s up from 25% in a survey taken in February. Only 2% of those polled expect a recession to begin this year, while 38% predict that it will occur in 2020. [...] The economists have previously expressed concern that Trump\u2019s tariffs and higher budget deficits could eventually dampen the economy. </p> \n   <p>The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on goods from many key US trading partners, from China and Europe to Mexico and Canada. Officials maintain that the tariffs, which are taxes on imports, will help the administration gain more favorable terms of trade. But US trading partners have simply retaliated with tariffs of their own. </p> \n   <p>Trade between the US and China, the two biggest global economies, has plunged. Trump decided last Wednesday to postpone until 15 December tariffs on about 60% of an additional $300bn of Chinese imports, granting a reprieve from a planned move that would have extended duties to nearly everything the US buys from China. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Beware any commentator who points out the problem, as conservative pundit Juan Williams did on <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/457885-trump-calls-juan-williams-pathetic-nasty-and-wrong\">Fox News Sunday</a>, accusing Trump of creating \u201cunpredictability\u201d.

Yet he is always nasty and wrong!</p>\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1163167660764532736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 18, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Where economist and analysts see an interplay between Trump\u2019s policies and the markets, Trump sees a conspiracy involving his own appointees, foreign lands and the US media, reports Maggie Haberman in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/18/us/politics/trump-economy-recession.html\">New York Times</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>He has insisted that his own handpicked Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H Powell, is intentionally acting against him. He has said other countries, including allies, are working to hurt American economic interests. And he has accused the news media of trying to create a recession.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThe Fake News Media is doing everything they can to crash the economy because they think that will be bad for me and my re-election,\u201d Mr Trump tweeted last week. \u201cThe problem they have is that the economy is way too strong and we will soon be winning big on Trade, and everyone knows that, including China!\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Not all economists think the US is in for a recession. The AP report notes in small print at the bottom:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Still, for now, most economic signs appear solid. Employers are adding jobs at a steady pace, the unemployment rate remains near a 50-year low and consumers are optimistic. US retail sales figures out last Thursday showed that they jumped in July by the most in four months.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Later this morning we\u2019ll look at remarks in which Trump suggested he was walking back support he had earlier voiced for background checks for gun purchases, and we\u2019ll catch up with some of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. Thanks for joining us for your politics Monday. </p> \n </div> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "Kari Paul, logging out for the night! Here\u2019s the top news of the afternoon: Planned Parenthood is no longer accepting Title X funding after the Trump administration banned it from being used at organizations that refer patients for abortion procedures. The Trump administration is considering a payroll tax cut to slow impending economic woes. Jeffrey Epstein signed a will two days before his death from suicide, CNN reports. The US may view aid given by Greece to an Iranian tanker as \u201cmaterial support to a terrorist group,\u201d according to the State Department. Donald Trump chatted with Boris Johnson and is looking forward to meeting him at the G7 summit this week. That\u2019s all, folks! Have a nice day. Journalists are dropping out of an upcoming softball game with presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and his campaign. CNN and ABC news pulled out of a Sunday night game at Iowa\u2019s Field of Dreams \u201cnot wanting to be associated with a campaign fundraising effort,\u201d POLITICO reported. Other media outlets including news site Iowa Starting Line will still participate. \u201cUnconfirmed rumors from scouts suggest that some on the opposing team \u2014 having realized Bernie \u2018the Bern\u2019 Sanders was the scheduled pitcher for tonight\u2019s contest \u2014 decided to stand down,\u201d campaign manager Faiz Shakir told POLITICO. \u201cOthers say that a few media executives got a little squeamish about sharing the field with Bernie. Regardless, fans will not be disappointed. It is game on. Because we have to fulfill the promise of \u2018if you build it, they will come!\u2019\u201d President Donald Trump said he looks forward to meeting with Boris Johnson at the G7 Summit in Biarritz this week after speaking with the UK Prime Minister by phone on Monday. The two discussed a \u201cwide range of trade and economic issues\u201d and Johnson updated Trump on the status of Brexit, according to a pool report from the White House. The US may view aid given by Greece to an Iranian tanker as \u201cmaterial support to a terrorist group,\u201d according to the State Department. From Reuters: The United States has conveyed its \u201cstrong position\u201d to the Greek government about an Iranian tanker that sailed for Greece on Monday after it was freed from detention off Gibraltar and Washington says is carrying oil to Syria, a State Department official said. Any efforts to assist the tanker could be considered as providing material support to a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization, which has immigration and potential criminal consequences, the official said. The Grace 1, renamed the Adrian Darya 1, left anchorage off Gibraltar late on Sunday. Refinitiv ship tracking data showed on Monday that the vessel was heading to Kalamata in Greece and was scheduled to arrive next Sunday. The official said the tanker was assisting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp, which the United States has designated as a terrorist organization, by transporting oil to Syria. The official said the United States had conveyed its \u201cstrong position\u201d to the Greek government, as well as to all ports in the Mediterranean about facilitating the tanker. Facebook said the Trump campaign violated the platform\u2019s rules with advertisements targeting women, Popular Information reported on Monday. Facebook advertising guidelines prohibit content that targets \u201cpersonal attributes,\u201d including ads that make \u201cdirect or indirect assertions or implications about a person\u2019s... gender identity.\u201d After Popular Information asked Facebook about Trump campaign ads targeting women, the company said it has notified the Trump campaign that the ads violate policy. \u201cThey can\u2019t continue to run unless fixed,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson said. Facebook launched tools for more transparency in political advertising and hired more than 3,000 people in 2018 to manually review ads for violations. But the company said it still relies primarily on automated tools to check ads. Earlier this month, the campaign launched a number of \u2018Latinos for Trump\u2019 ads days after an anti-Latino domestic terror attack in El Paso, Texas, where the shooter\u2019s motive was linked to Trump\u2019s rhetoric regarding immigrants. Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier with ties to many high-profile politicians including Donald Trump, had signed a will two days before his death, CNN reports. Epstein had assets of about $577 million and listed his brother Mark Epstein as the only heir. He died from suicide on August 10 while awaiting trial for accusations of running a sex trafficking ring of underage girls. The will was signed August 8. On Monday, Representative Pete King became the first Republican to back a bill in the House that would ban assault weapons. King is listed as a co-sponsor of the Assault Weapons Bill of 2019 on Congress\u2019s website, the Hill reported. \u201cThey are weapons of mass slaughter,\u201d King told the New York Daily News on Monday \u201cI don\u2019t see any need for them in everyday society.\u201d His support for the legislation comes after two recent mass shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio left 32 dead and dozens more injured in August. Republicans and Democrats have been largely divided on the issue of gun legislation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has vowed to not bring such legislation to the upper chamber\u2019s floor and President Trump has also expressed opposition to the bill. Several Trump Administration officials are considering a payroll tax cut to counter the weakening economy, the Washington Post reports. From the Post: Millions of Americans pay a \u201cpayroll tax\u201d on their earnings, a 6.2 percent levy that is used to finance Social Security programs. The payroll tax was last cut in 2011 and 2012 during the Obama administration to 4.2 percent, as a way to encourage more consumer spending during the recent economic downturn. But the cut was allowed to reset back up to 6.2 percent in 2013. Workers pay payroll taxes on income up to $132,900, so cutting the tax has remained a popular idea for many lawmakers, especially Democrats, seeking to deliver savings for middle-income earners and not the wealthiest Americans. But payroll tax cuts can also add dramatically to the deficit and \u2013 depending on how they are designed \u2013 pull billions of dollars away from Social Security. The Trump administration has only been looking into the potential tax cuts for a few days. It could potentially create a bigger tax cut than the 2017 tax law. Planned Parenthood will no longer accept funds from a federal program subsidizing women\u2019s health care after the Trump administration banned participants from referring patients to abortion providers, the organization said Monday. The Trump administration said organizations that receive Title X health care funding can no longer provide counseling regarding abortion. Planned Parenthood said it will leave the program due to the \u201cgag rule,\u201d which prevents providers from discussing the health procedure. \u201cDue to an unethical and dangerous gag rule, the Trump administration has forced Planned Parenthood grantees out of Title X,\u201d acting president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Alexis McGill Johnson told journalists on a conference call. Providers say this change will result in less funding for the organization, longer wait times, and increased costs for services. Hello readers, it\u2019s Kari Paul, heading the blog for the next few hours. More news to come. Here\u2019s a summary of the day in politics so far: Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib called a press conference to protest their denial of travel to Israel. \u201cWe cannot let Trump and Netanyahu succeed in hiding the cruel reality of the occupation from us,\u201d Omar said. She called the travel ban \u201cnot consistent with democracy.\u201d A survey of economists found an uptick in predictions of a US recession on the horizon. But Donald Trump chalked negative economic news up to a conspiracy against him. Trump launched Twitter attacks on pundits and media outlets who reported the economy might not be as strong as Trump likes to say. Attorney general William Barr removed the acting director of the federal Bureau of Prisons more than a week after millionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein took his own life while in federal custody. Presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren apologized at a Native American forum for the controversy over her past claims to indigenous heritage: \u201cI am sorry for harm I have caused. I have listened, and I have learned. A lot.\u201d Trump tamped down expectations for congressional action on gun safety, saying in part \u201cwe already have a lot of background checks, OK?\u201d The president got into a Twitter spat with his former communications director Anthony Scaramucci. Here\u2019s another constituent of Omar, Amber Harris, a Jewish American resident of Minnesota who is married to a Palestinian from the West Bank and who has been denied the right to travel to visit his family. She says the last time she tried to enter she was held and interrogated for 10 hours by Shin Bet and her marriage documents were almost thrown away, she says that she was yelled at for being a human rights activist and an environmentalist, and she says she was told she was a threat to the state of Israel and banned for 10 years. She says she has been denied the right to see her husband. She says in her last try to enter the West Bank she was told she was involved in violent protests which she denies. \u201cThe only conclusion I can come up with ... is that they are punishing me for my activities in protests in Ferguson, Missouri. I am being punished for free speech activities in my own country.\u201d She says Israel is punishing US citizens \u201cfor political activity within the US\u201d. Lana Barkawi, a Palestinian American who has not been able to visit her homeland and an Omar constituent, is talking about the pain of being denied the right to travel home. She describes \u201cour hope that we can someday return\u201d. She said she has been unable to balance her questions about her family with the negative image of Palestinians promulgated in US pop culture. \u201cWe knew the stories about what happens to Palestinians when they attempt to visit Israel,\u201d Barkawi says. She says her parents live \u201can enduring trauma\u201d from exile and \u201cto have their fate in the hands of an Israeli soldier\u201d at an entry checkpoint was too great a weight to bear. She thanks Omar for bringing \u201cthe cruel and racist occupation of Palestine by Israel into the national conversation. \u201cFor Israel to deny a family visit or to make it conditional is truly inhumane.\u201d Tlaib is up now. She says that their planned trip was \u201ca common occurrence for members of Congress\u201d. She compares the denial of entry to the inability of members of Congress to visit apartheid South Africa. Tlaib says: \u201cI watched as my mother had to go through dehumanizing checkpoints even though she was a United States citizen and proud American.\u201d She breaks into tears, stopping momentarily. Then she tells stories of watching family members navigate checkpoints to receive medical care and being harassed by security forces. She says Israelis \u201calso desperately want peace for their Palestinian neighbors\u201d. Tlaib says she is speaking out in tribute to her Palestinian grandmother. \u201cAll I can do as her granddaughter is help humanize her and the Palestinian people\u2019s plight,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is unfortunate that prime minister Netanyahu has taken a page out of Trump\u2019s book and even taken Trump\u2019s direction,\u201d she says. \u201cAll of us Americans should be deeply disturbed.\u201d Omar: We cannot let Trump and Netanyahu succeed in hiding the cruel reality of the occupation from us ... barring members of Congress from seeing it does not make it go away. Omar says that suppression of expression and association in Israel \u201cis not consistent with democracy\u201d. She continues: You know Donald Trump would love nothing more than to use this issue to pit Muslim and Jewish-Americans against each other. The Muslim and Jewish communities are being othered and made into the bogeyman by this administration. The news conference has begun. Omar is speaking. She says leading up to her anticipated trip, she met with constituents with a \u201crange\u201d of views \u201con the conflict\u201d. She said the trip she proposed was a usual trip for members of Congress. \u201cThe decision to ban me and my colleague, the first two Muslim American women elected to Congress, is nothing less than an attempt by an ally of the United States to deny our ability to do our job as an elected official,\u201d she says. \u201cThe only way to preserve unjust policy is to suppress people\u2019s freedom of expression, freedom of association and freedom of movement.\u201d Here\u2019s a live video stream of the upcoming Omar-Tlaib news conference. We\u2019re awaiting their arrival now: Representative Ilhan Omar has promised to post a live stream of her imminent press conference with Representative Rashida Tlaib on the topic of their being banned from travel to Israel and Palestine in her Twitter feed here. snap Can Trump keep up the appeal he demonstrated in 2016 among white women without college degrees? That new NBC/WSJ poll indicates it could be an uphill battle for him: That slice of the demographic might be more interesting to look at for elections handicappers than, say, white men without a college degree, because women who voted for Trump in 2016 seem to be more in play, as a group: A new squad taking shape? After a 37-month closure for renovation and repairs, the Washington Monument is set to reopen. A Park Service press release calls it \u201canother example of how the Trump Administration is enhancing visitors\u2019 experiences at national parks and public lands across the nation.\u201d Enhancing visitor experiences... by mounting a full-out assault on public lands? A poll out from NBC / WSJ says half of Americans approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the economy \u2013 note that that is better than his low-40s approval rating in general \u2013 but support for free trade has spiked to 64%, in a rebuke of Trump\u2019s tariffs. The Washington Post\u2019s Greg Sargent points out another poll finding: huge support for a generic Democrat over Trump, among those voters who think the economy is the only thing Trump is doing right: Here\u2019s the lineup for this afternoon\u2019s press conference with Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, who were denied entry by Israel to the Occupied Territories: Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) Rosa Druker, IfNotNow Twin Cities Member Lana Barkawi, Palestinian-American and Minnesota Resident Amber Harris, Jewish-American and Minnesota Resident The US has made secret contact with Venezuela\u2019s socialist party boss as close allies of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s inner circle seek guarantees they won\u2019t face prosecution for alleged abuses and crimes if they cede to growing demands to remove him, according to a senior Trump administration official, the AP reports: Diosdado Cabello, who is considered the most-powerful man in Venezuela after Maduro, met last month in Caracas with someone who is in close contact with the Trump administration, the official told The Associated Press. A second meeting is in the works but has not yet taken place. The AP is withholding the intermediary\u2019s name and details of the encounter with Cabello out of concern the person could suffer reprisals. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they aren\u2019t authorized to discuss the talks, which are still preliminary. It\u2019s not clear whether the talks have Maduro\u2019s approval or not. Cabello, 56, is a major power broker inside Venezuela, who has seen his influence in the government and security forces expand as Maduro\u2019s grip on power has weakened. But he\u2019s also been accused by US officials of being behind massive corruption, drug trafficking and even death threats against a sitting US senator. Read further. Representative Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, the assistant House speaker, has endorsed opening an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump, Politico reports: Luj\u00e1n, a close ally of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, is the highest-ranking House Democrat to support an impeachment investigation. The New Mexico Democrat, who serves as assistant House speaker, is running for Senate in his home state. He is the 127th House Democrat to back impeachment proceedings. Read further. The acting director of the federal Bureau of Prisons has been removed from his position more than a week after millionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein took his own life while in federal custody, the AP reports: William Barr announced Hugh Hurwitz\u2019s reassignment Monday. Hurwitz had served as the agency\u2019s acting director since May 2018. The attorney general gave no reason was given for Hurwitz\u2019s reassignment, but the move comes as the bureau faces increased scrutiny after Epstein\u2019s suicide on 10 August at a New York jail. The FBI and justice Department\u2019s inspector general are investigating. Barr has named Kathleen Hawk Sawyer to succeed Hurwitz. She was the agency\u2019s director from 1992 until 2003. Hurwitz also led the agency when Boston mobster James \u201cWhitey\u201d Bulger was killed in a federal prison in West Virginia in October. \u201cNewt Gingrich and an eclectic band of NASA skeptics are trying sell President Donald Trump on a reality show-style plan to jump-start the return of humans to the moon \u2014 at a fraction of the space agency\u2019s estimated price tag,\u201d Politico reports: The proposal, whose other proponents range from a three-star Air Force general to the former publicist for pop stars Michael Jackson and Prince, envisions creating a $2 billion sweepstakes pitting billionaires Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and other space pioneers to see who can establish and run the first lunar base, according to a summary of the plan shared with POLITICO. Sounds like it should work. \u201cTrump has yet to weigh in on the idea, at least publicly,\u201d Politico notes. Also there\u2019s no buy in from the billionaires. Gingrich has been into \u2013 visionary? \u2013 space travel schemes for a long time. Trump launched his new baseless attack on the integrity of US elections on Monday just hours after the chair of the Federal Elections Commission took Trump and Republicans to task for recklessly spreading baseless claims of voter fraud: Thinking aloud here, one seeming benefit, for the would-be despot, not naming names, of destroying faith in the integrity of elections would be, then you wouldn\u2019t have to win them, elections, in order to stay in power? Hang on Representative Steve King, the Iowa Republican whose own party has turned on him for his bigoted and controversial speech, has demanded an apology from the media and Republican party leaders after he questioned whether, without the historical persistence of rape and incest, \u201cwould there be any population of the world left?\u201d After the media reported the quote, which as demonstrated by video is accurate, Republican leaders renewed their calls for King to find another line of work. \u201cAnd so,\u201d King said Monday, \u201cwhen we have a national, viral attack that comes out on a misquote, and it\u2019s absolutely proven, all the folks that did that attack, I think they owe me an apology, including my own leadership.\u201d As for King\u2019s claim to have been misquoted: Trump appears to be picking up, in his latest attack on the integrity of US elections, on a psychologist\u2019s speculation that big tech companies have the power to shape public perceptions of US politics and candidates, which is not the same as demonstrating that something actually, you know, happened. Wow, Tweet Just Out! The president is claiming that a big tech company manipulated millions of votes in the last presidential election! That would seem to be extraordinarily reckless on the part of the president, in terms of the potential damage it could wreak to the public faith in free and fair elections, ie American democracy itself, if there were any chance that the story was maybe just another wild conspiracy theory advanced by Judicial Watch, the extreme-right propaganda outlet still devoted in August 2019 to a pretty much uninterrupted stream of Hillary Clinton conspiracy theories which the president retweets frequently especially when he seems especially upset. We can\u2019t locate at the moment the \u201cReport Just Out!\u201d that the president refers to here because we have allowed our subscription to Bananas Politics Conspiracy Theories to lapse. Developing... Here\u2019s video of the Warren \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d moment: Warren speaks out forcefully for systemic federal reporting on violence against indigenous women. \u201cOver and over I\u2019m struck by women who go missing and it doesn\u2019t make a headline... Native women, and it never makes a headline,\u201d Warren says. \u201cA problem that is not seen is a problem that is not fixed.\u201d Warren says the federal government \u201cneeds to get serious\u201d about collecting data and making sure the problem is known. She is applauded. Warren is earning applause at the Native American forum with a call for the United States to honor treaty obligations and to respect the sovereignty of tribal nations. Now she\u2019s making a call for steps to prevent violence against indigenous women and children, and for better federal reporting on missing and murdered indigenous women. Here\u2019s a livestream of Warren at the Native American forum: Senator Elizabeth Warren is among the presidential candidates speaking today at a forum on Native American issues. She has admitted \u201cmistakes\u201d and said: \u201cI am sorry for harm I have caused.\u201d Trump has just attacked (again) his own handpicked chairman of the federal reserve, and the Democrats, who he says are trying to tank the economy to prevent his reelection. Then he extends some free monetary policy advice. But also asserts that the economy is very strong. Larry Kudlow, director of the US national economic council, will hold a briefing call tomorrow to rebut reports of a recession on the horizon. Before joining the Trump administration Kudlow was a cable TV talking head with a crystal ball capable of some real doozies... John Delaney has poured a staggering $24m of his own money into running for president. He has been campaigning for the White House for more than two years, and in that time has held more than 200 events in Iowa. On one recent Thursday morning, these efforts translated into a grand total of 11 people coming out to see Delaney, at a campaign event in the small town of Algona, in the north of the state. The former Maryland congressman, former businessman and formerly much wealthier candidate is one of a slew of long-shot candidates for the Democratic nomination. In a crowded, historically diverse field, Delaney is part of a group of white, middle-aged men who are forging ahead with their increasingly quixotic presidential campaigns in spite of a collective lack of support. Delaney strode into Miller\u2019s Sports Bar &amp; Grill, one of a chain of bars across Iowa, just after 10am. One of his team had taped a couple of Delaney 2020 campaign posters to a wall in the back of the bar, and a sign-up list was on a table. The crowd, all silver haired apart from a thirtysomething man who walked in late, were sitting patiently at four different tables.

His efforts haven\u2019t been limited to labor events: Sanders has also used his campaign apparatus to recruit volunteers to get out the vote for Queens District Attorney candidate Tiffany Cab\u00e1n in New York and to boost turnout at a protest at a proposed migrant detention center in Oklahoma.

The event, scheduled to begin at 4pmET, is to include people directly impacted by the travel restrictions. We\u2019ll bring you a live stream and blog coverage. Senator Elizabeth Warren, whose claim to Native American ancestry has been the subject of political controversy, is among the 2020 presidential hopefuls participating today in a forum on Native American issues. Citing a scheduling conflict, Senator Kamala Harris will not participate in a CNN \u201cclimate town hall\u201d for presidential hopefuls next month, the network says. Candidates to have RSVP\u2019d \u201cyes\u201d include Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang. CNN said it had invited \u201cpresidential hopefuls who reach 2% in at least four Democratic National Committee-approved polls conducted between June 28 and Aug. 21\u201d. The candidates, who will make back-to-back appearances, will take questions directly from a live studio audience in New York and a CNN moderator. The audience will be drawn from Democratic voters interested in the issue. The town hall will air live on CNN platforms around the world. For future generations of political pros eager for the secret of how to transform a promising gubernatorial career into a presidential campaign job that basically amounted to a humiliating paid internship, except are we sure he was paid?, Chris Christie has announced that he is opening a politics institute named for himself, NJ.com reports: The former governor, known for his often brash leadership style that propelled him to the national stage as a tell-it-like-it-is politician, is about to unveil The Christie Institute of Public Policy, a non-profit, nonpartisan institute in part with his alma mater, Seton Hall University School of Law.

Donald Trump said on Sunday he would keep vice president Mike Pence as his running mate next year. \u201cI\u2019m very happy with Mike Pence,\u201d Trump told reporters before boarding Air Force One in New Jersey. Donald Trump has walked back a previous prediction that the United States could institute universal background checks for gun buyers, as the country\u2019s most recent major mass shootings recede in the public consciousness. Here\u2019s what Trump said on 7 August, after separate attacks in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, that killed 31 and left dozens injured: There is a great appetite, and I mean a very strong appetite, for background checks. And I think we can bring up background checks like we\u2019ve never had before. I think both Republican[s] and Democrat[s] are getting close to a bill on, to doing something with background checks. On Sunday, Trump was asked whether he would support universal background checks \u201cright now.\u201d He replied: I\u2019m not saying anything. I\u2019m saying Congress is going to be reporting back to me with ideas. And they\u2019ll come in from Democrats and Republicans. And I\u2019ll look at it very strongly. But just remember, we already have a lot of background checks. OK? Thank you. In other news: Scaramucci and Trump have taken their cable TV \u2013 Twitter smackdown entirely to Twitter. Developing... Just gold for Scaramucci to have been taken up by the president on his dog-days-of-summer cable trolling. But maybe it works for both sides? Apologies if that is obviously the case. In any case we\u2019ll keep you updated. Donald Trump is in a dis-war with his former communications director, Anthony Scaramucci. As with most of Trump\u2019s insult battles, which scientists estimate take up 87% of his daily attention, this one started with someone saying something bad about Trump on TV, at which Trump has gone on Twitter to say something bad about that person. Scaramucci, whose famously brief tenure in White House fell short of a fortnight, said on CNN this morning that he was assembling a squad of former administration officials to argue against Trump\u2019s reelection. \u201cI\u2019m in the process of putting together a team of people that feel the exact same way that I do,\u201d Scaramucci said. \u201cThis is not a \u2018Never Trump\u2019 situation. This not just screeching rhetoric. This is \u2014 OK, the guy is unstable. Everyone inside knows it, everyone outside knows it. Let\u2019s see if we can find a viable alternative.\u201d Trump replied that it was Scaramucci who was unstable, accused him of gross incompetence and pointed out that Scaramucci used to say nice things about him, in print no less. Good morning and welcome to our live blog politics coverage. An increasing number of economists see a recession looming in the US, according to a new report, while Donald Trump \u2013 whose erratic course on trade and monetary policy has shaken markets, analysts say \u2013 sees a conspiracy afoot. Thirty-four percent of economists surveyed by the National Association for Business Economics, in a report being released Monday, said they believe a slowing economy will tip into recession in 2021, the Associated Press reports: That\u2019s up from 25% in a survey taken in February. Only 2% of those polled expect a recession to begin this year, while 38% predict that it will occur in 2020. [...] The economists have previously expressed concern that Trump\u2019s tariffs and higher budget deficits could eventually dampen the economy. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on goods from many key US trading partners, from China and Europe to Mexico and Canada. Officials maintain that the tariffs, which are taxes on imports, will help the administration gain more favorable terms of trade. But US trading partners have simply retaliated with tariffs of their own. Trade between the US and China, the two biggest global economies, has plunged. Trump decided last Wednesday to postpone until 15 December tariffs on about 60% of an additional $300bn of Chinese imports, granting a reprieve from a planned move that would have extended duties to nearly everything the US buys from China. Beware any commentator who points out the problem, as conservative pundit Juan Williams did on Fox News Sunday, accusing Trump of creating \u201cunpredictability\u201d. The president swiftly replied on Twitter: Where economist and analysts see an interplay between Trump\u2019s policies and the markets, Trump sees a conspiracy involving his own appointees, foreign lands and the US media, reports Maggie Haberman in the New York Times: He has insisted that his own handpicked Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H Powell, is intentionally acting against him. He has said other countries, including allies, are working to hurt American economic interests. And he has accused the news media of trying to create a recession. \u201cThe Fake News Media is doing everything they can to crash the economy because they think that will be bad for me and my re-election,\u201d Mr Trump tweeted last week. \u201cThe problem they have is that the economy is way too strong and we will soon be winning big on Trade, and everyone knows that, including China!\u201d Not all economists think the US is in for a recession. The AP report notes in small print at the bottom: Still, for now, most economic signs appear solid. Employers are adding jobs at a steady pace, the unemployment rate remains near a 50-year low and consumers are optimistic. US retail sales figures out last Thursday showed that they jumped in July by the most in four months. Later this morning we\u2019ll look at remarks in which Trump suggested he was walking back support he had earlier voiced for background checks for gun purchases, and we\u2019ll catch up with some of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. Thanks for joining us for your politics Monday.",
