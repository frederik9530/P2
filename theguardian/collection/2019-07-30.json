The point is that climate change is happening and it is happening now.\u201d Kate Sambrook, a climate researcher at the University of Leeds who was not involved in the report, said the findings should be a wake-up call. \u201cInternational comparisons of public climate change beliefs indicate that UK residents are unconcerned about climate change and favour the prospect of hotter summers,\u201d said Sambrook, adding that more needs to be done to convey the full implications of the UK\u2019s changing climate. \u201cUnderstanding what shapes public perceptions of climate change is significantly important, as this could provide scientists, policymakers and campaigners with the tools they need to communicate climate change more effectively and as a result motivate more people to act.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Fines against accountants more than doubled to a record \u00a332m last year as the regulator cracked down on auditors in an attempt to repair its reputation in the wake of Carillion\u2019s controversial collapse. The penalties imposed mark a significant rise from the \u00a313m in fines handed out by the Financial Reporting Council over the 2017-18 financial year. The total would have reached \u00a342.9m in the year to March 2019 if the FRC hadn\u2019t offered discounts to firms that volunteered to settle cases early. The rise in fines follows a series of accounting scandals at companies, such as Patisserie Valerie, which has put the work of auditors under heightened scrutiny and attracted criticism from politicians and regulators. The accounting watchdog said the rise in penalties last year was partly due to more cases coming to a close over the period, as well as a rise in serious misconduct by accountants and the size of the auditing firms involved. The \u201cbig four\u201d accounting firms \u2013 KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY \u2013 accounted for six of the nine fines imposed. The big four have attracted heavy criticism over the quality of their audit work, particularly following the Carillion collapse. Critics said KPMG should have spotted the construction firm\u2019s problems sooner, and claimed auditors were prioritising profits over proper company scrutiny. The FRC itself has been criticised for failing to keep close enough tabs on the industry, and is now set to be replaced with a new regulator. The FRC\u2019s executive counsel, Elizabeth Barrett, said: \u201cThe clarity and accuracy of financial reporting is of critical importance to us all.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re wrapping up a bit early here today, so we can tune into Democratic debate. You can follow The Guardian\u2019s live coverage and analysis of the first round of the debate here. Donald Trump continued to defend his attacks on Baltimore and the city\u2019s congressman, Elijah Cummings even as he departed for an event commemorating 400 years since the rise of American democracy in Virginia that black state lawmakers boycotted in light of the president\u2019s \u201cdisparaging\u201d comments against minority members of Congress the majority-black city. To reporters, Trump said the black lawmakers were acting \u201cagainst their own people\u201d and asserted that he was the \u201cleast racist\u201d person \u201canywhere in the world\u201d A member of Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates interrupted Trump\u2019s speech to protest the president\u2019s divisive rhetoric and policies. Trump later said the protestor, Ibraheem Samirah, \u201cdidn\u2019t look so good\u201d. Two female Republican senators, both survivors of sexual assault, split sharply in their assessment of general John Hyten\u2019s fitness to serve as the vice-chairman of the joint chiefs of staff amid accusations that he sexually assaulted an Army colonel while she severed under him. Senator Martha McSally of Arizona declared Hyten \u201cinnocent\u201d of the charges against him while Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa said the facts of the case left her with \u201cconcerns regarding your judgment, leadership, and fitness to serve as the next vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s campaign announced that the president will be returning to New Hampshire next month, to hold a campaign rally. The event will be held on August 15, in Manchester, New Hampshire, interrupting a planned week-long presidential vacation at Trump\u2019s private golf course in New Jersey. Trump narrowly lost the state -- by less than one percent -- in 2016. North Carolina Republican political operative Leslie McCrae Dowless has had new charges of obstruction of justice, perjury and illegal possession of absentee ballots leveled against him. Dowless, who worked for the Republican nominee in the state\u2019s 9th congressional district last year, was previously indicted on obstruction of justice, conspiracy to commit obstruction of justice and possessing an absentee ballot in violation of state law. He was charged with running a scheme to illegally collect and forge mail-in ballots from voters in rural North Carolina. Maanvi Singh here, taking over. A federal judge has dismissed the Democratic National Committee\u2019s lawsuit against Donald Trump, The Russian Federation and WikiLeaks. The lawsuit, filed last year, alleged that the Trump campaign was a racketeering enterprise, engaged in a conspiracy to influence the outcome of the election. The dismissal notes that \u201cthe primary wrongdoer in this alleged criminal enterprise is undoubtedly the Russian Federation\u201d, which cannot be sued in US courts. The ACLU, who greeted Trump\u2019s election with an advertising campaign that taunted: \u201cwe\u2019ll see you in court,\u201d is making good on that promise. On Tuesday the civil liberties organization announced it had filed a motion to stop a Trump administration policy allowing migrant families to be separated at the border. Despite an earlier court ruling that had blocked the practice, reports have indicated that children and parents are still being separated more than a year later. The ACLU is also suing to stop Trump from using federal funds that Congress refused to appropriate to build his border wall. This lawsuit comes after the Supreme Court granted Trump temporary approval to begin construction of the wall with funds diverted from the military. Trump \u2013 or any presidential candidate \u2013 will not qualify for California\u2019s primary ballot unless he discloses his tax returns, under a new law signed by California Governor Gavin Newsom on Tuesday. The legislation, which passed on a strictly party-line vote by lawmakers in Sacramento, is an \u201cunprecedented mandate that is almost certain to spark a high-profile court fight and might encourage other states to adopt their own unconventional rules for presidential candidates,\u201d according to the LA Times. Trump has defied decades of tradition of voluntarily releasing his tax returns as a presidential candidate, and now as president. He routinely dismisses such calls to disclose his filings, insisting that he would release them when he was no longer under audit by the Internal Revenue Service. Democrats, including Newsom, have suggested that Trump is hesitant to release his filings because they might reveal potentially compromising financial ties to Russia \u2013 or that perhaps he is not as wealthy as he claims to be. To be eligible for California\u2019s presidential primary ballot in March, all presidential candidates must release five years of personal tax filings by late November. The financial documents will then be made public online by state election officials. California is not alone in the effort to force Trump\u2019s hand. Last week, Trump sued to stop House Democrats from obtaining his New York state tax returns made available by a law signed by governor Andrew Cuomo earlier this month. Several other states have also considered legislation that would require presidential candidates to release their tax returns in light of Trump\u2019s precedent. Meanwhile, the Democratic-led House is locked in a protracted legal battle with Trump, seeking to obtain his tax returns under an obscure 1924 law that allows the chairs of Congress\u2019s tax committees to examine any American\u2019s confidential filings. The slow drumbeat of calls for Trump\u2019s impeachment continued today as congresswoman Grace Meng, a Democrat from New York, announced her support. Eleanor Holmes Norton, DC\u2019s nonvoting delegate, also called on the House to launch impeachment proceedings on Tuesday. According to a count by Politico, 112 Democrats now support an impeachment inquiry. During the second presidential debates, Trump\u2019s re-election campaign will air a new ad that attacks Democrats for supporting a healthcare plan that would cover undocumented immigrants, according to a release from Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. The ad, , \u201cThey\u2019re All the Same,\u201d will run on CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News on July 30 and 31. During the first round of debates last month, every candidate on stage raised their hand when asked if their plan would cover undocumented immigrants. The concept is broadly unpopular and several leading Democratic strategists and pundits feared that moment would come back to haunt the party, as Trump and Republicans try to tar the field as too far left. The 30-second spot accuses Democrats of wanting to socialize the US healthcare system, even though there is a sharp divide in the Democratic field over support for a single-payer system. \u201cDemocrats. Radical. Reckless. Socialist,\u201d the ad blares amid video footage from the border and an emergency room hospital. Ibraheem Samirah, the Virginia state delegate who interrupted Trump\u2019s speech earlier this morning, is hitting back at Trump for saying that he \u201cdidn\u2019t look so good\u201d. In remarks to reporters outside the White House, Trump said he was \u201cgoing to be very nice,\u201d adding that \u201cthe protestor didn\u2019t look so good to me.\u201d Samirah shot back on Twitter: \u201cWhat about me \u2018didn\u2019t look so good?\u2019 I wore my favorite bowtie.\u201d Video and photos from the event would confirm that, indeed, Samirah wore a suit and bowtie. The Guardian\u2019s Adam Gabbatt has more on Trump\u2019s remarks in Jamestown and Samirah\u2019s protest. Read about that here: Thanks to Joanna Walters for manning the blog so I could grab some lunch and stretch my legs. Trump took another round of questions from reporters on his way back to the White House. Trump continued to attack the city of Baltimore, even though some state lawmakers in Virginia boycotted his speech commemorating the 400th anniversary of the rise of American democracy over his inflammatory remarks. For those wondering if Trump is playing \u201c3-dimensional chess\u201d or simply following his instincts, the president says it\u2019s the latter. Unless, of course, he is playing 3-dimensional chess and \u201cno strategy\u201d is the stratgey. He also again stood firm in his decision to nominate Texas congressman John Ratcliffe, who appears to have an uphill confirmation battle awaiting him in the Senate. Trump, who has employed his daughter and son-in-law in the White House, is thrilled that Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s son will be the ambassador to the US. Bolsonaro, after all, embraces comparisons to his American counterpart. Detroit is a whole scene ahead of the second presidential debate. Impeachment ad to run during presidential primary debates The first paid TV advertisement to emerge in the aftermath (anticlimax?) of the testimony by Robert Mueller on Capitol Hill last week will air during the Democratic primary debates tonight and tomorrow night. The 30-second ad is funded by long-shot 2020 presidential wannabe Tom Steyer\u2019s Need to Impeach group. With crisp clips of the most revealing questions from Democrats and decisive responses from the former special counsel, who spent almost two years conducting the Trump-Russia investigation, it does get to the best of the hearing. As Politico revealed this morning, it starts with: \u201cDid you actually totally exonerate the president?\u201d House judiciary chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) asks Mueller. \u201cNo,\u201d Mueller says. And it goes on from there in similar vein. McSally backs General but Ernst has serious questions Notwithstanding Arizona Republican senator Martha McSally\u2019s definite assertions earlier that Hyten is \u201cinnocent\u201d, fellow Republican Senator Joni Ernst, of Iowa, expressed concerns about an Air Force General John Hyten\u2019s nomination to serve as vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, amid the allegations of sexual harassment. Ernst questioned Hyten during an armed services committee hearing about his handling of complaints of a \u201ctoxic\u201d environment within his command. She said she was left with concern over Hyten\u2019s \u201cjudgment, leadership and fitness to serve\u201d in leadership, the AP reports. Ernst is a former reserve officer. She recently disclosed that she was a survivor of a college sexual assault. McSally\u2019s comments earlier were especially stunning because she recently revealed that she was raped in the military by a superior officer. And the way the crime investigation was handled drove her to despair. Ernst, meanwhile, in an interview with the Guardian earlier this year revealed that she turned down the opportunity to be Donald Trump\u2019s vice-president because she believed her husband Gail \u201chated any successes I have\u201d. Army colonel who alleges sexual assault responds US Army Colonel Kathryn Spletstoser has just responded, to reporters, after US Air Force General John Hyten denied her accusations of sexual assault, earlier at his Senate confirmation hearing today. Spletstoser on Tuesday maintained the sexual assault accusations she had leveled against Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for the position of second-highest ranking military officer in the country. She accused Hyten of making false statements in front of a Senate panel earlier in the day, Reuters reports. \u201cYou just had a four-star general get up in front of the American people and in open testimony, in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and make false official statements under oath, he lied about a myriad of items,\u201d Spletstoser told reporters. Of his alleged assailing of her in the past, she said: \u201cHe did it, he did it multiple times.\u201d Congressman Elijah Cummings, the recipient of days of attacks from the president, spent his morning with students of the University of Maryland\u2019s Summer Bioscience Internship Program and the Youthworks Program. On Twitter, the House Oversight committee chair championed the program that he helped start \u2013 and vowed to continue serving as a \u201ccheck on the Executive Branch\u201d. He also got a boost from Cher, who shared a slightly pixelated head shot of the lawmaker with the hashtag \u201cIStandWithElijahCummings.\u201d Senate Democrats unveiled a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United, a 2010 US supreme court decision that opened the spigot on unlimited campaign spending in US elections. The legislation has little chance of passing, especially with Mitch McConnell as Senate majority leader. Once an advocate of campaign finance reform, McConnell is now a staunch opponent of efforts to enact change. The amendment, introduced by Senators Tom Udall of New Mexico, and Jeanne Shaheen, of New Hampshire, has 43 original cosponsors and would give Congress and US states the ability to write the rules on political spending by outside groups. The House introduced a companion to this measure. A constitutional amendment must be approved by both the House of Representatives and Senate with a two-thirds majority vote or by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of the State legislatures. The full text of the amendment can be found here. Ibraheem Samirah, a Palestinian-American who is a Democratic member of the Virginia House of Delegates, interrupted the president\u2019s remarks commemorating the 400th anniversary of the rise of American Democracy. In a statement posted on Twitter, Samirah called Trump a \u201cbeacon of hate speech and harmful policy.\u201d Yeah, we\u2019re talking to you. We are asking our Charm City readers to share with us a little bit about the Baltimore you experience every day. If you\u2019re so inclined the questionnaire can be found in this story. Just tap the gray box and fill out the form. A Guardian journalist may follow up with you. Elizabeth Warren will take the debate stage tonight alongside fellow progressive stalwart Bernie Sanders. Ahead of their appearance, she unveiled a list of new endorsements from progressive lawmakers, including one from Ra\u00fal Grijalva, who was one of only a handful of members of Congress to endorse Sanders in 2016. \u201cShe is a bold, persistent, visionary leader who cares about working families - and because of this, she\u2019s won my endorsement,\u201d Grijalva said. She also won endorsements from Representative Deb Haaland, one of the first two Native American women to serve in the US Congress along with several members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation, including Senator Ed Markey, and congressmen Joe Kennedy. Donald Trump\u2019s delivered a speech that celebrates America\u2019s sweep from colonial Virginia settlement to \u2013 one day \u2013 planting an American flag on Mars. \u201cAmerica always gets the job done,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerica always wins.\u201d The speech was briefly interrupted by a protester who was shouted down by supporters of the president chanting \u201cTrump\u201d. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam was not on the dais during Trump\u2019s speech. In remarks earlier in the commemoration ceremony, Northam, who was called on to resign by several black lawmakers in the state over a scandal involving a racist yearbook photo,\u201d emphasized the inequities that still exist in Virginia 400 years later. Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, who is black and was urged not to attend, was present for Trump\u2019s remarks but sat stone-faced and did not clap. Donald Trump said the \u201cAfrican American community is so thankful\u201d that he was speaking out about the grim reality of inner cities like Baltimore. How did the entire African American community convey this gratitude? \u201cThey\u2019ve called me and they\u2019ve said, \u2018finally somebody is telling the truth,\u201d Trump said. Some critics weren\u2019t buying it. While we wait for Trump to speak in historic Jamestown, Virginia, a recap of his comments from earlier. Before departing from the White House, Trump said the black legislators planning to boycott his appearance at a Virginia event commemorating the 400th anniversary of the first meeting of the House of Burgesses are acting \u201cagainst their own people.\u201d Trump went on to say that African Americans \u201clove the job\u201d he\u2019s doing and are \u201chappy as hell\u201d with his recent comments disparaging the majority black city of Baltimore and its congressman, Elijah Cummings. This follows his attacks on four progressive congresswoman of color, who he told to \u201cgo back\u201d to their home countries, even though three were born in the US and all are US citizens. Rather than attend the ceremony in Jamestown, members of Virginia\u2019s legislative black caucus placed a wreath honoring deceased black lawmakers at Virginia\u2019s State Capitol, according to the Associated Press. They also plan to hold a ceremony at the Lumpkin\u2019s Slave Jail site in Richmond, where slaves were imprisoned and sold. Delegate Lamont Bagby told the AP that the lawmakers chose to boycott Trump\u2019s speech in Jamestown because they want to reflect on the good, the bad and \u201cthe ugly\u201d of the last 400 years, including slavery. The White House blocked a State Department intelligence analyst from delivering testimony on the national security implications of climate change to Congress because the analysis \u201cdid not comport with the administration\u2019s position on climate change,\u201d the analyst wrote in an editorial for the New York Times. Rod Schoonover, who worked as a senior analyst in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research at the State Department until he resigned in protest earlier this month, said he was allowed to deliver a brief oral testimony to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, but the White House refused to approve his written testimony for entry into the permanent Congressional record. That intervention prompted Schoonover\u2019s resignation. In the editorial he writes: The bottom line of written testimony was this: \u201cClimate change will have wide-ranging implications for US national security over the next 20 years.\u201d ... In blocking the submission of the written testimony, the White House trampled not only on the scientific integrity of the assessment but on the analytic independence of an arm of the intelligence community. That\u2019s why I recently resigned from the job I considered a sacred duty, and the institution I loved. The Guardian has extensively covered climate change \u2013 and the administration\u2019s \u201cwar on science\u201d. Read more here. Meanwhile, in another high-profile hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee the Air Force general nominated to become the next vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General John Hyten, categorically denied allegations of sexual misconduct. The Tuesday morning hearing is the the first chance that senators will have to question him about the charges brought by his former aide, Army colonel Kathryn Spletstoser, according to the Associated Press, which broke this story earlier this month. Hyten and Spletstoser met separately with senators in classified sessions last week. The Air Force Office of Special Investigations reviewed the matter and found insufficient evidence to charge Hyten or recommend any administrative punishment. Spletstoser told The Associated Press that Hyten subjected her to a series of unwanted sexual advances by kissing, hugging and rubbing up against her in 2017 while she was one of his top aides. She said she repeatedly pushed him away and told him to stop, and that he tried to derail her military career after she rebuffed him. During the hearing, Arizona Republican senator Martha McSally, who has spoken publicly about her sexual assault, says she believes Hyten is innocent. McSally, who was appointed to replace John McCain, faces a grueling election that may very well be decided by moderate and independent women in the state. The Senate Homeland Security &amp; Governmental Affairs Committee committee is holding a hearing on the conditions at the Southern Border. Among those slated to testify is Mark Morgan, acting commissioner of the US Customs and Border Protection and Jennifer Costello, the deputy inspector general US Department of Homeland Security. So that happened.... Bernie Sanders and Cardi B \u2013 who is freshly feeling the Bern this time around \u2013 met at the Ten Nail Bar in Detroit ahead of the presidential debates there this week. Video coming soon. Trump will speak in Jamestown today to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the first meeting of Virginia\u2019s House of Burgesses, which laid the foundation for America\u2019s representative government. This year also marks 400 years since the first African slaves were brought to Virginia, the birthplace of the slave trade to the US and the onetime seat of the Confederacy during the Civil War. Black state lawmakers have said they will not attend the president\u2019s address because of what they called in a statement his \u201cdegrading comments toward minority leaders,\u201d his \u201cpolicies that harm marginalized communities\u201d and his \u201cracist and xenophobic rhetoric\u201d. In a tweet, Trump appears to complain about their planned absence, saying the lawmakers, who are Democrats, are purposely trying to make the event as \u201cuncomfortable as possible.\u201d Speaking to journalists as he left the White House for Virginia, Trump said: \u201cI am the least racist person that there is anywhere in the world.\u201d Trump has often leveled this defense when accused of racism or bigotry. The assertion is laughable to most Trump critics in the wake of his equivocation in response to a white supremacist march in Charlottesville; his desire for the US to attract more migrants from Norway instead of \u201cshithole\u201d countries like El Salvador, Haiti and various African nations; his brutal policies at the southern border; his campaign to include a citizenship question on the census; his attack on four lawmakers of color who he told to \u201cgo back\u201d to their home countries, regardless of the fact three were born in the US and all are American citizens; and his most recent assault on senior black lawmaker, Elijah Cummings, and his majority-black district. In his comments on Tuesday, Trump also accused the Reverend Al Sharpton of being a racist and claimed his presidency has been a success for African Americans. \u201cThey\u2019re doing better than they\u2019ve ever done before,\u201d he said of African Americans. \u201cThey are so happy at what I\u2019ve been able to do.\u201d \u201cThe African American people have been calling the White House they have never been so happy as [sic] what a president has done,\u201d Trump added. He also said: \u201cI think I\u2019m helping myself\u201d with his attacks on Baltimore. Accusations of racism have long dogged Trump, since his days as a young real estate developer working alongside his father, Fred, when the Justice Department accused Trump Management Company of refusing to rent to African American residents. In the 1990s he took a full-page ad in major New York newspapers calling for the death penalty for five black and brown teens, known as the Central Park Five. All five men were later exonerated. And before becoming president, his entry into national politics was the false \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy that alleged Barack Obama, the nation\u2019s first black president was not born in the US. On his way out the door to Virginia, Trump defended his choice of congressman John Ratcliffe to be the director of national intelligence. Trump\u2019s nomination of the Texas Republican comes after he put on quite a show for the president during the testimony of former special counsel Robert Mueller. The president says Ratcliffe had already speaking to him about the post \u201clong\u201d before his performance during the House hearing. He also continued to attack the city of Baltimore and its leaders. This morning, Maryland governor, Larry Hogan, a Republican who considered challenging Trump for the nomination told a local radio station that the president\u2019s comments were \u201cjust outrageous and inappropriate.\u201d \u201cWashington is just completely consumed with, with angry and divisive politics, the divisiveness and dysfunction. And then 14 hours later we get this tweet that sets off another fire storm of angry tweets back and forth,\u201d he said. Baltimore hit back hard at Trump over his attack on the city as \u201cdisgusting\u201d and a \u201crat and rodent infested mess.\u201d Cartoonist Dan Wasserman imagined the president\u2019s reaction. George Conway, the lawyer and outspoken Trump critic married to White House counsel Kellyanne Conway, is at it again this morning. George Conway once told the Washington Post that he Tweets \u201cso I don\u2019t end up screaming at her about it.\u201d Good morning and welcome to another day that begins with a Donald Trump Tweet storm. On his mind this morning is all manner of topics: terrorism, the US border, China, trade, \u201cMorning Joe &amp; Psycho,\u201d Fox &amp; Friends and, of course, as if he\u2019s in on the joke, infrastructure week. Later today Trump will travel to Williamsburg, Virginia, where he delivers remarks on the 400th Anniversary of the First Representative Legislative Assembly, where America\u2019s unique tradition of representative government. But black lawmakers in the state will not attend because of Trump\u2019s ongoing and persistent attacks on lawmakers of color, including most recently, House Oversight chairman Elijah Cummings. \u201cThe commemoration of the birth of this nation and its democracy will be tarnished unduly with the participation of the President, who continues to make degrading comments toward minority leaders, promulgate policies that harm marginalized communities, and use racist and xenophobic rhetoric,\u201d the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus said in a statement Monday. We\u2019re also standing by for the big event of the day, the first night of the democratic presidential debates featuring senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. But don\u2019t expect the two leading lights of the American left to go after one another. They want this primary race to be a contest of ideas, and specifically of the progressive ones they have proposed. So far, the policy battles are being fought on their turf and they intend to keep it that way. More on that here: Also on the stage this evening is celebrity author and self-help guru Marianne Williamson. She made a splash in the first round of debates when she vowed to \u201charness love\u201d to defeat a fear-mongering president and later said her first call as president of the United States would be to the prime minster of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern. She explained that she would tell her that under a Williamson administration the US would be as good of a place for children to grow up in as New Zealand: \u201cGirlfriend, you are so on.\u201d Meanwhile, American rapper A$AP Rocky has pleaded not guilty to assault at the start of his trial in Sweden. The case has received widespread attention and strained international relations between the US and Sweden after Trump became involved and publicly demanded his release. The unusual intervention by a US president comes as Trump faces a torrent of condemnation for his racist attacks on US lawmakers of color, which he resumed last night.",

They include 678 whose parents faced allegations of criminal conduct. Other reasons include alleged gang affiliation, unfitness or child safety concerns, \u201cunverified familial relationship\u201d, or parent illness. The ACLU said about one of every five children separated is under five years old. In June 2018, the judge ordered that the practice of splitting families at the border be halted except in limited circumstances, such as a parent\u2019s criminal history or concerns about a child\u2019s safety. Separately, the Trump administration is scouting sites in central Florida, Virginia and Los Angeles for future facilities to hold unaccompanied minors who have crossed the US-Mexico border. The US Department of Health and Human Services sent letters to Florida lawmakers Monday saying it is looking for vacant properties in those locations to build permanent licensed facilities for children under age 18 who have entered the US illegally without a parent or guardian. The permanent sites will minimize the need for unlicensed temporary detention centers, according to the letter. \u201cThe search for an addition of permanent licensed facilities is being pursued to reduce the potential need for temporary influx shelters in the future,\u201d the letter said. The nation\u2019s largest child migrant facility is in Homestead, Florida, where immigrant advocates have described \u201cprisonlike\u201d conditions. Existing migrant facilities have become a flashpoint in the 2020 presidential race. In recent weeks, Democratic lawmakers and presidential candidates have visited and toured facilities in Texas and Florida and decried the conditions in which they found migrants.

He adopted the name A$AP Rocky when he began his career in 2007, joining the A$AP Mob crew.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Mayers had a troubled childhood. His elder brother was murdered, his dad was arrested for drug dealing, and he spent some time moving around homeless shelters with his mother and sister. His older sister died of a drug overdose in 2016. Mayers himself served two weeks in prison for drug dealing in 2004.</p>\n    <p>He came to prominence with the release of the mixtape Live.Love.A$AP in 2011.

In 2016, Mayers became the first African-American to be the face of Dior Homme.<br></p>\n    <p>In 2013, he was charged with slapping a woman at Philadelphia's Made in America festival. This was eventually settled out of court in 2015.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump sent the US special presidential envoy for hostage affairs to Stockholm to monitor the court proceedings of the American rapper A$AP Rocky, according to Swedish news agency TT. The special envoy Robert O\u2019Brien was seen on Tuesday at Stockholm district court, where the rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, faced trial. Ruth Newman, a spokeswoman for the US Embassy in Stockholm, told TT that O\u2019Brien was in Sweden \u201cto look after the well-being of American citizens, which is always our top priority\u201d. Mayers is accused with two others of beating a 19-year-old man in Stockholm on 30 June and has been held in detention in Sweden since the beginning of July. His ongoing detention in Sweden prompted Donald Trump to personally intervene on his behalf. Mayers nevertheless remained behind bars, angering the US president. Dressed in prison uniform of a green T-shirt and trousers, Mayers pleaded not guilty to assault on the first day of his trial on Tuesday. The rapper sat near his mother, Renee Black, in the Stockholm district court. Prosecutors and defense lawyers presented competing narratives of what happened the night of the fight. Prosecutors said 19-year-old Mustafa Jafari and a friend got into an argument with Mayers and one of his bodyguards near a fast-food restaurant where the rapper\u2019s entourage had eaten and played video footage that showed Mayers throwing a young man to the ground. Mayers has published videos on his Instagram account that showed him repeatedly pleading with Jafari and his friend to stop following him and his associates. The defense lawyer Slobodan Jovicic stressed Tuesday that the rapper and his entourage \u201cdidn\u2019t want any trouble\u201d and alleged that Jafari and his friend had exhibited \u201caggressive and deeply provocative behavior\u201d. A$AP Rocky previously encountered violent situations on streets because of his fame and \u201cthere are some people who don\u2019t always wish him well\u201d, Jovicic said. \u201cHe\u2019s has been harassed in the past. In this case, the bodyguard made the assessment that these people (Jafari and his friend) should move on ... and not to come close,\u201d the lawyer said. Another lawyer representing A$AP Rocky in Sweden, Martin Persson, told public broadcaster SVT that he would present new evidence, including facts that would show \u201cno bottle has been used to hit or injure anyone\u201d. Any physical aggression by Mayers and his co-defendants was \u201cwithin the limits of the law\u201d, Persson said. The case has drawn the attention of American celebrities like Kim Kardashian West and Mayers\u2019 fellow recording artists, including Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs and Justin Bieber. A social media campaign for his release, called #JusticeForRocky, was created soon after his arrest. Trump also weighed in, asking for a phone call with the Swedish prime minister, Stefan Lofven and offering to personally guarantee the rapper\u2019s bail.

      "bodyText": "A new report shows that 2018 saw a national rise in hate crimes, and that almost all extremist homicides were carried out by the far right. Hate crimes rose 9% to a decade high of 2,009 in 30 US cities surveyed for the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism (CSHE), headquartered at California State University at Santa Barbara, which published the report on Tuesday. The rise is the fifth consecutive increase and the steepest rise since 2015, and the trend has continued to rise so far in 2019, the report said. The rise happened even as overall crime rates continued to decline across those cities surveyed. The most frequently targeted groups nationally were blacks, Jews and LGBTQ people. The report shows that there was a particularly large increase in antisemitic incidents in cities like New York, and records 2018 as the \u201cworst year ever for antisemitic killings in the United States\u201d. The report also stated that the total number of extremist homicides decreased sharply from 36 in 2017 to 22, but that \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d homicides increased to 17, and along with two murders associated with \u201cextreme misogyny\u201d made up the vast majority of extremist murders. On 27 October 2018, in the lead-up to the midterm elections, Robert Bowers allegedly killed 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the worst antisemitic massacre in US history. The increase in homicides around the midterm election was in keeping with longterm trends that the report points to regarding an increase in hate crimes around major political events. The report warns that \u201cthe risk of extremist violence by (white nationalists) will likely continue into this current nascent political season\u201d, and that they will \u201cmaintain their position at the top of the threat matrix\u201d. Despite recent moves from Republicans to define anti-neo-Nazi groups known as \u201cAntifa\u201d as a terrorist organization, the report suggests that the far right has presented a much more serious threat of deadly extremist violence. The report points to \u201cpolitically motivated assaults and suspected crimes\u2013and non-violent protests\u201d from \u201cAntifa, anarchists, and hard left extremists\u201d, and details 19 incidents of \u201cAntifa harassment and violence\u201d throughout 2018 and 2019. CSHE director Brian Levin said in a telephone conversation that there is \u201ca sliver of violent Antifa\u201d but \u201cwe\u2019re not seeing the hard left yet going in and doing mass political violence\u201d. He said that he and CSHE colleagues are \u201cconcerned about increasing political violence\u201d, but \u201cwe have to be very careful about who we label terrorists\u201d. The report records that 26 transgender people were murdered in 2018. But the biggest percentage increase in reported hate crimes was against whites, from a relatively low base. Despite recent allegations of a wave of \u201cfake hate crimes\u201d in rightwing media, the CSHE could only find 11 false hate crime reports in 2018.",

Tristan Edis, a Green Energy Markets director and analyst, said clean energy growth would continue in the short term due to the number of projects that had been financially committed but were yet to come online. But he said despite falling prices the boom was expected to end in the absence of a national policy to encourage future clean investments.</p> <h2>Sport</h2> <p><strong>A new documentary, Collingwood: From The Inside Out, focuses on the Magpies\u2019 journey to the 2018 AFL grand final.</strong> But the team\u2019s on-field performance becomes a side note in the film, which aims to portray a more universal human story \u2013 that of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/31/new-collingwood-documentary-lifts-lid-on-mental-health-struggles-in-afl\">mental health struggles</a> of the modern-day footballer.</p> <p><strong>Caster Semenya will be prevented from defending her 800m title at the world athletics championships in Doha next month. </strong>The Swiss supreme court has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/30/caster-semenya-blocked-defending-800-metres-title-athletics-world-championships\">reversed a ruling</a> that suspended a regulation imposed by the sport\u2019s governing body, the IAAF, regarding testosterone levels pending her appeal.</p> <p><strong>The latest episode of The Spin is all about the Ashes, pronouncing Labuschagne and nuns at the cricket.</strong> Host Emma John is joined by Vic Marks and Geoff Lemon to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/audio/2019/jul/30/the-ashes-pronouncing-labuschagne-and-nuns-at-the-cricket-the-spin-podcast\">preview the men\u2019s Ashes series</a>.

Opinion and analysis Giving up alcohol for Dry July or some random month is nothing special but for Gay Alcorn, who hadn\u2019t had 30 days without drinking her entire adult life, it was a big thing. \u201cDrinking was what I \u2018did\u2019 \u2013 preferably alone in my head or watching some Netflix show or offering random opinions on Twitter. Feeling slow or a little sad in the mornings was so normal I barely noticed it.\u201d There was a sense of achievement in doing something she wasn\u2019t quite sure she could do, but she hadn\u2019t expected the scale of its impact. Clean energy will be providing 35% of Australia\u2019s total electricity needs within two years, analysts say, as new data underlines the pace at which solar power is transforming the national grid. A report by the consultant Green Energy Markets found rooftop solar systems and new large-scale farms regularly pushed renewable energy to beyond 30% of generation at midday during June, one of the least sunny months. Tristan Edis, a Green Energy Markets director and analyst, said clean energy growth would continue in the short term due to the number of projects that had been financially committed but were yet to come online. But he said despite falling prices the boom was expected to end in the absence of a national policy to encourage future clean investments. Sport A new documentary, Collingwood: From The Inside Out, focuses on the Magpies\u2019 journey to the 2018 AFL grand final. But the team\u2019s on-field performance becomes a side note in the film, which aims to portray a more universal human story \u2013 that of the mental health struggles of the modern-day footballer. Caster Semenya will be prevented from defending her 800m title at the world athletics championships in Doha next month. The Swiss supreme court has reversed a ruling that suspended a regulation imposed by the sport\u2019s governing body, the IAAF, regarding testosterone levels pending her appeal. The latest episode of The Spin is all about the Ashes, pronouncing Labuschagne and nuns at the cricket. Host Emma John is joined by Vic Marks and Geoff Lemon to preview the men\u2019s Ashes series. Plus they discuss Ireland\u2019s historic first Test at Lord\u2019s, Australia\u2019s dominance in the women\u2019s Ashes and pick their fancy dress outfits for the Eric Hollies Stand. Thinking time: Too Much Lip Melissa Lucashenko has the flu but that doesn\u2019t stop her breathing fire down the phone line. \u201cThis bloody bullshit about the forgotten white working class \u2013 if there\u2019s any forgotten people in Australia, if there\u2019s any battlers in Australia, it\u2019s brown and black people,\u201d she says. Lucashenko has just found out she\u2019s won the 2019 Miles Franklin award, Australia\u2019s most prestigious prize for fiction, for her novel Too Much Lip. It\u2019s a book the writer says was \u201crisky\u201d from the beginning. \u201cI wanted to portray the Australian underclass in rural NSW, and especially the black underclass,\u201d Lucashenko says. \u201cI wanted to talk about class. I wanted to write about the connections between poor blacks and poor whites in the country, and in the jail class.\u201d A founding member of Sisters Inside, the Queensland-based not-for-profit that advocates for the rights of female prisoners, Lucashenko cares passionately about the intersection of the underclasses and the jail system. \u201cPrison is fundamental to keeping poor people poor,\u201d she says. \u201cThe poorest of the poor. Australia hasn\u2019t changed in this respect over two centuries. This mentality of chucking people away when they\u2019re inconvenient started in Britain and has continued until today. Except these days it\u2019s extremely big business.\u201d Media roundup Two Liberal staffers have told the Sydney Morning Herald they were sexually assaulted while working for senior politicians. The SMH also reports that Icac will investigate key Labour figures over Chinese donations. The Australian reveals that laws to protect the private metadata of millions of Australians are being subverted by a vast array of organisations using loopholes to \u201caccess information only meant to be used by security agencies and police.\u201d Coming up Andy Penn, the head of Telstra, will address the National Press Club on how to get Australia\u2019s communications systems right. A rally will be held at the NSW parliament in support of abortion decriminalisation.

Both teams are desperate to win, both sets of players are desperate to perform because Ashes series are where you get scrutinised and criticised more, or praised if you do well.\u201d England, who have confirmed Joe Root will return to No 3 as Joe Denly drops down a spot, welcome back Jimmy Anderson after a calf problem. The uncapped Jofra Archer was denied the chance to fully prove his fitness on Tuesday when heavy rain in Birmingham forced training inside. Regardless of the XI, and the outcome of the toss, Stokes is demanding instant impact. He said: \u201cI think that first morning of any series is when you want to stamp your authority as a team with bat and ball. Getting off to a good start can make it flow throughout the series. \u201cYou want to be the team on top and win that first day because hopefully that can carry on into the next four. If you go 1-0 down in a series it can be hard to come back from so you want to start very well.\u201d Asked how important it will be to get on top of David Warner, the firebrand opener who served a 12-month ban for his part in the Cape Town scandal, Stokes replied: \u201cHe is a player who can take games away from you. He is a phenomenal batsman and very dangerous opener. So to tie him down and not let him establish his authority against us would be a really big plus. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to give anything away to any of their batsmen. We want to let them know we are here to be serious and everyone in the changing room is desperately trying to get that urn back because it\u2019s not good them having it.\u201d Such drive and passion from Stokes was absent from England\u2019s Ashes campaign 18 months ago, when Root appeared slightly isolated as a leader. It led to Ricky Ponting, the former Australia captain, claiming he was like a \u201clittle boy\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d when speaking publicly. Stokes, who missed last week\u2019s Test win over Ireland to recharge at home, has returned to the vice-captaincy. It is a reward for both his World Cup heroics and 18 months of hard work, with the all-rounder looking to repay his old friend. He said: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve always tried to do is in the past is to take all the little pressures off Joe\u2019s shoulders. He\u2019s captain and all the pressures he has are ginormous. In an Ashes series that goes up 50%. There are other little things that can affect a captain mentally, so it\u2019s a case of anything I can do to help him.\u201d Asked if he feels ready to step up and lead should Root go down injured in the series, Stokes said: \u201cTouch wood, nothing does happen but I\u2019ve played enough cricket now with this group \u2013 especially Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad \u2013 to understand what works for them. If anything happens I know I have a group of senior players who can help me through that.\u201d",

The meeting of the \u201cFive Eyes\u201d nations \u2013 the UK, US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand \u2013 was hosted by new home secretary, Priti Patel, in an effort to coordinate efforts to combat terrorism and child abuse. Dealing with the challenge faced by increasingly effective encryption was one of the main topics at the summit, officials said, at a time when technology companies want to make their services more secure after a range of security breaches. The meetings, however, were held in private with no agenda being made public, making it difficult to conclude exactly what had been discussed by the ministers, officials and intelligence agencies from the countries involved. However, British ministers have privately voiced particular concerns about WhatsApp, the widely used Facebook-owned messenger service, which was used by, among others, the three plotters in the London Bridge terror attack. \u201cWe need to ensure that our law enforcement and security and intelligence agencies are able to gain lawful and exceptional access to the information they need,\u201d the Home Office said in a statement. GCHQ, the UK agency which monitors and breaks into communications, has suggested that Silicon Valley companies could develop technology that would silently add a police officer or intelligence agent to conversations or group chats. The controversial so-called \u201cghost protocol\u201d has been fiercely opposed by companies, civil society organisations and some security experts \u2013 but intelligence and law enforcement agencies continue to lobby for it. Police said they had not been able to see or crack open hundreds of WhatsApp messages sent by at least one of those involved in the London Bridge attacks because an acquaintance of theirs had refused to hand over his phone. WhatsApp has also been improving its security after it emerged earlier this year that a flaw had been exploited by an Israeli spyware company, which allowed special software used by intelligence agencies to covertly take control of a person\u2019s phone. Ministers attending the event included Patel and the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, who is the government\u2019s most senior law officer. Also present was his US counterpart, William Barr. Barr attracted controversy last week when he said the proliferation of what he described as \u201cwarrant-proof encryption\u201d was making it easier for criminals to evade detection. Patel described the summit as \u201can exciting moment for the UK\u201d and said the UK was \u201ca global leader on national security and child protection and we are committed to working with our close partners on shared challenges\u201d.

He quit the job after only eight months, describing Duncan Smith as incompetent.</p>\n    <p>Following the 2010 general election, the then education secretary, Michael Gove, appointed Cummings as his chief of staff.

Britain hopes it can act as bridge between the US \u2013 which has the largest military presence of a western nation in the region \u2013 and countries such as Germany, which is reluctant to getting involved in any mission led by Washington. Whitehall sources said the British proposal to create a European-led mission to prevent future tanker seizures by Iran was still alive despite the dismissal of Jeremy Hunt as as foreign secretary in Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet reshuffle. But they conceded its success would be dependent on the involvement of the US, \u201cwhether at the head of or in support of the mission\u201d. The US\u2019s Fifth Fleet, responsible for the Gulf, is based in Bahrain. Two weeks ago Iran seized a British-flagged oil tanker, the Stena Impero. Tehran said the tanker had cut off its communications system. The UK said it was seized illegally in Omani waters. The seizure demonstrated the difficulties that Britain has in protecting its shipping in the strait of Hormuz, through which about a fifth of the world\u2019s oil passes through. Although a Royal Navy vessel \u2013 the HMS Montrose \u2013 was in the region trying to protect British shipping, it was an hour\u2019s sail away when the seizure occurred. A second British ship, the HMS Duncan, has been sent to the Gulf, but the ships are trying to cover a range of 19,000 nautical miles. The Iranian seizure came after the UK seized an Iranian oil tanker in Gibraltar that Britain said was bound for Syria in defiance of EU sanctions. British officials argue that other European countries should get involved in an international naval mission that has latterly been an Anglo-Iranian dispute because \u201cthey have skin in the game\u201d given the importance of the continuity of oil supplies. The meeting is scheduled to take place on Wednesday afternoon and is not expected to lead to an immediate outcome, British officials have indicated. They said proposals would be taken back to national governments for further discussion. Separately, the US embassy in Berlin confirmed it had formally asked Germany, as well as Britain and France, to join it in a naval mission in the Gulf, which could form part of the UK-led efforts. Diplomatic sources said the statement was an attempt to put pressure on Germany to become involved. \u201cWe\u2019ve formally asked Germany to join France and the UK to help secure the strait of Hormuz and combat Iranian aggression,\u201d said a US embassy spokesperson in Berlin. The embassy added: \u201cMembers of the German government have been clear that freedom of navigation should be protected \u2026 Our question is: protected by whom?\u201d There is considerable opposition among Germany\u2019s Social Democrats (SPD), the junior partners in Angela Merkel\u2019s ruling coalition, to getting involved in a US-led mission. \u201cThe German government has already rejected participation in the US military mission, Operation Sentinel, to protect shipping in the strait of Hormuz,\u201d said Nils Schmid, a foreign affairs spokesman for the SPD parliamentary party, in an interview with Stuttgarter Zeitung. \u201cIt should stay like that.

The US president said those who stayed away were acting \u201cagainst their own people\u201d, while claiming, as he left the White House to fly to the event, that his denigration of Baltimore was \u201chelping\u201d his political standing. Trump went to Jamestown, Virginia, on Tuesday to commemorate 400 years of democracy in the US at an event to mark the first meeting of a representative legislative assembly in the western hemisphere.

The remarks followed Trump\u2019s exhortations to four congresswomen of color earlier in July that they should \u201cgo back to where they came from\u201d, even though they are US citizens. On Tuesday, senior Democratic politicians, including Virginia\u2019s house Democratic leader and Democratic caucus chair, and every member of the Virginia legislative black caucus stayed away during Trump\u2019s speech in Jamestown. Virginia\u2019s Democratic governor Ralph Northam, who was almost forced out of office over his own controversy involving blackface, said: \u201cWe know our diversity is our strength, and we welcome immigrants, refugees and all who like those who stood on spot 400 years ago, come to Virginia in search of a better life. \u201cOur doors are open and our lights are on.

      "body": "<p>A new prime minister enters Downing Street promising to help the less advantaged, bring prosperity and opportunity to every area of the country, and make a success of Brexit. Conservative MPs cheer, a new era begins and there is a bounce in the polls. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jul/13/prime-minister-theresa-may-pledges-to-build-a-better-britain-video\" title=\"\">Three years ago</a> that was Theresa May, and the rest, as they say, is history. Our new prime minister is well versed in history, so undoubtedly he will know the famous quote that history repeats itself first as tragedy, then as farce.</p> \n<p>Last week I left the government. I would not have signed up to Boris Johnson\u2019s pledge to leave the European Union on 31 October with no deal if necessary. Initially he said leaving without a deal was a \u201cmillion-to-one\u201d possibility. However, the rhetoric soon changed to the more confrontational tone of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/brexit-boris-johnson-britain-will-leave-eu-31-october-do-or-die\" title=\"\">\u201cdo or die\u201d</a>. He has even rejected negotiations over a time limit to the Irish backstop. Now only a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/29/johnson-refuses-to-meet-eu-leaders-unless-they-scrap-backstop\" title=\"\">completely new withdrawal agreement</a> would be acceptable. New red lines have been introduced for the political declaration that will shape our ongoing relationship with our former partners. There is talk of no-deal preparations being ramped up, but in reality these are mitigations.</p> \n<p>While no-dealers celebrate, the sensible majority are concerned. Brexit should not mean no deal. An optimist might say the cause for hope is that this strategy will see movement from the EU and if, as a result, we secure a change to the backstop this allows Johnson to present a repackaged deal to parliament in the autumn. In the unlikely event that this happens, I shall vote for Johnson\u2019s deal, as I did three times for May\u2019s.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"820d4082-3b31-45d2-b4a9-18f416985110\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UFDJM3TcQpM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Brexit and no deal are not the same thing. The former will allow an orderly exit from our 46-year association with the EU. In contrast, the latter means a traumatic break in trading relationships, economic upheaval and disruption to travel and health arrangements. We shall resort to World Trade Organization terms with likely higher tariffs, trade barriers and food costs.</p> \n<p>After a no-deal exit our negotiating position will be weaker. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/30/pound-sterling-no-deal-brexit-dollar-euro-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">pound is likely to have fallen</a>, causing prices to rise for every citizen; trade will have been hampered; no new trade deals will have been signed; and the promised post-Brexit investment will not have yet boosted the economy.

      "bodyText": "A new prime minister enters Downing Street promising to help the less advantaged, bring prosperity and opportunity to every area of the country, and make a success of Brexit. Conservative MPs cheer, a new era begins and there is a bounce in the polls. Three years ago that was Theresa May, and the rest, as they say, is history. Our new prime minister is well versed in history, so undoubtedly he will know the famous quote that history repeats itself first as tragedy, then as farce. Last week I left the government. I would not have signed up to Boris Johnson\u2019s pledge to leave the European Union on 31 October with no deal if necessary. Initially he said leaving without a deal was a \u201cmillion-to-one\u201d possibility. However, the rhetoric soon changed to the more confrontational tone of \u201cdo or die\u201d. He has even rejected negotiations over a time limit to the Irish backstop. Now only a completely new withdrawal agreement would be acceptable. New red lines have been introduced for the political declaration that will shape our ongoing relationship with our former partners. There is talk of no-deal preparations being ramped up, but in reality these are mitigations. While no-dealers celebrate, the sensible majority are concerned. Brexit should not mean no deal. An optimist might say the cause for hope is that this strategy will see movement from the EU and if, as a result, we secure a change to the backstop this allows Johnson to present a repackaged deal to parliament in the autumn. In the unlikely event that this happens, I shall vote for Johnson\u2019s deal, as I did three times for May\u2019s. Brexit and no deal are not the same thing. The former will allow an orderly exit from our 46-year association with the EU. In contrast, the latter means a traumatic break in trading relationships, economic upheaval and disruption to travel and health arrangements. We shall resort to World Trade Organization terms with likely higher tariffs, trade barriers and food costs. After a no-deal exit our negotiating position will be weaker. The pound is likely to have fallen, causing prices to rise for every citizen; trade will have been hampered; no new trade deals will have been signed; and the promised post-Brexit investment will not have yet boosted the economy. So in any post-no-deal talks with Europe, Britain will be in a weaker economic position and the EU is still likely to demand the \u00a339bn divorce bill negotiated by May, as well as the terms of the withdrawal agreement. I understand that there are passionately held views about Brexit.

However, like many Conservatives I firmly believe it would be wrong and against our nation\u2019s interests to leave the EU without a deal. The media reports that the new prime minister has promised a 31 October Brexit \u201cby any means necessary\u201d, but he also understands that our country is a parliamentary democracy and that he must ensure majority support in the Commons for his Brexit policy. As a leading Vote Leave campaigner, he was also an enthusiastic proponent of the notion that Brexit would allow us to take back our sovereignty, to make our own laws.

      "bodyText": "British defence exports rose to a record \u00a314bn in 2018, with sales to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar and other countries in the Middle East accounting for nearly 80% of that figure, official figures reveal. Campaigners said the statistics, released on Tuesday, showed that Britain was \u201carming and supporting repressive regimes\u201d, while the Department for International Trade (DIT) said they demonstrated that the UK had returned to its position as the world\u2019s second largest arms exporter after the US. Defence orders rose by \u00a35bn to \u00a314bn, making it the biggest year since records began in 1983. That increase was helped by a \u00a35bn order for Typhoon fighters made by BAE Systems, plus Paveway missiles from Raytheon that are partly made in the UK. Campaign Against Arms Trade said the figures \u201cexposed the rank hypocrisy at the heart of UK foreign policy. The government claims to stand for human rights and democracy, but it is arming and supporting repressive regimes and dictatorships around the world.\u201d Britain\u2019s sales to Saudi Arabia \u2013 believed to be the largest arms buyer \u2013 are the subject of an ongoing legal battle. Ministers have asked the supreme court to overturn a lower court\u2019s judgment that some of the arms sales to Riyadh were conducted illegally. In June, the court of appeal concluded the sales of arms that could have been used by Saudi Arabia\u2019s air force in Yemen were unlawful because ministers had failed to examine whether, in targeting civilians, the country was in breach of international humanitarian law. The DIT estimates the UK\u2019s share of the defence export industry to be about 19%, placing it second for the first time since 2014, pushing Russia into third place and sitting comfortably ahead of fourth-ranked France. The world leader is the US, which has a share of about 40%, according to the British estimates in the annual statistics published by the DIT, which is the licensing authority for arms exports.",

In correspondence seen by Guardian Australia, Simon Milner, the Singapore-based vice-president of the social media giant in the Asia-Pacific, tells Labor\u2019s outgoing national secretary, Noah Carroll: \u201cI understand that your preference would be for Facebook to remove all content that you believe constitutes misinformation \u2013 which in this instance mean all content that discussed whether or not Labor intends to introduce a death tax \u2013 rather than demote it; however Facebook only removes content that violates our community standards. \u201cWe do not agree that is is our role to remove content that one side of a political debate considers to be false,\u201d Milner says in the letter sent a month after election day. The Facebook executive says the company invested significantly in an effort to support \u201cthe Australian government\u2019s work to safeguard the 2019 election\u201d and said the requirement for the social media giant was to \u201crespect applicable law\u201d and work with the Australian Electoral Commission by responding to queries or concerns. The backwards and forwards between Labor and the social media behemoth comes as Facebook is firmly in the sights of Australia\u2019s competition and consumer regulator as a consequence of its landmark review of digital platforms. One of the recommendations of the ACCC review, released last week, was digital platforms be required to implement a code of conduct to govern how they handled complaints about the spread of inaccurate information, which would be registered and enforced by an independent regulator such as the Australian Communications and Media Authority.

The controversy has prompted yet more criticism of Facebook\u2019s intransigence in providing full transparency around political advertising on its platform. Prof Axel Bruns, an expert with the digital media research centre at the Queensland University of Technology, said he understood the company\u2019s reluctance to get tied up in determinations of truth, a position he said would \u201copen a can of worms\u201d.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI just want to feel like how I used to feel after games,\u201d the Magpies midfielder, Adam Treloar, reveals in the upcoming documentary, Collingwood: From The Inside Out. \u201cI walk off, just borderline in tears.\u201d In a scene where Treloar discusses his on-going struggle with anxiety, he gives filmmaker Josh Cable unprecedented access to document the session with Jacqui Louder, the club\u2019s sport and exercise psychologist, in which he describes his inner turmoil. \u201cI was just worried about everything, what was thought about us, and me and stuff like that where before\u2026 I reckon every game I\u2019d walk off satisfied that, if we lost, I was disappointed we\u2019d lost, but satisfied that I went out there, I got through the game. I contributed. I played my role. When I was walking off this year, I wasn\u2019t even thinking about any of that.\u201d The film, co-directed by Cable and Marcus Cobbledick and produced by Good Thing Productions \u2013 the team behind the Adam Goodes documentary The Australian Dream \u2013 focuses on the club\u2019s 2018 season that saw the team reach the AFL grand final. After not playing finals in four years, the club defied the odds to end their wait but went on to lose by five points to West Coast Eagles. The on-field performance of the club during that season, and the heartbreak of losing a grand final, becomes a side note in the film, as Cable and Cobbledick aim to portray a more universal human story. Treloar\u2019s personal battle is one such narrative depicted and one that only came out during the process of filming the documentary. \u201cWhen I started following him, I just knew he was a gun player and I wanted to get to know him a bit more,\u201d Cable says. \u201cOne game day I was following him. He played well \u2013 was best on ground \u2013 and after the game he shared this moment with Bucks [coach Nathan Buckley] where they hugged and I thought, \u2018Oh that\u2019s really interesting, I\u2019ll ask him about that\u2019. \u201cWe go back to his house and he revealed to me that he\u2019d been struggling with anxiety and it had been a real challenge for him to get up and play every week.

While my husband looks forward to Alcohol August, I am thinking of going another month without booze. I can\u2019t say I won\u2019t drink again \u2013 the thought is terrifying \u2013 but the ledger leans too far one way to be ignored. Cheers to that. \u2022 Gay Alcorn is a Guardian Australia columnist \u2022 Comments on this piece will be premoderated",

However, if the protection claim is made during a second interview after referral under the \u201cmanual/other\u2019\u201d code, there is nothing which requires the department to log it. \u201cEssentially what the danger is, if the process isn\u2019t being applied correctly, then people who should be given the ability to apply \u2026 and access this screening process, are not getting access,\u201d said Regina Jefferies, a Scientia PhD scholar and Kaldor Centre affiliate, who lodged the FOI. \u201cWhere a traveller makes a claim for protection in immigration clearance, the claim is referred to the duty delegate, Humanitarian Program Operations Branch,\u201d the home affairs department said. Claims cannot be approved immediately \u2013 they can only be referred on for further assessment \u2013 but they can be rejected on the spot. The lack of data means there is no method of scrutiny to ensure this is being done properly. In 2017-18 ABF processed more than 43 million air travellers who arrived at airports with visas. In that same period 4,584 were refused immigration clearance. In the first few months of that period just 10 people raised a protection claim at the time of arrival, were referred under the refugee code, and refused. The prior year saw just 46. It is not known how many were approved for further assessment. There is no way of knowing how many of the remaining 4,574 may have raised a protection claim, or if they were then sent on to appropriately trained officers. Jefferies said there had been \u201clittle scrutiny\u201d of the way entry screening operated for asylum seekers arriving in Australia by air, and suggested it could be because the only recorded numbers \u2013 under the refugee claims code \u2013 were so small. \u201cThe onshore protection visa framework implements Australia\u2019s international obligations under the refugee convention \u2013 including the obligation not to return an individual to a place where they fear persecution or other serious harm,\u201d she said. \u201cYet, immigration clearance and the entry screening process may operate in a manner that runs afoul of that obligation.\u201d Seeking asylum at the airport also dramatically changes the nature of the protection granted to someone, Jefferies said. If a person is granted protection at the airport, they are granted one of Australia\u2019s temporary protection or safe haven entry visas. However, should they get through to Australia with their original visa still valid, they can apply for asylum and live on a bridging visa \u2013 with support and work rights \u2013 while it is processed. \u201cAustralian law and policy incentivise not raising [the claim at that time] because\u2026 you become subjected to a process which makes it impossible to apply for permanent protection,\u201d Jefferies said. \u201cThat feeds this backlog of claims the government is currently dealing with.\u201d The average time to process an application is now around 600 days. Last week Crikey reported the number of applications for onshore protection visas with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal had blown out from 8,587 in 2014-15 to almost 28,000 in 2017-18. The home affairs department said the total number of protection visas lodged onshore was declining \u201cwith a 19% decrease between 1 January 2019 to 30 June 2019, compared to the same period in 2018\u201d. Jefferies said the question was not about onshore approval rates or assessment backlogs. Rather it was about how the department could develop policy if it did not have in place \u201cadequate procedures to determine the number of people who have requested protection at Australia\u2019s borders, or an operational framework that ensures the fair and expeditious processing of legitimate protection claims\u201d.",

Neither Trump nor Johnson seems to understand that being \u201cnot racist\u201d is not, and has never been, the opposite of being racist. \u201cNot racist\u201d is an attempt at neutrality, usually deployed because events have just shown that no such thing exists. As the author Ibram X Kendi points out in his <a href=\"https://www.ibramxkendi.com/how-to-be-an-antiracist-1\" title=\"\">forthcoming book</a>, the opposite of \u201cracist\u201d is \u201canti-racist\u201d, which involves taking an active stance identifying and <a href=\"https://www.bates.edu/news/2017/10/26/kendi/\" title=\"\">dismantling the legacy of racism</a> that still characterises our societies. </p> \n<p>If an anti-racist wanted to unpick this legacy, I can think of few better places to look than Baltimore. The Maryland city has real and chronic problems that are symptomatic of the American story. From the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/video/african-americans-many-rivers-cross-great-migration/\" title=\"\">Great Migration</a> of African Americans fleeing the pro-slavery, pro-segregation South in the 19th century, to the 20th-century industries that kept them on low wages, to \u201credlining\u201d \u2013 overtly discriminatory housing practices that pushed black residents into poor, underserviced and marginalised districts \u2013 <a href=\"https://dcicblog.umd.edu/redliningbaltimore/baltimores-history/\" title=\"\">Baltimore</a> is as good a place as any to study the racism that any American leader should urgently address. </p> \n<p>It\u2019s hardly news that Trump isn\u2019t interested in addressing poverty and racism, or that he will try to distract those who do. But to racially abuse and dehumanise the citizens who will always bear the brunt of these ongoing failures of leadership \u2013 that is a truly squalid thing to do.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Afua Hirsch is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ve never accused anyone of being prone to infestations. But if I were inclined to sink that low, I suspect my attention would be directed towards the 45th president of the United States. It\u2019s not all Donald Trump\u2019s fault. Who can blame anyone for spending most of their life in New York \u2013 a city I love, despite the fact that it harbours one rodent for every four people? Trump hardly had a choice about moving to the White House in 2017, home for two centuries, reportedly, to an unwanted population of rats, ants and even raccoons. Yet it\u2019s hard to avoid holding Trump directly responsible for the wider range of public health hazards reported at his luxury Mar-a-Lago resort \u2013 78 were reported in the three years to 2017, including soiled kitchen utensils and potentially parasite-affected smoked salmon. Hard, too, to ignore the fact that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has been described as a \u201cslum landlord\u201d for the multiple health and safety violations reported in his family firm\u2019s 9,000 Baltimore properties, including mice, maggots and mould. It\u2019s pretty disgusting \u2013 enough to make you lose your appetite but not to break your heart. That feat is reserved for Trump\u2019s knack \u2013 one he has demonstrated many, many times \u2013 of dehumanising human beings, projecting the idea of \u201cinfestation\u201d on to their very existence. Because let\u2019s be clear: when Trump talks about a place being \u201cinfested\u201d, he means it\u2019s inhabited by people who are not white, whether Ebola-stricken west Africa in 2014; Atlanta in 2017, home to more African-American graduates than any other city; \u201csanctuary cities\u201d in 2018, with their offer of safe harbour for undocumented migrants; or the \u201csquad\u201d \u2013 four progressive congresswomen, all Americans, all women of colour \u2013 whom Trump said should go \u201cback\u201d to the \u201ccrime-infested places\u201d to which, in his imagination, they belong. Now he describes Baltimore, a city with proportionally one of the highest African-American populations in the US, as a \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested mess\u201d, holding the respected black congressman who represents the district, Elijah Cummings, responsible. As usual, the people most affected by Trump\u2019s escalation of racist rhetoric \u2013 black and brown Americans \u2013 have been doing the work of explaining why Trump\u2019s words carry racial undertones. A CNN anchor who grew up in Baltimore broke down on air. \u201cA lot of people get up and go to work there, they care for their families there, they love their children, who pledge allegiance to the flag, just like people who live in districts of congressmen who support you, sir,\u201d Victor Blackwell said. \u201cThey are Americans, too.\u201d It\u2019s as maddening as it is moving to watch Blackwell feel compelled to explain \u2013 after Trump described Baltimore as a place \u201cno human being would want to live\u201d \u2013 that his friends and family are indeed human. As black people we keep having to defend our humanity because, accompanying the racism that is revealing itself to be a central plank of Trump\u2019s re-election strategy, the president insists he is \u201cnot racist\u201d. Being racist while saying you are \u201cnot racist\u201d is a modern phenomenon of the modern age. It\u2019s the same story on both sides of the Atlantic. Even Boris Johnson\u2019s choice of racist slurs mirrors the Trumpian playbook: when he described Africans as \u201cAids-ridden\u201d, or published comments about people of Caribbean heritage \u201cmultiplying like flies\u201d, connotations of infestation were equally clear. One of Johnson\u2019s first acts as prime minister was to bring back Zac Goldsmith, whose mayoral campaign even senior Tories denounced, loaded as it was with Islamophobic rhetoric that attempted to link Sadiq Khan to Islamic extremism and crudely stereotyping British Indians. Not only that, but Johnson turned to a key architect of Goldsmith\u2019s campaign, Mark Fullbrook, in his successful bid for the Tory leadership. That both Trump and Johnson claim to be \u201cnot racist\u201d is irrelevant. No one ever admits to being racist any more \u2013 Trump, for instance, has gone to the trouble of interspersing his racist Twitter timeline with support for the rapper A$AP Rocky, currently detained in Sweden on an assault charge, and last-minute meetings with inner-city black pastors. Johnson has made plenty of ethnic minority appointments to his new cabinet. But it\u2019s immaterial, because being \u201cnot racist\u201d is a meaningless claim. Neither Trump nor Johnson seems to understand that being \u201cnot racist\u201d is not, and has never been, the opposite of being racist. \u201cNot racist\u201d is an attempt at neutrality, usually deployed because events have just shown that no such thing exists. As the author Ibram X Kendi points out in his forthcoming book, the opposite of \u201cracist\u201d is \u201canti-racist\u201d, which involves taking an active stance identifying and dismantling the legacy of racism that still characterises our societies. If an anti-racist wanted to unpick this legacy, I can think of few better places to look than Baltimore. The Maryland city has real and chronic problems that are symptomatic of the American story. From the Great Migration of African Americans fleeing the pro-slavery, pro-segregation South in the 19th century, to the 20th-century industries that kept them on low wages, to \u201credlining\u201d \u2013 overtly discriminatory housing practices that pushed black residents into poor, underserviced and marginalised districts \u2013 Baltimore is as good a place as any to study the racism that any American leader should urgently address. It\u2019s hardly news that Trump isn\u2019t interested in addressing poverty and racism, or that he will try to distract those who do. But to racially abuse and dehumanise the citizens who will always bear the brunt of these ongoing failures of leadership \u2013 that is a truly squalid thing to do. \u2022 Afua Hirsch is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>After four decades of war, Afghan civilians have experienced many forms of suffering, at the hands of many actors. It is nonetheless horrifying that the Afghan government and its international allies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/30/nearly-4000-afghan-civilians-killed-or-wounded-in-first-half-of-2019-un-says\" title=\"\">killed more civilians</a> than the Taliban and other insurgents, including the local Islamic State affiliate, in the first half of this year. The number of overall civilian casualties was 27% lower than in the same period last year, but 2018 saw record highs; these rates are shocking and unacceptable, the UN said. Over a third of the 3,812 casualties were children.</p> <p>It is not a contradiction or even a coincidence that so many have been killed and injured as talks with the Taliban gather pace. The US is <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-afghanistan/\" title=\"\">explicit in its commitment</a> to military pressure as a means of creating leverage; the militant group understands the same logic, and seeks to prove it is not cowed. It is nonsensical to think that you can create a lasting peace by ending so many civilian lives, and saying that the Taliban uses civilians as shields is not a free pass under international law. It is clear that the pro-government forces lack both the will and procedures to protect the Afghans they are supposed to be defending. Without proper recording, investigations of and accountability for injuries and deaths, these casualties will continue.</p> <p>Though the US officially ended its combat mission in 2014, after 13 years of war, more than 20,000 US and other Nato troops are present to train, assist and advise Afghan forces and carry out counterterrorism operations. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, says Donald Trump wants a deal before the Afghan presidential election in late September \u2013 another likely trigger for violence (on Sunday, 20 people were killed in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/29/kabul-attack-20-killed-50-injured-in-bombing-and-gun-battle-at-politicians-office\" title=\"\">suicide bombing and gun battle</a> at the vice presidential candidate Amrullah Saleh\u2019s office) \u2013 and troops <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-afghanistan-pompeo/trump-wants-forces-reduced-in-afghanistan-by-next-us-election-pompeo-idUSKCN1UO22R\" title=\"\">reduced before the 2020 US election</a>.</p> <p>The Taliban refuses to negotiate with the Afghan government because it does not recognise it as legitimate. But earlier this month its representatives met government officials at peace talks in Doha, with all theoretically participating in their personal capacities. A deal <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/south-asia/afghanistan/afghanistan-diplomacy-gathers-steam-even-attacks-increase\" title=\"\">might cover</a> a timeline for the withdrawal of US troops and Taliban guarantees not to harbour foreign militants. But it would be unsustainable without real commitments on other elements: a Taliban agreement to talk to Kabul and other political factions and an agreement to de-escalation, or even a full ceasefire. It is also unclear how promises can be upheld and enforced as US troops are withdrawn.</p> <p>The hunger for peace in Afghanistan is real and deep. Yet so is the fear that human rights, of women in particular, will be sold out in the haste to cobble together a fix. Though the Taliban has now <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/07/women-leading-efforts-female-rights-talks-taliban-190708113429836.html\" title=\"\">sat down with female representatives</a>, and is more willing to discuss women\u2019s rights, few believe that its position has fundamentally changed. Women will look at <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/13/video/afghanistan-women-taliban.html\" title=\"\">what they actually do</a> \u2013 and in the sizable areas it controls, the picture is alarming. Limited but still essential progress could be undermined.</p> <p>Afghan leaders and the warlords with whom they have forged alliances have their own <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/02/05/negotiating-peace-afghanistan-lets-not-overlook-human-rights\" title=\"\">dubious records</a> and are more interested in defending their own powers than the advances their country has made, often despite rather than because of them. But as the UN deputy chief, Amina Mohammed, <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/07/1043321\" title=\"\">observed</a> last week, echoing many Afghan activists, inclusivity isn\u2019t only the right thing to do for women and girls; it is the only way to bring about durable peace and development. A rushed deal which rapidly falls apart could cause more damage than no deal at all.</p>",

It is nonetheless horrifying that the Afghan government and its international allies killed more civilians than the Taliban and other insurgents, including the local Islamic State affiliate, in the first half of this year. The number of overall civilian casualties was 27% lower than in the same period last year, but 2018 saw record highs; these rates are shocking and unacceptable, the UN said. Over a third of the 3,812 casualties were children. It is not a contradiction or even a coincidence that so many have been killed and injured as talks with the Taliban gather pace. The US is explicit in its commitment to military pressure as a means of creating leverage; the militant group understands the same logic, and seeks to prove it is not cowed. It is nonsensical to think that you can create a lasting peace by ending so many civilian lives, and saying that the Taliban uses civilians as shields is not a free pass under international law. It is clear that the pro-government forces lack both the will and procedures to protect the Afghans they are supposed to be defending. Without proper recording, investigations of and accountability for injuries and deaths, these casualties will continue. Though the US officially ended its combat mission in 2014, after 13 years of war, more than 20,000 US and other Nato troops are present to train, assist and advise Afghan forces and carry out counterterrorism operations. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, says Donald Trump wants a deal before the Afghan presidential election in late September \u2013 another likely trigger for violence (on Sunday, 20 people were killed in a suicide bombing and gun battle at the vice presidential candidate Amrullah Saleh\u2019s office) \u2013 and troops reduced before the 2020 US election. The Taliban refuses to negotiate with the Afghan government because it does not recognise it as legitimate. But earlier this month its representatives met government officials at peace talks in Doha, with all theoretically participating in their personal capacities. A deal might cover a timeline for the withdrawal of US troops and Taliban guarantees not to harbour foreign militants. But it would be unsustainable without real commitments on other elements: a Taliban agreement to talk to Kabul and other political factions and an agreement to de-escalation, or even a full ceasefire. It is also unclear how promises can be upheld and enforced as US troops are withdrawn. The hunger for peace in Afghanistan is real and deep. Yet so is the fear that human rights, of women in particular, will be sold out in the haste to cobble together a fix. Though the Taliban has now sat down with female representatives, and is more willing to discuss women\u2019s rights, few believe that its position has fundamentally changed. Women will look at what they actually do \u2013 and in the sizable areas it controls, the picture is alarming. Limited but still essential progress could be undermined. Afghan leaders and the warlords with whom they have forged alliances have their own dubious records and are more interested in defending their own powers than the advances their country has made, often despite rather than because of them. But as the UN deputy chief, Amina Mohammed, observed last week, echoing many Afghan activists, inclusivity isn\u2019t only the right thing to do for women and girls; it is the only way to bring about durable peace and development. A rushed deal which rapidly falls apart could cause more damage than no deal at all.",

And the results that matter are the share price, the dividend and the company\u2019s market capitalisation.</p> <p>Iain Conn joined Centrica in January 2015. Since then, the company\u2019s share price has fallen by 70%, its stock market value is a quarter of what it was, and \u2013 following a thumping pre-tax loss in the first half of 2019 \u2013 its interim dividend has now been cut by 58% to 1.5 pence a share.</p> <p>Add in the loss of customers to the plethora of new energy suppliers that have sprung up in the past five years and it came as no surprise to learn Conn is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/30/british-gas-owner-centrica-loss-iain-conn\">leaving the company that owns British Gas next year</a>. The patience of the board \u2013 and the company\u2019s shareholders \u2013 has run out.</p> <p>Conn\u2019s pitch is that he has totally restructured the company since he took over, and there\u2019s truth in that. Centrica is no longer a vertically integrated business that both generates and supplies energy. It has sold off large power plants, got out of nuclear and instead concentrated on consumer-facing services, such as the Hive, a smart thermostat app. It has taken time but there is evidence that the loss of UK domestic energy supply accounts has halted. Its US operations are successful.</p> <p>It is also reasonable for Conn to point out that recent business conditions have been challenging. The company has been beset by a number of headwinds, the most significant of which has been the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/31/what-is-the-price-cap-and-how-does-it-work\">energy price cap</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>But pointing to the problems created by the company he inherited is a bit like a football manager bemoaning the fact that his predecessor left him with a lot of dead wood. And blaming market conditions for poor performance is the equivalent of pointing to a long injury list for a run of bad results.</p> <p>Conn says he will leave Centrica in a better place than he found it but it will be up to a new chief executive to prove whether he is right. And, let\u2019s face it, in the more brutal world of the Premier League he would have been out long ago.</p> <h2>Good CV, wrong passport</h2> <p>Europe has yet to decide who it wants to run the International Monetary Fund but one thing is certain: it won\u2019t be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/30/mark-carney-shortlist-imf-top-job-christine-lagarde\">Mark Carney</a>.</p> <p>The Bank of England\u2019s governor is on the lookout for a new challenge when he leaves Threadneedle Street next January and would have made any merit-based shortlist for the IMF hot seat. In truth, the chances of him getting a sniff at the job were always slim: he was born in the wrong part of the world.</p> <p>By an outdated convention, the managing director of the IMF is a European while the president of the World Bank is an American. Carney is Canadian, and that rules him out, even though he also holds UK and Irish passports.</p> <p>Finance ministers from the eurozone want to ensure the IMF will be there for Europe in the event of another global downturn affecting the single currency. That, though, is the easy bit. </p> <p>The northern Europeans want someone who will be tough on debt, budget rules and the need for structural reform, which is why Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the former Dutch finance minister and Olli Rehn, Finland\u2019s central bank governor, are in the frame. </p> <p>The southern Europeans want someone more sympathetic to them, which is why Portugal\u2019s Mario C\u00e9nteno, chair of the Eurogroup of finance ministers; and Spain\u2019s finance minister, Nadia Calvi\u00f1o are in the running.</p> <p>Bulgaria\u2019s Kristalina Georgieva, number two at the World Bank, is the obvious compromise candidate. True, the IMF would have to waive the rule that excludes people becoming MD after their 65th birthday, but Georgieva appears to have the backing of Paris. And, given that five of the last eight IMF bosses have been French, that could prove crucial.</p>",

Many in the currency markets think the impasse between the UK and the EU will only be ended by Johnson calling a general election. A squeeze on living standards caused by a depreciating pound would make it harder for Johnson to secure his own mandate \u2013 as May found to her cost in 2017. Centrica\u2019s patience had run out Like the managers of football clubs, the chief executives of FTSE 100 companies are judged by their results. And the results that matter are the share price, the dividend and the company\u2019s market capitalisation. Iain Conn joined Centrica in January 2015. Since then, the company\u2019s share price has fallen by 70%, its stock market value is a quarter of what it was, and \u2013 following a thumping pre-tax loss in the first half of 2019 \u2013 its interim dividend has now been cut by 58% to 1.5 pence a share. Add in the loss of customers to the plethora of new energy suppliers that have sprung up in the past five years and it came as no surprise to learn Conn is leaving the company that owns British Gas next year. The patience of the board \u2013 and the company\u2019s shareholders \u2013 has run out. Conn\u2019s pitch is that he has totally restructured the company since he took over, and there\u2019s truth in that. Centrica is no longer a vertically integrated business that both generates and supplies energy. It has sold off large power plants, got out of nuclear and instead concentrated on consumer-facing services, such as the Hive, a smart thermostat app. It has taken time but there is evidence that the loss of UK domestic energy supply accounts has halted. Its US operations are successful. It is also reasonable for Conn to point out that recent business conditions have been challenging. The company has been beset by a number of headwinds, the most significant of which has been the government\u2019s energy price cap. But pointing to the problems created by the company he inherited is a bit like a football manager bemoaning the fact that his predecessor left him with a lot of dead wood. And blaming market conditions for poor performance is the equivalent of pointing to a long injury list for a run of bad results. Conn says he will leave Centrica in a better place than he found it but it will be up to a new chief executive to prove whether he is right. And, let\u2019s face it, in the more brutal world of the Premier League he would have been out long ago. Good CV, wrong passport Europe has yet to decide who it wants to run the International Monetary Fund but one thing is certain: it won\u2019t be Mark Carney. The Bank of England\u2019s governor is on the lookout for a new challenge when he leaves Threadneedle Street next January and would have made any merit-based shortlist for the IMF hot seat. In truth, the chances of him getting a sniff at the job were always slim: he was born in the wrong part of the world. By an outdated convention, the managing director of the IMF is a European while the president of the World Bank is an American. Carney is Canadian, and that rules him out, even though he also holds UK and Irish passports. Finance ministers from the eurozone want to ensure the IMF will be there for Europe in the event of another global downturn affecting the single currency. That, though, is the easy bit. The northern Europeans want someone who will be tough on debt, budget rules and the need for structural reform, which is why Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the former Dutch finance minister and Olli Rehn, Finland\u2019s central bank governor, are in the frame. The southern Europeans want someone more sympathetic to them, which is why Portugal\u2019s Mario C\u00e9nteno, chair of the Eurogroup of finance ministers; and Spain\u2019s finance minister, Nadia Calvi\u00f1o are in the running. Bulgaria\u2019s Kristalina Georgieva, number two at the World Bank, is the obvious compromise candidate. True, the IMF would have to waive the rule that excludes people becoming MD after their 65th birthday, but Georgieva appears to have the backing of Paris. And, given that five of the last eight IMF bosses have been French, that could prove crucial.",

Although this book, like all Millar\u2019s publications, was rooted in constant reading and research in libraries, his understanding of the variety of the late Roman and early Christian landscape in Syria and Jordan had been transformed by a tour of major ancient sites including Palmyra, Petra and Jerash (the Greco-Roman Gerasa), a few years before the Harvard lectures.

But the regard in which he was held by classicists and historians never wavered. In 1959 he married Susanna Friedmann, an academic psychologist. She survives him, as do his children, Sarah, Andrew and Jonathan, and seven grandchildren. \u2022 Fergus Graham Burtholme Millar, scholar of ancient history, born 5 July 1935; died 15 July 2019",

Non-molestation orders can protect against violence or harassment by a partner, ex-partner or family member.</p> <p>Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, who did not appear at the hearing, is arguing in the same proceedings for the return of the couple\u2019s two children to Dubai. Princess Haya has applied for wardship of the children. </p> <p>The case is being heard by Andrew McFarlane, the president of the high court\u2019s family division.</p> <p>The bare facts of the applications sought by the disputing parties can be reported after the Guardian, with the support of other media organisations, challenged restrictions imposed on the case.</p> <p>This month in a highly unusual move after extensive international publicity, the couple issued a statement saying the proceedings were \u201cconcerned with the welfare of the two children of their marriage and do not concern divorce or finances\u201d.</p> <p>Before the breakdown of their marriage, Sheikh Mohammed and Princess Haya had been described as a perfect couple and often appeared together at international social events. Princess Haya, the daughter of the late King Hussein of Jordan, is close to the British royal family and owns an \u00a385m house near Kensington Palace. She married Sheikh Mohammed in 2004 and is his sixth wife.</p> <p>Sheikh Mohammed, 70, is vice-president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates as well as ruler of Dubai. The billionaire sheikh is also the founder of the successful Godolphin horse racing stable and last month received a trophy from the Queen after one of his horses won a race at Royal Ascot.</p> <p>The princess was educated at private schools in the UK and studied philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford University. She has served on the International Olympic Committee and has been a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations world food programme.</p> <p>The Emirati royal family has already been subjected to unwelcome publicity over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/24/family-of-emirati-princess-release-pictures-to-rebut-false-abduction-allegations\">the case of Princess Latifa</a>, Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s daughter. She allegedly escaped Dubai and was seized by commandos off the coast of India and returned to her home.</p> <p>Emirati authorities rubbished allegations over Princess Latifa\u2019s treatment and abduction as fiction, saying she was \u201cvulnerable to exploitation\u201d and had been kidnapped.</p> <p>Princess Haya\u2019s legal team includes Fiona Shackleton, who represented Prince Charles during his divorce from Princess Diana.</p> <p>The sheikh\u2019s team includes Helen Ward QC, of Stewarts Law, who has previously represented Andrew Lloyd Webber, Paloma Picasso, Guy Ritchie and Bernie Ecclestone.</p> <p>The case continues.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The estranged wife of the ruler of Dubai has asked an English court for a forced marriage protection order relating to their children and a non-molestation order after the breakdown of the marriage. Princess Haya of Jordan, 45, appeared in the family court division of the high court, central London, on Tuesday, for a preliminary hearing. A forced marriage protection order aims to protect a person who has been or is being forced into marriage. Non-molestation orders can protect against violence or harassment by a partner, ex-partner or family member. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, who did not appear at the hearing, is arguing in the same proceedings for the return of the couple\u2019s two children to Dubai. Princess Haya has applied for wardship of the children. The case is being heard by Andrew McFarlane, the president of the high court\u2019s family division. The bare facts of the applications sought by the disputing parties can be reported after the Guardian, with the support of other media organisations, challenged restrictions imposed on the case. This month in a highly unusual move after extensive international publicity, the couple issued a statement saying the proceedings were \u201cconcerned with the welfare of the two children of their marriage and do not concern divorce or finances\u201d. Before the breakdown of their marriage, Sheikh Mohammed and Princess Haya had been described as a perfect couple and often appeared together at international social events. Princess Haya, the daughter of the late King Hussein of Jordan, is close to the British royal family and owns an \u00a385m house near Kensington Palace. She married Sheikh Mohammed in 2004 and is his sixth wife. Sheikh Mohammed, 70, is vice-president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates as well as ruler of Dubai. The billionaire sheikh is also the founder of the successful Godolphin horse racing stable and last month received a trophy from the Queen after one of his horses won a race at Royal Ascot. The princess was educated at private schools in the UK and studied philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford University. She has served on the International Olympic Committee and has been a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations world food programme. The Emirati royal family has already been subjected to unwelcome publicity over the case of Princess Latifa, Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s daughter. She allegedly escaped Dubai and was seized by commandos off the coast of India and returned to her home. Emirati authorities rubbished allegations over Princess Latifa\u2019s treatment and abduction as fiction, saying she was \u201cvulnerable to exploitation\u201d and had been kidnapped. Princess Haya\u2019s legal team includes Fiona Shackleton, who represented Prince Charles during his divorce from Princess Diana. The sheikh\u2019s team includes Helen Ward QC, of Stewarts Law, who has previously represented Andrew Lloyd Webber, Paloma Picasso, Guy Ritchie and Bernie Ecclestone. The case continues.",

He has promised to rapidly renegotiate almost all of May\u2019s departure deal, ditching the Irish backstop border guarantee policy \u2013 something that would seem a huge task over any timescale, let alone little more than 12 weeks, a fair proportion of which is taken up by a summer break. If this fails, he will be set on a no-deal departure for 31 October, and a likely huge clash with MPs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Iran</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>&nbsp;wasn\u2019t enough, a new Johnson government must immediately take steps to make sure he doesn\u2019t begin his time in No 10 with a slide into war. The situation in the gulf is complex, fast-moving and hugely dangerous. Johnson did not cover himself in glory as foreign secretary, especially over Iran. It will be his task to prove he has learned.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Managing parliament and Tory MPs</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Johnson will start as PM with a working Commons majority of four, thanks to the DUP, but within weeks it is likely to be down to three if as expected the Liberal Democrats win in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection. If this wasn\u2019t tricky enough, a small but significant section of Tory MPs openly detest Johnson, and will not want to help him out - and with his cabinet sackings, the \u2018Gaukward squad\u2019 of former senior cabinet members set on blocking a no-deal Brexit swelled in ranks.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Loosening the purse strings</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Such was the fiscal largesse on display from both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt during the hustings process that much as he will seek to kick any decisions towards an autumn budget, voters \u2013 especially Tory members \u2013 will be expecting both tax cuts and more spending on areas such as education and the police.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Everything non-Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This might sound glib, but there is a lot to consider \u2013 during the three-plus years of Brexit introversion May\u2019s government failed to properly grasp any of a series of long-term, pressing national problems: the crisis in social care; the future of the NHS; a climate emergency; the increasingly insecure future of work; a broken housing market; rampant poverty, including among many working people. This is a huge workload for any new administration.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Being prime ministerial</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Critics might say this is Johnson\u2019s single biggest challenge. The leadership process has shown that while he endlessly harked back to supposed successes as London mayor \u2013 an often ceremonial role with relatively few powers \u2013 Johnson was notably quieter about his period as foreign secretary.</p>\n    <p>Being prime minister is like the latter, to a factor of 10 \u2013 a never-ending succession of red boxes containing vital documents, of urgent briefings, of a whole system hanging on your decisions. Johnson has a tendency to ignore advice, pluck statistics out of the air and rely on sudden, cheap glibness.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has declined to give specific details about how his government would help agriculture in the event of a no-deal Brexit, after farming groups said it would be catastrophic for the sheep and lamb industry. Before a trip to Wales on Tuesday, where he visited a chicken farm near Newport, the prime minister was urged to \u201cstop playing Russian roulette\u201d with farming and warned that leaving the EU without a deal could spark civil unrest. But Johnson dismissed those concerns, saying it was important for people to be confident about the government\u2019s no-deal plans. During his farm visit, he declined twice to provide details on what sort of help farmers would get, beyond saying they had the support they needed and that the government would help them to find new markets if other ones became trickier to do business with. \u201cWe have interventions that are aimed to support them and their incomes,\u201d he added. Johnson said: \u201cAs you know, Defra, the [agriculture] ministry, has done a huge amount already to prepare in advance to 29 March, and will do even more to prepare in the run-up to 31 October, when we come out.\u201d Pressed on what help would be provided, he said: \u201cThe more you prepare, and the more confident you are about the measures you put in place, the less likely it is that there will be difficulties when it comes to 31 October.\u201d Johnson reiterated his belief that a no-deal outcome was unlikely, and said it was up to the EU whether the UK left the bloc without a new withdrawal agreement: \u201cIt\u2019s their call if they want us to do this.\u201d He said the EU had to accept the removal of the Irish backstop \u2013 something Brussels has repeatedly said it would not do. \u201cIf they understand that then I think we\u2019re going to be at the races,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cIf they can\u2019t compromise, if they really can\u2019t do it, then clearly we have to get ready for a no-deal exit, and I think we\u2019ll do it. I think the people of this country are full of resolve and purpose, and we will look after the farming sector.\u201d On his visit to Wales, Johnson met Mark Drakeford, the Labour first minister. A Welsh government spokesperson said the pair \u201chad substantial discussions, but clearly there are fundamentally different views on Brexit\u201d. Drakeford \u201crepeatedly warned of the catastrophic impact Brexit would have on Wales and pressed the prime minister on what support would be available for Welsh industry and agricultural sectors\u201d but \u201cno details [were] given about new or alternative markets\u201d. The first minister also urged Johnson to hold a second referendum \u201cto test the views of the people\u201d. Before the trip, Johnson was warned that 40% tariffs on meat exported to the EU could lead to the mass slaughter of sheep. Helen Roberts from the National Sheep Association in Wales said it would be \u201cabsolutely catastrophic\u201d to leave with no deal and could lead to civil unrest among sheep farmers.\u201cI\u2019d want him to stop playing Russian roulette with the industry,\u201d she said. Roberts said she did not want to see a mass slaughter for welfare reasons and that the government needed to get cold storage in place and talk about public procurement of lamb meat. Asked about civil unrest among farmers such as tractors being used to block roads, she said: \u201cI think they will. It is time to stand up for ourselves ... I suspect there will be protests.\u201d Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers Union, said there would be no market for 40% of the UK\u2019s lamb meat in the event of a no-deal Brexit. \u201cYou would be in oversupply because you wouldn\u2019t be able to get over the barrier of a tariff to Europe,\u201d she said. She said a mass slaughter was the last thing the NFU wanted but to avoid that the government would need to look at forcing hospitals, schools and other public bodies to buy lamb meat. Alun Cairns, the Welsh secretary, agreed that farming was a winner from having access to EU markets but said there was potential for exports to new markets. Asked for his response to threats of civil unrest, he claimed UK farmers could export their meat to Japan rather than Europe. \u201cI would say we are working to get a deal and the European market is important to us but there are markets around the world,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. He added that it was not clear how civil unrest would take place. \u201cThe context is that Wales has voted to leave the EU \u2026 we have an obligation to leave and of course we would much prefer to leave with a deal.\u201d Last week research commissioned by the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board and Quality Meat Scotland found that combined beef and sheep meat exports to the EU could decline by 92.5%, with the lamb export trade \u201calmost completely wiped out\u201d. In a no-deal scenario, the 37,000 carcasses a week that are usually sent to Europe would be stopped overnight under strict EU import rules that require de facto licensing for all farm exports. This has led to suggestions of a mass cull of animals as well as the need for state aid to support farmers, some of whom earn as little as \u00a313,000 a year.",

As the Press Association reports, Corbyn spoke to a hundred or so people demonstrating at the Preston New Road site near Blackpool as police officers stood guard. The site is the UK\u2019s only operational shale exploration operation and is controversial in Lancashire after small earth tremors were blamed on the process. </p> <p>Corbyn said fracking, a method of shale gas extraction through hydraulic fracturing underground, would have a damaging effect on the environment. But the boss of Cuadrilla, Francis Egan, said Labour\u2019s policies would leave the UK dependent on imported gas and issued an open invitation for him to visit. Asked if he had any plans to meet the firm\u2019s representatives, Corbyn said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As of this moment no.

I don't quite understand why British farmers aren't just planning to sell their meat to British people when tariffs both ways across the channel go up. Surely as the cost of meat from the EU goes up we will import less?</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>The best explanation I\u2019ve read is<a href=\"http://beefandlambmatters.blogspot.com/2013/07/why-uk-imports-lamb-from-new-zealand.html\"> this one,</a> from the Beef and Lamb Matters blog. Here is an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A question we\u2019re often asked though is, \u2018if we\u2019re self sufficient, why does the UK import so much sheep meat?\u2019 The reasons are numerous and complex but can broadly split into four areas \u2013 historic, market, seasonal and economic.</p> <p>The UK has been importing New Zealand sheep meat for 130 years, with unrestricted imports until 1973 when the UK joined the European Economic Community (EEC). At the time, the UK was only circa 40 per cent self sufficient. To give it some context, prior to joining the EEC, the UK took the vast majority of New Zealand\u2019s lamb exports \u2013 86 per cent in 1970. Today the UK takes around 20 per cent and in 2012 China overtook the UK as the primary destination for New Zealand lamb.</p> <p>From 1972 to 1999, the UK sheep flock grew from 27.9 million head to 44.7 million head, with the UK\u2019s self sufficiency rate increasing to 95 per cent to coincide with increasing production. Increasing production drove rising UK export volumes and, despite a fall in the 2000s, today the UK exports around 100,000 tonnes.</p> <p>However, while the UK market is technically self-sufficient, it is not functionally self sufficient. The UK demands a larger volume of higher end cuts such as legs and chops, while UK exports consist mainly of carcases and a large proportion of low value cuts to emerging markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d4031598f08cf92bb779bc2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-30T12:03:49.607Z\">1.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Johnson reaffirms commitment not to have checks or infrastructure at Irish border in any circumstances</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Downing Street has just sent out the readout of Boris Johnson\u2019s call with Leo Varadkar, his Irish opposite number.

McDonald said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the British government have factored into their calculations a hard border, then they must factor in a unity referendum as laid out in the Good Friday agreement.</p> <p>The route back for the north into the EU is clear. Irish unity is the route back to the EU.</p> <p>We will be meeting Boris Johnston in the coming days. We will remind him not only of the need to respect the wishes of the majority to remain within the EU.</p> <p>We will also remind him of his obligations under the Good Friday and subsequent agreements including the provision for a unity referendum</p> <p>Brexit has re-exposed the folly of partition and reinforced the need for Irish unity.</p> <p>Sinn F\u00e9in makes no apology for promoting our vision of a united Ireland.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said that \u201clittle progress\u201d had been made in the talks on restoring the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland</strong>.

He has explained why<a href=\"https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/alastair-campbell-s-letter-to-jeremy-corbyn-1-6188152\"> in a 3,000-word open letter to Jeremy Corbyn for the New European. </a>There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/29/jeremy-corbyn-labour-party-brexit\">a shorter version in the Guardian,</a> and my colleague <strong>Rowena Mason</strong> has written it up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/29/alastair-campbell-says-he-no-longer-wishes-to-be-a-labour-member\">here. </a></p> <p>As Campbell explains in his New European article, his conclusion that Labour is not in a position to win a general election with Corbyn as leader has been partly influenced by time he has spent in Australia, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/30/bill-shorten-blames-powerful-vested-interests-for-labors-election-defeat\">Labour lost a general election earlier this year</a> that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/16/essential-poll-majority-of-voters-think-bill-shorten-will-be-the-winner-on-saturday\">it had been widely expected to win. </a>Campbell writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I fear the country may already have decided that it does not intend to make you prime minister. The importance of being clear and honest about that has been underlined to me talking to senior politicians in Australia, where the Labor party has recently lost an election it was almost universally expected to win against a failing, right-wing government. The data was there for all to see - Bill Shorten was not popular enough to win, the country had made up its mind. But the party failed to confront that truth, perhaps because Labor were polling well ahead of the government. Labour in the UK has no such excuse for denial. Both party standing and yours are nowhere near where they need to be, nor anywhere near where Bill Shorten\u2019s and Labor\u2019s were.</p> </blockquote> <p>In an interview on the Today programme this morning, Campbell said that he would not be joining the Liberal Democrats. \u201cI don\u2019t feel I\u2019m close to other parties, but I do think if we do get to a general election and the choice facing the country is Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn all sorts of things are going to happen because that is not a choice that this country finds remotely palatable,\u201d Campbell said. He said he did not know how he would vote at the next general election, but he said that Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, was his local MP, and he described Starmer as \u201ca good MP\u2019. </p> <p>Campbell also said that he wanted to support Labour, but that the party was no longer the one he had supported all his life.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t ever want to vote anything but Labour. But this Labour party is not the Labour party of Clement Attlee, it is not the Labour party of Harold Wilson, it is not the Labour party of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. It has been taken over by people who until recently were communists, they were Stalinists, and they still are, in my view. And I think it\u2019s time to stop pretending, all of us, members, MPs, let\u2019s stop pretending that this is the Labour party that we really believe in.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9e8252f44cd4ff24375322cdbd37f2885d08524\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9e8252f44cd4ff24375322cdbd37f2885d08524/0_13_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alastair Campbell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alastair Campbell</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-30T10:23:29.230Z\">at 11.23am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d4010808f0845f89e316f03\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-30T09:43:29.168Z\">10.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor, <strong>Peter Foster,</strong> has a good Twitter thread that considers how realistic it is for the government to say that farmers can make up for the possible loss of access to the EU market by selling their produce to other countries abroad.

His comments included this fascinating aside.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We don\u2019t do the kind of trade we could do with - what some people say is Great Britain, and some people remember - a word you don\u2019t hear too much is England, which is a piece of it.</p> </blockquote> <p>It would be easy to put this down to simple US confusion about the name of the country that Johnson presides over (understandable confusion - it is not straightforward). But with Brexit posing perhaps the biggest threat to the preservation of the union of the United Kingdom for a century, perhaps Trump was being more prescient than he realised. It is not entirely impossible that, within a generation, England might be all that is left.</p> <p>In Northern Ireland the prospect of a no deal Brexit is making Irish reunification look more palatable to some than it has done for years, and Theresa May was so alarmed by this that she eventually concluded a no deal Brexit would be unacceptable. In Scotland the SNP believes that the combination of Brexit and a Johnson premiership could make a second independence referendum easier to win than the last one. Wales is a different prospect; unlike Scotland and Northern Ireland, it voted leave along with England. And in Wales even the nationalists are wary of independence - Plaid Cymru is more of a home rule party, with independence only a long-term goal. But even in Wales opinion is shifting. Recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/08/tory-leadership-latest-news-liam-fox-says-ambassador-who-angered-trump-should-keep-his-job--live-news?page=with:block-5d23664f8f0845f89e30902b#block-5d23664f8f0845f89e30902b\">the Labour first minister, Mark Drakeford, said that Wales\u2019s support for the union was not unconditional</a>, and only yesterday an opinion poll put <a href=\"https://blogs.cardiff.ac.uk/electionsinwales/2019/07/29/the-july-welsh-political-barometer-poll/\">Plaid Cymru ahead in voting intention for the Welsh assembly for the first time ever.</a></p> <p>After his visit to Scotland yesterday, Johnson, who has given himself the title \u201cminister for the union\u201d alongside the title prime minister, is in Wales, and, according to a statement released by Number 10 overnight, he will tell Welsh farmers they have a bright future after Brexit. He will say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I will always back Britain\u2019s great farmers and as we leave the EU we need to make sure that Brexit works for them.</p> <p>That means scrapping the common agricultural policy and signing new trade deals \u2013 our amazing food and farming sector will be ready and waiting to continue selling ever more not just here but around the world.</p> <p>Once we leave the EU on 31 October, we will have a historic opportunity to introduce new schemes to support farming\u2013 and we will make sure that farmers gets a better deal.</p> <p>Brexit presents enormous opportunities for our country and it\u2019s time we looked to the future with pride and optimism.</p> </blockquote> <p>But not everyone is convinced. On the Today programme this morning Helen Roberts, a sheep farmer in Wales and a regional development officer for the <strong>National Sheep Association,</strong> said a no deal Brexit could lead to farmers in Wales blocking roads in protest. Echoing<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-49066465\"> a comment made by the Farmers Union of Wales</a>, which recently warned that a no deal Brexit could lead to \u201ccivil unrest\u201d, Roberts said a no deal Brexit would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for sheep farmers. She explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At home we have got a flock of 450 ewes. We\u2019ve just started selling the lambs off them for this year. Come the end of October, that\u2019s when we will still be selling them. And to not have a market [because no deal would lead to the imposition of high tariffs by the EU] to sell them into just means there would be no future.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if she thought farmers would really take the fight onto the streets in the event of a no deal Brexit, Roberts replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think they will. I think it is time to stand up for ourselves and be counted. We produce the most wonderful product and we need to be able to sell it and continue farming and looking after the land, like we do best.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked what she meant, and whether she was talking about the possibility of farmers blocking roads with tractors, Roberts said she would expect something like that in the event of a no deal Brexit. </p> <p>Johnson is in Wales this afternoon.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar have clashed over the Irish backstop in their first phone call, with the taoiseach saying the EU is united in the view that it cannot be scrapped and the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened. Boris Johnson has been urged to \u201cstop playing Russian roulette\u201d with the sheep and lamb industry by threatening a no-deal Brexit. Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, has told Boris Johnson that a no deal Brexit would be \u201ccatastrophic for Wales\u201d. (See 12.41pm.) The pound has faced renewed selling pressure amid rising fears that Boris Johnson could walk Britain out of the EU without a deal, raising the prospect of rising prices for consumers and hitting holidaymakers in the pocket. Jim O\u2019Neill, the former Treasury minister and former Goldman Sachs banker, has said government policy amounts to a \u201cfree lunch\u201d for currency traders. (See 4.09pm.) Jeremy Corbyn has urged Boris Johnson to ban fracking for gas as research by Labour shows it will stop the UK meeting a net zero target for carbon emissions this century. Cambridge Analytica did work for Leave.EU on the EU referendum, according to emails published by a House of Commons committee, even though the company never received payment for it. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Jeremy Corbyn has snubbed the boss of fracking firm Cuadrilla, meeting protesters instead at the gates of a shale gas exploration site and promising them his party would ban the practice. As the Press Association reports, Corbyn spoke to a hundred or so people demonstrating at the Preston New Road site near Blackpool as police officers stood guard. The site is the UK\u2019s only operational shale exploration operation and is controversial in Lancashire after small earth tremors were blamed on the process. Corbyn said fracking, a method of shale gas extraction through hydraulic fracturing underground, would have a damaging effect on the environment. But the boss of Cuadrilla, Francis Egan, said Labour\u2019s policies would leave the UK dependent on imported gas and issued an open invitation for him to visit. Asked if he had any plans to meet the firm\u2019s representatives, Corbyn said: As of this moment no. I\u2019m here to announce our support for ending fracking, but I\u2019m happy to talk to them because I do believe what they are doing is dangerous to our environment. As the Press Association reports, after speaking to demonstrators in a hut where they organise round the clock monitoring of the fracking activities, Corbyn stepped onto a bench to give a speech to protesters. He said: I want to see a green industrial revolution in Britain. I want to see sustainability. We cannot go on with this level of CO2 emissions and global warming, otherwise we are all damaged if not doomed. A green industrial revolution will create around 400,000 jobs, high-skilled, good quality, well paid jobs, all around the country. That is a future for our children. We have a short window, as a people, to reduce CO2 emissions, to prevent global warming beyond 1.5C, in order to protect the planet. I want to say well done everyone in Lancashire that opposed fracking here, as in Derbyshire and other places, in Sussex, and the way in which you have made sure the issue is kept alive. This is from Sky\u2019s Sam Coates on what Boris Johnson said to Leo Varadkar in their call. (See 1.03pm.) Actually, Johnson has already repudiated the December 2017 joint report. He did so here, in his Commons statement last Thursday. Adrian Masters, ITV Wales\u2019s political editor, has written a Twitter thread explaining why he thought Number 10 were being unduly restrictive in their dealings with the media when Boris Johnson visited the Welsh chicken farm today. It starts here. Boris Johnson has recorded an interview for broadcasters at the chicken farm in Wales. Here are the key points. Johnson insisted that technological solutions were available to provide an alternative to the Irish backstop. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, told Johnson when they spoke today that no \u201csatisfactory\u201d alternatives to the backstop had yet been identified. (See 2.20pm.) But Johnson claimed that he had had a \u201cvery good\u201d conversation with Varadkar. He went on: The UK, under no circumstances, will have checks at the border in Northern Ireland. We will throw all our energies into sorting out the problems of frictionless trade at the border. We can do it. We have all the sorts of technological solutions that are necessary to do it. But let\u2019s solve those issues in the context of the free trade agreement that we\u2019re going to do after we come out on October 31. He claimed he had had a \u201cvery good\u201d conversation with Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, today. He stressed that he was not aiming for a no deal Brexit. But the EU had to accept that the backstop needed to go, he said: If they understand that then I think we\u2019re going to be at the races. If they can\u2019t compromise, if they really can\u2019t do it, then clearly we have to get ready for a no deal exit, and I think we\u2019ll do it. I think the people of this country are full of resolve and purpose, and we will look after the farming sector. He said the UK had to prepare for a no deal Brexit because it was \u201cabsolutely vital\u201d that it had the ability to talk away from the negotiations. He said farmers could get the support they needed in the event of a no deal Brexit. Asked how the government would help them, he replied: We will make sure that they have the support they need, that if there are markets that are going to be tricky, that we help them to find new markets, that we have interventions that are aimed to support them and their incomes. As you know, Defra, the ministry, has done a huge amount already to prepare in advance to 29 March, and will do even more to prepare in the run-up to 31 October, when we come out. He said a lot of adjustments that would be needed for a no deal Brexit would be necessary even if the UK were to leave the EU with a deal. He insisted that he was not engaged in what was effectively the early stage of a general election campaign. This is what Jim O\u2019Neill, the former Goldman Sachs economist and former Treasury minister, told the World at One about how government policies are driving down the value of sterling. (See 2.29pm.) O\u2019Neill started by stressing that it was hard to predict what currencies would do, and that the value of currencies could go up as well as down. But he went on: We have got the ingredients of quite a challenge here with the pound. In my many former years [as a Goldman Sachs economist] I would have a little quadrant of different policy combinations and what they would mean for a currency ... In addition to the obviously increased no deal Brexit risk, I think the markets are also now looking at a government that might be leaning on an independent central bank, possibly including the choice of its new governor, as well as ... having a free lunch on an expansionary fiscal policy. An expansionary fiscal policy and an expansionary monetary policy combination used to be what one would associate with the Italian lira and Latin American currencies. So those, on top of a no Brexit risk, are essentially all pointing one way for the pound. O\u2019Neill said he was not involved in currency trading any more. But he then went on: I\u2019m pretty sure that a lot of big foreign exchange and hedge fund-type people have had a pretty tricky life for the past few years for a whole host of reasons and they are probably looking at what\u2019s being said coming out of the UK as almost close to a free lunch; that you\u2019ve got a government that is deliberately promoting the no deal risk, and one that is talking so adventurously, let\u2019s call it, about monetary and fiscal policy too. The world I was in, a lot of them are saying, \u2018Thank goodness for Boris, he\u2019s giving us a chance to make some money.\u2019 Boris Johnson has been visiting a chicken farm in Wales. Coincidentally Johnson visit coincides with the Daily Mirror splashing on the news that Lee Cain, his director of communications, used to pursue Tory politicians dressed as a chicken as a tabloid stunt when he was working for the paper during the 2010 general election. According to Downing Street, apart from a few Lords appointments, the government reshuffle has now been completed. In due course a full list of ministers should appear on the government\u2019s website here. Number 10 has also sent out a list of all the ministers who have, as they put it, \u201cleft the government\u201d. That means it\u2019s mostly a list of ministers who have been sacked, although some may have refused to accept demotions, like Jeremy Hunt, and others may have indicated they wanted to go, like Chris Grayling. This list understates the full scale of change because it does not include four ministers who resigned before Boris Johnson had the chance to sack them: Philip Hammond, the chancellor; David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister; David Gauke, the justice secretary; Rory Stewart, the international development secretary. Here is the Number 10 list of ministers who have left the government. Cabinet ministers who have gone (10) Jeremy Hunt, foreign secretary Penny Mordaunt, defence secretary Liam Fox, international trade secretary Greg Clark, business secretary Chris Grayling, transport secretary Damian Hinds, education secretary James Brokenshire, housing secretary Jeremy Wright, culture secretary Karen Bradley, Northern Ireland secretary David Mundell, Scottish secretary Ministers attending cabinet who have gone (3) Mel Stride, leader of the Commons Claire Perry, energy minister Caroline Nokes, immigration minister Other ministers (10) Stephen Hammond, health minister George Hollingberry, international trade minister John Penrose, Northern Ireland minister Mark Field, Foreign Office minister Robert Goodwill, environment minister Harriet Baldwin, Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood, defence minister Jackie Doyle-Price, health minister Andrew Jones, transport minister Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth, a housing minister According to Dan Bloom at the Mirror, Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser on Brexit, David Frost, argued earlier this year that it would be a mistake for the UK to agree to continue matching EU rules on workers\u2019 rights after Brexit. In his first speech as prime minister, a week ago tomorrow, Boris Johnson declared: The people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts. But it turns out, because of the way Johnson\u2019s government has talked up the prospect of a no deal Brexit, currency traders are doing quite well betting against Britain. At least, that\u2019s what Jim O\u2019Neill, the former Goldman Sachs economist and former Treasury minister, told the World at One. Here is the Irish government\u2019s readout of Boris Johnson\u2019s conversation with Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach. It says Varadkar told Johnson that the EU was \u201cunited in its view that the withdrawal agreement could not be reopened\u201d and that no \u201csatisfactory\u201d alternatives to the backstop had yet been identified. When Boris Johnson is in Wales this afternoon, he is likely to be asked what will happen to Welsh farmers if a no deal Brexit leads to the EU imposing tariffs on meat imports. According to this report from the Shropshire Star, when Johnson was asked about this during the Tory leadership campaign last month, he claimed that in practice there would be no tariffs. The report says: Mr Johnson said he did not believe it remotely likely that the EU would want to impose import tariffs on British goods if a deal could not be reached. \u201cObviously we have got to prepare for every scenario possible, but I don\u2019t think there is any chance that the EU would want to start putting tariffs on trade with Britain again, something we have not done since the Napoleonic days of continental Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople need to be confident and courageous, I believe there is plenty of time to come to a trading arrangement that benefits both Britain and the EU. \u201cI think we have got to be a bit less timid and a lot less defeatist in our dealings with the EU.\u201d Johnson is unlikely to try using the same argument again - because it is not true. Under WTO trade rules, without a trade deal, the EU could not drop tariffs for meat imports from the UK without dropping them for everyone else. Thanks to tangerineblue in the comments for flagging this up. Here is a question from below the line that is worth addressing. The best explanation I\u2019ve read is this one, from the Beef and Lamb Matters blog. Here is an extract. A question we\u2019re often asked though is, \u2018if we\u2019re self sufficient, why does the UK import so much sheep meat?\u2019 The reasons are numerous and complex but can broadly split into four areas \u2013 historic, market, seasonal and economic. The UK has been importing New Zealand sheep meat for 130 years, with unrestricted imports until 1973 when the UK joined the European Economic Community (EEC). At the time, the UK was only circa 40 per cent self sufficient. To give it some context, prior to joining the EEC, the UK took the vast majority of New Zealand\u2019s lamb exports \u2013 86 per cent in 1970. Today the UK takes around 20 per cent and in 2012 China overtook the UK as the primary destination for New Zealand lamb. From 1972 to 1999, the UK sheep flock grew from 27.9 million head to 44.7 million head, with the UK\u2019s self sufficiency rate increasing to 95 per cent to coincide with increasing production. Increasing production drove rising UK export volumes and, despite a fall in the 2000s, today the UK exports around 100,000 tonnes. However, while the UK market is technically self-sufficient, it is not functionally self sufficient. The UK demands a larger volume of higher end cuts such as legs and chops, while UK exports consist mainly of carcases and a large proportion of low value cuts to emerging markets. Downing Street has just sent out the readout of Boris Johnson\u2019s call with Leo Varadkar, his Irish opposite number. Here it is in full. The taoiseach congratulated the prime minister on his appointment and both leaders underscored their commitment to working closely together in the spirit of the warm and deep relationship between the UK and Ireland. On the process of restoring the executive and assembly in Northern Ireland, both leaders expressed their determination to see this happen as quickly as possible. The prime minister said the ongoing talks have his unequivocal support and that he wanted to continue to work closely with the Irish government to help drive the process towards a successful conclusion. He said he looked forward to visiting Northern Ireland shortly and talking to the leaders of the five main parties about this. On Brexit, the prime minister made clear that the UK will be leaving the EU on October 31, no matter what. He said that in all scenarios, the government will be steadfast in its commitment to the Belfast agreement and will never put physical checks or physical infrastructure on the border. The prime minister made clear that the government will approach any negotiations which take place with determination and energy and in a spirit of friendship, and that his clear preference is to leave the EU with a deal, but it must be one that abolishes the backstop. The two leaders agreed to stay in contact. \u201cBoosterism\u201d may turn out to be a more accurate description of Boris Johnson\u2019s modus operandi than his team thought then they briefed the Daily Mail about it. See the update to my 11.39am post for more. This is from Mark Drakeford, the Labour first minister of Wales, who is meeting Boris Johnson later. Six days after becoming prime minister, Boris Johnson has finally spoken to Leo Vardakdar, his Irish opposite number and one of the most important EU leaders in the Brexit negotiations, the Irish Times\u2019s Denis Staunton reports. Yesterday Johnson was criticised for not already have spoken to the taoiseach. Sinn Fein\u2019s president, Mary Lou McDonald, has given a major speech in Belfast this morning on the subject of Brexit and Irish unity. You can read the full text here, but here are the main points. McDonald said there was increasing support for Irish unity in the north because of Brexit. She said: Political unionism has lost its electoral majority in a series of consecutive elections. The nationalist people of the north have turned their backs on Westminster and increasingly look to Dublin for leadership. Brexit has forced increasing numbers of people, from all backgrounds, to look south ... A growing number of people in the north, including many from a unionist background, are now considering their future in the context of Brexit. Many are now open to discussing the prospect of a new Ireland, an agreed Ireland and united Ireland. She said the Irish government should now start planning for the reunification of Ireland. She said: Last Friday an taoiseach told the MacGill summer school that the government would have to consider a forum on Irish unity in the event of a no deal Brexit. While the taoiseach has the responsibility to lead the debate on Irish Unity he should appoint an Irish government minister of state with the dedicated and specific responsibility of developing strategies to advance Irish unity and coordinating the government\u2019s all-Ireland policies. The government has to begin planning for unity. Creating the environment for the necessary conversation and discussion to take place. Looking at the steps needed to demonstrate that unity is in the best interest of all, economically viable, and welcoming for unionists, and all citizens. A forum which is open to all strands of political opinion on this island can only be a good initiative. She said the return of a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland would oblige the government to hold a referendum on Irish unity. Under the terms of the Good Friday agreement, the UK government is obliged to hold a referendum, or \u201cborder poll\u201d, if at any time it seems \u201clikely\u201d that a majority in the north would vote to form part of a united Ireland. McDonald said: If the British government have factored into their calculations a hard border, then they must factor in a unity referendum as laid out in the Good Friday agreement. The route back for the north into the EU is clear. Irish unity is the route back to the EU. We will be meeting Boris Johnston in the coming days. We will remind him not only of the need to respect the wishes of the majority to remain within the EU. We will also remind him of his obligations under the Good Friday and subsequent agreements including the provision for a unity referendum Brexit has re-exposed the folly of partition and reinforced the need for Irish unity. Sinn F\u00e9in makes no apology for promoting our vision of a united Ireland. She said that \u201clittle progress\u201d had been made in the talks on restoring the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland. She said there were three outstanding issues. The outstanding issues remain the outstanding issues. They are not intractable and do not give any section of the community a win over another section of the community. This is not a game in which a score is kept. Marriage equality for our LGBT brothers and sisters does not denigrate the rights of others to marry. Respecting the rights of Irish speakers does not diminish anyone\u2019s sense of Britishness. Resolving the past and promoting reconciliation is a threat to no one. This round of talks to restore the power sharing government have thus far failed to achieve agreement. This is because these key issues have not been faced up to yet. She said that introducing direct rule in Northern Ireland - something the government has not ruled out in the event of a no deal Brexit - would be \u201ca huge threat\u201d to all the people of the island of Ireland. She said there was no contradiction between having a functioning Northern Ireland executive and assembly and also planning for Irish reunification. And here is the BBC\u2019s Gareth Gordon on the speech. Here is Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, on the logic of the government\u2019s position on the likelihood of no deal. According to Jason Groves in the Daily Mail, Boris Johnson has not just an economic philosophy, but a word for it - \u201cboosterism\u201d. Groves explains it here: Senior Tories said the new prime minister had made it clear he wants \u2018rocket boosters\u2019 placed under the economy in the run up to Brexit, with a huge investment in infrastructure and an end to the tight austerity spending rules that have characterised the last decade. Senior City sources say that Mr Johnson\u2019s economic credo combines a Blairite enthusiasm for infrastructure spending, coupled with a Thatcherite belief in the power of tax cuts to stimulate the economy. One said: \u2018He was asked to explain his economic philosophy and said, in a word: Boosterism.\u2019 It sounds a bit like Reaganomics - combination of tax cuts and high spending, funded by increased borrowing. UPDATE: In the comments OldSynner says that \u201cboosterism\u201d already exists as a concept, at least according to Wikipedia. But Wikipedia suggests it is not something to be proud of. It says: During the expansion of the American and Canadian West, boosterism became epidemic as the leaders and owners of small towns made extravagant predictions for their settlement, in the hope of attracting more residents and, not coincidentally, inflating the prices of local real estate. Reminder: in his first speech to the Commons as PM last week, Johnson said his mission was to make the UK \u201cthe greatest place on earth\u201d. Labour did not respond when asked for a comment on Alastair Campbell\u2019s article yesterday. (See 11.21am.) But if you want to know what Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office think, you could do worse than read these tweets from Steve Howell, who worked for Corbyn as deputy communications director during the 2017 general election campaign. Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s former communications chief, has announced today that he no longer wants to be a member of the Labour party. He has explained why in a 3,000-word open letter to Jeremy Corbyn for the New European. There is a shorter version in the Guardian, and my colleague Rowena Mason has written it up here. As Campbell explains in his New European article, his conclusion that Labour is not in a position to win a general election with Corbyn as leader has been partly influenced by time he has spent in Australia, where Labour lost a general election earlier this year that it had been widely expected to win. Campbell writes: I fear the country may already have decided that it does not intend to make you prime minister. The importance of being clear and honest about that has been underlined to me talking to senior politicians in Australia, where the Labor party has recently lost an election it was almost universally expected to win against a failing, right-wing government. The data was there for all to see - Bill Shorten was not popular enough to win, the country had made up its mind. But the party failed to confront that truth, perhaps because Labor were polling well ahead of the government. Labour in the UK has no such excuse for denial. Both party standing and yours are nowhere near where they need to be, nor anywhere near where Bill Shorten\u2019s and Labor\u2019s were. In an interview on the Today programme this morning, Campbell said that he would not be joining the Liberal Democrats. \u201cI don\u2019t feel I\u2019m close to other parties, but I do think if we do get to a general election and the choice facing the country is Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn all sorts of things are going to happen because that is not a choice that this country finds remotely palatable,\u201d Campbell said. He said he did not know how he would vote at the next general election, but he said that Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, was his local MP, and he described Starmer as \u201ca good MP\u2019. Campbell also said that he wanted to support Labour, but that the party was no longer the one he had supported all his life. I don\u2019t ever want to vote anything but Labour. But this Labour party is not the Labour party of Clement Attlee, it is not the Labour party of Harold Wilson, it is not the Labour party of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. It has been taken over by people who until recently were communists, they were Stalinists, and they still are, in my view. And I think it\u2019s time to stop pretending, all of us, members, MPs, let\u2019s stop pretending that this is the Labour party that we really believe in. The Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor, Peter Foster, has a good Twitter thread that considers how realistic it is for the government to say that farmers can make up for the possible loss of access to the EU market by selling their produce to other countries abroad. It starts here. And here are two of his key tweets. On the Today programme this morning Alun Cairns, the Welsh secretary, stressed that the government was trying to avoid a no deal Brexit. He also said, after Brexit, there would be opportunities for farmers to sell their produce outside the EU. He explained: We are now looking to the growth that will come from right around the world, 90% of global growth will come from outside of the EU, but we don\u2019t want to close our back on the European market either and that\u2019s why working hard to get a deal is important, but of course there needs to be a shift in attitude and a positive response to the cause that we\u2019re making. But Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers\u2019 Union, said that the government should be doing more to open up opportunities for farmers. She told the programme: Government buying standards, government contracts at the moment - those are not based on British sourcing at all and they could be. We could look at and should be looking right now at opening up market opportunities in China, but that isn\u2019t happening. There\u2019s also opportunities in the United States that could be happening right now, but it isn\u2019t happening. The prospect of a no deal Brexit is also spooking the currency markets. As my colleague Jasper Jolly reports on the business live blog, renewed selling this morning has left the pound just a percent away from hitting a 34-year low. There is more on the blog here. Here is my colleague Rowena Mason\u2019s story on what Welsh farmers are saying to Boris Johnson ahead of his visit to the country later today. Recently Donald Trump spoke about his first phone call with Boris Johnson after Johnson became prime minister. His comments included this fascinating aside. We don\u2019t do the kind of trade we could do with - what some people say is Great Britain, and some people remember - a word you don\u2019t hear too much is England, which is a piece of it. It would be easy to put this down to simple US confusion about the name of the country that Johnson presides over (understandable confusion - it is not straightforward). But with Brexit posing perhaps the biggest threat to the preservation of the union of the United Kingdom for a century, perhaps Trump was being more prescient than he realised. It is not entirely impossible that, within a generation, England might be all that is left. In Northern Ireland the prospect of a no deal Brexit is making Irish reunification look more palatable to some than it has done for years, and Theresa May was so alarmed by this that she eventually concluded a no deal Brexit would be unacceptable. In Scotland the SNP believes that the combination of Brexit and a Johnson premiership could make a second independence referendum easier to win than the last one. Wales is a different prospect; unlike Scotland and Northern Ireland, it voted leave along with England. And in Wales even the nationalists are wary of independence - Plaid Cymru is more of a home rule party, with independence only a long-term goal. But even in Wales opinion is shifting. Recently the Labour first minister, Mark Drakeford, said that Wales\u2019s support for the union was not unconditional, and only yesterday an opinion poll put Plaid Cymru ahead in voting intention for the Welsh assembly for the first time ever. After his visit to Scotland yesterday, Johnson, who has given himself the title \u201cminister for the union\u201d alongside the title prime minister, is in Wales, and, according to a statement released by Number 10 overnight, he will tell Welsh farmers they have a bright future after Brexit. He will say: I will always back Britain\u2019s great farmers and as we leave the EU we need to make sure that Brexit works for them. That means scrapping the common agricultural policy and signing new trade deals \u2013 our amazing food and farming sector will be ready and waiting to continue selling ever more not just here but around the world. Once we leave the EU on 31 October, we will have a historic opportunity to introduce new schemes to support farming\u2013 and we will make sure that farmers gets a better deal. Brexit presents enormous opportunities for our country and it\u2019s time we looked to the future with pride and optimism. But not everyone is convinced. On the Today programme this morning Helen Roberts, a sheep farmer in Wales and a regional development officer for the National Sheep Association, said a no deal Brexit could lead to farmers in Wales blocking roads in protest. Echoing a comment made by the Farmers Union of Wales, which recently warned that a no deal Brexit could lead to \u201ccivil unrest\u201d, Roberts said a no deal Brexit would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for sheep farmers. She explained: At home we have got a flock of 450 ewes. We\u2019ve just started selling the lambs off them for this year. Come the end of October, that\u2019s when we will still be selling them. And to not have a market [because no deal would lead to the imposition of high tariffs by the EU] to sell them into just means there would be no future. Asked if she thought farmers would really take the fight onto the streets in the event of a no deal Brexit, Roberts replied: I think they will. I think it is time to stand up for ourselves and be counted. We produce the most wonderful product and we need to be able to sell it and continue farming and looking after the land, like we do best. Asked what she meant, and whether she was talking about the possibility of farmers blocking roads with tractors, Roberts said she would expect something like that in the event of a no deal Brexit. Johnson is in Wales this afternoon. And Jeremy Corbyn is also on a visit today. He is due to meet anti-fracking protesters at Cuadrilla\u2019s Preston New Road site. Otherwise the diary is fairly empty. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "A no-deal Brexit would endanger not only agriculture but rural life as a whole, the Welsh first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said he took very seriously the risk of civil unrest in the countryside if farmers\u2019 livelihoods were lost. Speaking to the Guardian during Boris Johnson\u2019s visit to Wales, Drakeford said: \u201cIt is a sector of the economy that has the capacity, if it feels sufficiently provoked, to carry out acts of civil disobedience.\u201d He said the Welsh countryside would be put under huge strain if there was no deal. \u201cWe\u2019re not simply talking about an economy here. We\u2019re talking about a whole way of life that has existed for centuries and which will be put at peril in a way that it has never been put at peril before.\u201d Drakeford said the Labour-led Welsh government had been pointing out for months that no deal would be catastrophic. \u201cWe are particularly exposed to some of the impacts of a no-deal Brexit,\u201d he said. \u201cManufacturing is a larger percentage of our economy than any other part of the United Kingdom and tariffs in a no deal will place enormous barriers in the path of our manufacturing industry.\u201d Drakeford noted the sheep industry had attracted headlines in the last few days and he also cited the shellfish industry, which he said could crash within weeks of a no-deal departure from the EU. The vast bulk of Welsh shellfish goes to the southern Mediterranean. \u201cWe have a very successful shellfish industry that has been built up over the last 20 years and more,\u201d he said. \u201cIt leaves fresh, it arrives fresh, there are no impediments to trade.

It was the most joyous day in golf\u2019s history; the wonderful denouement of the greatest tale ever told. Nothing at all had gone wrong at any point.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jul/16/theopen.golf5\">Golf: The Joy of Six: British Open memories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We all have different ways of dealing with grief, and this is mine. I\u2019m allowed my fantasy. You can\u2019t stop me. But even the greatest careers have to end. Last Sunday in the Senior Open, Watson played his last round of competitive golf, five weeks shy of turning 70. He had won his first Open at Carnoustie in 1975. Just a shame there was no valedictory birdie last weekend; he bogeyed his final three holes.</p> <p>Not quite the fairytale ending enjoyed by his friend and former foe Jack Nicklaus, who made birdie on 18 at St Andrews when stepping off the tour treadmill in 2005. But then Watson will always have the upper hand in the Duel in the Sun, so everybody goes home happy.</p> <p>Watson\u2019s longevity is worth celebrating, especially as no other sport allows the old-timers to compete at the top with folk less than half their age. Compare and contrast his antics of 2009 to other 1949 babies. Manchester United were not pairing Cristiano Ronaldo up front with Brian Kidd. Wladimir Klitschko was not trading blows with George Foreman. Jimmy Anderson never opened the bowling with Bob Willis. But Watson contested the same Open as Rory McIlroy, 39 years his junior. By the end of it he was 45 places better off.</p> <p>Watson was in the field thanks to the exemption he had earned for becoming the Champion Golfer all those years ago. Win the Open and you are guaranteed a spot until the age of 60. Win the Masters or the PGA and you are in for life. This tradition is one of the reasons championship golf has a unique flavour but it\u2019s under threat. When 47-year-old David Duval ran up 14 on the 7th at Portrush a fortnight ago, some suggested the hapless 2001 champion\u2019s spot would have been better awarded to first alternative Martin Kaymer. Given Duval also made triple and quadruple bogey on his way to 91, having previously played just four events all year, while Kaymer is 34 and a relatively recent PGA and US Open winner, it\u2019s tough to deny.</p> <p>Then again, Kaymer had all season to qualify, while Duval put in the hard yards years ago. This, for better or worse, was his reward. And ours. Purists may demur but there is something life-affirming in a former world No 1 hitting three balls off the tee, losing two then playing the wrong one, en route to a nonuple bogey. You would not want to witness it every week but it\u2019s reassuring to know golfageddon is not the preserve of the weekend hacker. Without his exemption, this yarn remains unspun.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Duval smashed the modern Open record of 11 for a single-hole meltdown. He was one shy of the all-time fiasco, the 15 made by the German amateur Herman Tissies in 1950 qualifying at Troon. Tissies went from bunker to bunker and back again on the par-three Postage Stamp, though he required only a single putt. A one-putt duodecuple bogey! You do not get many of those to the pound.</p> <p>But we digress. These things tend to be forgotten when single holes are played in nine over par but there had earlier been a frisson of excitement when Duval opened his ill-fated round with consecutive birdies. How lovely to see a long-forgotten favourite pop up unexpectedly on the leaderboard, even if they just hang about for a couple of hours on Thursday morning. Sandy Lyle was always good for this. Fred Couples too, though he took throwback thrills to the next level, playing in the final group of the 2006 Masters as a 46-year-old, then sharing the 36-hole lead in 2012 at 52 before tiring. Without exemptions, Greg Norman would never have led the 2008 Open after 54 holes as a 53-year-old, nor would a new generation have witnessed one of his trademark fourth-round implosions unfolding in real time before their horrified faces.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2011/jul/15/the-open-2011-golf-theopen\">The Open 2011: Tom Watson's hole in one - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are limits. The four-times winner Old Tom Morris teed it up at Muirfield in 1896, five days shy of his 75th birthday. He carded rounds of 101, 103 and 105 before withdrawing, never to compete in the Open again. But even septuagenarians can make a mark. In 1973 at Troon, the 71-year-old Gene Sarazen punched a five-iron into the Postage Stamp for a hole in one. The next day, the 1932 Open champion found a bunker, then splashed out for birdie. He had played a notoriously difficult hole twice, taking just three strokes, never once requiring the putter.</p> <p>Sarazen shot 79 and 81 that week, not bad for a senior dude. Coincidentally, his 36-hole total was exactly the same as the one he made there in 1923, when he struggled as a young man in high winds. One tinder-dry Troon member could not help himself, chiding the seven-times major champion: \u201cFifty years, Mr Sarazen, and you haven\u2019t improved a single shot.\u201d No, golf would not be the same without the old boys. Though on balance, Tom Watson has probably timed his exit perfectly.</p>",

Watson\u2019s longevity is worth celebrating, especially as no other sport allows the old-timers to compete at the top with folk less than half their age. Compare and contrast his antics of 2009 to other 1949 babies. Manchester United were not pairing Cristiano Ronaldo up front with Brian Kidd. Wladimir Klitschko was not trading blows with George Foreman. Jimmy Anderson never opened the bowling with Bob Willis. But Watson contested the same Open as Rory McIlroy, 39 years his junior. By the end of it he was 45 places better off. Watson was in the field thanks to the exemption he had earned for becoming the Champion Golfer all those years ago. Win the Open and you are guaranteed a spot until the age of 60. Win the Masters or the PGA and you are in for life. This tradition is one of the reasons championship golf has a unique flavour but it\u2019s under threat. When 47-year-old David Duval ran up 14 on the 7th at Portrush a fortnight ago, some suggested the hapless 2001 champion\u2019s spot would have been better awarded to first alternative Martin Kaymer. Given Duval also made triple and quadruple bogey on his way to 91, having previously played just four events all year, while Kaymer is 34 and a relatively recent PGA and US Open winner, it\u2019s tough to deny. Then again, Kaymer had all season to qualify, while Duval put in the hard yards years ago. This, for better or worse, was his reward. And ours. Purists may demur but there is something life-affirming in a former world No 1 hitting three balls off the tee, losing two then playing the wrong one, en route to a nonuple bogey. You would not want to witness it every week but it\u2019s reassuring to know golfageddon is not the preserve of the weekend hacker. Without his exemption, this yarn remains unspun. Duval smashed the modern Open record of 11 for a single-hole meltdown. He was one shy of the all-time fiasco, the 15 made by the German amateur Herman Tissies in 1950 qualifying at Troon. Tissies went from bunker to bunker and back again on the par-three Postage Stamp, though he required only a single putt. A one-putt duodecuple bogey! You do not get many of those to the pound. But we digress. These things tend to be forgotten when single holes are played in nine over par but there had earlier been a frisson of excitement when Duval opened his ill-fated round with consecutive birdies. How lovely to see a long-forgotten favourite pop up unexpectedly on the leaderboard, even if they just hang about for a couple of hours on Thursday morning. Sandy Lyle was always good for this. Fred Couples too, though he took throwback thrills to the next level, playing in the final group of the 2006 Masters as a 46-year-old, then sharing the 36-hole lead in 2012 at 52 before tiring. Without exemptions, Greg Norman would never have led the 2008 Open after 54 holes as a 53-year-old, nor would a new generation have witnessed one of his trademark fourth-round implosions unfolding in real time before their horrified faces. There are limits. The four-times winner Old Tom Morris teed it up at Muirfield in 1896, five days shy of his 75th birthday. He carded rounds of 101, 103 and 105 before withdrawing, never to compete in the Open again. But even septuagenarians can make a mark. In 1973 at Troon, the 71-year-old Gene Sarazen punched a five-iron into the Postage Stamp for a hole in one. The next day, the 1932 Open champion found a bunker, then splashed out for birdie. He had played a notoriously difficult hole twice, taking just three strokes, never once requiring the putter. Sarazen shot 79 and 81 that week, not bad for a senior dude. Coincidentally, his 36-hole total was exactly the same as the one he made there in 1923, when he struggled as a young man in high winds. One tinder-dry Troon member could not help himself, chiding the seven-times major champion: \u201cFifty years, Mr Sarazen, and you haven\u2019t improved a single shot.\u201d No, golf would not be the same without the old boys. Though on balance, Tom Watson has probably timed his exit perfectly.",

Beech is also a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/15/man-who-sparked-vip-abuse-ring-inquiry-is-paedophile-court-told\">convicted paedophile</a> having pleaded guilty to hoarding hundreds of indecent images in a separate case this year.</p> <p>After the guilty verdicts last Monday, the policing watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), announced it had cleared three officers involved in the police inquiry into Beech\u2019s claims.</p> <p>But in <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7298869/Nick-police-searches-broke-law-says-former-high-court-judge.html\">an article</a> for the Daily Mail, Henriques said \u201cthe course of justice was perverted with shocking consequences\u201d, adding: \u201cA criminal investigation must surely follow.\u201d</p> <p>Henriques\u2019s 2016 review of the Met\u2019s Operation Midland, which shut after 16 months without an arrest being made, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/08/operation-midland-riddled-with-met-police-errors-report-finds\">highlighted 43 separate failings</a> in the force\u2019s investigation.</p> <p>His review found that senior detectives fell for Beech\u2019s \u201cfalse allegations\u201d and then misled a judge to get warrants to search the homes of innocent members of the establishment, distressing them and their loved ones.</p> <p>Henriques said he stood by his findings, writing: \u201cI concluded in my review \u2013 and maintain the opinion \u2013 that the three search warrants authorising the searches of the homes of Lord Bramall, Lady Brittan and Harvey Proctor were obtained unlawfully.\u201d</p> <p>Proctor, who was falsely accused of child murder and rape by Beech, backed the call for a criminal investigation and described Henriques\u2019s intervention as a \u201cgamechanger\u201d.</p> <p>He told the Guardian: \u201cThe Metropolitan police are in the doghouse \u2026 No one but no one has been held responsible for the 43 errors that Sir Richard identified.\u201d</p> <p>Proctor called for Northumbria police \u2013 the force that carried out the investigation into Beech for perverting the course of justice \u2013 to be put in charge of a criminal investigation.</p> <p>He also urged the Home Office to set up a separate QC-led inquiry into Scotland Yard\u2019s handling of Operation Midland. The IOPC was \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d, he said, calling for the body to be replaced.</p> <p>Daniel Janner, the son of late Labour peer Greville Janner who was falsely accused of abuse by Beech, called for the IOPC report to be reopened \u201cwith a view as to whether or not former police officers were guilty of misfeasance in a public office in light of Sir Richard\u2019s comments\u201d.</p> <p>In his piece, Henriques said the warrant applications stated that Beech had remained consistent in his allegations when he had not. He said he was \u201cunable to conclude that every officer acted with due diligence and in good faith\u201d and claimed officers leading the inquiry were \u201cfully aware\u201d of six matters that undermined Beech\u2019s credibility but that they were not disclosed to the district judge who granted the warrants.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/22/how-nick-the-serial-child-abuse-accuser-became-the-accused\">Revealed: how Carl Beech, the serial child abuse accuser, became the accused</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI concluded in 2016 \u2013 and I remain of the view \u2013 that the officers responsible for the three applications did not in fact fully believe that there were reasonable grounds to believe Beech\u2019s allegations,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Henriques also expressed surprise that his review had not led to more serious consequences. \u201cKnowingly misleading a district judge is far more serious than mere misconduct. The IOPC should in my judgment have investigated whether a criminal act had been committed, and if so by whom,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>He also said there was no explanation from the IOPC \u201cas to why the two most senior officers were exonerated without interview\u201d.</p> <p>A Scotland Yard spokesman said: \u201cNone of the five officers involved in the original referral or the three officers subject to investigation [by the IOPC] were found to have cases to answer in relation to any of the allegations.</p> <p>\u201cNone of the officers involved in the allegations which were referred to the IOPC remain as serving MPS officers. They have either retired or moved to other jobs. The DS who retired as a police officer is employed in a civilian role by the MPS.\u201d</p> <p>The IOPC said it had conducted a careful assessment and concluded there was \u201cno suspicion of criminality\u201d. The watchdog spoke to Henriques as part of its investigation and took a formal statement from the retired judge. It has a full copy of his report, not the heavily edited version that was made public. </p> <p>It said it had no plans to reopen its investigation. </p> <p>A spokesman said: \u201cThe investigation did not identify any information to suggest that officers deliberately withheld evidence from the applications, with the intention of misleading the district judge.</p> <p>\u201cWe have acknowledged the delays in the investigation and are now in the process of preparing the final publication report, which we expect will be published in September.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Scotland Yard has come under renewed fire over its handling of a \u00a32.5m inquiry into false VIP paedophile ring allegations after a retired high court judge who reviewed the investigation said police broke the law. Sir Richard Henriques is calling for a criminal investigation after he said Metropolitan police officers \u201cunlawfully\u201d obtained search warrants by using false evidence to raid the homes of high-profile figures during their inquiry into Carl Beech\u2019s allegations. The retired judge, whose 2016 review found a catalogue of failings, said detectives described Beech as \u201cconsistent\u201d, misleading a judge into issuing search warrants to raid the homes of the D-Day veteran Edwin Bramall, the widow of the ex-home secretary Leon Brittan and the former Tory MP Harvey Proctor. Beech \u2013 known under the pseudonym \u201cNick\u201d \u2013 was jailed for 18 years last week after being found guilty of 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one of fraud following a 10-week trial. The 51-year-old had claimed an establishment group, including the former prime minister Sir Edward Heath, Lord Bramall, Lord Brittan, Proctor and others, abused, kidnapped, tortured and murdered boys in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The former nurse fled to Sweden and went on the run when his story unravelled. Beech is also a convicted paedophile having pleaded guilty to hoarding hundreds of indecent images in a separate case this year. After the guilty verdicts last Monday, the policing watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), announced it had cleared three officers involved in the police inquiry into Beech\u2019s claims. But in an article for the Daily Mail, Henriques said \u201cthe course of justice was perverted with shocking consequences\u201d, adding: \u201cA criminal investigation must surely follow.\u201d Henriques\u2019s 2016 review of the Met\u2019s Operation Midland, which shut after 16 months without an arrest being made, highlighted 43 separate failings in the force\u2019s investigation. His review found that senior detectives fell for Beech\u2019s \u201cfalse allegations\u201d and then misled a judge to get warrants to search the homes of innocent members of the establishment, distressing them and their loved ones. Henriques said he stood by his findings, writing: \u201cI concluded in my review \u2013 and maintain the opinion \u2013 that the three search warrants authorising the searches of the homes of Lord Bramall, Lady Brittan and Harvey Proctor were obtained unlawfully.\u201d Proctor, who was falsely accused of child murder and rape by Beech, backed the call for a criminal investigation and described Henriques\u2019s intervention as a \u201cgamechanger\u201d. He told the Guardian: \u201cThe Metropolitan police are in the doghouse \u2026 No one but no one has been held responsible for the 43 errors that Sir Richard identified.\u201d Proctor called for Northumbria police \u2013 the force that carried out the investigation into Beech for perverting the course of justice \u2013 to be put in charge of a criminal investigation. He also urged the Home Office to set up a separate QC-led inquiry into Scotland Yard\u2019s handling of Operation Midland. The IOPC was \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d, he said, calling for the body to be replaced. Daniel Janner, the son of late Labour peer Greville Janner who was falsely accused of abuse by Beech, called for the IOPC report to be reopened \u201cwith a view as to whether or not former police officers were guilty of misfeasance in a public office in light of Sir Richard\u2019s comments\u201d. In his piece, Henriques said the warrant applications stated that Beech had remained consistent in his allegations when he had not. He said he was \u201cunable to conclude that every officer acted with due diligence and in good faith\u201d and claimed officers leading the inquiry were \u201cfully aware\u201d of six matters that undermined Beech\u2019s credibility but that they were not disclosed to the district judge who granted the warrants. \u201cI concluded in 2016 \u2013 and I remain of the view \u2013 that the officers responsible for the three applications did not in fact fully believe that there were reasonable grounds to believe Beech\u2019s allegations,\u201d he said. Henriques also expressed surprise that his review had not led to more serious consequences. \u201cKnowingly misleading a district judge is far more serious than mere misconduct. The IOPC should in my judgment have investigated whether a criminal act had been committed, and if so by whom,\u201d he wrote. He also said there was no explanation from the IOPC \u201cas to why the two most senior officers were exonerated without interview\u201d. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: \u201cNone of the five officers involved in the original referral or the three officers subject to investigation [by the IOPC] were found to have cases to answer in relation to any of the allegations. \u201cNone of the officers involved in the allegations which were referred to the IOPC remain as serving MPS officers. They have either retired or moved to other jobs. The DS who retired as a police officer is employed in a civilian role by the MPS.\u201d The IOPC said it had conducted a careful assessment and concluded there was \u201cno suspicion of criminality\u201d. The watchdog spoke to Henriques as part of its investigation and took a formal statement from the retired judge. It has a full copy of his report, not the heavily edited version that was made public. It said it had no plans to reopen its investigation. A spokesman said: \u201cThe investigation did not identify any information to suggest that officers deliberately withheld evidence from the applications, with the intention of misleading the district judge. \u201cWe have acknowledged the delays in the investigation and are now in the process of preparing the final publication report, which we expect will be published in September.\u201d",

A similar ban in England on the supply of plastic straws, drinks stirrers and cotton buds will come into force in April.",

      "bodyText": "Your front-page report (Revealed: collapse in rape cases that end up in court, 27 July) was truly shocking and leads us to ask whether rape has effectively been decriminalised. Justice system leaders, including those at the top of the police, prosecution service and courts, must be pressed on your revelation that only one in every 65 rapes reported to the police now ends up in court. If they were school or hospital leaders they would surely be put into special measures and new management brought in. The government is already running a review into what is going wrong with investigating and prosecuting this crime.

The term was popularised after US social psychologists devised a way of measuring the prejudices that we are not necessarily aware of \u2013 the Implicit Association Test. They published a paper in 1998 claiming that their tool for measuring \"the unconscious roots of prejudice\" showed that 90-95% of people were susceptible.</p>\n    <p>While the reliability of that test is now contested, there is overwhelming wider evidence that unconscious bias seeps into decisions that affect recruitment, access to healthcare and outcomes in criminal justice in ways that can disadvantage black and minority ethnic people.

Another showed that white people perceived black faces as more threatening than white faces with the same expression.</p>\n    <p>While some of our biases may begin on an unconscious level, experts caution that the concept of unconscious bias should not absolve people of discriminatory behaviour. \u201cIf you\u2019re aware of these associations then you can bring to bear all of your critical skills and intelligence to see it\u2019s wrong to think like that,\u201d says Lasana Harris, a neuroscientist who studies prejudice and social learning at University College London. \u201cWe all have the ability to control that.\u201d<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Asked whether her research on chimpanzees had affected how she felt about people, Goodall said it had shown her humans had a lot of instincts, and inherited aggressive tendencies. \u201cThey\u2019re not learned.

A new deal seems increasingly unlikely given that Boris Johnson and his ministers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/29/johnson-refuses-to-meet-eu-leaders-unless-they-scrap-backstop\">have demanded terms</a> \u2013 scrapping the Irish backstop and an entirely new withdrawal deal \u2013 that have been repeatedly rejected by Brussels and would be hugely ambitious anyway given the 93-day deadline.</p> \n<h2>Could it be stopped?</h2> \n<p>It seems a majority of MPs still oppose a no-deal departure, as they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/13/mps-reject-no-deal-brexit-by-majority-of-four\">did in March</a>. It nonetheless remains unknown if the Commons can block Johnson if he is intent on such a Brexit, whether or not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/18/mps-pass-amendment-seeking-to-thwart-no-deal-prorogation\">proroguing parliament is possible</a>. MPs would need to create the circumstances for a binding vote and it is unclear how this might be done. It is worth noting here that some in Westminster see a government intent on no deal being blocked by parliament as Johnson\u2019s preferred scenario \u2013 allowing him to call an election as the self-styled champion of Brexit.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d492f6cf-1fda-46ad-a040-347be0393605\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>A cabinet reshuffle</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The first task of any new PM involves rewarding some loyal allies and disappointing more. Several Johnson loyalists have had their eye on the post of chancellor, but only one can do it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/24/boris-johnson-takes-his-revenge-and-sacks-over-half-the-cabinet\">A complete clearout of May\u2019s remain-minded ministers</a> provided plenty of opportunity to reward the Brexit believers though.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The issue that will define a Johnson premiership. He has promised to rapidly renegotiate almost all of May\u2019s departure deal, ditching the Irish backstop border guarantee policy \u2013 something that would seem a huge task over any timescale, let alone little more than 12 weeks, a fair proportion of which is taken up by a summer break. If this fails, he will be set on a no-deal departure for 31 October, and a likely huge clash with MPs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Iran</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>&nbsp;wasn\u2019t enough, a new Johnson government must immediately take steps to make sure he doesn\u2019t begin his time in No 10 with a slide into war. The situation in the gulf is complex, fast-moving and hugely dangerous. Johnson did not cover himself in glory as foreign secretary, especially over Iran. It will be his task to prove he has learned.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Managing parliament and Tory MPs</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Johnson will start as PM with a working Commons majority of four, thanks to the DUP, but within weeks it is likely to be down to three if as expected the Liberal Democrats win in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection. If this wasn\u2019t tricky enough, a small but significant section of Tory MPs openly detest Johnson, and will not want to help him out - and with his cabinet sackings, the \u2018Gaukward squad\u2019 of former senior cabinet members set on blocking a no-deal Brexit swelled in ranks.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Loosening the purse strings</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Such was the fiscal largesse on display from both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt during the hustings process that much as he will seek to kick any decisions towards an autumn budget, voters \u2013 especially Tory members \u2013 will be expecting both tax cuts and more spending on areas such as education and the police.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Everything non-Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This might sound glib, but there is a lot to consider \u2013 during the three-plus years of Brexit introversion May\u2019s government failed to properly grasp any of a series of long-term, pressing national problems: the crisis in social care; the future of the NHS; a climate emergency; the increasingly insecure future of work; a broken housing market; rampant poverty, including among many working people. This is a huge workload for any new administration.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Being prime ministerial</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Critics might say this is Johnson\u2019s single biggest challenge. The leadership process has shown that while he endlessly harked back to supposed successes as London mayor \u2013 an often ceremonial role with relatively few powers \u2013 Johnson was notably quieter about his period as foreign secretary.</p>\n    <p>Being prime minister is like the latter, to a factor of 10 \u2013 a never-ending succession of red boxes containing vital documents, of urgent briefings, of a whole system hanging on your decisions. Johnson has a tendency to ignore advice, pluck statistics out of the air and rely on sudden, cheap glibness. Curbing these long habits will be a daily struggle - his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jul/24/meet-the-new-dude-at-no-10-papers-greet-boris-johnsons-victory\">adopting the acronym 'Dude' in his victory speech</a> shows just how hard it is for him.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterwalker\"><b>Peter Walker</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Political correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>What does \u2018no deal\u2019 actually mean?</h2> \n<p>It would simply mean that at 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a \u201cthird country\u201d in terms of relations with the EU, with no post-Brexit plan in place, and no transition period.

Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p> \n<h2>What impact would there be?</h2> \n<p>To a great extent this is a leap in the dark, given the multiplicity of factors involved, but a number of sectors are deeply worried. With meat farming, there would be an immediate WTO 40% tariff on exports to the EU, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/30/stop-playing-russian-roulette-sheep-industry-johnson-told\">which could instantly wipe out</a> many farming businesses.

For individuals, there are concerns about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/18/revealed-uk-patients-stockpile-drugs-in-fear-of-no-deal-brexit\">supplies of medicines</a>, and the potential that travellers to the EU might need to go through extra checks. Essentially, for both businesses and individuals, the potential list of impact is very long and cannot be completely predicted.</p> \n<h2>What mitigation measures are in place?</h2> \n<p>The government began <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-governments-preparations-for-a-no-deal-scenario/uk-governments-preparations-for-a-no-deal-scenario\">preparing for possible no</a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-governments-preparations-for-a-no-deal-scenario/uk-governments-preparations-for-a-no-deal-scenario\"> deal</a> ahead of the original Brexit deadline in March, passing legislation to cover areas such as nuclear material, money laundering and road haulage, and moving thousands of civil servants to make no-deal plans. While some warn that the government is still less prepared for an October no deal, planning has been stepped up under Johnson, with Michael Gove handed a cross-government cabinet role <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/28/michael-gove-government-operating-on-assumption-of-no-deal-brexit\">to lead on this</a>, complete with a select cabinet sub-committee.

The premise is simple: 100 empty-handed players are dropped onto a virtual island and fight to be the last person standing. Simple to learn, difficult to master.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"12da897b-2587-4cf0-a974-48466c48a579\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is Fortnite: Battle Royale</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In short, it's a mass online brawl where 100 players leap out of a flying bus on to a small island and then fight until only one is left. Hidden around are weapons and traps, and players must arm themselves while exploring.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>When was it released?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Fortnite started in July 2017 as a four-player cooperative survival game, but the game's developer, Epic, noticed the huge success of PC title PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG), which pits 100 players against each other, and decided to release a new version.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The game is free and players are able to unlock new items as they progress without paying anything. A Premium Battle Pass gives access to exclusive clothing and items.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is it so popular with kids?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>It's free, it's fun, and it has a very silly, offbeat sense of humour. While PUBG has a serious, realistic visual style, Fortnite: Battle Royale has very bright, almost cartoon-like graphics, as well as loads of ridiculous items and costumes, such as space suits and dinosaur outfits. Players can pull a variety of dance moves, and team up with a friend to compete as a duo or a squad. Participants can chat as they play using headsets and microphones.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there violence? And is it addictive?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Although Fortnite is a multiplayer shooter, it does not depict bloody violence. It takes lots of enjoyable gameplay concepts from more mature shooting games but places them in a non-threatening, non-realistic world. In terms of addictiveness, Fortnite contains nothing that makes it different from other action video games. It's more that the game contains many different elements \u2013 nice visuals, good shooting mechanics, an interesting building component and lots of support and interest from YouTubers \u2013 into one package that is free to download.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>About 40 million of Fortnite\u2019s more than 250 million registered players competed in online qualifying over 10 weeks for the opportunity to come to New York. The 200 finalists (average age: 16) hailed from 34 different countries.</p> \n<p>The open format meant that some of the game\u2019s most famous players, like <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ninja-tyler-blevins-twitch-subscribers-fortnite-drake-youtube-2018-3\">Twitch megastar Tyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins</a>, failed to qualify for Sunday\u2019s solo finals. The 28-year-old from Detroit instead settled for a spot in Friday\u2019s pro-am, a nod to the game\u2019s democratic and sometimes random underpinnings.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was invite-only before, but I do like that the World Cup is open qualifiers,\u201d said Aydan Conrad, a 20-year-old from Ohio who competes for Ghost Gaming. \u201cTechnically, everyone has a chance, and I really like that. I\u2019ve never even met half of the people who qualified here, and it\u2019s cool that they get the chance to come here and make at least $50,000.

The players manned their stations on a state-of-the art two-storey playing stage with screens depicting each player\u2019s view in the game.</p> \n<p>Wall-to-wall color commentary of was broadcast on Fortnite.com, YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, Mixer and Caffeine. Some of the platforms allowed viewers to focus on their preferred player. The telecast featured all the hallmarks of a major sporting event: breathless announcers, splashy graphics, soft-focus profiles of the competitors that wouldn\u2019t feel out of place in NBC\u2019s Olympics coverage.</p> \n<p>Stuart Saw, the head of esports at the sports and entertainment company Endeavor who headed the event logistics, said the number of feeds going into the production truck was twice that of the Super Bowl with several dozen in-arena and in-game cameras in addition to the individual displays for each of the 100 players.</p> \n<p>The biggest names on the Fortnite circuit are global celebrities, teenage millionaires with social-media followings rivaling the world\u2019s most famous athletes. You may not have heard of 21-year-old Turner \u201cTfue\u201d Tenney, but your niece probably has.

I ended up making $10,000 and it was a really great moment.\u201d</p> \n<p>That esports are big business is hardly news, but the splashy investment figures of the last decade have not always resonated with sports fans older than, say, 25. And yet esports have already been confirmed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/apr/18/esports-to-be-medal-sport-at-2022-asian-games\">as a medal sport for the 2022 Asian Games</a>. Addition to the Olympic program would seem inevitable, though some in the industry say the esports doesn\u2019t need the IOC as much as the other way around \u2013 and a reluctance to surrender its autonomy, and authenticity, could pose a formidable obstacle.</p> \n<p>The communal passion throughout the weekend was palpable. The doors for Sunday\u2019s solos final opened at 9.30am, but fans were lined up as early as 6am for limited-edition special codes redeemable for rare items that could be used in the game.

      "bodyText": "Nearly all established sports are going through some degree of hand-wringing over attracting younger fans as their older core ages out. The death of monoculture and explosion of entertainment options, many accessible without leaving one\u2019s bedroom, have seen attendance drops across the board. MLB and NFL teams have fallen over themselves installing on-site daily fantasy lounges to lure second-screeners. Even the hidebound International Olympic Committee has made transparent plays for youth, most recently with the addition of skateboarding, surfing and three-on-three basketball to next year\u2019s Summer Olympics in Tokyo. The demographic they\u2019re so thirsty for could be found in droves over the weekend at New York\u2019s Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, where three days of sold-out crowds turned out for the biggest video game competition of all time \u2013 the Fortnite World Cup \u2013 where a 16-year-old from Pennsylvania named Kyle Giersdorf (aka Bugha) brought home the winner\u2019s share of $3m with a dominant performance in Sunday\u2019s solos competition. It was the climax of a three-day marathon that saw a staggering $30m in prize money doled out. A walk around the sprawling grounds where the US Open will take place next month raised a pressing question: not whether esports is the future of sports entertainment, but whether there\u2019s any possible scenario where it\u2019s not. Fortnite, the free-to-play sensation published by Epic Games in 2017, is a crossover phenomenon that raked in $2.4bn in revenue last year alone, transcending gaming into the mainstream in ways few titles have managed. The premise is simple: 100 empty-handed players are dropped onto a virtual island and fight to be the last person standing. Simple to learn, difficult to master. About 40 million of Fortnite\u2019s more than 250 million registered players competed in online qualifying over 10 weeks for the opportunity to come to New York. The 200 finalists (average age: 16) hailed from 34 different countries. The open format meant that some of the game\u2019s most famous players, like Twitch megastar Tyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins, failed to qualify for Sunday\u2019s solo finals. The 28-year-old from Detroit instead settled for a spot in Friday\u2019s pro-am, a nod to the game\u2019s democratic and sometimes random underpinnings. \u201cIt was invite-only before, but I do like that the World Cup is open qualifiers,\u201d said Aydan Conrad, a 20-year-old from Ohio who competes for Ghost Gaming. \u201cTechnically, everyone has a chance, and I really like that. I\u2019ve never even met half of the people who qualified here, and it\u2019s cool that they get the chance to come here and make at least $50,000. Some of these kids are 13 or 14, so that\u2019s pretty nice.\u201d The three-day World Cup finals consisted of a creative competition and pro-am on Friday and the duos competition on Saturday and the singles championship on Sunday. The players manned their stations on a state-of-the art two-storey playing stage with screens depicting each player\u2019s view in the game. Wall-to-wall color commentary of was broadcast on Fortnite.com, YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, Mixer and Caffeine. Some of the platforms allowed viewers to focus on their preferred player. The telecast featured all the hallmarks of a major sporting event: breathless announcers, splashy graphics, soft-focus profiles of the competitors that wouldn\u2019t feel out of place in NBC\u2019s Olympics coverage. Stuart Saw, the head of esports at the sports and entertainment company Endeavor who headed the event logistics, said the number of feeds going into the production truck was twice that of the Super Bowl with several dozen in-arena and in-game cameras in addition to the individual displays for each of the 100 players. The biggest names on the Fortnite circuit are global celebrities, teenage millionaires with social-media followings rivaling the world\u2019s most famous athletes. You may not have heard of 21-year-old Turner \u201cTfue\u201d Tenney, but your niece probably has. It\u2019s a generational disconnect that even the biggest stars reflect on. \u201cAfter high school, my dad didn\u2019t make me get a job right away and decided to give me a year to try and make a career out of this,\u201d Conrad said. \u201cI told him, \u2018Dad, if I make what you make in a year, then I get to keep going.\u2019 And then I made that in like, a month. I remember I played the second actual money tournament for Fortnite from home, and my dad was right with me while I was streaming. I ended up making $10,000 and it was a really great moment.\u201d That esports are big business is hardly news, but the splashy investment figures of the last decade have not always resonated with sports fans older than, say, 25. And yet esports have already been confirmed as a medal sport for the 2022 Asian Games. Addition to the Olympic program would seem inevitable, though some in the industry say the esports doesn\u2019t need the IOC as much as the other way around \u2013 and a reluctance to surrender its autonomy, and authenticity, could pose a formidable obstacle. The communal passion throughout the weekend was palpable. The doors for Sunday\u2019s solos final opened at 9.30am, but fans were lined up as early as 6am for limited-edition special codes redeemable for rare items that could be used in the game. The expansive 46\u00bd-acre property of the National Tennis Center allowed Epic Games to transform the venue into an immersive fan festival with DJ booths, carnival-style games and a zipline that saw fans queued up for hours. The masses filed into the stadium just after midday on Sunday for a concert by DJ Marshmello followed by the hotly anticipated solos final, which consisted of six matches scored on a point-based system that combined placement and number of eliminations to incentivize more active play. Bugha\u2019s $3m check was not the only life-changing windfall of the day. Psalm earned $1.8m for second, Epikwhale won $1.2m for third and Kreo brought in $1.05m for fourth. The 25th through 100th place finishers took home the princely sum of $50,000 apiece just for showing up, roughly the same as a first-round loser at next month\u2019s US Open. Yet a common refrain among many of the players was that money was secondary to the experience \u2013 and the life lesson of the pastime that connects them. \u201cI think there\u2019s something to be said about not just Fortnite, but competitive gaming in general in terms of what it can teach people,\u201d said Sam \u201cTwizz\u201d Pearson, a 23-year-old from New Zealand. \u201cYou see that in some of the younger players here not only in the hard work and dedication that they put in, but in their time management. There\u2019s a balance to keep of how much time you spend playing the game, reviewing your game, and working on your skills outside of the game. \u201cAnother thing is communication. It\u2019s very important to have really good communication skills when you want to work with someone and play in duos. These kinds of skills, as well as knowing that you will make mistakes and being accepting of them, will help you take the ego out of your game and analyze things from an outside point of view.

      "body": "<p>When Stephen Hawking wanted to speak, he chose letters and words from a synthesiser screen controlled by twitches of a muscle in his cheek.</p> <p>But the painstaking process the cosmologist used might soon be bound for the dustbin. With a radical new approach, doctors have found a way to extract a person\u2019s speech directly from their brain.</p> <p>The breakthrough is the first to demonstrate how a person\u2019s intention to say specific words can be gleaned from brain signals and turned into text fast enough to keep pace with natural conversation.</p> <p>In its current form, the brain-reading software works only for stock sentences it has been trained on, but scientists believe it is a stepping stone towards a more powerful system that can decode in real time the words a person intends to say.</p> <p>Doctors at the University of California in San Francisco took on the challenge in the hope of creating a product that allows paralysed people to communicate more fluidly than using existing devices that pick up eye movements and muscle twitches to control a virtual keyboard.</p> <p>\u201cTo date there is no speech prosthetic system that allows users to have interactions on the rapid timescale of a human conversation,\u201d said Edward Chang, a neurosurgeon and lead researcher on the study published in the journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10994-4\">Nature Communications</a>.</p> <p>The work, funded by Facebook, was possible thanks to three epilepsy patients who were about to have neurosurgery for their condition. Before their operations went ahead, all three had a small patch of tiny electrodes placed directly on the brain for at least a week to map the origins of their seizures.</p> <p>During their stay in hospital, the patients, all of whom could speak normally, agreed to take part in Chang\u2019s research. He used the electrodes to record brain activity while each patient was asked nine set questions and asked to read a list of 24 potential responses.</p> <p>With the recordings in hand, Chang and his team built computer models that learned to match particular patterns of brain activity to the questions the patients heard and the answers they spoke. Once trained, the software could identify almost instantly, and from brain signals alone, what question a patient heard and what response they gave, with an accuracy of 76% and 61% respectively.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the first time this approach has been used to identify spoken words and phrases,\u201d said David Moses, a researcher on the team. \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that we achieved this using a very limited vocabulary, but in future studies we hope to increase the flexibility as well as the accuracy of what we can translate.\u201d</p> <p>Though rudimentary, the system allowed patients to answer questions about the music they liked; how well they were feeling; whether their room was too hot or cold, or too bright or dark; and when they would like to be checked on again.</p> <p>Despite the breakthrough, there are hurdles ahead. One challenge is to improve the software so it can translate brain signals into more varied speech on the fly. This will require algorithms trained on a huge amount of spoken language and corresponding brain signal data, which may vary from patient to patient.</p> <p>Another goal is to read \u201cimagined speech\u201d, or sentences spoken in the mind. At the moment, the system detects brain signals that are sent to move the lips, tongue, jaw and larynx \u2013 in other words, the machinery of speech.

      "bodyText": "When Stephen Hawking wanted to speak, he chose letters and words from a synthesiser screen controlled by twitches of a muscle in his cheek. But the painstaking process the cosmologist used might soon be bound for the dustbin. With a radical new approach, doctors have found a way to extract a person\u2019s speech directly from their brain. The breakthrough is the first to demonstrate how a person\u2019s intention to say specific words can be gleaned from brain signals and turned into text fast enough to keep pace with natural conversation. In its current form, the brain-reading software works only for stock sentences it has been trained on, but scientists believe it is a stepping stone towards a more powerful system that can decode in real time the words a person intends to say. Doctors at the University of California in San Francisco took on the challenge in the hope of creating a product that allows paralysed people to communicate more fluidly than using existing devices that pick up eye movements and muscle twitches to control a virtual keyboard. \u201cTo date there is no speech prosthetic system that allows users to have interactions on the rapid timescale of a human conversation,\u201d said Edward Chang, a neurosurgeon and lead researcher on the study published in the journal Nature Communications. The work, funded by Facebook, was possible thanks to three epilepsy patients who were about to have neurosurgery for their condition. Before their operations went ahead, all three had a small patch of tiny electrodes placed directly on the brain for at least a week to map the origins of their seizures. During their stay in hospital, the patients, all of whom could speak normally, agreed to take part in Chang\u2019s research. He used the electrodes to record brain activity while each patient was asked nine set questions and asked to read a list of 24 potential responses. With the recordings in hand, Chang and his team built computer models that learned to match particular patterns of brain activity to the questions the patients heard and the answers they spoke. Once trained, the software could identify almost instantly, and from brain signals alone, what question a patient heard and what response they gave, with an accuracy of 76% and 61% respectively. \u201cThis is the first time this approach has been used to identify spoken words and phrases,\u201d said David Moses, a researcher on the team. \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that we achieved this using a very limited vocabulary, but in future studies we hope to increase the flexibility as well as the accuracy of what we can translate.\u201d Though rudimentary, the system allowed patients to answer questions about the music they liked; how well they were feeling; whether their room was too hot or cold, or too bright or dark; and when they would like to be checked on again. Despite the breakthrough, there are hurdles ahead. One challenge is to improve the software so it can translate brain signals into more varied speech on the fly. This will require algorithms trained on a huge amount of spoken language and corresponding brain signal data, which may vary from patient to patient. Another goal is to read \u201cimagined speech\u201d, or sentences spoken in the mind. At the moment, the system detects brain signals that are sent to move the lips, tongue, jaw and larynx \u2013 in other words, the machinery of speech. But for some patients these signals may not suffice, and more sophisticated ways of reading sentences in the brain will be needed. While the work is still in its infancy, Winston Chiong, a neuroethicist at UCSF who was not involved in the latest study, said it was important to debate the ethical issues such systems might raise in the future. For example, could a \u201cspeech neuroprosthesis\u201d unintentionally reveal people\u2019s private thoughts? Chang said that decoding what someone was trying to say was hard enough, and that extracting their inner thoughts was virtually impossible. His device only works thoughts are turned into signals to drive muscles involved in speech. \u201cI have no interest in developing a technology to find out what people are thinking, even if it were possible,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if someone wants to communicate and can\u2019t, I think we have a responsibility as scientists and clinicians to restore that most fundamental human ability.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "ZE PLAYFUL ONE Ze Roberto. Ze Elias. Anyone know any other famous Zes, once well respected for their work across Europe and beyond but now long since put out to pasture? It\u2019s a question The Fiver has long wrestled with but there\u2019s now a new sheriff in town. Welcome Ze. Jos\u00e9. JoZ\u00e9 Mourinho. He wants to get back into football management and he\u2019s ready to have at it like a kid in a sweetshop. \u201c\u2018Ze\u2019 is full of fire,\u201d cheered, er, Mourinho, who has adopted his childhood nickname in order to rediscover some of the old magic. It\u2019s not quite Robin van Persie\u2019s \u201clittle boy inside me\u201d but it does suggest even the Lowry\u2019s grumpiest ex-resident has a playful little goblin just waiting to spring out. Sorry: we mean playful little Wichtelm\u00e4nnchen. Our guy Ze has started learning German in the hope of satisfying his wanderlust \u2013 or fernweh as he\u2019d call it \u2013 and perhaps landing a plum Bundesliga role. The phone hasn\u2019t rung yet though, certainly not from anyone connected to Bayern Munich or Borussia Dortmund, so he\u2019s waiting it out and hoping a big hitter from one of the top five leagues fancies a bit of playful fun. If there was a Tinder for football managers then Ze would be working his way through the bios, having tried \u201cSpecial One\u201d and then, with unseemly haste, realising \u201cHappy One\u201d didn\u2019t quite bring in the matches he wanted. Keeping things simple and reminding everyone that, at heart, he\u2019s just a big wide-eyed kid smacks slightly of a mid-life crisis and might put off the club-next-door types, but there\u2019s every chance someone \u2013 maybe a glamour kid from the Paris area? \u2013 might eventually be impressed by a flashy name. \u201cI have to be patient and wait for the right one and the right one is at the dimension of what I am as a manager,\u201d he purred, clearing that all up for us. What Ze really needs is a wormhole into a dimension where he is still relevant; a time before PES 2020 cover star Scott McTominay and the RT rouble became his closest friends. \u201cI have to be patient and this is the most difficult thing,\u201d he continued, closely mirroring how the Old Trafford faithful felt about the wait for a dynamic performance or two throughout most of his tenure. At 56, Mourinho will surely work again. All he needs, while everyone else goes back to school and little Ze stays up in his room, is a demonstration of freundschaftsbeziehungen from a suitor or two. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cEven if you can say good morning and good afternoon, 1-0, 2-0, that was a corner, should have had a free-kick, little things like that will endear you to the people \u2026 it\u2019s not gone down well at all here in Spain and it saddens me\u201d \u2013 John Toshack reveals how Gareth Bale could have been adored in Madrid if only he knew how to scream for a set-piece in the native tongue.

It is easy, in the age of \u201cpeak content\u201d, when TV appears close to offering something for everyone, to forget how revolutionary it was when it first appeared in 2013. Kohan took a prison memoir by <a href=\"https://piperkerman.com/\">Piper Kerman</a> and turned it into an ambitious comedy-drama about incarcerated women. It told us rich stories of poor women, rich women, straight women, gay women, trans women, black, white and Latino women. Its cast, unable to locate the mythical makeup store to which most TV prisoners seem to have secret access, were careful to look the part. The show seethed about injustice, but its comic touch meant it rarely, if ever, tipped into agitprop.</p> <p>When it started, it was only the third series Netflix had ever made, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/house-of-cards\">House of Cards</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/10/netflix-hemlock-grove-eli-roth\">Hemlock Grove</a>. Kohan had just finished working on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/30/when-good-tv-turns-bad-weeds\">Weeds</a>, the suburbs-skewering show about a drug-dealing housewife that had been transformative in its own way, but HBO and Showtime both declined OITNB. \u201cI was pissed Showtime didn\u2019t pick it up,\u201d says Kohan. \u201cI had just given them eight years of a show. What do you mean, you won\u2019t do my next project?\u201d But Netflix greenlit a whole season, without the traditional testing ground of a pilot. \u201cGod bless Netflix.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e03dc5c122af6613dc6c353f9041787a4efd162a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e03dc5c122af6613dc6c353f9041787a4efd162a/0_0_1912_3000/637.jpg\" alt=\"Will Smith Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, on which Kohan worked as a write.r\" width=\"637\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will Smith in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, on which Kohan worked as a writer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Streaming was in its infancy then, and the idea of Emmy nominations for anything you couldn\u2019t watch on an actual television was unimaginable. But Kohan swiftly realised that the real shift was the advent of binge-watching. \u201cI was, and remain, somewhat conflicted about that,\u201d she says. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s completely hypocritical, because I indulge in it!\u201d She binge-watched Fleabag recently (\u201cShe did a wonderful job \u2013 it\u2019s great\u201d), but she has always been motivated by the idea of bringing people together: \u201cWhen shows came out at the same time for everyone, they could make these connections. I mean, look what happened with Game of Thrones.\u201d</p> <p>Even so, binge-watching is here to stay. \u201cI can lament the water-cooler conversation not happening, but you know, we cannot put the genie back in the bottle.\u201d Hang on: isn\u2019t OITNB, and therefore she, at least a little to blame? \u201cI\u2019m not taking personal responsibility!\u201d she protests. \u201cIt\u2019s the streaming services\u2019 fault.\u201d</p> <p>Kohan, 50, grew up in Los Angeles.

      "bodyText": "Deep into the new and final season of Orange Is the New Black, the groundbreaking Netflix show about life in a women\u2019s prison, a character slumps in front of her TV, engrossed in Love Island. \u201cI got obsessed with it,\u201d explains Jenji Kohan, the woman who has been at the helm of OITNB for the last six years. \u201cA friend who is British introduced it to my life last year, and I got unhealthily involved.\u201d And so she wrote it into her series, giving her obsession to one of the characters, where it appears in the background like a branded water bottle. Kohan does very few interviews \u2013 \u201cI chose to be a writer for a reason. I don\u2019t particularly want to be in front of the camera, so to speak\u201d \u2013 but she is funny, dry-witted and very frank. So much so that she ends our conversation with a wistful: \u201cI hope I didn\u2019t say stupid things that will bite me in the ass later.\u201d After seven seasons, Orange Is the New Black is bowing out. It is easy, in the age of \u201cpeak content\u201d, when TV appears close to offering something for everyone, to forget how revolutionary it was when it first appeared in 2013. Kohan took a prison memoir by Piper Kerman and turned it into an ambitious comedy-drama about incarcerated women. It told us rich stories of poor women, rich women, straight women, gay women, trans women, black, white and Latino women. Its cast, unable to locate the mythical makeup store to which most TV prisoners seem to have secret access, were careful to look the part. The show seethed about injustice, but its comic touch meant it rarely, if ever, tipped into agitprop. When it started, it was only the third series Netflix had ever made, after House of Cards and Hemlock Grove. Kohan had just finished working on Weeds, the suburbs-skewering show about a drug-dealing housewife that had been transformative in its own way, but HBO and Showtime both declined OITNB. \u201cI was pissed Showtime didn\u2019t pick it up,\u201d says Kohan. \u201cI had just given them eight years of a show. What do you mean, you won\u2019t do my next project?\u201d But Netflix greenlit a whole season, without the traditional testing ground of a pilot. \u201cGod bless Netflix.\u201d Streaming was in its infancy then, and the idea of Emmy nominations for anything you couldn\u2019t watch on an actual television was unimaginable. But Kohan swiftly realised that the real shift was the advent of binge-watching. \u201cI was, and remain, somewhat conflicted about that,\u201d she says. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s completely hypocritical, because I indulge in it!\u201d She binge-watched Fleabag recently (\u201cShe did a wonderful job \u2013 it\u2019s great\u201d), but she has always been motivated by the idea of bringing people together: \u201cWhen shows came out at the same time for everyone, they could make these connections. I mean, look what happened with Game of Thrones.\u201d Even so, binge-watching is here to stay. \u201cI can lament the water-cooler conversation not happening, but you know, we cannot put the genie back in the bottle.\u201d Hang on: isn\u2019t OITNB, and therefore she, at least a little to blame? \u201cI\u2019m not taking personal responsibility!\u201d she protests. \u201cIt\u2019s the streaming services\u2019 fault.\u201d Kohan, 50, grew up in Los Angeles. Her father, Buz, is a TV writer and producer of variety shows; her mother, Rhea, is a writer and actor, and her older brother, David, created Will &amp; Grace. It seemed pre-ordained that Kohan would be a writer, too, but she has previously called her first job \u2013 in the writers\u2019 room of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air in the early 90s \u2013 \u201ca rough and fascinating entrance into the business\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Thirty-two years after riding the first winner of his career at Goodwood in June 1987, Frankie Dettori moved a step closer to completing his best season at the sport\u2019s highest level when Stradivarius took the Group One Goodwood Cup for the third year running here on Tuesday. Dettori has ridden 10 Group One winners in 2019 \u2013 since 31 May, in fact \u2013 and his 2001 total of 16 Group and Grade One victories, set at the high-water mark of his Godolphin days, is now within sight. After the high drama of Enable\u2019s head-to-head with Crystal Ocean in Saturday\u2019s King George, Stradivarius provided Dettori with a relatively straightforward success. The five-year-old rarely wins by more than a length, and had just a neck to spare over Dee Ex Bee here after Dettori, by his own admission, started his celebrations \u201ca stride too soon\u201d. As he also pointed out, though, \u201ceveryone was panicking but I\u2019ve been here before, so I know exactly where the winning post is.\u201d Dettori has another ride on a Group One favourite in Wednesday\u2019s Sussex Stakes and has already won as many top-tier events this year as he has in any season since 2007. And he is racking up the big-race wins at the age of 48, seven years after his career appeared to be in irreversible decline when he was banned for six months for testing positive for cocaine. \u201c[Enable and Stradivarius] are the two most popular and precious horses that we\u2019ve got in training in England,\u201d Dettori said. \u201cStradivarius wastes very little energy and he\u2019s very tough mentally. He\u2019s never going to be flash and win by 10 but he gets the job done. All I have to do is put him in the place to win the race and he does the rest, he\u2019s a perfect partner. \u201cIt\u2019s important for the public to have a horse who stays in training for so long and keeps on delivering, and with Stradivarius you know what to expect. You\u2019re going to get a fight and that\u2019s why people latched on to him and love him so much. \u201cEveryone keeps saying, what a great run you\u2019re having, but it\u2019s Clarehaven [Stables] that\u2019s having a great run. I work for a great trainer in John Gosden, he puts it on a plate for me. I just have to do my job, he should have all the credit.\u201d Stradivarius may not get the chance to add any further Group Ones to Dettori\u2019s tally this year as both the Lonsdale Stakes at York next month and the Long Distance Cup on Champions Day in October are Group Twos. Victory in the Lonsdale, though, would secure a \u00a31m bonus \u2013 the Stayers\u2019 Million \u2013 for the second year running and the best news for the chestnut\u2019s many fans is that Bjorn Nielsen, Stradivarius\u2019s owner and breeder, is planning to keep him in training at six. Pinatubo had a strong claim to be the best two-year-old to race in Europe this year as he went to post for the Group Two Vintage Stakes. His case is unanswerable after he showed instant and sustained acceleration to power five lengths clear of a useful field. \u201cYou really can\u2019t get excited watching him in the mornings but in the afternoons there\u2019s no doubt about it, he excites you,\u201d Charlie Appleby, Pinatubo\u2019s trainer, said. \u201cAs James [Doyle, his rider] said, he just wheeled him out there and as soon as he did he came on the bridle and wanted to go forward. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that acceleration on his last three starts now. Going forward, we\u2019d spoken about it before [Tuesday\u2019s race] and thought the [Group One] National Stakes [at The Curragh in September] would be a likely target.\u201d Pinatubo was as big as 12-1 for next year\u2019s 2,000 Guineas on Tuesday morning but is now top-priced at 7-2 in a market which, unusually for this stage of the season, does not include a colt from Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s stable at shorter than 14-1.",

      "bodyText": "Messrs Trump and Johnson have both moved markets today with their respective central concerns: trade with China and Brexit. US stock markets have caught a cold from Donald Trump\u2019s latest Twitter outburst, which suggests that his patience with negotiations with China is wearing thin. Investors had not been betting that the two days of trade talks currently happening in Shanghai would reach a resolution, but some had hoped for the groundwork for more detailed talks could be laid. That hope now appears to be forlorn. Trump\u2019s criticisms of China will form the backdrop tomorrow for the Federal Reserve, which is expected to cut interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis \u2013 partly because of the risks to growth from the trade war. On the British side of the pond, new Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s insistence that the EU must ditch the backstop (an insurance policy to avoid a hard Irish border) if there is to be a deal. That pushed sterling to a 28-month low against the US dollar. Sterling has become \u201cincreasingly politicised\u201d because of Brexit, becoming more sensitive to news from Westminster and Brussels than the economic fundamentals, according to Peter Dixon, senior economist at Commerzbank. For all the words of warning from politicians, economists and central bankers of the dangers of a no-deal Brexit, the market judgement comes as a brutal reminder that investors are not prepared to take politicians on trust and that the balance of risks is clearly tilted to the downside. Usually a slide in the pound and the consequent inflation would prompt the Bank of England to favour an interest rate hike, but with Brexit in play that could change very quickly. The pound is unlikely to remain at current levels for long: Either the government delivers a no-deal Brexit, in which case sterling might be expected to fall much further, or this prospect is avoided in which case the currency retraces some lost ground. Either way, holding for now would be the sensible option, Dixon said. And in corporate news, Centrica boss Ian Conn will step down after announcing that the British Gas owner had slashed its dividend following a first-half loss. Thanks for joining us today for coverage of business, economics and markets. Please do join my colleague, Julia Kollewe, tomorrow for coverage of the buildup to the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. JJ US stock markets have fallen after US President Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on China, which analysts have said could scupper trade talks. The Nasdaq composite index lost 0.68% in early trading, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.52% and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.34% at the opening bell. The FTSE 100 is now down by 0.3%, and the pain has increased for Centrica and Fresnillo after their poor results: the former has lost 17% and the latter has lost a fifth. On the mid-cap FTSE 250 CYBG, the owner of the Virgin Money, Clydesdale and Yorkshire bank brands, is the biggest faller. Shares in the bank have lost 12% after it reported a fall in mortgage lending and lower net interest margins, a key measure of how much money they make on their loans. US stock market futures are pointing to a difficult time for Wall Street today, after Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter attacks on China. Dow Jones industrial average futures prices have fallen by 0.4% with half an hour to go until the opening bell, while futures for the S&amp;P 500 are down by 0.5% and those on the Nasdaq 100 are down by 0.8%. The latest German inflation data might add to the case for the European Central Bank to go ahead with an interest rate cut in September: the harmonised index of consumer prices (used by the ECB) fell to 1.1%, the lowest since November 2016. In the previous month the inflation measure had reached 1.5%, much closer to the ECB\u2019s 2% inflation target. Economists had expected a drop, but only to an annual rate of 1.3%. The data add to a picture of a European economy that is struggling to sustain its momentum. The German manufacturing industry\u2019s travails have been a major part of that story. Trump\u2019s tweets appear to have scuppered any hopes for progress in the latest talks, barring some major concessions on the Chinese side. Stephen Innes, managing partner at VM Markets Pte, said: Whatever shred of optimism markets had about the ongoing trade negotiations were dealt as a severe blow when President Trump flew off the handle again at China for not buying American agricultural products. Following another month of escalating tensions, agreement on practically anything would have been viewed positively, but I think you can throw that view out the window. Trump\u2019s belief that China is hanging on for a Democrat to replace him as president in 2020 could lead the US to take a more aggressive tone, Innes added. European equities have suffered today after poor earnings from big companies, and the slide has accelerated after Trump\u2019s trade comments. Germany\u2019s Dax is now down by 2.2% today \u2013 and has hit its lowest level in more than a year. France\u2019s Cac 40 is down by 1.5%. The FTSE 100 is now in negative territory after Trump\u2019s trade interventions, down by 0.2%. An update on banking regulation: the Bank of England has today confirmed plans to make big British lenders publish plans to show that they could go bankrupt without needing the government to step in like it did with the \u00a345bn bailout of Royal Bank of Scotland a decade ago. The UK will become the second country to force its largest lenders to publicly disclose their \u201cliving wills\u201d and prove they can afford to foot the bill for their own failures in order to avoid costly taxpayer bailouts, reports the Guardian\u2019s Kalyeena Makortoff. New rules confirmed by the Bank of England and its regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, on Tuesday mean banks will face further pressure to lay out plans that ensure they wind down in an orderly fashion \u2013 or risk the scrutiny of both the public and investors. The public disclosures, due every two years from 2021, will be the first made by major banks outside of the US. With the new rules confirmed, UK\u2019s seven largest high street banks \u2013 RBS, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, Standard Chartered, the UK arm of Santander and Nationwide building society \u2013 will soon start assessing whether they are in a position to continue serving customers and fulfilling existing contracts even if they are headed for a full shutdown or major reorganisation. The president of the United States is awake, and he appears to be doing his best to prevent any progress in trade talks with China that are taking place in Shanghai. Donald Trump clearly is not holding out much hope for the latest round \u2013 which will not be welcomed by jittery investors hoping for a resolution. The trade war between the two countries has been highlighted as one of the major risks to the global economy for months. Raoul Leering, head of international trade analysis at the ING investment bank, said: Markets could be in for another disappointment because, as of yet, there are no other concrete signs that negotiators are getting closer to a deal. On the contrary, China has demanded that the US lift all tariff hikes before a deal can be cut, which doesn\u2019t align well with the American approach to keep the pressure on even after a deal. However, both China and Trump could do with a deal, one to help its economy, ther other to parade his trade negotiating successes. But \u201cTrump will need to back down\u201d, said Leering. Markets were yesterday pricing in a 50% chance of a Bank of England interest rate cut before the end of the year, Archer added. However, a fiscal boost from a free-spending new government could add to pressure not to cut interest rates. In yet another complication, the UK economy is weakening. Indeed, the influential National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) last week said there was a one in four chance the country is in a recession already. That is backed up by recent Bank of England data, said Costas Milas, a professor at the University of Liverpool. According to fresh Bank of England data, \u201cdivisia money\u201d grew in June 2019 by only 3.5%, the worst rate of growth for more than seven years. \u201cDivisia money\u201d, which has been found to predict GDP movements quite well, weights different forms of money according to their likelihood of being spent (hence, notes and coins have a higher weight than money held in mutual funds, for example). Milas said: The fact that divisia money is now slowing down rapidly indicates that GDP contraction is almost imminent which, of course, is hitting our currency in addition to the no-deal Brexit talk. There has been something of an about-turn in views on the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate path in recent weeks. Governor Mark Carney and co had been hinting that interest rates could rise in the event of a smooth Brexit \u2013 their central assumption. But as government policy has taken on more of a no-deal flavour that is looking increasingly strained. The Bank also runs the risk of being out of step with other major central banks \u2013 an uncomfortable feeling for policymakers who meet regularly at various economic fora. The US Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates tomorrow, and the European Central Bank\u2019s September rate cut has already been pencilled in by investors. It would be a \u201cmajor surprise\u201d if there is anything other than a 9-0 vote in favour of leaving policy unchanged, but the Bank could back away from its guidance that rates will rise gradually, according to Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club. Until very recently (including the June MPC meeting), the main focus on UK monetary policy was when the Bank of England is most likely to raise interest rates. However, there has been a marked turnaround in sentiment regarding likely Bank of England action and the key question is now whether the central bank\u2019s next move will be to raise or cut interest rates. We suspect that the Bank of England will acknowledge that the risks to the UK economic outlook have increased but play down the prospects of an interest rate cut unless there is a disruptive \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit in October. It would probably take conciliatory noises from the government or the EU to push the pound back up, although perhaps don\u2019t hold your breath for any change in tone any time soon, given that many key figures on either side will be on holiday in August. Currency traders are trying to work out what it will take for sterling to fall further, given that markets appear to have finally priced in Boris Johnson\u2019s no-deal Brexit threat. Added to that is the complication that the Bank of England (due to meet tomorrow before Thursday\u2019s decision) would likely have to cut interest rates if there is a no-deal Brexit. John Goldie, a dealer at foreign exchange company Argentex Group, said: The market finally seems to be waking up to the potential for No Deal Brexit, despite the fact that it has been the legal default for over two years now and consecutive prime ministers have maintained that they would prefer to leave without a deal than with a bad deal. The difference is that, this time, people believe Boris Johnson just might be crazy enough to carry out the threat. The Bank of England corrected its panic cut post-referendum when they raised rates in 2017 and then took interest rates to the highest since the financial crisis in mid-2018. With this buffer, as well as a seemingly synchronised dovish shift across the major economies, the market is already pricing over 50% likelihood of a reduction in rates later this year. There is not likely to be any change from the MPC this week but any suggestion that a cut has been considered would cement the expectation for action in the coming months and likely undermine the pound further. The number of insolvent companies in England and Wales hit a five-year high in the second quarter of 2019, in the latest ominous economic signal for the British economy. There were 4,321 company insolvencies between April and June, 2.6% higher than in the first three months of the year and an increase of 11.9% year-on-year. The last time insolvencies hit this level was the start of 2014. Duncan Swift, president of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3, said: Today\u2019s figures are evidence of a difficult period for UK businesses. Tighter constraints on consumers and significant uncertainty about the future of the UK economy and the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU are just some of the key factors at play that are making the business climate a challenging one. Questions around what Brexit really means have hit investment and growth levels, and led to a degree of economic stagnation. Businesses in a variety of industries are struggling right now. Retailers are suffering as the world in which they operate changes and more and more people shop online. Manufacturing output and confidence is low. Private and business car sales are down. And businesses which stockpiled items ahead of the original Brexit deadline of 29 March will now be seeing those decisions have an impact on their cash flow levels. Simply put: it\u2019s an uncertain, difficult time to be in business right now. The pound has moderated some of its losses for the day: it has now lost 0.3% for the day to trade at around $1.2184 against the US dollar. The slight recovery has weighed on the FTSE 100, which is now up by only 0.07%. But any talk of recovery comes in the context of a very difficult month for sterling owners. The pound remains down by 4.5% over the year to date, or 4% in the past month alone \u2013 leading to some rather unflattering comparisons: Important pensions news from the Financial Conduct Authority. Britain\u2019s financial watchdog has proposed measures to protect consumers transferring out of defined benefit pension schemes, including a ban on contingent charging for advice and a clampdown on ongoing fees over 20 to 30 years \u2013 practices it said were costing customers \u00a32bn a year. Many savers have been encouraged to move their pensions when they would be better advised to stay put.

An Ofcom investigation revealed the network, which is owned by O2\u2019s parent company Telef\u00f3nica, overcharged users a total of almost \u00a32.9m, writes the Guardian\u2019s Mark Sweney. The communications regulator said the billing mistake was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and imposed a further \u00a350,000 fine because Giffgaff failed to provide accurate information during its investigation.

Here\u2019s more from Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics: The overall sentiment indicator for consumers jumped to -7 in July \u2013 its highest level since August 2018 \u2013 from -11 in June. Confidence among households about the economic outlook recovered in July, while households\u2019 optimism about the 12-month outlook for their personal finances rose further above its long-run average. Although caveated by the fact that the survey was carried out before Johnson ascended to the premiership, \u201cthere\u2019s no sign yet that consumers are going to tap the brakes on spending in the run-up to the October Brexit deadline\u201d, Tombs said. The weakening in the eurozone is reflected across the world, and it has drawn a response from central bankers who are planning to add support to their ailing economies. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates tomorrow, and the European Central Bank has all but committed to moving in September (although the Bank of England is expected to remain on hold until the Brexit path becomes clearer, for better or worse). The Bank of Japan\u2019s Haruhiko Kuroda this morning added to the sense of wariness among central bank governors, saying that he was prepared to ease monetary policy if need be. While the BoJ did not change interest rates, it said it would add more stimulus \u201cwithout hesitation\u201d if there is a global slowdown that threatens to weaken inflationary pressures. Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said Kuroda echoed what other policymakers have been saying in recent weeks. The language now promises further easing if downside risks materialise, mainly regarding developments in overseas economies. Eurozone business confidence fell to an almost six-year low in July, according to closely followed indicators published by the European commission. Business confidence for the eurozone fell \u201cmarkedly\u201d, the commission said, from a reading of 0.17 points in June to a negative reading of 0.12 in July. That was the first negative reading for business confidence since October 2013, and the lowest since August of that year. It was also well below economists\u2019 average expectations of 0.08. The commission\u2019s economic sentiment indicator, which combines consumer and business confidence, fell to its lowest since 2016. The figures add to an ominous picture for the eurozone economy, which has been blighted in particular by the struggles of the German manufacturing industry \u2013 with fears rising of a global economic slowdown. British bakery chain Greggs has reported a 58% rise in profits today, after the buzz around its vegan sausage roll boosted sales. The Newcastle-based company announced a special dividend of 35p per share \u2013 a vegan sausage roll payout, perhaps. Greggs launched its vegan sausage roll in January with a hugely successful marketing campaign that drew the ire of famous ranters but boosted sales. Underlying pre-tax profits came in at \u00a340.6m for the six months to 29 June, up from \u00a325.7m the year before. There were heavier sterling trading volumes than normal in Asia trading hours, say analysts at Deutsche Bank led by Jim Reid. The renewed selling this morning has left the pound just a percent away from hitting a 34-year low (if ignoring the \u201cflash crash\u201d of October 2016). They said: With 93 days until the UK\u2019s scheduled departure from the EU on October 31, and with Johnson\u2019s policy of leaving that day \u201cno ifs or buts\u201d, fears of a no-deal outcome are increasingly being reflected in the currency. It isn\u2019t only sterling markets that are being affected: the yield on the 10-year gilt, the benchmark rate for UK government borrowing, has matched its almost-three-year low of 0.628% this morning. Yields fall as prices rise in response to higher demand for the bonds. That demand has been driven in part by expectations that a no-deal Brexit would lead to economic stimulus from the Bank of England. Lower interest rates tend to make the returns from bonds more attractive. Remember that Johnson and much of his cabinet have already voted in favour of the withdrawal deal that Theresa May agreed with the EU. But his new-found conversion to leaving without a deal if necessary reflects the apparent impossibility of getting enough votes to pass that deal. Kit Juckes, chief foreign exchange strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said: UK PM Boris Johnson\u2019s position that there is no point talking about the exit deal with the EU until the Irish border backstop arrangement is removed, reflects his inability to get the deal in its current format through Parliament. His hard-line stance is seeing the Conservatives win voters back from the Brexit Party, according to recent polls, and he needs either to get a deal from the EU that he can get through Parliament or win back enough Brexiteer votes to be able to win an election. Either way, he is committed to a hard-line stance towards the EU that will of course, be rebuffed aggressively. In the process, sterling moves to the bottom of its post-referendum ranges and re-tests historical trade-weighted lows. Oh, to be a fly on the wall in 10 Downing Street today as they discuss a fall in sterling at peak holiday season. Perhaps, counterintuitively, Boris Johnson and his new strategy supremo, Dominic Cummings, may welcome the fall (or what it represents), says Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at foreign exchange firm Oanda. The weakness in the pound is a reflection of the fact that Boris Johnson\u2019s plan is working. He wants his no-deal threats to be taken seriously by the EU in the hope that it forces them to re-engage on the backstop. Clearly he has traders convinced. Ultimately, May failed to convince anyone that no-deal was ever an option, despite repeated warnings that it was better than a bad deal. Boris Johnson is determined not to make the same mistake and it now remains to be seen whether the EU will take his threats as seriously as the market is. Traders are currently not optimistic but it\u2019s still early days. For now, the currency may remain under severe pressure. The FTSE 100 is the one gainer among major European stock markets, still up by 0.14%. Elsewhere Germany\u2019s Dax index has been shaken by poor earnings from the Lufthansa airline and chemicals company Bayer. It fell by 0.5%. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB benchmark index has hit a four-week low after falling by 0.8%. British Gas owner Centrica\u2019s shares are sputtering: they are now at a 21-year low. Silver and gold miner Fresnillo is the second-worst performer on the FTSE 100, after it reported a drop in production and higher costs. Profits dropped by two-thirds. And consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser missed analysts expectations for sales thanks to slower sales of infant formula in the giant Chinese market. A bit more detail on those BP earnings: profits fell by 35% in the second quarter on the back of sliding crude oil prices. But investors of course know the effect of lower oil prices on oil company earnings; better than expected production figures helped make up for the lower prices. (Despite all of its talk of supporting the energy transition, BP is in the middle of a five-year plan to expand production.) Via AFP: BP said that its underlying replacement cost profit \u2013 a widely-watched measure which strips out exceptional items and changes in the value of oil inventories \u2013 was broadly unchanged at $2.8bn. That beat the average analyst forecast of $2.48bn, according to Bloomberg. Centrica shares have fallen by 10% in early trading on the FTSE 100. Here is the chart which probably goes some way to explaining why Centrica boss Ian Conn is being shown the door. London\u2019s benchmark index is up by 0.35%, however, after stronger-than-expected BP results boosted the weighty mining contingent. And don\u2019t forget that the FTSE 100\u2019s multinationals are usually boosted by the falling pound, which makes their foreign currency earnings more valuable in sterling terms. Back on sterling, it\u2019s \u201crelentless selling pressure\u201d says Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com. If sterling weakens further \u201cit\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess where cable [sterling against the dollar] could land,\u201d he said. Remember the previous post-2016 low was before no-deal was on the table \u2013 it was all talk of a hard v soft Brexit \u2013 no deal wasn\u2019t even being discussed. The reasons behind the slide are well trodden but worth noting again: increased risk of a no-deal Brexit as the new government regime pivots squarely towards making no-deal a reality. And Johnson will not be endearing himself to many families about to go abroad ... Terrible timing for the holidays. Why is it always August? Ian Conn\u2019s departure came after what he described as an \u201cexceptionally challenging environment in the first half of 2019\u201d, resulting in Centrica slashing its dividend in half. Centrica slumped to a loss of \u00a3446m in the first six months of 2019, after making a profit of \u00a3704m in the same period last year. The company blamed a litany of factors for the \u00a31.1bn downturn in its fortunes: the UK default tariff price cap, low UK natural gas prices, extensions to outages at the Hunterston B and Dungeness B nuclear power stations, and warmer than normal weather in both the UK and North America. The British Gas owner\u2019s adjusted earnings for shareholders, which attempts to strip out one-off costs, slumped by 63% year-on-year to \u00a3134m. The dividend to be paid to investors fell to 1.5p per share, down from 3.6p last year. Centrica\u2019s UK consumer business will be \u201cfundamentally rebased\u201d, and it will seek another \u00a3250m of efficiencies per year, part of a \u00a31bn cost-cutting programme. British Gas owner Centrica has announced that its chief executive, Ian Conn, will step down next year. Conn will remain with Centrica at least until the 2020 annual general meeting and \u201cprovide his full support to help with the transition\u201d, the company said. The board said it will plan for his succession and provide an update at a later point. Conn will remain on the same pay policy until the end of his employment, Centrica said. However, bonus payments whose conditions have not yet been fulfilled will \u201clapse in full\u201d and no further bonuses will be granted. Conn has previously been the object of criticism after receiving a 44% pay rise to \u00a32.4m for 2018, despite a difficult year in which the company imposed two bill increases, warned on profits and announced thousands of job cuts. Charles Berry, Centrica chairman, said: Iain has now agreed with the Board that, while he will continue to focus on driving [the] transformation, including pursuing the announced divestments and continuing to drive performance and efficiency, he will also support an orderly succession before stepping down in due course. Here\u2019s a graph regular readers will have seen yesterday, but it certainly bears repeating: sterling against the US dollar since the start of 2016, ahead of the June 2016 referendum. Note that sterling popped to above $1.50 as the results of the referendum started to come through. It has since suffered, recovered somewhat, and then fallen back as it became clearer that a no-deal Brexit was increasingly likely. Boris Johnson\u2019s financial markets welcoming party has delivered another blow this morning, sending sterling to fresh lows. When campaigning for the Conservative leadership, the new prime minister made it very clear that he intended to leave the EU on 31 October with or without a deal. Markets appeared not to believe him; they now appear to have caught up. Johnson again rejected the backstop, the insurance policy that aims to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Speaking in Scotland, he said: We can\u2019t accept the backstop, it was thrown out three times, the withdrawal agreement as it stands is dead and everybody gets that. But there is ample scope to do a new deal and a better deal. Investors were not reassured and sterling tumbled again this morning, losing as much as 0.7% against the US dollar and 0.6% against the euro. One pound bought as little as $1.2121 US dollars this morning, the lowest since 14 March 2017. Watch for the $1.2106 level: that will be the lowest since January 2017. It has been an uncomfortable month for the pound, making it one of the worst-performing currencies across the world in recent days. Sterling\u2019s Johnsonian weakness will also have tricky implications for the Bank of England, whose rate-setting monetary policy committee will be looking at the fall in the pound with a certain trepidation ahead of their latest interest rate decision on Thursday. Falls in the pound feed eventually through into higher inflation \u2013 but it is not the kind of inflation that signals an economy that is heating up. That leaves an uncomfortable decision to leave rising inflation, or to raise interest rates to combat it at a time when the economy may be struggling even more.

In fact, one of their guidelines is that any cannabis oil extracted from the hemp plant only contains 0.2% of THC [tetrahydrocannabinol, the substance that produces a psychoactive high], which we also stuck by and indeed were upfront with the Home Office. We kept them informed every step of the way when we started this business in 2015.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems like we are being punished for being upfront and honest about what we were doing, when we took the decision to extract cannabis oil solely for wellbeing purposes. Once we got started in 2016 after learning about CBD oil and how it was doing in America \u2026 we never hid it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b656cf8c0e98e70de501a675880e4034c79c83d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b656cf8c0e98e70de501a675880e4034c79c83d3/0_0_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samples of Hempen products.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samples of Hempen products.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Silk, who gave up a job in the City of London this year to pursue her dream of a more eco-friendly, organic lifestyle, said: \u201cWe are being banned from producing something organically, something which is also good for the environment by its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-capture-and-storage\">carbon</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-capture-and-storage\"> capture</a>, that is available in shops on any British high street. You can go into health and wellbeing stores and buy CBD oil over the counter yet we can\u2019t produce it here in these fields in England because the Home Office treats hemp like narcotics or firearms.\u201d</p> <p>Silk estimated that their company, Hempen, would lose about \u00a3200,000 as a result of the destroyed crop and while their overall projections for sales over the next few years were as high as \u00a32.4m, she said it would be foreign hemp growers who would reap the benefits.</p> <p>\u201cPatrick and I worked it out that about \u00a3480,000 of our profits over the next few years would be taken away in tax. So that is a massive loss in tax revenue plus the foreign producers we can actually buy from, Swiss hemp farmers, will be the ones to benefit from the Home Office ban,\u201d she said.</p> <p>As the sun beat down on a slashed and stubbled field, Gillett said: \u201cThis is all very strange. No one in the Home Office up until the end of last year ever said to us: \u2018Stop what you are doing, this is illegal.\u2019 They allowed us to get started and then after a perfect year \u2013 wet spring and hot summer \u2013 we had a bumper crop which they made us destroy last Tuesday. It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said it did not routinely comment on individual licences. The tenant farmer had held a hemp grower\u2019s licence.

      "bodyText": "Two hemp farmers say they have been left devastated after they were forced to destroy 40 acres of the crop \u2013 the end product of which can be bought legally in high street shops. Patrick Gillett and Ali Silk said they had to cut down their crop because the Home Office said they were no longer allowed to harvest it for cannabis oil, or CBD. As they surveyed the Oxfordshire fields where their combine harvester tore up the hemp, the pair remained perplexed over the order to cease production at their cooperative farm. Gillett and Silk are so incensed over what they believe was an unjust order from the Home Office that they have launched a national campaign to have the policy reversed. \u201cFor three years we operated openly and always kept the Home Office informed over what we were doing,\u201d Gillett said as he lifted one of the remaining stalks scattered around the field. \u201cIt was devastating to have to rip the entire crop up just because the Home Office changed its guidelines. In fact, one of their guidelines is that any cannabis oil extracted from the hemp plant only contains 0.2% of THC [tetrahydrocannabinol, the substance that produces a psychoactive high], which we also stuck by and indeed were upfront with the Home Office. We kept them informed every step of the way when we started this business in 2015. \u201cIt seems like we are being punished for being upfront and honest about what we were doing, when we took the decision to extract cannabis oil solely for wellbeing purposes. Once we got started in 2016 after learning about CBD oil and how it was doing in America \u2026 we never hid it.\u201d Silk, who gave up a job in the City of London this year to pursue her dream of a more eco-friendly, organic lifestyle, said: \u201cWe are being banned from producing something organically, something which is also good for the environment by its carbon capture, that is available in shops on any British high street. You can go into health and wellbeing stores and buy CBD oil over the counter yet we can\u2019t produce it here in these fields in England because the Home Office treats hemp like narcotics or firearms.\u201d Silk estimated that their company, Hempen, would lose about \u00a3200,000 as a result of the destroyed crop and while their overall projections for sales over the next few years were as high as \u00a32.4m, she said it would be foreign hemp growers who would reap the benefits. \u201cPatrick and I worked it out that about \u00a3480,000 of our profits over the next few years would be taken away in tax. So that is a massive loss in tax revenue plus the foreign producers we can actually buy from, Swiss hemp farmers, will be the ones to benefit from the Home Office ban,\u201d she said. As the sun beat down on a slashed and stubbled field, Gillett said: \u201cThis is all very strange. No one in the Home Office up until the end of last year ever said to us: \u2018Stop what you are doing, this is illegal.\u2019 They allowed us to get started and then after a perfect year \u2013 wet spring and hot summer \u2013 we had a bumper crop which they made us destroy last Tuesday. It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said it did not routinely comment on individual licences. The tenant farmer had held a hemp grower\u2019s licence. However, it is understood that his application to renew the licence was recently rejected by the Home Office. Silk and Gillett said they sought cooperation from the Home Office and wanted to be fully licensed \u201cbecause any CBD oil we would produce would have been well within the legal guidelines of 0.2% THC\u201d. Gillett said Hempen had been in touch with farmers from Yorkshire to the Channel Islands in an attempt to build a national campaign to overturn the Home Office ruling. \u201cWe need to persuade the government to take these decisions away from a department that deals with illegal drugs and guns, and put it in the hands of somewhere like the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. We need to get them to see the benefits of CBD and hemp in general rather than look upon it as a criminal matter.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 7 August 2019 because an earlier version wrongly suggested that Hempen had never held a Home Office licence to grow cannabis. It is understood that the tenant farmer had held a licence for three years, but the Home Office recently rejected his application for the licence to be renewed.",

      "bodyText": "A few weeks ago, Boris Johnson insisted in one of the Conservative leadership hustings that the chances of no deal were a million to one against. Smash cut to him assembling a \u201cwar cabinet\u201d to step up no-deal Brexit plans and work round the clock under the assumption that no deal is definitely going to happen. At this news the pound fell at an alarming rate, pretty much acting in the opposite manner to Johnson on a zipline, and hit a new 28-month low. On the bright side, we will soon hit parity with the euro, essentially finally joining to the currency by the back door, and it\u2019s all thanks to Brexiteers. So how has the emergency committee decided to prepare us for something pretty much unprecedented in British history in three months\u2019 time? While sitting around in the Cobra briefing room \u2013 normally reserved for national emergencies that we haven\u2019t brought upon ourselves \u2013 Johnson and his team decided to talk about leafleting. The government will launch a new campaign to inform the whole country about no-deal preparations, with costs expected to run into nine figures. A few years after Theresa May looked a nurse dead in the eye and said \u201cThere\u2019s no magic money tree\u201d, here they are spending \u00a3100m on a leaflet explaining how best to eat your dog.

      "body": "<p>Michael Forsyth, chair of the House of Lords economic committee, is in buoyant mood, happily surprised by the positive response to the committee\u2019s <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201719/ldselect/ldeconaf/392/39202.htm\" title=\"\">recent, pugnacious report into social care funding</a>. \u201cI was astonished by the reaction, actually,\u201d says the Conservative peer. Congratulations came from across parliament; and there were supportive emails from the public. They liked not just its bold call for a multibillion-pound, taxpayer-funded, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/04/peers-call-for-extra-8bn-to-tackle-social-care-scandal\" title=\"\">NHS-style overhaul of adult social care</a>, but its brisk frustration with the political failure of successive governments to address what it concluded (after a brief deliberation about whether such language was appropriately lordly) was a \u201cnational scandal\u201d.</p> <p>The solution was admirably simple: write an \u00a38bn cheque to local authorities in England and Wales to pull adult social care budgets back to pre-austerity 2010 levels; and create by 2025 a \u00a37bn a year system of free personal care to help people with daily tasks such as bathing, dressing, personal hygiene, going to the toilet, and meal preparation. Importantly, the cash would be distributed via a central grant, removing postcode lotteries in standards of provision. Above all, robust action was needed, and quickly: as Lord Forsyth said at the launch of the report earlier this month: \u201cLet\u2019s stop faffing around.\u201d</p> <p>Any initial concerns the peers had that their demands for an extra \u00a315bn a year by 2025 were unrealistic were quickly drowned out by copious evidence of a broken system, he says. About 1.4 million people are denied the social care they need because of cuts, rationing and means tests. Many more endured basic \u201cclean and feed\u201d levels of care. The system is riddled with unfairness and inequality, and the gap between demand and resources is growing apace. People are suffering. \u201cYou would have to be blind and totally excluded from society not to be able to read or see that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/26/social-care-funding-crisis-putting-tens-of-thousands-at-risk\" title=\"\">system is failing</a>. We all know the system is failing,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Equally, some will have been surprised by the enthusiasm with which Forsyth \u2013 a former minister in John Major\u2019s government \u2013 embraced this most statist of solutions. Forsyth less so. \u201cI\u2019m regarded as a rightwinger, as a Thatcherite,\u201d he admits. \u201cI believe in politics that the first duty of parliament is the defence of the nation but also to ensure, as Winston Churchill put it, to provide a net and a ladder; a net below which people do not fall and a ladder to help them get out of the net. Here you have people who can\u2019t climb ladders and the net is full of holes.\u201d</p> <p>The committee\u2019s proposals were built on solid evidence, he says \u2013 \u201cwhich I suppose these days is something of a novelty in terms of public policy\u201d. So, private insurance solutions favoured by many in his own party were quickly dispatched, after the insurance industry told the committee they wouldn\u2019t work. Half the social care budget is spent on people of working age, so insurance schemes would not help them. They were just a diversion from the reality that a properly functioning social care system is the expensive duty of the taxpayer, not of markets, says Forsyth. \u201cThe people who are looking for some easy way out of this are in search of a holy grail which does not exist.\u201d</p> <p>If confirmation were needed that the system was crumbling, it came in the private testimony given to the committee by care workers, he says. He was struck by their dedication despite low pay, low status, the lack of a career structure, and the dearth of support available to them. You can\u2019t blame employers for this, he says, \u201ctrying to squeeze a pint into a half-pint pot\u201d. It all comes back to financing. \u201cThey [the carers] know that people are denied care not because the local authorities or anyone wants to be beastly but simply because they are having to ration resources in the face of increasing demands.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/27/care-for-the-elderly-boris-johnson-jeremy-hunt\">Care for the elderly is a scandal \u2013 but don\u2019t expect a solution from Hunt or Johnson | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The committee expressly set out not to produce yet another worthy social care funding report \u2013 there have been 17 in the last 20 years, all of which were ignored or abandoned \u2013 but to create a blueprint that was acceptable to both Labour and the Tories. He is conscious of the way both parties have weaponised social care reforms in past elections: Labour\u2019s plans dubbed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/mar/30/death-tax-haunts-andy-burnham-care-revolution\" title=\"\">\u201cdeath tax\u201d</a> in 2010; Theresa May\u2019s plans vilified as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/22/theresa-may-u-turn-on-dementia-tax-cap-social-care-conservative-manifesto\" title=\"\">dementia tax</a> in 2017. May\u2019s were \u201ccrackpot\u201d proposals anyway, he reflects: \u201cYou don\u2019t try and get a policy which requires consensus among the political parties and launch it in the middle of an election campaign.\u201d</p> <p>Several days after our interview, Boris Johnson promised in his first utterances as prime minister to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-announced-plan-fix-18770005\" title=\"\">fix the crisis </a>in social care\u201d. There has been speculation that his plan may adopt an insurance-style approach.

      "bodyText": "Michael Forsyth, chair of the House of Lords economic committee, is in buoyant mood, happily surprised by the positive response to the committee\u2019s recent, pugnacious report into social care funding. \u201cI was astonished by the reaction, actually,\u201d says the Conservative peer. Congratulations came from across parliament; and there were supportive emails from the public. They liked not just its bold call for a multibillion-pound, taxpayer-funded, NHS-style overhaul of adult social care, but its brisk frustration with the political failure of successive governments to address what it concluded (after a brief deliberation about whether such language was appropriately lordly) was a \u201cnational scandal\u201d. The solution was admirably simple: write an \u00a38bn cheque to local authorities in England and Wales to pull adult social care budgets back to pre-austerity 2010 levels; and create by 2025 a \u00a37bn a year system of free personal care to help people with daily tasks such as bathing, dressing, personal hygiene, going to the toilet, and meal preparation. Importantly, the cash would be distributed via a central grant, removing postcode lotteries in standards of provision. Above all, robust action was needed, and quickly: as Lord Forsyth said at the launch of the report earlier this month: \u201cLet\u2019s stop faffing around.\u201d Any initial concerns the peers had that their demands for an extra \u00a315bn a year by 2025 were unrealistic were quickly drowned out by copious evidence of a broken system, he says. About 1.4 million people are denied the social care they need because of cuts, rationing and means tests. Many more endured basic \u201cclean and feed\u201d levels of care. The system is riddled with unfairness and inequality, and the gap between demand and resources is growing apace. People are suffering. \u201cYou would have to be blind and totally excluded from society not to be able to read or see that the system is failing. We all know the system is failing,\u201d he says. Equally, some will have been surprised by the enthusiasm with which Forsyth \u2013 a former minister in John Major\u2019s government \u2013 embraced this most statist of solutions. Forsyth less so. \u201cI\u2019m regarded as a rightwinger, as a Thatcherite,\u201d he admits. \u201cI believe in politics that the first duty of parliament is the defence of the nation but also to ensure, as Winston Churchill put it, to provide a net and a ladder; a net below which people do not fall and a ladder to help them get out of the net. Here you have people who can\u2019t climb ladders and the net is full of holes.\u201d The committee\u2019s proposals were built on solid evidence, he says \u2013 \u201cwhich I suppose these days is something of a novelty in terms of public policy\u201d. So, private insurance solutions favoured by many in his own party were quickly dispatched, after the insurance industry told the committee they wouldn\u2019t work. Half the social care budget is spent on people of working age, so insurance schemes would not help them. They were just a diversion from the reality that a properly functioning social care system is the expensive duty of the taxpayer, not of markets, says Forsyth. \u201cThe people who are looking for some easy way out of this are in search of a holy grail which does not exist.\u201d If confirmation were needed that the system was crumbling, it came in the private testimony given to the committee by care workers, he says. He was struck by their dedication despite low pay, low status, the lack of a career structure, and the dearth of support available to them. You can\u2019t blame employers for this, he says, \u201ctrying to squeeze a pint into a half-pint pot\u201d. It all comes back to financing. \u201cThey [the carers] know that people are denied care not because the local authorities or anyone wants to be beastly but simply because they are having to ration resources in the face of increasing demands.\u201d The committee expressly set out not to produce yet another worthy social care funding report \u2013 there have been 17 in the last 20 years, all of which were ignored or abandoned \u2013 but to create a blueprint that was acceptable to both Labour and the Tories. He is conscious of the way both parties have weaponised social care reforms in past elections: Labour\u2019s plans dubbed a \u201cdeath tax\u201d in 2010; Theresa May\u2019s plans vilified as a dementia tax in 2017. May\u2019s were \u201ccrackpot\u201d proposals anyway, he reflects: \u201cYou don\u2019t try and get a policy which requires consensus among the political parties and launch it in the middle of an election campaign.\u201d Several days after our interview, Boris Johnson promised in his first utterances as prime minister to \u201cfix the crisis in social care\u201d. There has been speculation that his plan may adopt an insurance-style approach. Forsyth said Johnson should take note of the committee\u2019s emphasis on funding the social care needs of working-age adults, and the importance of paying for it through taxation, warning: \u201cAny plan which relies mainly on private insurance will not work, even with a pensions-style auto-enrolment scheme.\u201d By convention the government must formally respond to the committee within eight weeks; and a debate on the floor of the Lords should take place before Christmas. Brexit or no Brexit, there is simply no time to waste, Forsyth says. If the government is serious about social care reform it cannot possibly avoid the committee\u2019s conclusions. \u201cThis is a broken system, we are reaching the end of the road.\u201d Curriculum vitae Age: 64.

      "bodyText": "When I watched the video of Mark Field\u2019s actions against the Greenpeace protester Janet Barker, I had a visceral reaction. Tears rushed into my eyes when confronted with the rage in his expression, the shock on her face. I wasn\u2019t alone. Many women I spoke to saw the assertion of a brutal kind of male dominance. Some knew all too well the moment when a man aggressively decides that an outspoken woman must be put in her place. For those of us who know the reality of male violence against women, this looked like a moment when a pervasive culture of male entitlement escaped into the open. Just over a month after Field manhandled Barker from a black tie dinner, the prime minister has dropped the Whitehall investigation into his behaviour. The decision came after Johnson sacked Field from his role as a Foreign Office minister, saying the investigation was a \u201cmatter for the previous PM\u201d. An investigation into whether an MP should be a minister when he has already lost his ministerial post is arguably redundant. But Johnson\u2019s actions leave a sour taste. This looks like powerful men closing ranks against women \u2013 and not for the first time. After all, isn\u2019t that just what happened on the night of the incident? While women were reacting online with horror, those in the room were reacting with silence at best, cheers at worst. The well-dressed diners closed ranks against the woman from Greenpeace, and took the part of the man with his hands on the back of her neck. We were told that Field was a \u201chero\u201d for what he did. We were told to be \u201cthankful that it wasn\u2019t worse\u201d. We were told to \u201ccalm down and move on\u201d. Moving on is exactly what this government has now done. The dropping of the investigation feels like the natural conclusion to that silence, those claps, and those praise-filled tweets. It\u2019s hard to avoid an impression of the powerful protecting one another. And it sends a clear message to men: you can behave with aggression towards women, and so long as it\u2019s politically expedient, eventually no one will care.

Johnson can\u2019t afford to lose the support of any MPs, and dropping an investigation is one way to bolster goodwill. This isn\u2019t the first time in recent months that women have been sold down the river for political advantage. In December 2018, Theresa May restored the whip to two MPs facing allegations of sexual misconduct in order to get through her vote of no confidence. One of them, Charlie Elphicke, has since been charged with three counts of sexual assault. For a leader potentially facing an election who has low popularity with female voters \u2013 not least for his jokes that voting Tory could make your wife\u2019s breasts bigger, and that women only go to university to get a man \u2013 this could have been an opportunity for Johnson to make a positive stand for women and prove himself the feminist he claims to be. Obviously Field couldn\u2019t lose his ministerial role twice.

The shooting was one of the bloodiest incidents in Sudan since the RSF killed more than 120 people at a protest site in Khartoum, the capital, last month. The government claims far fewer died in that attack. The RSF are commanded by Mohammed Dagalo, known as Hemedti, who is seen as the most powerful of the military rulers in charge of Sudan since the ousting of President Omar al-Bashir in April. The deaths on Monday prompted further protests in El-Obeid, where markets were shut, schools suspended and a curfew was imposed. Authorities announced a state of emergency in the state and shut down internet access. The army was deployed in the city. There were also demonstrations in Khartoum, Omdurman and Port Sudan as news of the shooting spread. The Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors, one of a group of unions and professional bodies that helped lead months of protests against Bashir, said many people were injured in the incident in El-Obeid. There was no immediate statement from the state security services or from Sudan\u2019s military leaders. Opposition activists have kept up their demonstrations since April, pressing for the military to speed up the move to civilian rule and calling for justice for the people killed last month in Khartoum. The shootings have been condemned by the United Nations and some international powers. Abdullah Fadil, a Unicef representative in Sudan, said: \u201cNo child should be buried in their school uniform. The children, aged between 15 and 17 years old, were protesting the commencement of the school year amid the political uncertainty in Sudan \u2026. Unicef calls on the government to investigate and hold all perpetrators of violence against children accountable.\u201d The main opposition Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) coalition is negotiating with the ruling military council to finalise an agreement for a three-year transition to elections. The two sides signed a deal on 17 July setting out the transition\u2019s institutions. But talks have been repeatedly delayed since then owing to disagreement over the wording of a constitutional declaration to determine the role of a ruling council to govern Sudan. A new round of talks is due to start on Tuesday. It will cover issues including the powers of the joint civilian-military governing body, the deployment of security forces and immunity for generals over protest-related violence.

Can it really be that this generation\u2019s teenagers are inherently more sad, anxious or vulnerable than those of the past?</p> <p>Bringing together critical voices in psychiatry and psychology \u2013 clinicians who look towards social change as a means of preventing mental distress, rather than always seeing people as fundamentally disordered or damaged \u2013 Young, British and Depressed asked if we are too quick to medicalise young people\u2019s emotions. As a headteacher in a highly deprived area of London said on camera: \u201cIt is a difficult time to be a young person, particularly in areas of deprivation and poverty.\u201d</p> <p>No doubt. Poverty and social inequality are known to be <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-psychiatric-treatment/article/poverty-social-inequality-and-mental-health/39E6EB94B44818EDE417F181AC300DA4\">the greatest causes of suffering on Earth</a> \u2013 particularly for children.

Government pledges to funnel millions of pounds into improving mental health provisions are farcical in light of such endemic suffering caused by continued austerity measures \u2013 including further cuts to already buckling services.</p> <p>The reporter Sanah Ahsan spoke to those who have been waiting six months (or more) for talking therapy, including a teenage girl who harmed herself with intent to end her life. Such waiting times are an unequivocal injustice for anyone feeling mentally unwell. Pressurised GPs often prescribe antidepressants to young people in the interim. Many may find the medication helpful. However, as one GP interviewed said, it is \u201cfar from ideal\u201d \u2013 and this echoes the majority view.</p> <p>Of 1,000 UK GPs surveyed in the show, 86% agreed that the prescribing of antidepressants has increased due to problems accessing specialist services. Only 1% feel this is the best treatment for depression. In fact, only one type of antidepressant has been shown to be effective and <a href=\"https://bnfc.nice.org.uk/treatment-summary/antidepressant-drugs.html\">recommended as a treatment for</a> depression in children and adolescents. <a href=\"http://www.adisorder4everyone.com/bio/james-davies/\">Dr James Davies</a>, a psychotherapist and mental health researcher, explained how withdrawing from antidepressants can often take longer than the seven days stated in clinical guidelines. A young man spoke of his months-long experience of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/brain-shakes#treatment\">brain zaps</a>\u201d. The guidelines are <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/news/medication/calls-for-guidelines-be-revised-over-antidepressant-withdrawal-symptoms/\">currently being updated</a>.</p> <p>Another key question raised by the programme was whether the abundance of anti-stigma campaigns geared towards young people is having an inverse effect. It is often suggested that increased referrals to mental health services shows how young people are feeling empowered to express their distress, gaining new language with which to do so. This may be true. But the \u201ctalk to someone\u201d message means very little if there\u2019s no one to talk to. Jenny, a young person featured, says: \u201cThese campaigns are asking people to reach out for help, it\u2019s OK to feel this way, it\u2019s OK like there\u2019ll be help there if you reach out. There isn\u2019t. There isn\u2019t help.

Davies argued that we need to move away from medicalising young people\u2019s distress, in which labels \u2013 that can significantly change how a person views their normal ups and downs \u2013 are not necessarily needed. For example, a common NHS approach for <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/borderline-personality-disorder/treatment/\">borderline personality disorder</a> is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_behavior_therapy\">dialectical </a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_behavior_therapy\">behaviour </a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_behavior_therapy\">therapy</a>, which often requires patients to attend \u201cpre-commitment sessions\u201d to establish that they are <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/nhs-mental-health-therapy-depression-anxiety-state-a8752196.html\">\u201cowning their diagnosis</a>.\u201d How can this be right when the label itself <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/borderline-personality-disorder-mental-health-depression-anxiety-stress-psychiatry-a8456301.html\">is so woolly and controversial</a>?</p> <p>The implication is that we are, potentially, creating a huge group of people who believe they have perennial mental illness; creating long-term patients of the future. We need more programmes like this and, at 30 minutes, it wasn\u2019t enough. Dissenting voices like Johnston are often condemned, but with record numbers of young people entering mental health services that cannot cope, it is time we started asking difficult, deeper questions about what\u2019s going on.</p>",

The wall became a literal fulcrum for U.S. - Mexico relations and children and adults were connected in meaningful ways on both sides with the recognition that the actions that take place on one side have a direct consequence on the other side. Amazing thanks to everyone who made this event possible like Omar Rios @colectivo.chopeke for collaborating with us, the guys at Taller Herrer\u00eda in #CiudadJuarez for their fine craftsmanship, @anateresafernandez for encouragement and support, and everyone who showed up on both sides including the beautiful families from Colonia Anapra, and @kerrydoyle2010, @kateggreen , @ersela_kripa , @stphn_mllr , @wakawaffles, Chris Gauthier and many others (you know who you are). #raelsanfratello #borderwallasarchitecture</a></p> \n   <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rrael/\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Ronald Rael</a> (@rrael) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-07-29T06:22:19+00:00\">Jul 28, 2019 at 11:22pm PDT</time></p>\n  </div>\n </blockquote> \n <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> \n</figure> \n<p>He added that it was also about finding \u201cmeaningful ways on both sides with the recognition that the actions that take place on one side have a direct consequence on the other side\u201d.</p> \n<p>The US-Mexico border has become one of the defining features of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.

      "bodyText": "A set of fluorescent pink seesaws has been built across the US-Mexico border by a pair of professors seeking to bring a playful concept of unity to the two sides of the divide. Installed along the steel border fence on the outskirts of El Paso in Texas and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez in Mexico, the seesaws are the invention of Ronald Rael, a professor of architecture at the University of California, Berkeley, and Virginia San Fratello, an associate professor of design at San Jos\u00e9 State University, who first came up with the concept 10 years ago. In an Instagram post that has received tens of thousands of likes, children and adults can be seen playing and interacting on both sides of the fence using the seesaws, which provide \u201ca literal fulcrum\u201d between the countries, according to Rael. He said the event was about bringing \u201cjoy, excitement and togetherness at the border wall\u201d. He added that it was also about finding \u201cmeaningful ways on both sides with the recognition that the actions that take place on one side have a direct consequence on the other side\u201d. The US-Mexico border has become one of the defining features of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. His promise to \u201cbuild a wall\u201d between the two countries has yet to materialise but crowded migrant detention facilities, the use of teargas at the border and the separation of children from their parents are among some of the controversial tactics deployed by US authorities as its stance has become more hostile under the Trump administration. The US supreme court recently ruled in the US president\u2019s favour and allowed him to use $2.5bn (\u00a32.05bn) of Pentagon funds on four contracts to replace existing sections of barrier with fencing in Arizona, California and New Mexico. Other art projects have been planned for the border. Estudio 3.14, an architectural practice in Mexico, designed a pink interpretation of Trump\u2019s border wall that was inspired by the 20th-century Mexican architect Luis Barrag\u00e1n, employing the pink pastel colour he often used in his designs.

      "bodyText": "Everton have concluded a deal with Juventus to sign Moise Kean for an initial \u20ac32m (\u00a329m) and the forward is due to fly to England on Wednesday to finalise the move. The signing of the 19-year-old Italy international would be a significant coup for Everton, who have also sold the midfielder Idrissa Gueye to Paris Saint-Germain for a fee understood to be \u20ac32m. Everton could end up spending \u20ac40m on Kean with add-ons and have agreed to pay him \u00a32.75m a year. Juventus had wanted a buy-back clause but instead they will be told of any bid so they can choose whether to match it. The player, who had one year remaining on his contract, scored six Serie A goals in 13 appearances last season and has played three times for Italy. Marco Silva had hoped to keep Gueye at Goodison Park this season but the player was determined to join the French champions. \u201cI wanted to give a new boost to my club career by joining Paris St-Germain, one of the most structured and ambitious sports projects in Europe,\u201d Gueye told his new club\u2019s website. Everton have made a substantial profit on the 29-year-old Gueye, who signed from Aston Villa for \u00a38m in 2016. The Senegal international has previously played in France for Lille from 2008-15. Kean was among the Juventus players who had racist abuse directed at them by Cagliari fans during a game there in April. Kean reacted to monkey chants by celebrating in front of the home supporters after scoring.",

      "bodyText": "Two of the most senior intelligence officials in the US and UK privately shared concerns about \u201cour strange situation\u201d as the FBI launched its 2016 investigation into whether Donald Trump\u2019s campaign was colluding with Russia, the Guardian has learned. Text messages between Andrew McCabe, the deputy director of the FBI at the time, and Jeremy Fleming, his then counterpart at MI5, now the head of GCHQ, also reveal their mutual surprise at the result of the EU referendum, which some US officials regarded as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d, according to a person familiar with the matter. While Russia had previously been viewed as a country that would seek to interfere in western elections, the Brexit vote was viewed by some within the FBI as a sign that Russian activities had possibly been successful, the person said. Their exchanges offer new insights into the start of the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation, and how British intelligence appears to have played a key role in the early stages. In one exchange in August 2016, Fleming noted that members of the FBI and MI5 had \u201cmet on our strange situation\u201d, a veiled reference to discussions about Russian activities, according to the source. The text messages between the two men were infrequent and cryptic and did not contain specific or sensitive materials, but occurred with some regularity after the referendum in June 2016. A spokesperson for McCabe declined to comment. The exchanges underscore a sensitive issue in the US \u2013 namely the role foreign intelligence services played in the FBI\u2019s decision to initiate an investigation into the Trump campaign. On 31 July 2016, the FBI opened a covert counterintelligence investigation codenamed \u201cCrossfire Hurricane\u201d into the then presidential candidate\u2019s possible collusion with Russia. The investigation was eventually taken over by the special counsel Robert Mueller, who has said there were \u201cmultiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election\u201d by Russia. Mueller\u2019s 448-page report did not establish a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, but it did identify incidents in which Trump attempted to obstruct justice in the investigation, and did not clear the president of wrongdoing. US and UK intelligence agencies frequently share information, but the exchanges between McCabe and Fleming appear to reflect a desire for a direct line of communication given what was seen as a developing problem on both sides of the Atlantic. In his text message about the August 2016 meeting, Fleming appeared to be making a reference to Peter Strzok, a senior FBI official who travelled to London that month to meet the Australian diplomat Alexander Downer. Downer had agreed to speak with the FBI about a Trump campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, who had told him that Russia had dirt on Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee in the race. The meeting was first reported by the New York Times. When Boris Johnson, the UK foreign secretary at the time, was asked in November 2017 whether Russia had played any role in British elections, he told MPs in a select committee that he had not seen any evidence of such an occurrence. When asked in a follow-up if Russia had sought to play a role, Johnson said: \u201cI don\u2019t know about sought to play, but as far as I know they played no role.\u201d The new revelation comes as authorities in the UK are investigating the funding behind a pro-Brexit campaign, and whether it might have included illegal foreign donations. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating the insurance executive and political donor Arron Banks, who was suspected by the UK\u2019s Electoral Commission of not being the \u201ctrue source\u201d of \u00a38m in funding to the Leave.EU campaign. The matter was referred to the NCA by the commission after it said it had \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to suspect a number of criminal offences. Banks has said there was \u201cno Russian money, no interference\u201d behind the \u00a38m he gave to the unofficial Brexit campaign. The Guardian reported in 2017 that Britain\u2019s spy agencies played a crucial role in alerting their counterparts in Washington to contacts between members of Trump\u2019s campaign team and Russian intelligence operatives. GCHQ became aware in late 2015 of suspicious \u201cinteractions\u201d between figures connected to Trump and known or suspected Russian agents, a source close to UK intelligence said.

Nine months is a long time in politics: Williamson was just a lowly world-famous self-help author and lecturer then \u2013 a name you\u2019d probably know if you were into Deepak Chopra, <a href=\"https://www.tonyrobbins.com/\" title=\"\">Tony Robbins</a> or <a href=\"https://www.louisehay.com/\" title=\"\">Louise Hay</a>, or if you were going through the kind of personal crisis where even ultra-rationalists find themselves drawn to the \u201cmind, body, spirit\u201d aisle of bookshops.</p> <p>A room-mate of the actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/laura-dern\" title=\"\">Laura Dern</a> in her 20s, Williamson had transformed herself into Hollywood\u2019s spiritual darling by her mid-30s. She\u2019s unique among the Democratic candidates in having been both Oprah Winfrey\u2019s spiritual adviser and the officiator at Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s eighth and final wedding at Neverland (where Michael Jackson was best man). The actor Jeff Bridges donated $2,050 to her campaign in May. Williamson is said to have advised Hillary Clinton prior to Clinton\u2019s re-election to the Senate in 2006, teaching her the word \u201cchannelling\u201d, which Clinton then used on the campaign trail. It shows how much American politics has absorbed the language \u2013 even the ideology \u2013 of New Age thinking that, six years later, Bill Clinton said his wife \u201cwas known to commune\u201d with the spirit of Eleanor Roosevelt.</p> <p>Williamson is 67<em><strong>,</strong></em> single, and her daughter is 29 \u2013 that\u2019s all she\u2019ll share about her private life. Professionally, \u201cself-help guru\u201d is not a description she would use. The day I met her, she was taking a day off midway through the European leg of a speaking tour \u2013 <em>Love America</em> \u2013 en route to Dublin, then the continent. I found myself sitting across the table from a poised and serious woman, a strange hybrid of Lauren Bacall and a Jungian therapist.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think of myself as a self-help guru and I do not think anybody who has actually heard me talk or read my books thinks of me as flaky,\u201d she told me sternly. <em>Forbes</em> magazine, which has quoted her a lot over the years, describes her as a businesswoman, but she says she sees herself as a spiritual teacher (of 35 years\u2019 standing), an activist, an entrepreneur, \u201ca bestselling writer, a woman, a mother, an American and a Jew\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02dfc3832660dd43ae791a15d03eec332a4eb78b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02dfc3832660dd43ae791a15d03eec332a4eb78b/0_0_1024_1536/667.jpg\" alt=\"Good causes: Williamson with David Hockney at an Aids charity party.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Good cause: Williamson with David Hockney at an Aids charity party.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Perry/Sygma via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Nine months on</strong></em> from that conversation, what Williamson has decided to do about Trump is to become president herself. She calls me on the road, living out of a suitcase, she says \u2013 not dissimilar to her usual existence, though she\u2019s now preaching the Politics of Love (which is also the title of her latest <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/politics-of-love-9780062873934.html\">book</a>, published in April) \u2013 to the as-yet-unconverted. People mock her love-can-beat-Trump message but don\u2019t actually dislike it.</p> <p>She\u2019s had time to reflect on her performance at the debate and the impact she made. \u201cI can\u2019t really complain about some of the mockery. I mean, some of it has been hilarious. Very little of it was malevolent and a lot of it is quite fascinating. Politics is a long-form conversation. It\u2019s a journey. It\u2019s not a one-night debate.\u201d</p> <p>One of the more memorable moments in Williamson\u2019s stage time came when candidates were asked to name the person they\u2019d call first as president. Biden and Harris stared on in astonishment at Williamson\u2019s reply: \u201cThe prime minister of New Zealand, who said her goal is to make New Zealand the best place in the world for a child to grow up. And I would tell her: \u2018Girlfriend, you are so on.\u2019\u201d Williamson became the most Googled candidate on the second night of the 2020 Democratic debates. \u201cSome people think I\u2019m absolutely bonkers,\u201d she laughs.</p> <p>Like her foes on the far right, Williamson calls for a \u201cnew kind of politics\u201d, but she\u2019s been accused by some on the left of being a Republican-funded plant. \u201cWhat I would say is, true, there are a lot of Republicans who like what I\u2019m saying,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are many people who voted for Trump who say they would vote for me. I think if anything, <em>that</em> would make me more attractive to Democratic voters as a nominee.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a delightful image \u2013 angry Trump voters casting off the president\u2019s hate-filled message to embrace Williamson\u2019s mantras of peace, love and mindfulness. But it\u2019s the left-wing establishment she wants to disrupt just as thoroughly. \u201cThe Democratic party is seen as too cool. Too cool to use words like \u2018patriotism\u2019 and \u2018morality\u2019. I think that\u2019s been very damaging to us politically.\u201d</p> <p>The biggest test to her campaign came when she described mandatory vaccination policies as \u201cdraconian\u201d and \u201cOrwellian\u201d. There was an outcry \u2013 George Orwell died of TB. Although she later apologised, her claim that she \u201csupports vaccinations\u201d came with the caveat \u201cwhen they are called for\u201d. It\u2019s unclear what her policy would be. \u201cI\u2019m not anti-vaccine,\u201d she tells me quite angrily, after an article in the <em>Daily Beast</em> calls her \u201ca dangerous wacko\u201d. \u201cI am pro-science. I have never told anyone to pray away their disease[\u2026] I regret, however, calling it draconian or Orwellian. The government must always come down on the side of public safety.\u201d</p> <p>What about when she said, \u201cThe Aids virus is not more powerful than God\u201d? \u201cI would hope,\u201d she says, \u201cthat if you\u2019re writing an article you might have read my books. Integrative medicine means body, mind and spirit.\u201d In today\u2019s world, she says, the three are no longer considered separate even by the mainstream. \u201cAn oncologist is likely to be the first person to tell someone to go to one of those spiritual support groups. It\u2019s not a fringe activity. If someone does a meditation or a prayer with someone regarding the boosting of their immune system, it is in no way to denigrate or to argue against or to criticise medicine. That is absurd. I\u2019ve never said anything like that. I\u2019ve never written anything like that and my entire career proves otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>She says drug companies pathologise unhappiness, a claim that some have furiously interpreted as: \u201cDepression is all in your head,\u201d and argues that antidepressants are an exploitative, money-making scheme. Then Williamson went further. \u201cHow many public personalities on antidepressants have to hang themselves before the FDA does something?\u201d she Tweeted last June, when the designer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jun/06/kate-spade-obituary\" title=\"\">Kate Spade</a> killed herself. \u201cBig Pharma cops [sticks] to what it knows, and the average person stops falling for this? The tragedies keep compounding. The awakening should begin.\u201d</p> <p>Depression, stress and unhappiness are big themes in her work, as one would expect, and there are plenty who have read her books who say she\u2019s changed, if not saved, their lives. But does she really think people who have been prescribed antidepressants should come off them? Isn\u2019t that dangerous? \u201cOver the past few years,\u201d she says, \u201cthe psychopharmacological and pharmaceutical industries have medicalised depression. Now, I\u2019m not saying there is no such thing as mental illness, but I am saying there is a spectrum of normal human despair that is not mental illness. When someone you love dies, when you go bankrupt, lose something professionally, go through a divorce\u2026 that\u2019s very painful but it\u2019s not a mental illness, and can be better addressed through spiritual rather than pharmaceutical means.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>A day or two </strong></em>after the Democrat debate, Williamson was trending again, this time because she had been left out of a <em>Vogue</em> magazine shoot by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/annie-leibovitz\" title=\"\">Annie Leibo</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/annie-leibovitz\" title=\"\">vitz</a> dedicated to \u201call\u201d the women running for president. Williamson responded by retweeting the picture with her face Photoshopped into it and a Facebook post: \u201cThe framers of the constitution did not make <em>Vogue</em> magazine the gatekeeper of America\u2019s political progress.\u201d The <em>Vogue</em> editor responsible was hauled up on morning talk shows to defend the magazine\u2019s decision on the basis that Williamson, unlike her five female rivals, is not a member of Congress.</p> <p>Williamson\u2019s CV has nothing obviously presidential to recommend it. The daughter of a naturalised Russian immigration lawyer and a homemaker mother, she grew up in Houston, the youngest of three children, and was a teen protester against the Vietnam war, with a rebellious streak and ambitions to be an actor.</p> <p>In her 20s she found herself living an aimless party life in New York when a gift from her then boyfriend changed her life and career. It was a book by the psychologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/15/helen-shucman-course-of-miracles-germany-jesus-christ\" title=\"\">Helen Schucman</a>, a self-study spiritual curriculum called <em>A Course </em><em>in Miracles</em>, the greatest \u201cmiracle\u201d of all being full \u201cawareness of love\u2019s presence\u201d. Williamson found it inspiring and moved to Los Angeles, where she worked at the Philosophical Research Society library. Here, she was invited by its president to lecture about what she\u2019d learned studying Schucman.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I am pro-science. I\u2019ve never told anyone to pray away a\u00a0disease</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Williamson began to build on Schucman\u2019s ideas. Her quasi-religious talks and books began to attract Hollywood\u2019s attention. Shirley MacLaine, Cher and Bette Midler absorbed her lessons on forgiving your parents, saving the world and why death does not exist. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/aug/31/all-aboard-david-geffens-celebrity-strewn-superyacht\" title=\"\">David Geffen</a>, then the richest film mogul in the world, became a key supporter. When her work gained traction in the 1980s among gay men with Aids, Geffen donated $500,000 to help set up <a href=\"https://www.angelfood.org/\" title=\"\">Project Angel Food</a>, a free meal service for men and women too unwell to shop and cook for themselves. David Hockney, Diane von Furstenberg and Kim Basinger joined the honorary advisory board of a subsequent charity. The last time she was as talked about as she is now was probably in 1991, when, at 38, she was profiled in <em>Vanity Fair</em> as \u201cguru of the moment\u201d.</p> <p>She has written 12 books, four of them bestsellers. Her first, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/return-to-love-2.html\">A Return to Love</a></em>, spent 39 weeks on the <em>New York Times</em> best sellers list in 1992. The names of her books coupled with the calibre of celebrities (including members of the Kardashian clan) who supported her failed 2014 congressional bid in California led even the Democrat incumbent, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/lehmanbrothers.banking\" title=\"\">Henry Waxman</a>, to dismiss her as too woo for a more serious career in Washington. That failure weighed heavily on her, though she sees the criticism of her as gendered. \u201cI\u2019m hardly the first woman whose career and contribution is seen differently because of my sex,\u201d she says, and it\u2019s true that the respected philosopher John Gray, who endorsed her candidacy, for example, never gets called a \u201cself-help guru\u201d. </p> <p>So what are her policies? There follows a long shopping list of Democrat ideals, starting with a \u201cmassive infusion of hope and economic opportunity into the sinews of American civilisation\u201d. She would \u201crepeal the 2017 tax cut which gave 83 cents in every $1 to the richest individuals and corporations. I\u2019d stop the corporate subsidies, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jul/30/america-spends-over-20bn-per-year-on-fossil-fuel-subsidies-abolish-them\" title=\"\">$20bn</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jul/30/america-spends-over-20bn-per-year-on-fossil-fuel-subsidies-abolish-them\" title=\"\"> that went to the fossil fuel companies</a> in one year alone. I want to see a $15-an-hour minimum wage. I want to see Medicare for all.\u201d She wants to reverse climate change and give citizenship to America\u2019s 11m undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>As a speaker she has millions of adoring followers, but the majority are women. Does she think her message can appeal to men? \u201cThere\u2019s a saying in publishing,\u201d she says: \u201c\u2018the wives buy the books and their husbands read them.\u2019\u201d In politics, she adds: \u201cAngela Merkel is liked by men in Germany, so my sense is that there are many instances where the fact that the leader is a woman has not created a misogynist backlash even though I think misogyny was definitely involved in the defeat of Hillary Clinton. And so when President Trump said, \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 \u2013 there are so many dog whistles in that statement. What is the great American that he\u2019s talking about, exactly? It implied to a lot of people an America where the men ran the show and the women stood there and looked pretty.\u201d</p> <p>She says that Trump\u2019s recent \u201cGo back\u201d Tweets are \u201cout of every fascist\u2019s playbook\u201d.

Williamson built a career on helping others work through their personal crises, but can she convince the nation to apply her skills to an entire demographic? Come 2020, will we be watching her lead America in a televised group mindfulness meditation? Laugh all you want, then remember who\u2019s president.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The left-wing version of Donald Trump \u2013 perhaps soon to be his nemesis \u2013 could well turn out to be a highly groomed and imposingly articulate best-selling author of spiritual books. Marianne Williamson was written off as a joke until last month when, almost 30 minutes into the televised Democratic debate, as if emerging from a pupa of deep meditation, she calmly blindsided Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and the entire line-up of career politicians beside her, with a solemn vow to \u201charness love\u201d to defeat the fear-mongering president. Within seconds the author of books such as The Age of Miracles and A Course in Weight Loss, the Tweeter of bon mots such as \u201cThe power of your mind is greater than the power of nuclear radiation\u201d, and the advocate of what some Democrats are now describing forcefully as dangerous medical quackery was trending on social media. Now she\u2019s through to this week\u2019s second round of debates, and there are a great many Americans who will be watching for her unpredictable contribution alone. Williamson grew up in Texas, has lived most of her life in California and, in a bid to garner precious votes in the early caucus state of Iowa, recently took the unusual step of moving to its capital, Des Moines. But her accent is strangely borderless \u2013 she doesn\u2019t so much speak as orate, in the low, deliberate, somewhat husky tones of a philosopher: the voice of, it was noted on Twitter, \u201csomeone who just dumped Humphrey Bogart\u201d. She knows she\u2019s not the \u201csafe choice,\u201d she says gravely, \u201cbut I believe that this is a moment and situation where what some might consider a safe choice is the most dangerous choice we can make. Donald Trump is not a politician. Donald Trump is a phenomenon. And it will take a phenomenon to defeat him.\u201d She often talks about \u201cTrump the phenomenon\u201d in interviews, which neatly positions her as his diametric opponent. But will she be the phenomenon to beat Trump? She\u2019s collected enough unique donations to make it back into the overcrowded field of Democrats but is polling at just half a per cent. Can \u201cconscious politics\u201d and \u201cconscious capitalism\u201d vanquish Trump? \u201cNobody knows who\u2019s going to win. This is a very volatile moment in the United States. I am going to do my best to be the Democratic nominee, and if I\u2019m not a nominee I\u2019m going to do my best to support who is.\u201d I first met Williamson last October, in a too-noisy caf\u00e9 in London, around the corner from where her daughter lives. Nine months is a long time in politics: Williamson was just a lowly world-famous self-help author and lecturer then \u2013 a name you\u2019d probably know if you were into Deepak Chopra, Tony Robbins or Louise Hay, or if you were going through the kind of personal crisis where even ultra-rationalists find themselves drawn to the \u201cmind, body, spirit\u201d aisle of bookshops. A room-mate of the actor Laura Dern in her 20s, Williamson had transformed herself into Hollywood\u2019s spiritual darling by her mid-30s. She\u2019s unique among the Democratic candidates in having been both Oprah Winfrey\u2019s spiritual adviser and the officiator at Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s eighth and final wedding at Neverland (where Michael Jackson was best man). The actor Jeff Bridges donated $2,050 to her campaign in May. Williamson is said to have advised Hillary Clinton prior to Clinton\u2019s re-election to the Senate in 2006, teaching her the word \u201cchannelling\u201d, which Clinton then used on the campaign trail. It shows how much American politics has absorbed the language \u2013 even the ideology \u2013 of New Age thinking that, six years later, Bill Clinton said his wife \u201cwas known to commune\u201d with the spirit of Eleanor Roosevelt. Williamson is 67, single, and her daughter is 29 \u2013 that\u2019s all she\u2019ll share about her private life. Professionally, \u201cself-help guru\u201d is not a description she would use. The day I met her, she was taking a day off midway through the European leg of a speaking tour \u2013 Love America \u2013 en route to Dublin, then the continent. I found myself sitting across the table from a poised and serious woman, a strange hybrid of Lauren Bacall and a Jungian therapist. \u201cI don\u2019t think of myself as a self-help guru and I do not think anybody who has actually heard me talk or read my books thinks of me as flaky,\u201d she told me sternly. Forbes magazine, which has quoted her a lot over the years, describes her as a businesswoman, but she says she sees herself as a spiritual teacher (of 35 years\u2019 standing), an activist, an entrepreneur, \u201ca bestselling writer, a woman, a mother, an American and a Jew\u201d. Nine months on from that conversation, what Williamson has decided to do about Trump is to become president herself. She calls me on the road, living out of a suitcase, she says \u2013 not dissimilar to her usual existence, though she\u2019s now preaching the Politics of Love (which is also the title of her latest book, published in April) \u2013 to the as-yet-unconverted. People mock her love-can-beat-Trump message but don\u2019t actually dislike it. She\u2019s had time to reflect on her performance at the debate and the impact she made. \u201cI can\u2019t really complain about some of the mockery. I mean, some of it has been hilarious. Very little of it was malevolent and a lot of it is quite fascinating. Politics is a long-form conversation. It\u2019s a journey. It\u2019s not a one-night debate.\u201d One of the more memorable moments in Williamson\u2019s stage time came when candidates were asked to name the person they\u2019d call first as president. Biden and Harris stared on in astonishment at Williamson\u2019s reply: \u201cThe prime minister of New Zealand, who said her goal is to make New Zealand the best place in the world for a child to grow up. And I would tell her: \u2018Girlfriend, you are so on.\u2019\u201d Williamson became the most Googled candidate on the second night of the 2020 Democratic debates. \u201cSome people think I\u2019m absolutely bonkers,\u201d she laughs. Like her foes on the far right, Williamson calls for a \u201cnew kind of politics\u201d, but she\u2019s been accused by some on the left of being a Republican-funded plant. \u201cWhat I would say is, true, there are a lot of Republicans who like what I\u2019m saying,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are many people who voted for Trump who say they would vote for me. I think if anything, that would make me more attractive to Democratic voters as a nominee.\u201d It\u2019s a delightful image \u2013 angry Trump voters casting off the president\u2019s hate-filled message to embrace Williamson\u2019s mantras of peace, love and mindfulness. But it\u2019s the left-wing establishment she wants to disrupt just as thoroughly. \u201cThe Democratic party is seen as too cool. Too cool to use words like \u2018patriotism\u2019 and \u2018morality\u2019. I think that\u2019s been very damaging to us politically.\u201d The biggest test to her campaign came when she described mandatory vaccination policies as \u201cdraconian\u201d and \u201cOrwellian\u201d. There was an outcry \u2013 George Orwell died of TB. Although she later apologised, her claim that she \u201csupports vaccinations\u201d came with the caveat \u201cwhen they are called for\u201d. It\u2019s unclear what her policy would be. \u201cI\u2019m not anti-vaccine,\u201d she tells me quite angrily, after an article in the Daily Beast calls her \u201ca dangerous wacko\u201d. \u201cI am pro-science.

Williamson\u2019s CV has nothing obviously presidential to recommend it. The daughter of a naturalised Russian immigration lawyer and a homemaker mother, she grew up in Houston, the youngest of three children, and was a teen protester against the Vietnam war, with a rebellious streak and ambitions to be an actor. In her 20s she found herself living an aimless party life in New York when a gift from her then boyfriend changed her life and career. It was a book by the psychologist Helen Schucman, a self-study spiritual curriculum called A Course in Miracles, the greatest \u201cmiracle\u201d of all being full \u201cawareness of love\u2019s presence\u201d. Williamson found it inspiring and moved to Los Angeles, where she worked at the Philosophical Research Society library.

It seemed almost anything was possible, from the resignation of the unpopular incumbent chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/14/carrie-lam-hong-kong-chief-executive-china-beijing-puppet\" title=\"\">Carrie Lam</a>, to the imposition of a curfew to PLA troops on the streets of Hong Kong.</p> <p>As expected, the office\u2019s spokesman Yang Guang expressed support for Lam and her administration, decried the use of violence by protesters, and insisted that Hong Kong\u2019s rule of law should be upheld. But, as with so many messages in China, it was the unspoken that rang loudest.</p> <p>To begin with, Yang acknowledged the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/16/hong-kong-protests-carrie-lam-china\" title=\"\">peaceful protests</a> that had been held in opposition to Lam\u2019s extradition bill, and further acknowledged that Lam had suspended work on the bill as a result. This in itself was remarkable: it would seem anathema to Beijing to publicly recognise the fact and effectiveness of political protest in Hong Kong, when such a possibility is unthinkable in the mainland.</p> <p>Second, while Yang unsurprisingly expressed support for Lam and her administration, his comments contained veiled criticism. Yang said that there had been \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in the way Lam\u2019s administration handled the extradition bill, leading the council to \u201creflect\u201d upon its governing style. In China, where leaders are universally regarded as infallible (until, that is, they very publicly fall from grace) this is an extremely harsh statement. It also has some historical resonance: following similar mass demonstrations in Hong Kong, then-president <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/21/world/president-of-china-warns-hong-kongs-leader-to-do-a-better-job.html?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=CFA1B2FC58D4109EF8961148BD60124F&amp;gwt=pay\" title=\"\">Hu Jintao famously advised</a> Hong Kong\u2019s inaugural chief executive Tung Chee-hwa to \u201cidentify his deficiencies\u201d in a December 2004 public appearance. By the following March, Tung had resigned, citing ill health. Today\u2019s thinly veiled criticism does not bode well for the longevity of Lam\u2019s administration.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Beijing regards this, quite correctly, as a purely domestic problem for Hong Kong</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The focus in Yang\u2019s prepared remarks on upholding Hong Kong\u2019s rule of law, and severely punishing those who have engaged in acts of violence, was clearly intended for consumption by an international audience for whom Hong Kong\u2019s rule of law is seen as a core value. But alongside this statement, Yang also expressed support for Hong Kong\u2019s police force in its mission of upholding the law. This was a clear indication from Beijing that it has no intention of involving the PLA, however it also signalled Beijing\u2019s assent to the Hong Kong police adopting harsher policing tactics. It is perhaps no coincidence that police also announced today that they would begin road tests this week for three powerful new riot control water cannon vehicles, with a view to deploying them on Hong Kong\u2019s streets by mid-August.</p> <p>Also surprising, given recent rhetoric, was that the malign influence of \u201cforeign forces\u201d did not receive more airtime. Indeed, foreign influence was not addressed in Yang\u2019s initial prepared remarks, and was only raised in a question from official state news agency Xinhua. While Yang did criticise foreign politicians, who he said wanted to make Hong Kong into a \u201cproblem\u201d for China, there were no references to \u201ccolour revolutions\u201d or \u201dblack hands\u201d, a welcome dialling-back on recent hysteria. </p> <p>This suggests that those in the highest levels of government in Beijing regard this, quite correctly, as a purely domestic problem for Hong Kong. Unfortunately, they seem to continue to be looking to blame it on the wrong targets. Affairs office spokeswoman Xu Luying, speaking of social problems in Hong Kong, focused on economic issues such as youth opportunity, social mobility and housing affordability.

      "bodyText": "After another weekend of violent clashes between protesters and police, Hong Kong held its collective breath on Monday afternoon as the Chinese state council\u2019s Hong Kong and Macau affairs office \u2013 the cabinet-level office with responsibility for Hong Kong policy \u2013 held a press conference to give its views on the \u201cHong Kong problem\u201d. With official state media over the past week ramping up reports of \u201cextremist elements\u201d and foreign \u201cblack hands\u201d, and senior establishment figures openly referring to the possibility of the People\u2019s Liberation Army being deployed, Hong Kongers were braced for potentially paradigm-shifting news. It seemed almost anything was possible, from the resignation of the unpopular incumbent chief executive, Carrie Lam, to the imposition of a curfew to PLA troops on the streets of Hong Kong. As expected, the office\u2019s spokesman Yang Guang expressed support for Lam and her administration, decried the use of violence by protesters, and insisted that Hong Kong\u2019s rule of law should be upheld. But, as with so many messages in China, it was the unspoken that rang loudest. To begin with, Yang acknowledged the peaceful protests that had been held in opposition to Lam\u2019s extradition bill, and further acknowledged that Lam had suspended work on the bill as a result. This in itself was remarkable: it would seem anathema to Beijing to publicly recognise the fact and effectiveness of political protest in Hong Kong, when such a possibility is unthinkable in the mainland. Second, while Yang unsurprisingly expressed support for Lam and her administration, his comments contained veiled criticism. Yang said that there had been \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in the way Lam\u2019s administration handled the extradition bill, leading the council to \u201creflect\u201d upon its governing style. In China, where leaders are universally regarded as infallible (until, that is, they very publicly fall from grace) this is an extremely harsh statement. It also has some historical resonance: following similar mass demonstrations in Hong Kong, then-president Hu Jintao famously advised Hong Kong\u2019s inaugural chief executive Tung Chee-hwa to \u201cidentify his deficiencies\u201d in a December 2004 public appearance. By the following March, Tung had resigned, citing ill health. Today\u2019s thinly veiled criticism does not bode well for the longevity of Lam\u2019s administration. The focus in Yang\u2019s prepared remarks on upholding Hong Kong\u2019s rule of law, and severely punishing those who have engaged in acts of violence, was clearly intended for consumption by an international audience for whom Hong Kong\u2019s rule of law is seen as a core value. But alongside this statement, Yang also expressed support for Hong Kong\u2019s police force in its mission of upholding the law. This was a clear indication from Beijing that it has no intention of involving the PLA, however it also signalled Beijing\u2019s assent to the Hong Kong police adopting harsher policing tactics. It is perhaps no coincidence that police also announced today that they would begin road tests this week for three powerful new riot control water cannon vehicles, with a view to deploying them on Hong Kong\u2019s streets by mid-August. Also surprising, given recent rhetoric, was that the malign influence of \u201cforeign forces\u201d did not receive more airtime. Indeed, foreign influence was not addressed in Yang\u2019s initial prepared remarks, and was only raised in a question from official state news agency Xinhua. While Yang did criticise foreign politicians, who he said wanted to make Hong Kong into a \u201cproblem\u201d for China, there were no references to \u201ccolour revolutions\u201d or \u201dblack hands\u201d, a welcome dialling-back on recent hysteria. This suggests that those in the highest levels of government in Beijing regard this, quite correctly, as a purely domestic problem for Hong Kong. Unfortunately, they seem to continue to be looking to blame it on the wrong targets. Affairs office spokeswoman Xu Luying, speaking of social problems in Hong Kong, focused on economic issues such as youth opportunity, social mobility and housing affordability. This holds out hope that Beijing intends to work with the Hong Kong government and, perhaps more importantly, Hong Kong\u2019s all-powerful tycoons in addressing housing prices and other business and economic issues. However, while these indeed contribute to discontent in Hong Kong, Beijing would be sorely mistaken to believe this to be the root cause. The real motivation bringing Hong Kong people out on to the streets every weekend can be heard in the slogans they now chant: \u201cDemocracy now!\u201d and \u201cReclaim Hong Kong! Revolution of our times!\u201d The extradition bill that originally motivated the present protest movement and the livelihood issues Beijing is targeting are merely symptomatic of what Hong Kong\u2019s protesters see as the underlying cause: Hong Kong\u2019s undemocratic system, under which the people are governed by a government beholden to Beijing and accountable to Hong Kong\u2019s tycoon class, and not governing in the interests of the people. Until democratic reforms are introduced, the protesters believe, Hong Kong will not see meaningful change. With no policy initiatives or specific measures coming out of today\u2019s announcements, one thing is certain: protests in Hong Kong will continue. If Beijing does not realise that it will take more than economic fixes to bring an end to the current crisis, the cycle of protest and crackdown seems likely only to intensify. \u2022 Antony Dapiran is a Hong Kong-based writer and lawyer and the author of City of Protest: A Recent History of Dissent in Hong Kong",

According to Shannon Lee, Bruce \u2013 a trainer of many Hollywood figures, including Steve McQueen, Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate \u2013 avoided fighting people who were not martial arts experts. \u201c[But] here, he\u2019s the one with all the puffery and he\u2019s the one challenging Brad Pitt. Which is not how he was.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can understand all the reasoning behind what is portrayed in the movie.

      "bodyText": "Bruce Lee\u2019s daughter, Shannon, has hit out at the portrayal of her father in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Quentin Tarantino\u2019s new film set in the late 1960s film industry, saying it was disheartening and uncomfortable. Speaking to the Wrap, Shannon Lee said: \u201c[Bruce Lee] comes across as an arrogant asshole who was full of hot air, and not someone who had to fight triple as hard as any of those people did to accomplish what was naturally given to so many others.\u201d She added: \u201cIt was really uncomfortable to sit in the theatre and listen to people laugh at my father.\u201d Lee, who died in 1973, achieved major film stardom in the early 70s via a string of Hong Kong-produced martial arts films, after years of trying and failing to interest Hollywood in his projects. He is portrayed in Tarantino\u2019s film by Mike Moh, who Lee claims was \u201cdirected to be a caricature\u201d. Criticism of Lee\u2019s treatment in the film centres on a scene where he challenges stunt performer Cliff Booth (played by Brad Pitt) to a fight, in an encounter where Booth appears to get the better of him. According to Shannon Lee, Bruce \u2013 a trainer of many Hollywood figures, including Steve McQueen, Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate \u2013 avoided fighting people who were not martial arts experts. \u201c[But] here, he\u2019s the one with all the puffery and he\u2019s the one challenging Brad Pitt. Which is not how he was.\u201d \u201cI can understand all the reasoning behind what is portrayed in the movie. I understand that the two [lead] characters are antiheroes, and this is sort of like a rage fantasy of what would happen \u2026 and they\u2019re portraying a period that clearly had a lot of racism and exclusion,\u201d she said. \u201cI understand they want to make the Brad Pitt character this super-badass who could beat up Bruce Lee. But they didn\u2019t need to treat him in the way that white Hollywood did when he was alive.\u201d The Guardian has contacted Quentin Tarantino for a response. Tarantino has been a vocal admirer of Bruce Lee, most notably dressing Uma Thurman in a replica of Lee\u2019s yellow jumpsuit in his two-part martial arts film Kill Bill. Shannon Lee is president of the Bruce Lee Foundation, CEO of Bruce Lee Entertainment and is an executive producer on the 2019 TV show Warrior, based on one of her father\u2019s unmade projects. Lee added: \u201cWhat I\u2019m interested in is raising the consciousness of who Bruce Lee was as a human being and how he lived his life. All of that was flushed down the toilet in this portrayal, and made my father into this arrogant punching bag.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s financial watchdog has <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-acts-protect-consumers-transferring-out-defined-benefit-pension-schemes\">proposed measures</a> to protect consumers transferring out of defined benefit pension schemes, including a ban on contingent charging for advice and a clampdown on ongoing fees over 20 to 30 years \u2013 practices it said were costing customers \u00a32bn a year.</p> <p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) plans to ban financial advisers from getting paid only when a customer transfers a pension, known as contingent charging, which it says creates a bias to recommend a transfer. Consumers were given <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/19/chancellor-scrap-compulsory-annuities-pension-overhaul\">freedoms</a> in 2015 to move their pension pots between schemes or to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/28/pension-freedom-withdrawals-accelerate-to-top-6bn\">withdraw their money</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/pension-types\">Defined benefit pension schemes</a> are workplace pensions arranged by an employer, where the amount people are paid is based on their salary and how many years they have worked. Most people are now in defined contribution pension schemes, where the pension pot is based on how much is paid in by employers and employees.</p> <p>Most consumers are advised on a contingent charging basis. The FCA found 69% of consumers are advised to transfer despite its view that most would be best advised to stick with their existing scheme. It estimates unsuitable pension transfer advice costs consumers up to \u00a32bn each year.</p> <p>The move comes after Frank Field, the chair of the House of Commons work and pensions committee, called for action on contingent charging to protect consumers from the <a href=\"https://international-adviser.com/uk-committee-to-tackle-scourge-of-contingent-charging/\">\u201cvultures circling around their pension pots\u201d</a>. The committee found in February that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/feb/15/steelworkers-let-down-by-fca-and-pensions-regulator-mps\">former British Steel workers had been \u201cshamelessly bamboozled\u201d</a> by commission-hungry financial advisers into transferring their pensions and badly let down by regulators.</p> <p>The watchdog said it would also address conflicts of interest that arise when a financial adviser stands to receive ongoing fees, which in some cases can be for 20 to 30 years following the transfer. The FCA said advisers would have to show why a scheme they recommend is more suitable than the customer\u2019s workplace pension scheme.</p> <p>The FCA said in its consultation paper: \u201cWe believe the current situation is unsustainable. Too many consumers are receiving unsuitable advice, resulting in too many consumers transferring when it is not in their best interests to do so.\u201d</p> <p>Christopher Woolard, the executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA, said: \u201cBy making changes to the way advisers are paid for transfer advice and the other changes to transfer advice we are proposing today, we want to ensure people receive suitable advice and drive down the number giving up valuable defined benefit pensions when it is not in their interests to do so.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other proposed measures include introducing low-cost advice for customers who should not transfer, improving how charges are disclosed and setting out how advisers should demonstrate customers\u2019 understanding of the advice.</p> <p>The consumer group Which? welcomed the plans, but Gareth Shaw, its head of money, added: \u201cIt is disappointing that the regulator has stopped short of introducing a cap on charges for pension drawdown products, to stop savers from sleepwalking into costly products that can drain the money they\u2019ve worked hard to save over their careers.\u201d</p> <p>The FCA is consulting on the changes until 30 October and expects to announce final rules early next year.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s financial watchdog has proposed measures to protect consumers transferring out of defined benefit pension schemes, including a ban on contingent charging for advice and a clampdown on ongoing fees over 20 to 30 years \u2013 practices it said were costing customers \u00a32bn a year. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) plans to ban financial advisers from getting paid only when a customer transfers a pension, known as contingent charging, which it says creates a bias to recommend a transfer. Consumers were given freedoms in 2015 to move their pension pots between schemes or to withdraw their money. Defined benefit pension schemes are workplace pensions arranged by an employer, where the amount people are paid is based on their salary and how many years they have worked. Most people are now in defined contribution pension schemes, where the pension pot is based on how much is paid in by employers and employees. Most consumers are advised on a contingent charging basis. The FCA found 69% of consumers are advised to transfer despite its view that most would be best advised to stick with their existing scheme. It estimates unsuitable pension transfer advice costs consumers up to \u00a32bn each year. The move comes after Frank Field, the chair of the House of Commons work and pensions committee, called for action on contingent charging to protect consumers from the \u201cvultures circling around their pension pots\u201d. The committee found in February that former British Steel workers had been \u201cshamelessly bamboozled\u201d by commission-hungry financial advisers into transferring their pensions and badly let down by regulators. The watchdog said it would also address conflicts of interest that arise when a financial adviser stands to receive ongoing fees, which in some cases can be for 20 to 30 years following the transfer. The FCA said advisers would have to show why a scheme they recommend is more suitable than the customer\u2019s workplace pension scheme. The FCA said in its consultation paper: \u201cWe believe the current situation is unsustainable. Too many consumers are receiving unsuitable advice, resulting in too many consumers transferring when it is not in their best interests to do so.\u201d Christopher Woolard, the executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA, said: \u201cBy making changes to the way advisers are paid for transfer advice and the other changes to transfer advice we are proposing today, we want to ensure people receive suitable advice and drive down the number giving up valuable defined benefit pensions when it is not in their interests to do so.\u201d Other proposed measures include introducing low-cost advice for customers who should not transfer, improving how charges are disclosed and setting out how advisers should demonstrate customers\u2019 understanding of the advice. The consumer group Which? welcomed the plans, but Gareth Shaw, its head of money, added: \u201cIt is disappointing that the regulator has stopped short of introducing a cap on charges for pension drawdown products, to stop savers from sleepwalking into costly products that can drain the money they\u2019ve worked hard to save over their careers.\u201d The FCA is consulting on the changes until 30 October and expects to announce final rules early next year. It will consult with firms on new rules for non-workplace pension schemes in early 2020.",

      "body": "<p>Edu was reading Robert Kiyosaki\u2019s <em>Rich Dad, Poor Dad</em> when Gilberto Silva said to him: \u201cYou will become a manager in the future. You have the perfect profile.\u201d Almost two decades later his then-Arsenal teammate\u2019s prophecy has been proved right. Edu has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/09/arsenal-edu-football\" title=\"\">returned to the club</a> as technical director tasked with restoring the success he enjoyed there as a player, including as a member <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/17/arsenal-invincible-season-arsene-wenger-inside-story\" title=\"\">of 2003-04\u2019s Invincibles</a>.</p> <p>Edu may not be a manager in the traditional English sense but his management and executive skills have earned him three technical director roles since he gave up playing. The midfielder retired while with Corinthians in December 2010 and three months later received an unexpected invitation to take that position at the Brazilian club.</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t know what to do after he stopped playing football,\u201d says Du\u00edlio Monteiro Alves, one of the directors who invited Edu to work for the S\u00e3o Paulo side. \u201cHowever, he had all the qualities to become a great director. He is very different: polite, speaks many languages and has great experience in Europe. It was the best choice.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/29/premier-league-2019-20-preview-arsenal-unai-emery-champions-league-pepe\">Premier League 2019\u201120 preview No 1: Arsenal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first months were testing, though. Corinthians had great players such as Ronaldo and Roberto Carlos but had been eliminated from the Copa Libertadores a month earlier after a painful defeat by the Colombian club Tolima. One of his first aims was to restore calm to the dressing room and explain to the squad how he would operate.</p> <p>\u201cWhen he took over he was very clear,\u201d recalls Chic\u00e3o, the club\u2019s former defender and captain. \u201cHe said that he was a director but he would remain a friend to the players, that he would work hard to bring peace to our team. We couldn\u2019t bring these problems on to the pitch. He promised this and did it.\u201d</p> <p>Edu formed a great partnership with the coach, Tite. Together they won the Copa Libertadores, Brazilian championship, Club World Cup, Paulista championship and the Recopa. It earned the pair promotion to the national team in 2016, working alongside Sylvinho, a former colleague of Edu\u2019s at Arsenal, and Matheus Bachi, Tite\u2019s son.</p> <p>\u201cEdu knows how to delegate roles,\u201d says Bachi. \u201cThe first time I worked with him he asked me to write a report. I did it very well and from then I earned his trust. We were a team. We had a staff to analyse any potential talents for Corinthians. He read the reports, studied all the players and then gave a list to Tite to decide who to sign. Everyone had their input into the decision.\u201d</p> <p>Mauri Lima, a Corinthians goalkeeper coach under Edu, was also impressed. \u201cHe was the best at organising everything in the background and creating a good atmosphere for our players to shine. When he won the Club World Cup in 2012 with Corinthians I called him to congratulate him on his amazing work. At Corinthians we worked together for six years. He oversaw a revolution. I\u2019ve never seen a bad relationship between him and any coach. He has the confidence of the president, players and all members of staff.\u201d</p> <p>When Edu left Corinthians to take up the role with Brazil, he was criticised by Andr\u00e9s Sanchez, the club\u2019s president. Sanchez, when questioned by <em>the Observer </em>about his stance, says: \u201cI don\u2019t talk about him. Let him be happy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7fc3174bbabbe2e94993bdfb2a2c9a01afc488b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7fc3174bbabbe2e94993bdfb2a2c9a01afc488b/0_0_3282_2474/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edu with Arsenal head of football Raul Sanllehi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"754\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edu with Arsenal head of football Raul Sanllehi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The friendship ended when Edu\u2019s new job was announced a few days after he had denied he was negotiating a deal with the Brazilian football federation, the CBF.</p> <p>As a coordinator for the CBF, Edu was less successful. Brazil\u2019s youth teams underperformed, eliminated early in the South American Under-17 and Under-20 championships in 2019 despite being full of talented prospects. Two years ago the Under-20s failed to qualify for the World Cup. Before Edu the youth teams could call on three technical scouts, whereas now there is one professional. For one year under his control the Under-20s did not have a coach.</p> <p>For the senior team the problems started with the organisation for the 2018 World Cup. Selecting Brazil\u2019s training base in Sochi created a problem because of the long distances to each match. During the group stage Brazil clocked up 7,000km, more than three times that of Argentina.</p> <p>Edu was widely criticised for seeming to pander to their star player, Neymar. At the end of the World Cup Edu said: \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy to be Neymar. It\u2019s very hard. He is a little boy. Sorry, he is an athlete. He is an athlete that deserves my praise.\u201d He added: \u201cI feel pity for him in some moments, because what this boy suffers isn\u2019t easy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rog\u00e9rio Caboclo, the CBF president, lost confidence in Edu and the switch to Arsenal was timely for both parties. To many the challenge for Edu at the Emirates is harder than at Corinthians and with Brazil, because of the state of the Premier League club. For the third year in a row Arsenal have failed to qualify for the Champions League and they conspicuously lack the financial power of rivals.</p> <p>Yet in Edu\u2019s native Brazil there are key figures in the game who believe he can help create an environment to improve Arsenal. The former Corinthians president Roberto de Andrade says: \u201cEdu knows the business very well, the game and everything around it. I think he can do something different. In Brazil it\u2019s harder than working in England. Like Arsenal we didn\u2019t have so much money and he helped us to form a great team.\u201d</p> <p>Gilberto agrees but calls for patience. \u201cIt\u2019s worrying when you can\u2019t compete with other clubs for good players but Arsenal need to sign around three or four players,\u201d he says. \u201cA big difference from the national team, he will now face daily pressure. You play every week and you are tested every day. But little by little he will adapt.\u201d</p> <p>Edu\u2019s appointment has the approval of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, and Gilberto sees similarities with his former manager. \u201cArs\u00e8ne doesn\u2019t like to rush decisions. He had his own style, he took care of everything. All was very measured, despite having so many things to consider. I see the same in Edu. He is very careful and calculates every step. I think he will have success at Arsenal.\u201d</p> <p>The job reunites Edu with Unai Emery, the pair having worked together at Valencia in 2008-09. The club then had David Villa, David Silva, Marchena and Ra\u00fal Albiol but Edu was one of the most important voices. \u201cHe is a real leader,\u201d says the former Valencia goalkeeper Renan. \u201cBecause of his history and daily attitude, he has that impact .\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Edu was reading Robert Kiyosaki\u2019s Rich Dad, Poor Dad when Gilberto Silva said to him: \u201cYou will become a manager in the future. You have the perfect profile.\u201d Almost two decades later his then-Arsenal teammate\u2019s prophecy has been proved right. Edu has returned to the club as technical director tasked with restoring the success he enjoyed there as a player, including as a member of 2003-04\u2019s Invincibles. Edu may not be a manager in the traditional English sense but his management and executive skills have earned him three technical director roles since he gave up playing. The midfielder retired while with Corinthians in December 2010 and three months later received an unexpected invitation to take that position at the Brazilian club. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know what to do after he stopped playing football,\u201d says Du\u00edlio Monteiro Alves, one of the directors who invited Edu to work for the S\u00e3o Paulo side. \u201cHowever, he had all the qualities to become a great director. He is very different: polite, speaks many languages and has great experience in Europe. It was the best choice.\u201d The first months were testing, though. Corinthians had great players such as Ronaldo and Roberto Carlos but had been eliminated from the Copa Libertadores a month earlier after a painful defeat by the Colombian club Tolima. One of his first aims was to restore calm to the dressing room and explain to the squad how he would operate. \u201cWhen he took over he was very clear,\u201d recalls Chic\u00e3o, the club\u2019s former defender and captain. \u201cHe said that he was a director but he would remain a friend to the players, that he would work hard to bring peace to our team. We couldn\u2019t bring these problems on to the pitch. He promised this and did it.\u201d Edu formed a great partnership with the coach, Tite. Together they won the Copa Libertadores, Brazilian championship, Club World Cup, Paulista championship and the Recopa. It earned the pair promotion to the national team in 2016, working alongside Sylvinho, a former colleague of Edu\u2019s at Arsenal, and Matheus Bachi, Tite\u2019s son. \u201cEdu knows how to delegate roles,\u201d says Bachi. \u201cThe first time I worked with him he asked me to write a report. I did it very well and from then I earned his trust. We were a team. We had a staff to analyse any potential talents for Corinthians. He read the reports, studied all the players and then gave a list to Tite to decide who to sign. Everyone had their input into the decision.\u201d Mauri Lima, a Corinthians goalkeeper coach under Edu, was also impressed. \u201cHe was the best at organising everything in the background and creating a good atmosphere for our players to shine. When he won the Club World Cup in 2012 with Corinthians I called him to congratulate him on his amazing work. At Corinthians we worked together for six years. He oversaw a revolution. I\u2019ve never seen a bad relationship between him and any coach. He has the confidence of the president, players and all members of staff.\u201d When Edu left Corinthians to take up the role with Brazil, he was criticised by Andr\u00e9s Sanchez, the club\u2019s president. Sanchez, when questioned by the Observer about his stance, says: \u201cI don\u2019t talk about him. Let him be happy.\u201d The friendship ended when Edu\u2019s new job was announced a few days after he had denied he was negotiating a deal with the Brazilian football federation, the CBF. As a coordinator for the CBF, Edu was less successful. Brazil\u2019s youth teams underperformed, eliminated early in the South American Under-17 and Under-20 championships in 2019 despite being full of talented prospects. Two years ago the Under-20s failed to qualify for the World Cup. Before Edu the youth teams could call on three technical scouts, whereas now there is one professional. For one year under his control the Under-20s did not have a coach. For the senior team the problems started with the organisation for the 2018 World Cup. Selecting Brazil\u2019s training base in Sochi created a problem because of the long distances to each match. During the group stage Brazil clocked up 7,000km, more than three times that of Argentina. Edu was widely criticised for seeming to pander to their star player, Neymar. At the end of the World Cup Edu said: \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy to be Neymar. It\u2019s very hard. He is a little boy. Sorry, he is an athlete. He is an athlete that deserves my praise.\u201d He added: \u201cI feel pity for him in some moments, because what this boy suffers isn\u2019t easy.\u201d Rog\u00e9rio Caboclo, the CBF president, lost confidence in Edu and the switch to Arsenal was timely for both parties. To many the challenge for Edu at the Emirates is harder than at Corinthians and with Brazil, because of the state of the Premier League club. For the third year in a row Arsenal have failed to qualify for the Champions League and they conspicuously lack the financial power of rivals. Yet in Edu\u2019s native Brazil there are key figures in the game who believe he can help create an environment to improve Arsenal. The former Corinthians president Roberto de Andrade says: \u201cEdu knows the business very well, the game and everything around it. I think he can do something different. In Brazil it\u2019s harder than working in England. Like Arsenal we didn\u2019t have so much money and he helped us to form a great team.\u201d Gilberto agrees but calls for patience. \u201cIt\u2019s worrying when you can\u2019t compete with other clubs for good players but Arsenal need to sign around three or four players,\u201d he says. \u201cA big difference from the national team, he will now face daily pressure. You play every week and you are tested every day. But little by little he will adapt.\u201d Edu\u2019s appointment has the approval of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, and Gilberto sees similarities with his former manager. \u201cArs\u00e8ne doesn\u2019t like to rush decisions. He had his own style, he took care of everything. All was very measured, despite having so many things to consider. I see the same in Edu. He is very careful and calculates every step. I think he will have success at Arsenal.\u201d The job reunites Edu with Unai Emery, the pair having worked together at Valencia in 2008-09. The club then had David Villa, David Silva, Marchena and Ra\u00fal Albiol but Edu was one of the most important voices. \u201cHe is a real leader,\u201d says the former Valencia goalkeeper Renan. \u201cBecause of his history and daily attitude, he has that impact .\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Iain Conn has agreed to step down as chief executive of Centrica, the owner of British Gas, after the energy company swung to a loss for the first half of the year and slashed shareholder payouts. The embattled energy boss said he would retire from the board by next year\u2019s annual general meeting, five years after taking the reins of the company in 2015. The former BP executive has faced increasing pressure to step down after a steady decline in the company\u2019s market value, which is now a quarter of what it was when Conn took the top job. Since then Britain\u2019s biggest energy supplier has lost over 1m customer accounts and made thousands of job cuts as part of a plan to steady the company. Conn said he had \u201cagreed with the board that this is the right thing to do\u201d after \u201cmonths of talks\u201d over the company\u2019s future. He announced his departure alongside worse-than-expected financial results for the first half of the year, and a \u201cdeeply regrettable\u201d dividend cut for investors. Centrica\u2019s shareholders, which include about 600,000 individual investors, will receive less than half the expected return after the company slashed its interim dividend by 58% to 1.5p a share. It said the full-year dividend total will also be cut by 58%, from 12p to 5p a share. The company\u2019s share share price plunged 19% on Tuesday to 77p, the lowest in more than 20 years, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. The company announced its lowest dividend in 15 years less than four months after revealing it had handed Conn a 44% pay rise for 2018 to \u00a32.4m. The hike in pay angered trade unions and was awarded despite a difficult year in which the company imposed two bill increases, warned on profits and announced 4,000 job cuts. Conn said he had reinvested most of his bonus payouts in the company while he worked to shift Centrica\u2019s traditional energy business towards selling energy services and devices. Many City analysts are unconvinced that the plan can bear fruit after a series of disappointing financial results for Centrica in recent years. The company posted a pretax loss of \u00a3569m for the six months to 30 June compared with a profit of \u00a3415m last year. Centrica blamed an \u201cexceptionally challenging\u201d environment in the first half of 2019, including the government price cap on standard energy tariffs and additional pension contributions. The swing to a pretax loss is the latest blow to the owner of Britain\u2019s biggest energy supplier which was already planning to sell its nuclear, oil and gas business units to pay off debts and cut thousands of jobs from its shrinking workforce. \u201cIt has been an exceptionally challenging first half with some really difficult circumstances,\u201d Conn said. \u201cOur results were weak.\u201d The group took a pretax charge of \u00a3346m in the first half. This included \u00a3257m of restructuring costs, \u00a364m one-off pension costs and asset writedowns of nearly \u00a390m, partly due to the fall in near-term gas prices. But Conn said the company \u201chas momentum\u201d which should see a return to growth in the second half of the year and into 2020. Although British Gas lost 178,000 UK home energy supply accounts in the first half, the figures mark a slowdown in losses compared with recent years because its prices are more competitive and its brand remains strong, Conn said. He said Centrica\u2019s new deal with Ford to provide electric vehicle tariffs and charge points was an example of \u201cwhere we are moving to\u201d in the future. Centrica plans to exit oil and gas production to focus on customers, and expects to sell its last major asset, its stake in the oil and gas venture Spirit Energy, by the end of 2020. Conn added that the company is speaking to \u201cat least two groups\u201d of investors which are interested in buying its stake in EDF Energy\u2019s fleet of UK nuclear reactors. Charles Berry, the chairman, said: \u201cIain has led the strategic repositioning of Centrica since 2015 and has been the driving force behind our plan to turn Centrica into a sustainable business.\u201d",

Teams collect points over a two-year cycle, with the top two playing in the final in June 2021.

He\u2019d love to end as he started, too: Bayliss\u2019s first series was the 3-2 victory over Australia in 2015.</p> <p><strong>8) </strong>The inclusion of the Cape Town Three \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/29/australia-good-tempered-ashes-england-cricket\">David Warner, Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft</a> \u2013 in Australia\u2019s Ashes squad should ensure a summer of bantermime booing and sandpaper-based props.

For the first time, players with have their name and number on the back of their shirts: as in white-ball cricket, Joe Root will wear No 66, proving that the responsibility of captaincy need not get in the way of a popular pun. 2) After years of vetoes and false starts, the all-singing, all-dancing, all-context-providing Test Championship will begin this week. Teams collect points over a two-year cycle, with the top two playing in the final in June 2021. There are 120 points available in each series, so winning a match in a two-Test series is worth more (60 points) than if there are five matches (24 points). But you can lose points as well \u2026 3) The ICC has changed its approach to slow over-rates. Instead of suspending the captain, they will now hit all 11 players where it really hurts: in the Test Championship. If a team wins any points during the match, they will lose two for each over they were short of the required rate. 4) Once upon a time, Ashes series in England began in June and ended in August. The modern schedule is designed to squeeze as much as possible from the lemon, so since 2001 the series have started in July. This year, for the first time in Ashes history, the series will start in August, one day before the start of the Football League season. The latest ever start goes hand in hand with the latest ever finish \u2026 5) There has only ever been one Ashes Test in September, a long-forgotten match at the Oval in 2005.

The Bank of England has a 2% inflation target and would in normal circumstances raise interest rates to keep inflation under control. However, faced with a global economic slowdown and no-deal Brexit risks at home, the Bank has limited room for manoeuvre. Fabrice Montagn\u00e9, the chief UK economist at Barclays, said: \u201c[The Bank will] insist that economic uncertainty is translating into policy uncertainty.\u201d The Bank of England will provide an update on its thinking at the publication of its quarterly inflation report on Thursday. The lower pound could benefit UK exporters, as British goods become cheaper for overseas buyers. However, economists question whether the sharp drop in 2016 led to a significant rise in exports, as UK companies have complex supply chains \u2013 requiring components from abroad that went up in price, eroding their margins. Andrew Wishart, UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said the betting markets implied the chances of no-deal Brexit had risen to about 38% from 30% last week. Crashing out without a deal could send sterling tumbling to parity against the dollar, breaking the all-time low of $1.05 recorded in 1985. \u201cBetting odds probably underestimate the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit as they only cover the chances of one this year,\u201d he said.",

He adopted the name A$AP Rocky when he began his career in 2007, joining the A$AP Mob crew.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Mayers had a troubled childhood. His elder brother was murdered, his dad was arrested for drug dealing, and he spent some time moving around homeless shelters with his mother and sister. His older sister died of a drug overdose in 2016. Mayers himself served two weeks in prison for drug dealing in 2004.</p>\n    <p>He came to prominence with the release of the mixtape Live.Love.A$AP in 2011. Having signed to a major-label deal&nbsp; for a reported $3m, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/10/asap-rocky-long-live-review\">his 2013 debut album, Long.Live.A$AP</a> debuted at No 1 on the US Billboard 200.

Prosecutors allege the platinum-selling artist, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, and two members of his entourage \u201cdeliberately, together and in agreement\u201d attacked the alleged victim, Mustafa Jafari, in the Swedish capital on 30 June. The men, who say they were responding to harassment and provocations, have been in custody since 3 July and face up to two years in prison if the charges, for assault causing actual bodily harm, are upheld.

      "body": "<p>Nothing about Caroline Spiegel would suggest she\u2019s at the helm of a new women\u2019s porn site \u2013 except, perhaps, the background on her phone. The face of her cracked iPhone screen bears the cartoon likeness of Wonder Woman masturbating, a word Spiegel refers to as \u201cgettin\u2019 it done\u201d. And getting it done is big business these days: <a href=\"https://tryquinn.com/\">Quinn</a>, Spiegel\u2019s New York-based adult startup, is just one of a litany of female-founded companies taking a slice of an estimated $30bn sex tech industry. The term \u201csex tech\u201d encompasses everything from sex toys to fertility apps. And, in typical millennial fashion, Spiegel\u2019s pornography comes with a side helping of purpose.</p> <p>\u201cQuinn\u2019s overall goal, our grand mission, is to be an intimacy guide for the new generation,\u201d the 22-year-old says. \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t seem like that on the surface \u2026 but we\u2019re trying to open up this conversation by bringing porn to a more inclusive place and making it [span] this bigger emotional scale.\u201d</p> <p>What sets Quinn apart from an ocean of other porn sites is its visual-free ethos and focus on written and audio sex stories. The website has no imagery whatsoever, and nary a banner ad for sexual enhancement pills or CGI sex games in sight. Its simple homepage is divided into three sections: Tell, where users can upload their own submissions; Read, where erotica is labelled under filters such as \u201cstranger\u201d and \u201cfirst time\u201d; and Listen, where stories range from approximately three to 30 minutes. The result is an online environment where a vortex of content such as \u201cLate Night Lust at the Office\u201d (and other, far more explicit titles) feels approachable and lighthearted, with an underlying editorial tone similar to Spiegel herself: spirited and prone to fits of nervous laughter.</p> <p>While Quinn is decidedly different from YouPorn, RedTube and other video-based websites, it is not alone in the ever-growing female-focused erotica space, where big name competitors such as Pornhub and Literotica still dominate. Catering to female sexuality, Spiegel believes, makes the task of cultivating an audience harder. \u201cThe woman audience is the most insightful, critical [but], honestly, the most gratifying to please,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause once you get it right, when we see a spike or get a ton of listens, you just feel like: \u2018I hit the money right there!\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6bf3c4e79109235f211f5f2f5185b8c01943af3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6bf3c4e79109235f211f5f2f5185b8c01943af3/157_0_668_668/500.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Spiegel, founder, Quinn, an audio pornography company.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caroline Spiegel, founder of Quinn: \u2018Female sexuality is still shrouded in stigma, which makes some people uncomfortable or critical of Quinn and our mission.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Quinn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At just two months old, Quinn is still in the giddy fledgling phase.

      "bodyText": "Nothing about Caroline Spiegel would suggest she\u2019s at the helm of a new women\u2019s porn site \u2013 except, perhaps, the background on her phone. The face of her cracked iPhone screen bears the cartoon likeness of Wonder Woman masturbating, a word Spiegel refers to as \u201cgettin\u2019 it done\u201d. And getting it done is big business these days: Quinn, Spiegel\u2019s New York-based adult startup, is just one of a litany of female-founded companies taking a slice of an estimated $30bn sex tech industry. The term \u201csex tech\u201d encompasses everything from sex toys to fertility apps. And, in typical millennial fashion, Spiegel\u2019s pornography comes with a side helping of purpose. \u201cQuinn\u2019s overall goal, our grand mission, is to be an intimacy guide for the new generation,\u201d the 22-year-old says. \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t seem like that on the surface \u2026 but we\u2019re trying to open up this conversation by bringing porn to a more inclusive place and making it [span] this bigger emotional scale.\u201d What sets Quinn apart from an ocean of other porn sites is its visual-free ethos and focus on written and audio sex stories. The website has no imagery whatsoever, and nary a banner ad for sexual enhancement pills or CGI sex games in sight. Its simple homepage is divided into three sections: Tell, where users can upload their own submissions; Read, where erotica is labelled under filters such as \u201cstranger\u201d and \u201cfirst time\u201d; and Listen, where stories range from approximately three to 30 minutes. The result is an online environment where a vortex of content such as \u201cLate Night Lust at the Office\u201d (and other, far more explicit titles) feels approachable and lighthearted, with an underlying editorial tone similar to Spiegel herself: spirited and prone to fits of nervous laughter. While Quinn is decidedly different from YouPorn, RedTube and other video-based websites, it is not alone in the ever-growing female-focused erotica space, where big name competitors such as Pornhub and Literotica still dominate. Catering to female sexuality, Spiegel believes, makes the task of cultivating an audience harder. \u201cThe woman audience is the most insightful, critical [but], honestly, the most gratifying to please,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause once you get it right, when we see a spike or get a ton of listens, you just feel like: \u2018I hit the money right there!\u2019\u201d At just two months old, Quinn is still in the giddy fledgling phase. The site is run by a relatively small team consisting of remote engineers, graphic designers, and Spiegel\u2019s Stanford University classmate, Jaclyn Hanley, who quit her job as an investment analyst at BlackRock to become Spiegel\u2019s COO. The idea, however, is an expression of a much longer journey that began with the sexual dysfunction Spiegel experienced in the wake of recovering from an eating disorder: \u201cIt was this big, stewing problem in my life, and I felt like I\u2019d stuffed away this part of myself for so long,\u201d She says. \u201cSex had always been perfect, easy for me, then all of a sudden I\u2019m bad at it. So I was just trying to figure out if it doesn\u2019t work for me, what does? Everything just sort of felt either smutty or like sex ed [lessons], and there was nothing in that grey area that kind of nailed it for me.\u201d Her personal struggles were one source of inspiration. Another is her older brother, Evan Spiegel, whom she watched launch Snapchat from their childhood home. Though the younger Spiegel is reluctant to speak about her brother in interviews, she is candid about those who suggest she would never have had the same opportunities without her famous sibling. \u201cI mean, in some senses it\u2019s true,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of the things I\u2019ve had in my life, I wouldn\u2019t have had if it wasn\u2019t for him.

But I just try to count my blessings. And you know, he\u2019s an incredible mentor and friend, and although he hasn\u2019t given any money to us [Quinn], he\u2019s been very helpful and loving and caring.\u201d Having one of the world\u2019s most successful tech entrepreneurs in your network is advantageous, but certainly is no substitute for grit. Though Spiegel declined to comment on the specifics of Quinn\u2019s userbase and reach, the site \u2013 even in its \u201csoft launch\u201d phase \u2013 is churning out ample content, publishing between six and 10 new pieces of content per day.

Hundreds of tonnes of lead in the cathedral spire and roof melted in the extreme heat of the fire in April, dispersing lead particles into the air that settled on streets and buildings in surrounding neighbourhoods. Officials have insisted there was no danger to residents but pressure has mounted on Paris authorities and health officials in recent days over the safety of schools in the surrounding area as well as the health of hundreds of firefighters who fought the blaze and the construction workers shoring up the site. The French environmental campaign group Robin des Bois this week filed a lawsuit saying: \u201cThe relevant authorities, including the diocese .\u2026 neglected to assist residents, visitors and workers, allowing them to be exposed to the toxic fallout.\u201d The lawsuit accuses health agencies, government officials and the city of Paris of \u201cdeliberately putting people in danger\u201d by not immediately taking measures to limit exposure to the contamination. Environmental campaigners have said there were potentially high levels of lead in dust at ground level at schools and creches near the site and swift remedial action was not taken. Clean-up work at Notre Dame was halted last weekend with workers sent home from the site after a leading government official acknowledged that anti-contamination measures were insufficient. The Paris prefect, Michel Cadot, the government\u2019s top official for the Paris region, said strict controls should have been introduced in the heavily contaminated interior of the cathedral, as well as in surrounding areas.

      "bodyText": "Giffgaff has been fined \u00a31.4m for overcharging 2.6 million mobile phone customers over an eight-year period. An Ofcom investigation revealed the network, which is owned by O2\u2019s parent company Telef\u00f3nica, overcharged users a total of almost \u00a32.9m. The communications regulator said the billing mistake was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and imposed a further \u00a350,000 fine because Giffgaff failed to provide accurate information during its investigation. Giffgaff, which overcharged customers from May 2011 to February 2019, has about 2.5 million customers. \u201cGetting bills right is a basic duty for every phone company. But Giffgaff made unacceptable mistakes, leaving millions of customers out of pocket,\u201d Gaucho Rasmussen, the director of investigations and enforcement at Ofcom, said. \u201cThis fine should serve as a warning to all communications providers: if they get bills wrong, we will step in to protect customers.\u201d Ofcom said the fine would have been \u00a32m but the penalty was reduced by 30% because Giffgaff agreed to settle the case and admitted the mistake. Giffgaff customers who pre-paid for \u201cgoodybags\u201d \u2013 bundles of voice minutes, text messages and data \u2013 were in effect charged twice, the regulator said. This was because there was a delay in Giffgaff applying the bundles to customers\u2019 accounts after they paid for it, which meant calls and data they were using at the time came out of their pre-paid credit instead. Ofcom said the services should have been free immediately after the bundle was purchased. Giffgaff has already refunded about \u00a32.1m to affected customers. It has also made a donation to charity in lieu of those customers it has not been able to trace and refund. It said the sum, about \u00a3750,000, would be given to 10 charities that customers had nominated over the past year in its \u201cpayback donations\u201d scheme.

      "body": "<p>Thursday marks the 200th birthday of Herman Melville \u2013 the author of the greatest unread novel in the English language. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times I\u2019ve seen eyes glaze over when I ask people if they have conquered Moby-Dick. It is the Mount Everest of literature: huge and apparently insurmountable, its snowy peak as elusive as the tail of the great white whale himself.</p> <p>Having grown up loving whales as a boy \u2013 in the era of the Save the Whale campaigns of the 1970s \u2013 I was underwhelmed when I watched John Huston\u2019s grandiose 1956 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kHQe12BWSw\" title=\"\">film, </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kHQe12BWSw\" title=\"\">Moby</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kHQe12BWSw\" title=\"\"> Dick</a>. Perhaps it was because I saw it on a tiny black-and-white TV, but the whole story seemed impenetrable to me. And there weren\u2019t enough whales. I would have been even less keen had I known that the whale footage Huston did include had been specially shot off Madeira, where they were still being hunted. For the Hemingwayesque director, there was none of that final-credit nonsense: \u201cNo animals were harmed in the making of this film.\u201d Because they very much were.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c124afbb10fcf3a023b962bc7b2936e1ec9ee259\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c124afbb10fcf3a023b962bc7b2936e1ec9ee259/0_232_3648_2189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Hoare: \u2018I fell in love with Melville as much as I had fallen in love with the whales.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Hoare: \u2018I fell in love with Melville as much as I had fallen in love with the whales.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Forty years later, I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/10/sperm-whale-azores-ocean-pod\" title=\"\">saw my first whales in the wild</a>, off Provincetown, a former whaling port on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. It was there, in New England, that I finally finished the book. What had seemed to be a heroic tale of the high seas proved to be something much darker and more sublime. I realised its secret. Not only is it very funny and very subversive, but it maps out the modern world as if Melville had lived his life in the future and was only waiting for us to catch up. I fell in love with Melville as much as I had fallen in love with the whales. My own five-year-long voyage searching for these magnificent creatures produced my own book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/24/scienceandnature\" title=\"\">Leviathan or, The Whale</a> and a subsequent film, <a href=\"http://www.philiphoare.co.uk/the-hunt-for-moby-dick\" title=\"\">The Hunt for Moby-Dick</a>. But even now, having read it a dozen times, I\u2019m still not sure I can tell you what Moby-Dick is all about. Yes, it\u2019s the tale of Captain Ahab, who sails his ship, the Pequod, in search of a white whale that had bitten off his leg. But it\u2019s also a wildly digressive attempt to comprehend the animals themselves. And despite the author\u2019s rather unhelpful conclusion, after 650 pages, about the whale, \u201cI know him not, and never will\u201d, here are some very good reasons why you need to read his crazily wonderful book.</p> <h2><strong>It is adored by the great and the good</strong></h2> <p>It is precisely Moby-Dick\u2019s forbidding reputation that has inspired artists, writers, performers and film-makers from Frank Stella to Jackson Pollock, Led Zeppelin to Laurie Anderson, Orson Welles, Sylvia Plath, <a href=\"https://www.scr.org/get-connected/south-coast-repertorys-stories/south-coast-repertory%E2%80%99s-stories/2016/12/27/from-barrymore-to-led-zeppelin-moby-dick--inspired-art\" title=\"\">Stanley Kubrick and Lynne Ramsay</a>, as well as the makers of Tom and Jerry, and even The Simpsons. The musician Moby claims direct descent from Melville (although he admitted to me that he wasn\u2019t so sure it was true at all). There are many who hold it as one of their favourite books: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/obama-favorite-books_n_3328565\" title=\"\">Barack Obama</a>, <a href=\"https://thegreatestbooks.org/\" title=\"\">Joyce Carol Oates</a>, <a href=\"https://happymag.tv/recommended-reading-these-are-patti-smiths-40-favourite-books-of-all-time/\" title=\"\">Patti Smith</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/nile-rodgers-chic-last-word-759116/\" title=\"\">Nile Rodgers</a> and Bob Dylan (who <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bob-dylan-cribbed-moby-dick-notes-for-nobel-prize-lecture-36pqk2rqw\" title=\"\">cribbed it for his Nobel speech</a>), among them.</p> <h2><strong>It has never been more relevant</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e91bfce636ec06f9cecfed7d1b6db3f4d1b0c3da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e91bfce636ec06f9cecfed7d1b6db3f4d1b0c3da/0_0_3872_2325/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Melville invests sperm whales with their own intrinsic beauty.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Melville invests sperm whales with their own intrinsic beauty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerard Soury/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a tribute to Melville\u2019s imagination that his book remains so strongly in ours. He may have done for the whale what Peter Benchley\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/05/shark-drunk-monsters-tale-review\" title=\"\">Jaws</a> did for the shark \u2013 recreating the animal as an icon of otherness. He invests cetaceans with their own intrinsic beauty and in doing so, he pre-empted our conception of animals we know to be highly sentient and entirely matriarchal, expressing their own culture <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/03/what-is-the-future-for-sri-lanka-lost-population-of-sperm-whales\" title=\"\">through their sonar clicks</a>.</p> <p>Equally, Melville\u2019s reflections on our own species still reverberate. Days after 9/11, the Palestinian-American writer Edward Said <a href=\"https://www.truthdig.com/articles/we-are-all-aboard-the-pequod/\" title=\"\">compared George W Bush\u2019s pursuit of Osama </a><a href=\"https://www.truthdig.com/articles/we-are-all-aboard-the-pequod/\" title=\"\">bin Laden to </a><a href=\"https://www.truthdig.com/articles/we-are-all-aboard-the-pequod/\" title=\"\">Ahab\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.truthdig.com/articles/we-are-all-aboard-the-pequod/\" title=\"\">obsessive hunt for the white whale</a>. The current tenant of the White House draws comparisons to Ahab\u2019s crazed mission, too: Trump\u2019s desire for a wall \u2013 an \u201cunnecessary and expensive \u2026vengeful folly\u201d, according to Neil Steinberg in the <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/2/17/18447553/white-whale-and-wide-wall-american-obsessives-ahab-and-donald-trump\" title=\"\">Chicago Sun Times</a> \u2013 is as irrational a pursuit as Ahab\u2019s.</p> <p>You might apply similar metaphors to the head of our own shaky ship of state. When the prime minister\u2019s cabinet was announced last week, I couldn\u2019t help but think of <a href=\"http://www.mobydickbigread.com/chapter-41-moby-dick/\" title=\"\">Melville\u2019s line</a>: \u201cSuch a crew, so officered, seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge.\u201d</p> <p>But it is Moby-Dick\u2019s premonitory brilliance that continues to make it relevant. Melville predicts <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/493160a?message-global=remove\" title=\"\">mass extinction</a> and climate breakdown, and foresees a <a href=\"http://www.mobydickbigread.com/chapter-105-does-the-whales-magnitude-diminish/\" title=\"\">drowned planet</a> from which the whale would \u201cspout his frothed defiance to the skies\u201d. And in its worldwide pursuit of a finite resource, the whaling industry is an <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/07/18/born-200-years-ago-herman-melville-was-globalisations-first-great-bard?fsrc=scn/tw/te/rfd/pe\" title=\"\">augury of our globalised state</a>. It\u2019s no coincidence that the Pequod\u2019s first mate, Starbuck, gave his name to a chain of coffee shops.</p> <h2><strong>It\u2019s a very queer book</strong></h2> <p>Moby-Dick may be the first work of western fiction to feature a same-sex marriage: Ishmael, the loner narrator (famous for the most ambiguous opening line in literature) <a href=\"http://www.mobydickbigread.com/chapter-10-a-bosom-friend/\" title=\"\">gets hitched</a> \u2013 in bed \u2013 to the omni-tattooed Pacific islander, Queequeg: \u201cHe pressed his forehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that henceforth we were married.\u201d Other scenes are deeply homoerotic: sailors <a href=\"http://www.mobydickbigread.com/chapter-94-a-squeeze-of-the-hand/\" title=\"\">massage each others\u2019 hands</a> in a tub of sperm oil and there is an entire chapter <a href=\"http://www.mobydickbigread.com/chapter-95-the-cassock/\" title=\"\">devoted to foreskins</a> (albeit of the whalish variety).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"81d3e068fdc9b94b20260503ed29e4dcb961d226\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81d3e068fdc9b94b20260503ed29e4dcb961d226/190_131_1237_1237/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A 1840 portrait of the writer Nathaniel Hawthorne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 1840 portrait of the writer Nathaniel Hawthorne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indeed, the whole book is a <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/02/13/herman-melville-nathaniel-hawthorne-love-letters/\" title=\"\">love letter</a> (sadly unreciprocated) from a besotted Melville to his hero, Nathaniel Hawthorne, to whom he wrote: \u201cYou have sunk your northern roots down into my southern soul.\u201d</p> <p>Faced with such unbridled flagrancy, the US establishment has never been keen to accept the idea that Melville may just possibly have been gay. And it must have rankled to have the brilliance of his book pointed out to them by a bunch of British queer writers. When a modest Everyman edition appeared in London 20 years after Melville\u2019s death in 1891, DH Lawrence declared it a work of futurism before futurism had been invented; <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/the-incredible-voyager-1282559.html\" title=\"\">E</a><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/the-incredible-voyager-1282559.html\" title=\"\">M</a><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/the-incredible-voyager-1282559.html\" title=\"\"> Forster</a> and <a href=\"https://biblio.co.uk/book/herman-melville-auden-w-h/d/862546635\" title=\"\">W</a><a href=\"https://biblio.co.uk/book/herman-melville-auden-w-h/d/862546635\" title=\"\">H</a><a href=\"https://biblio.co.uk/book/herman-melville-auden-w-h/d/862546635\" title=\"\"> Auden</a> extolled its queer nature. Virginia Woolf read it three times, comparing it to Wuthering Heights in its strangeness, and noted in her 1926 diary that no biographer would believe her work was inspired by the vision of \u201ca fin rising on a wide blank sea\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>It is genuinely subversive</strong></h2> <p>The alluring figure of Queequeg is one of the first persons of colour in western fiction, and the Pequod carries a multicultural crew of Native Americans, African Americans and Asians (evocatively reflected in the paintings of the contemporary black American artist <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gallagher-bird-in-hand-t12450\" title=\"\">Ellen Gallagher</a>). It is a metaphor for a new republic already falling apart, with the pursuit of the white whale as a bitter analogy for the slave-owning states. It is why, in 1952, the Trinidadian writer <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2017/06/moby-dick-clr-james-mariners-renegades-castaways\" title=\"\">C</a><a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2017/06/moby-dick-clr-james-mariners-renegades-castaways\" title=\"\">L</a><a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2017/06/moby-dick-clr-james-mariners-renegades-castaways\" title=\"\">R</a><a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2017/06/moby-dick-clr-james-mariners-renegades-castaways\" title=\"\"> James</a> called Moby-Dick \u201cthe greatest portrayal of despair in literature\u201d, seeing an indictment of imperialism in Ahab\u2019s desire for revenge on the whale. (In fact, Melville hints it wasn\u2019t only his leg that was bitten off. As Cerys Matthews <a href=\"http://www.mobydickbigread.com/chapter-132-the-symphony/\" title=\"\">asked me</a>: \u201cShouldn\u2019t it be called Moby-no-Dick?\u201d)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e93f327a0fe6d114c2cb920a70f884ee9ebfaa60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e93f327a0fe6d114c2cb920a70f884ee9ebfaa60/0_0_3286_4278/768.jpg\" alt=\"Herman Melville, c1885.\" width=\"768\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Herman Melville, c1885.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>It was born in Britain</strong></h2> <p>Melville was born in Manhattan on 1 August 1819, <a href=\"https://melvillesociety.org/calendar/eventdetail/9/-/melville-s-birthday\" title=\"\">in sight of the sea</a>. As a failed teacher, he signed up for a whaling voyage in New Bedford \u2013 then the richest city in the US, <a href=\"https://www.whalingmuseum.org/\" title=\"\">wealthy on the oil of whales</a>. He deserted the ship a year later, but on his return to the US became a glamorous figure, acclaimed for his sensual books about the \u201cexotic\u201d inhabitants of the Marquesas islands. But by 1849, his output had become increasingly obscure, and that October, he arrived in London, seeking inspiration. Installed in lodgings <a href=\"https://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/herman-melville\" title=\"\">overlooking the Thames at Charing Cross</a>, he spent his time visiting publishers and getting drunk. Stumbling home, he <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2015/12/white-whale-big-smoke-how-geography-london-inspired-moby-dick\" title=\"\">saw whales swimming down Oxford Street</a>. It was if they were haunting him.</p> <p>A month later, after a diversion to Paris, he returned to New York with a new book he had been given: Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein. Its tale of perverted nature and overweening ambition fed into Moby-Dick. The first version of the book was published in Britain in 1851, entitled <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?an=Melville&amp;bi=0&amp;bx=off&amp;ds=30&amp;fe=on&amp;pics=on&amp;recentlyadded=all&amp;sortby=1&amp;tn=Moby+Dick&amp;x=48&amp;y=18&amp;yrh=1851&amp;yrl=1851\" title=\"\">The Whale</a>. It came out in the US later that year as Moby-Dick \u2013 and failed, miserably. When Melville died 40 years later, he and his book were long forgotten.</p> <h2><strong>It has never been easier (or cheaper) to get hold of</strong></h2> <p>If the last 1,400 words haven\u2019t convinced you (\u201cOh, Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience!\u201d as Melville <a href=\"http://www.mobydickbigread.com/chapter-32-cetology\" title=\"\">complained</a>), you don\u2019t have to read the book at all.

Once you do read it, it\u2019s hard to let it go.

This side of the Atlantic, his anniversary ghost has conjured up some aptly eccentric events. The Isle of Man, which lays claim to a crewman on the Pequod, has issued a set of commemorative <a href=\"https://www.iompost.com/stamps-coins/collection/moby-dick---celebrating-the-200th-anniversary-of-the-birth-of-herman-melville/\" title=\"\">Moby-Dick stamps</a>, while a Yorkshire stately home is asking for the return of bones pilfered from the only whale mentioned in Moby-Dick that <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/moby-dick-whale-bones-herman-melville-1444099\" title=\"\">really did exist</a> \u2013 a skeleton assembled at <a href=\"https://www.burtonconstable.com/DB/events/caroline-hack-at-burton-constable\" title=\"\">Burton Constable Hall</a> in 1825, on whose jaws, Melville joked, the lord of the manor liked to swing.

We are hoping for a bigger crowd than his book launch, when the party consisted of just him and Hawthorne. Melville was defiant. \u201cI have written a blasphemous book,\u201d he declared, \u201cand I feel as spotless as the lamb.\u201d The wickedness lives on. Happy birthday, Herman.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Thursday marks the 200th birthday of Herman Melville \u2013 the author of the greatest unread novel in the English language. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times I\u2019ve seen eyes glaze over when I ask people if they have conquered Moby-Dick. It is the Mount Everest of literature: huge and apparently insurmountable, its snowy peak as elusive as the tail of the great white whale himself. Having grown up loving whales as a boy \u2013 in the era of the Save the Whale campaigns of the 1970s \u2013 I was underwhelmed when I watched John Huston\u2019s grandiose 1956 film, Moby Dick. Perhaps it was because I saw it on a tiny black-and-white TV, but the whole story seemed impenetrable to me. And there weren\u2019t enough whales. I would have been even less keen had I known that the whale footage Huston did include had been specially shot off Madeira, where they were still being hunted. For the Hemingwayesque director, there was none of that final-credit nonsense: \u201cNo animals were harmed in the making of this film.\u201d Because they very much were. Forty years later, I saw my first whales in the wild, off Provincetown, a former whaling port on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. It was there, in New England, that I finally finished the book. What had seemed to be a heroic tale of the high seas proved to be something much darker and more sublime. I realised its secret. Not only is it very funny and very subversive, but it maps out the modern world as if Melville had lived his life in the future and was only waiting for us to catch up. I fell in love with Melville as much as I had fallen in love with the whales. My own five-year-long voyage searching for these magnificent creatures produced my own book, Leviathan or, The Whale and a subsequent film, The Hunt for Moby-Dick. But even now, having read it a dozen times, I\u2019m still not sure I can tell you what Moby-Dick is all about. Yes, it\u2019s the tale of Captain Ahab, who sails his ship, the Pequod, in search of a white whale that had bitten off his leg. But it\u2019s also a wildly digressive attempt to comprehend the animals themselves. And despite the author\u2019s rather unhelpful conclusion, after 650 pages, about the whale, \u201cI know him not, and never will\u201d, here are some very good reasons why you need to read his crazily wonderful book. It is adored by the great and the good It is precisely Moby-Dick\u2019s forbidding reputation that has inspired artists, writers, performers and film-makers from Frank Stella to Jackson Pollock, Led Zeppelin to Laurie Anderson, Orson Welles, Sylvia Plath, Stanley Kubrick and Lynne Ramsay, as well as the makers of Tom and Jerry, and even The Simpsons. The musician Moby claims direct descent from Melville (although he admitted to me that he wasn\u2019t so sure it was true at all). There are many who hold it as one of their favourite books: Barack Obama, Joyce Carol Oates, Patti Smith, Nile Rodgers and Bob Dylan (who cribbed it for his Nobel speech), among them. It has never been more relevant It\u2019s a tribute to Melville\u2019s imagination that his book remains so strongly in ours. He may have done for the whale what Peter Benchley\u2019s Jaws did for the shark \u2013 recreating the animal as an icon of otherness. He invests cetaceans with their own intrinsic beauty and in doing so, he pre-empted our conception of animals we know to be highly sentient and entirely matriarchal, expressing their own culture through their sonar clicks. Equally, Melville\u2019s reflections on our own species still reverberate. Days after 9/11, the Palestinian-American writer Edward Said compared George W Bush\u2019s pursuit of Osama bin Laden to Ahab\u2019s obsessive hunt for the white whale. The current tenant of the White House draws comparisons to Ahab\u2019s crazed mission, too: Trump\u2019s desire for a wall \u2013 an \u201cunnecessary and expensive \u2026vengeful folly\u201d, according to Neil Steinberg in the Chicago Sun Times \u2013 is as irrational a pursuit as Ahab\u2019s. You might apply similar metaphors to the head of our own shaky ship of state. When the prime minister\u2019s cabinet was announced last week, I couldn\u2019t help but think of Melville\u2019s line: \u201cSuch a crew, so officered, seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge.\u201d But it is Moby-Dick\u2019s premonitory brilliance that continues to make it relevant. Melville predicts mass extinction and climate breakdown, and foresees a drowned planet from which the whale would \u201cspout his frothed defiance to the skies\u201d. And in its worldwide pursuit of a finite resource, the whaling industry is an augury of our globalised state. It\u2019s no coincidence that the Pequod\u2019s first mate, Starbuck, gave his name to a chain of coffee shops. It\u2019s a very queer book Moby-Dick may be the first work of western fiction to feature a same-sex marriage: Ishmael, the loner narrator (famous for the most ambiguous opening line in literature) gets hitched \u2013 in bed \u2013 to the omni-tattooed Pacific islander, Queequeg: \u201cHe pressed his forehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that henceforth we were married.\u201d Other scenes are deeply homoerotic: sailors massage each others\u2019 hands in a tub of sperm oil and there is an entire chapter devoted to foreskins (albeit of the whalish variety). Indeed, the whole book is a love letter (sadly unreciprocated) from a besotted Melville to his hero, Nathaniel Hawthorne, to whom he wrote: \u201cYou have sunk your northern roots down into my southern soul.\u201d Faced with such unbridled flagrancy, the US establishment has never been keen to accept the idea that Melville may just possibly have been gay. And it must have rankled to have the brilliance of his book pointed out to them by a bunch of British queer writers. When a modest Everyman edition appeared in London 20 years after Melville\u2019s death in 1891, DH Lawrence declared it a work of futurism before futurism had been invented; EM Forster and WH Auden extolled its queer nature. Virginia Woolf read it three times, comparing it to Wuthering Heights in its strangeness, and noted in her 1926 diary that no biographer would believe her work was inspired by the vision of \u201ca fin rising on a wide blank sea\u201d. It is genuinely subversive The alluring figure of Queequeg is one of the first persons of colour in western fiction, and the Pequod carries a multicultural crew of Native Americans, African Americans and Asians (evocatively reflected in the paintings of the contemporary black American artist Ellen Gallagher). It is a metaphor for a new republic already falling apart, with the pursuit of the white whale as a bitter analogy for the slave-owning states. It is why, in 1952, the Trinidadian writer CLR James called Moby-Dick \u201cthe greatest portrayal of despair in literature\u201d, seeing an indictment of imperialism in Ahab\u2019s desire for revenge on the whale. (In fact, Melville hints it wasn\u2019t only his leg that was bitten off. As Cerys Matthews asked me: \u201cShouldn\u2019t it be called Moby-no-Dick?\u201d) It was born in Britain Melville was born in Manhattan on 1 August 1819, in sight of the sea. As a failed teacher, he signed up for a whaling voyage in New Bedford \u2013 then the richest city in the US, wealthy on the oil of whales. He deserted the ship a year later, but on his return to the US became a glamorous figure, acclaimed for his sensual books about the \u201cexotic\u201d inhabitants of the Marquesas islands. But by 1849, his output had become increasingly obscure, and that October, he arrived in London, seeking inspiration. Installed in lodgings overlooking the Thames at Charing Cross, he spent his time visiting publishers and getting drunk. Stumbling home, he saw whales swimming down Oxford Street. It was if they were haunting him. A month later, after a diversion to Paris, he returned to New York with a new book he had been given: Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein. Its tale of perverted nature and overweening ambition fed into Moby-Dick. The first version of the book was published in Britain in 1851, entitled The Whale. It came out in the US later that year as Moby-Dick \u2013 and failed, miserably. When Melville died 40 years later, he and his book were long forgotten. It has never been easier (or cheaper) to get hold of If the last 1,400 words haven\u2019t convinced you (\u201cOh, Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience!\u201d as Melville complained), you don\u2019t have to read the book at all. The artist Angela Cockayne and I have curated the Moby-Dick Big Read for the University of Plymouth, featuring Tilda Swinton, David Attenborough, Fiona Shaw, Stephen Fry, John Waters, Benedict Cumberbatch and 130 others who will read it to you, chapter by chapter, for free. The site has had 10m hits to date. A word of caution, though. Once you do read it, it\u2019s hard to let it go. I\u2019m still haunted by Melville: this winter, staying alone in an 18th-century house that he visited on the island of Nantucket off Cape Cod, I started to think that he was coming up the stairs. This side of the Atlantic, his anniversary ghost has conjured up some aptly eccentric events. The Isle of Man, which lays claim to a crewman on the Pequod, has issued a set of commemorative Moby-Dick stamps, while a Yorkshire stately home is asking for the return of bones pilfered from the only whale mentioned in Moby-Dick that really did exist \u2013 a skeleton assembled at Burton Constable Hall in 1825, on whose jaws, Melville joked, the lord of the manor liked to swing. And if you happen to be in Paris on Thursday, you can join us reading the book aloud in the bookshop Shakespeare &amp; Co, close to where Melville stayed in 1849.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Here\u2019s a song from the 1920s \u2013 just before Led Zeppelin were formed,\u201d announces Robert Plant as he leads his new semi-acoustic band Saving Grace into Cindy I\u2019ll Marry You Someday. It\u2019s late on Sunday night \u2013 Orbital are on the main stage, while Plant and singer Suzi Dian make a modest festival debut backed by drums, guitars, mandolin and banjo for a classy set of old favourites. They include Doc Watson\u2019s Your Long Journey, Ray Charles\u2019 stomping Leave My Woman Alone, Donovan\u2019s Season of the Witch and finish with I Bid You Goodnight, in which they all huddle around one microphone. Low-key, but enormous fun. This was the 38th Womad, held in an increasingly crowded festival market made all the more difficult by visa restrictions. But there was still a varied global lineup \u2013 anything from Macha y El Bloque Depresivo\u2019s tragic Chilean ballads to the emotional soul classics of Macy Gray, BaBa ZuLa\u2019s wild and angry Turkish psychedelia, and the extraordinary voice of Ustad Saami, Pakistan\u2019s 75-year-old master of a haunting microtonal style that predates Islam. It was a great year for veterans such as these. Calypso Rose, now 79, was feisty on the cheerfully risque Young Boy, and Africa\u2019s finest male singer Salif Keita is in distinctive, soaring voice on an upbeat set that includes a powerful revival of M\u2019Bemba and just one \u2013 exquisite \u2013 acoustic song, Awa. Behind him, a sign announces he is \u201ccelebrating 50 years of music in 70 years\u201d. If he\u2019s on a farewell tour, it doesn\u2019t feel like it. The best newcomers include Jamaican soloist Brushy One String, whose song Chicken In the Corn has been viewed 24m times on YouTube, and who really does play a guitar with just one string to back his growling, soulful voice. With Brexit threatening, there was also an appropriate emphasis on Europe: San Salvador, from the French Massif Central, are a slick, rousing young six-piece whose thrilling polyphonic harmony singing is backed by pounding percussion, and Ukraine\u2019s glorious DakhaBrakha returned, sporting tall fur hats and quirky, compelling songs. There were reminders of the British multicultural scene too, from the adventurous soul-jazz-rap re-working of civil rights classics by A Change Is Gonna Come to the angry political songs of Nadine Shah. In our era of walls and vocal bigots, Womad is more important than ever.",

The analysis was published ahead of a visit by the Labour leader to join anti-fracking protesters at Cuadrilla\u2019s Preston New Road site in Lancashire. It reveals that if the UK fully exploits its shale gas reserves, the amount of carbon released would eliminate any hope of the government meeting its 2050 net zero target. Labour said that even if progress continued at its current rate, the government\u2019s 2050 target would be missed by nearly 50 years. Corbyn\u2019s visit is part of his summer campaign tour as the party gets ready for an election potentially called by Johnson as soon as this autumn. He called on the prime minister to stand up to big business interests and ban fracking, accusing Johnson of \u201cbending the knee\u201d to companies who want to profit from fracking. \u201cWe need urgent action to tackle the climate emergency, and that means the prime minister immediately banning fracking once and for all,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the next generation and the world\u2019s poorest who will pay the price if this Conservative government continues to put the interests of a few polluters ahead of people. \u201cTackling the climate emergency cannot be left to the free market.

      "body": "<p>Watching the first trailer for Charlie\u2019s Angels, something is immediately off key. The first thing we see is a closeup of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/09/kristen-stewart-bisexual-personal-shopper-trump-tweets\">Kristen Stewart</a> and she is smiling. Before now, nobody was even sure Stewart could smile, so transcendently stoic is her screen persona. Stewart does other un-Stewart-ish things in the trailer: flirting with a guy, wearing a glittery pink dress, tossing her long blond hair, dancing. Reassuringly, this is all just a disguise and she\u2019s beating the crap out of said guy moments later but, still, something has clearly changed. Stewart has spent the past decade cultivating a reputation as one of the coolest, most distinctive, least game-playing actors in the business. And now here she is in a big-budget Hollywood action-comedy.</p> <p>Whatever is going on with Stewart, it also seems to be going on with her former on- and off-screen partner, Robert Pattinson. Like Stewart, Pattinson has successfully built a career on the back of some brave movie roles, but in May he was unveiled as the next Batman. So he, too, is returning to the very centre of Hollywood mainstream. What is going on? Is this a coordinated move? Will either of them survive it?</p> <p>Both Stewart and Pattinson have already survived early breakout stardom in a high-profile Hollywood franchise, which is no mean feat. Just ask <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/22/who-do-you-think-you-are-review-harry-potter-and-the-diamond-heist\">Daniel Radcliffe</a> or Elijah Wood. Twilight could have ruined them. Stephenie Meyer\u2019s vampire saga somehow struck that elusive chord with young audiences, catapulting its leads to global recognition \u2013 stalked by paparazzi, their names worthy of ugly abbreviation (\u201cK-Stew\u201d, \u201cR-Patz\u201d, \u201cStewpatz\u201d?). But Stewart and Pattinson have been textbook examples of how to do it right. It helped that neither of them were exactly cookie-cutter actors from the start. He was classically handsome but with a roguish air to him; she was possessed of a detached acting style that verged on boredom \u2013 understandable given the high cheese quota and sanctimonious abstinence messaging of the Twilight movies. But their chemistry made it all the more palatable. The fact that they became a couple in real life only added to the mythology; a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/sep/12/eva-sereny-best-photograph-liz-taylor-richard-burton-angry-looks\">Liz Taylor and Richard Burton</a> for the TMZ generation.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSUq4VfWfjE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RSUq4VfWfjE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It looked as though things were heading that way post-Twilight, especially for Stewart. She had another brush with the Hollywood mainstream in 2012\u2019s Snow White and the Huntsman, and a more damaging brush with its director Rupert Sanders, married and 20 years her senior. The latter affair led to Stewart being dropped from the sequel, which could have been a blessing in disguise. It also led to a high-profile breakup with Pattinson, including public apologies and acres of media attention. Their relationship was of such global significance, even Donald Trump felt compelled to weigh in on it.

      "bodyText": "Watching the first trailer for Charlie\u2019s Angels, something is immediately off key. The first thing we see is a closeup of Kristen Stewart and she is smiling. Before now, nobody was even sure Stewart could smile, so transcendently stoic is her screen persona. Stewart does other un-Stewart-ish things in the trailer: flirting with a guy, wearing a glittery pink dress, tossing her long blond hair, dancing. Reassuringly, this is all just a disguise and she\u2019s beating the crap out of said guy moments later but, still, something has clearly changed. Stewart has spent the past decade cultivating a reputation as one of the coolest, most distinctive, least game-playing actors in the business. And now here she is in a big-budget Hollywood action-comedy. Whatever is going on with Stewart, it also seems to be going on with her former on- and off-screen partner, Robert Pattinson. Like Stewart, Pattinson has successfully built a career on the back of some brave movie roles, but in May he was unveiled as the next Batman. So he, too, is returning to the very centre of Hollywood mainstream. What is going on? Is this a coordinated move? Will either of them survive it? Both Stewart and Pattinson have already survived early breakout stardom in a high-profile Hollywood franchise, which is no mean feat. Just ask Daniel Radcliffe or Elijah Wood. Twilight could have ruined them. Stephenie Meyer\u2019s vampire saga somehow struck that elusive chord with young audiences, catapulting its leads to global recognition \u2013 stalked by paparazzi, their names worthy of ugly abbreviation (\u201cK-Stew\u201d, \u201cR-Patz\u201d, \u201cStewpatz\u201d?). But Stewart and Pattinson have been textbook examples of how to do it right. It helped that neither of them were exactly cookie-cutter actors from the start. He was classically handsome but with a roguish air to him; she was possessed of a detached acting style that verged on boredom \u2013 understandable given the high cheese quota and sanctimonious abstinence messaging of the Twilight movies. But their chemistry made it all the more palatable. The fact that they became a couple in real life only added to the mythology; a Liz Taylor and Richard Burton for the TMZ generation. It looked as though things were heading that way post-Twilight, especially for Stewart. She had another brush with the Hollywood mainstream in 2012\u2019s Snow White and the Huntsman, and a more damaging brush with its director Rupert Sanders, married and 20 years her senior. The latter affair led to Stewart being dropped from the sequel, which could have been a blessing in disguise. It also led to a high-profile breakup with Pattinson, including public apologies and acres of media attention. Their relationship was of such global significance, even Donald Trump felt compelled to weigh in on it. In 2012, the future president tweeted: \u201cRobert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart. She cheated on him like a dog &amp; will do it again \u2013 just watch.

      "bodyText": "The repercussions of Shayna Jack\u2019s failed drug test are beginning to be felt after the International Swimming League issued a ban to the Australian swimmer for its coming inaugural series. Jack, who was slated to feature for the Cali Condors team in the new, lucrative competition starting in October, tested positive for the banned substance Ligandrol and was forced to pull out of the recent world championships in South Korea. The 20-year-old, who faces a standard four-year ban from competition, is preparing to face Australia\u2019s anti-doping body, Asada, in Canberra on Friday when she will begin the fight to clear her name. But pending the outcome of her case she will not be allowed to compete in the ISL. Jack\u2019s teammates said her right to a fair doping hearing has been impinged by the leaking of her positive drug test, and the Dolphins\u2019 leadership group also rejected claims of a cover-up regarding the case. The leadership group of Cate Campbell and her sister Bronte, Mitch Larkin, Jess Hansen and Alex Graham said on Tuesday they support Swimming Australia\u2019s handling of the case. \u201cSwimming Australia kept our team informed when they were allowed, under the legislation, to do so,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cWe also strongly believe in an athlete\u2019s right to privacy and fair process under the Asada code while a full investigation takes place and due to a leak of this information in the early stages of this process these rights have been infringed. \u201cWe stand very strongly in our commitment to clean and drug-free sport and this won\u2019t change. But we also are strongly committed to following the procedures set out in legislation.\u201d The non-Fina sanctioned ISL is a breakaway competition designed by the Ukrainian billionaire and swimming fan Konstantin Grigorishin, and is aimed at \u201cputting power back into the hands of athletes\u201d. Billed as \u201cthe champions league of swimming\u201d, the ISL\u2019s budget for the first season comes in at US$20m, with US$7m of that going to athletes and teams in prize money. The competition holds a firm line on doping and the ISL\u2019s managing director, Andrea di Nino, says Jack\u2019s selection has been revoked for the meets to be held in Europe and the United States from October. \u201cNo doping control rules violation will be overlooked,\u201d Di Nino said in a statement on the ISL\u2019s website. \u201cThis is another case that serves to reiterate our stance on banned substances and breaking doping control rules. No such behaviour will ever be condoned. \u201cFrom the outset, the ISL has been an advocate for transparency and clean sport. Any athletes with doping control or ethical violation records will be considered ineligible, with no recourse.\u201d Jack\u2019s teammates Cate Campbell and Kyle Chalmers will feature in the competition, alongside other stars such as Katinka Hossz\u00fa, Federica Pellegrini, Katie Ledecky, Adam Peaty and Nathan Adrian. But due to the hardline stance on doping, like Jack, the Chinese swimmer Sun Yang will also miss out. Yang served a three-month doping suspension in 2014 and was at the centre of controversy when he was cleared to race at the recent world championships, while awaiting a court of arbitration for sport ruling on accusations of wrongdoing during a drug test last September. Yang, who has a history of hostility with Mack Horton, clashed again with Jack\u2019s teammate in Gwangju after the Australian led protests against the Chinese, sparking an international incident in which Horton was accused of \u201cdisrespecting\u201d China. Given the tensions, the revelations over Jack\u2019s failed doping test were met with inevitably huge interest in China, where the hashtag \u201cAustralian female swimmer drug test positive\u201d on Weibo, China\u2019s version of Facebook, prompted 390m reads, with 35,000 users talking about the topic. A People\u2019s Daily article attracted just over 15,000 comments and close to 750,000 likes, and other articles were widely shared across other Chinese news platforms. Jack has denied knowingly taking any banned substance but her manager, Philip Stoneman, said she would not contest the presence of the banned drug in her system. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a question of Shayna denying there is something in her body,\u201d Stoneman said on Monday. \u201cWhat she is doing is fighting her innocence because it shouldn\u2019t be in there and she doesn\u2019t know how it got in there.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A federal MP has revealed extraordinary allegations from a former Crown casino driver who claims he transported foreign nationals to the company\u2019s Melbourne hotel from a private jet base without being subject to border security checks and saw women degraded, abused and \u201cslapped around\u201d. Andrew Wilkie quoted the whistleblower\u2019s testimony in the lower house, adding to allegations in a Channel Nine investigation that Crown casino has links to organised crime in China and used a sweetheart deal with the home affairs department to facilitate visas for high rollers. The revelations \u2013 rejected by Crown \u2013 prompted the attorney general, Christian Porter, to launch a law enforcement integrity probe on Tuesday. Wilkie said the driver had told his office that \u201cthere is no law at Crown\u201d and \u201ceven if it\u2019s illegal you can get whatever you want at Crown\u201d including cocaine, pills and MDMA. Wilkie said that the driver \u201croutinely transported foreign nationals between Crown casino and the Melbourne jet base through the notorious access gate 24\u201d. \u201cHe recounts that there were no Border Force checks. Foreign nationals [were] getting off with up to 15 bags for a short stay, stopping only on the way to the casino to pick up a sex worker. \u201cOn violence, this latest whistleblower told my team: \u2018You see women being degraded, women being abused, women slapped around \u2013 things like that. If you saw someone being slapped around you literally become numb to it, and you see it a lot.\u2019\u201d Wilkie said the allegations \u201cgo to the performance of Victoria police, [the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation], the Australian federal police, Austrac, the Department of Transport, Border Force and Asio\u201d. The speech triggered a fall in Crown\u2019s share price from $12.36 to $11.78 before recovering to a day-end price of $11.98, down 2.3%. In a statement, Crown said it \u201cabsolutely rejects allegations of illegality made in parliament today and in recent media reporting\u201d. \u201cWe believe these allegations are ill-informed and an attempt to smear the company.\u201d Wilkie unsuccessfully moved a motion for a joint parliamentary committee to examine Crown, citing recent reports and his earlier complaints of pokie tampering which resulted in a \u201claughably tiny fine\u201d of $300,000 in Victoria. Porter, the attorney general, said he had considered the Nine investigation and \u201callegations which are either directly relatable to, or tangentially relatable to, commonwealth officers\u201d and concluded \u201cthere are sufficient concerns raised at least to warrant further investigations\u201d. Porter revealed he had referred it to the Australian Commissioner for Law Enforcement Integrity, which he said is \u201cthe most appropriate body to consider these allegations\u201d. He said if the ACLEI uncovered conduct by public servants who were not law enforcement officials, or by civilians or employees of a commercial organisation, ACLEI could refer information and further allegations to the Australian federal police. Crown said it would assist the investigation and \u201cif there is any evidence of unlawful conduct, we encourage individuals or organisations to contact the relevant authorities\u201d. While Labor backed the government\u2019s call to tap the ACLEI to conduct an inquiry instead of a parliamentary committee, the Greens and Wilkie raised concerns the decision could put ministers and other politicians out of reach of the probe. Calls for an inquiry began with a Nine investigation alleging tens of thousands of leaked internal Crown documents show the casino company has close ties to organised crime through the organisers of junkets run to lure gambling whales from mainland China, where gambling is banned. The investigation featured the former Australian Border Force head Roman Quaedvlieg, who told 60 Minutes two government ministers complained to him that Crown\u2019s VIP jets \u201cweren\u2019t receiving a facilitated service for private jets coming into Australia\u201d. The Greens MP Adam Bandt warned that ACLEI \u201ccan\u2019t investigate ministers and former ministers, especially regarding the prime ministers\u2019s statement of ministerial standards\u201d. He accused the Liberal and Labor parties of \u201crunning a protection racket for ministers and former ministers with connections to Crown casino\u201d. Later, Wilkie told reporters in Canberra the new probe was \u201cgood but only as far as it goes.\u201d The allegations go beyond \u201cstrictly criminal matters\u201d to the broader question of \u201cintegrity\u201d and whether ministers acted improperly by putting pressure on government agencies to allow high-rollers with criminal links into the country, he said. In a statement on Tuesday, the Department of Home Affairs confirmed it has \u201cstakeholder arrangements\u201d with a number of large international organisations for the quick processing of short stay visas but insisted there was no special treatment given to applicants. \u201cThe arrangement with Crown casinos was put in place in 2003. The arrangement was last affirmed by the minister in June 2011 and ceased in 2016,\u201d the department said. \u201cThere is no reduced vetting in certain locations or for certain applicants. Our offices in China are well aware of the risks that may be present in their caseloads and they scrutinise and manage applications accordingly. \u201cThere is no discretion to waive legislative checks or requirements and the department has no evidence that this has occurred.\u201d Wilkie said the idea a government department would fast-track visas for a company that is a major political donor \u201cdoesn\u2019t pass the pub test\u201d. Before Wilkie\u2019s speech the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, defended the state\u2019s gaming regulator against the independent\u2019s allegations it had proved \u201cincapable or unwilling\u201d to properly supervise Crown. \u201cI know that they take issues of probity and integrity across the industry very seriously and I\u2019m very confident that they have everything they need to guarantee that probity and integrity as we look to the future,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cNo one gets a pass on integrity and probity when it comes to this industry or any industry.\u201d",

What has been around is to collect money if it has been improperly extended to someone. What has happened under the Coalition with robodebt is the automation of this. The Coalition is looking to automate, looking to automate a number of processes and the way in which they have done this process has gone off the rails. No one is disputing the need to recover money if it has been received by somebody who has not validly received that benefit. </p> <p>In this case, the automated system, a seven-year program of automation under this government announced, in particular respect of robodebt, has gone off the rails, people were sent notices because they were not being double checked by a human pair of eyes, this was just sent out, and people were getting debt notices or debts they did not owe.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Wilson:</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This point is dishonest \u2013 the idea that a human pair of eyes is happy to go through every single debt collection notice and every single history of somebody\u2019s tax payments and welfare payments, and make sure everything occurs, is verging on impossible, especially when talking on scale. That is why we have automated systems to compare to make sure there isn\u2019t anybody doing the wrong thing. As soon as a problem is identified, there is a pathway for people to raise it and respond. </p> <p>I\u2019m not trying to pretend that there may not be shock when people receive a notice \u2013 that is why we have a pathway to make sure that when there is evidence to the contrary they can take appropriate action. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Husic:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is not.

You said there was nothing before you to warrant taking action on Crown. Today you and Labor opposed a parliamentary inquiry into ministers and former ministers. The attorney general has referred some of the allegations to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity commissioner, but it won\u2019t look into if your ministers have acted inappropriately. Given the stench from allegations regarding the matters, can you ensure the House you have fully investigated and none of your ministers lobbied home affairs on behalf of Crown, or is it a case of don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell, with the government running a protection racket for ministers with ties to Crown Casino?</p> <p><strong>Christian Porter:</strong><br></p> <p>With respect to standing order 90 and reflections on members, that is a reflection on all ministers here without identifying particularly which minister he is reflecting on, and indeed, there were no allegations of the type he raised in the media specifically or otherwise.

You would find a precedent for questions of this nature have been asked before. Obviously, it was a long question. And the full 45 seconds worth. So I will allow the question and obviously the prime minister has given \u2013 I just say to the member for Melbourne, given the amount of preamble commentary, and the nature of the 45-second contribution, that wasn\u2019t all the question.

And in fact a Parliamentary Committee inquiry would likely cause enormous difficulties to the efficacious running of ACLEI\u2019S inquiry if they determined to undertake one.</p> <p>I would also note that if ACLEI uncovered conduct by any other public service officers outside those determined in its remit as law enforcement officers or indeed civilians or employees of a commercial organisation who do not fall within ACLEI\u2019s jurisdiction, ACLEI can of course refer that information, and further allegations, to the AFP for further investigation.</p> <p>Now I just note as these allegations have now earlier today already been referred to ACLEI under the section of Act that I have nominated, it would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d3fbeb38f0845f89e316cd1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-30T03:51:51.594Z\">4.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is <strong>Christian Porter\u2019s</strong> official statement on why the government is not supporting the cross bench push for a parliamentary inquiry into Crown:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Government is not intending to support the motion and I will explain in detail.</p> <p>Obviously it is the case Mr Deputy Speaker that the Australian Government takes all allegations of illegal activity very seriously. Everyone must abide by the Australian law and that is particularly the case for any members of our law enforcement, our immigration or our customs authorities.</p> <p>They, of course, as part of the broader Australian law enforcement community hold very privileged positions and as such are expected to uphold the highest standards of integrity and professionalism at all times.</p> <p>A strong integrity and professional standards culture is fundamental to public confidence in our work and the Australian Government\u2019s work.</p> <p>I have considered the allegations that have been raised in media reporting and particularly as they touch upon allegations which are either directly relatable to, or tangentially relatable to, Commonwealth officers.</p> <p>It is my view that there are sufficient concerns raised at least to warrant further investigations.</p> <p>Now I might note for the benefit of Members that were speaking to this motion that saying that there are sufficient concerns to warrant me as Attorney-General to refer this matter for consideration under section 18 of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006, is not to say that I have before me, or that there is any obvious evidence otherwise available that supports allegations against law enforcement, immigration or customs authorities. Rather it is the case that s18 of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act might be called a precautionary referral provision and I have already enacted that provision earlier today.</p> <p>So i can inform the House that I have already referred this matter, these allegations, to the Australian Commissioner for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI), under section 18 of the <em>Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006.</em></p> <p>And under that referral provision it would now become open for ACLEI to decide whether or not to launch an investigation or indeed if they determined not to, that would be a matter which they would need to inform me as to what it was that they considered was appropriate and if it was no further action they would need to advise me of that and obviously that is advice that I would relay publicly.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d3fbdff8f08d0b6ca53a403\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/katharine-murphy\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-30T03:48:58.184Z\">4.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Kim Carr</strong> is unhappy.</p> <p>Pretty interesting ructions in today\u2019s Labor caucus meeting, particularly in light of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2019/jul/26/anthony-albanese-on-the-reality-of-labors-next-three-years-australian-politics-live-podcast\">podcast interview we published at the weekend</a>, which involved <strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>outlining Labor\u2019s strategy in this parliament (a strategy that has been dubbed \u201cbitch and fold\u201d in our office).</p> <p>The former Labor frontbencher <strong>Kim Carr</strong> expressed strong objections during today\u2019s meeting about the potential for Labor to vote against its own platform when considering an upcoming piece of legislation which gives effect to some of the recommendations from the royal commission set up by the former Labor prime minister, <strong>Julia Gillard. </strong></p> <p>The bill deals with combating child sexual exploitation and includes mandatory sentencing for some offences, including (I gather), possession of child-like sex dolls.<br></p> <p>The recommendation to today\u2019s caucus meeting was the legislation be not opposed in the House, and the shadow cabinet to determine a final position after a Senate inquiry reports back. </p> <p>According to people at today\u2019s meeting, the relevant shadow minister, <strong>Kristina Keneally</strong>,<strong> </strong>telegraphed to colleagues that Labor might end up supporting the proposal, despite it containing mandatory sentencing provisions. Labor opposes mandatory sentencing in its federal policy platform.<br></p> <p>At that point, Carr rose in high dudgeon. He asked why Labor would support legislation contrary to the party\u2019s platform. He also wanted to know what the argument was for folding on the legislation if Labor proposed amendments that were ultimately unsuccessful.<br></p> <p>A lively conversation ensued. Various shadow ministers spoke in favour of the recommendation, including, I\u2019m told, <strong>Joel Fitzgibbon</strong>, who said Labor shouldn\u2019t be guided exclusively by the platform. </p> <p>Again, according to the accounts I\u2019ve been given, the shadow attorney general, <strong>Mark Dreyfus, </strong>spoke in favour of the recommendation, but also expressed opposition to mandatory sentencing as a principle.<br></p> <p>Separately to that, Albanese took caucus members through a very similar conversation to the one he and I had in the podcast. </p> <p>He told MPs Labor was in a very similar position to where it washed up after the 2004 election (when <strong>John Howard</strong> gained control of the Senate after <strong>Mark Latham </strong>crashed out in the contest). </p> <p>He told colleagues there was now a conservative majority in the Senate, and the government would succeed in getting most of its agenda through. He said it would be a regular event in this parliament \u2013 situations like the tax package, where Labor tried to amend the package but ultimately did not vote against it because the government already had the numbers.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s fair to say Carr\u2019s objections today were both objections of principle and a proxy for disquiet within Labor about the post-election repositioning under way.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-30T03:55:11.133Z\">at 4.55am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d3fbd4c8f08d0b6ca53a3fe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-30T03:48:04.413Z\">4.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Andrew Probyn: </strong>Do you take personal responsibility for the loss?</p> <p><strong>Bill Shorten: </strong>That\u2019s why I stood down, absolutely.

It is causing unnecessary distress, and the government needs to go back to the drawing board. It\u2019s not that people shouldn\u2019t pay money they owe the government, but just relying on algorithms and automated systems, taking up the human factor, just giving people a number without asking how it has been arrived at.

This is absurd. </p> <p>We know, also, from the documents that have been produced, that they were concerned about land clearing on one particular farm being a breach of the EPBC Act.

It is incumbent on the federal government to explain what measures it has in place to ensure the safe use, handling and storage of nuclear substances in Australia. Currently it is not doing enough, with examples of skin exposure, contamination, spillages, and double doses. Australians depend on nuclear technology for medicines used in the diagnosis of heart disease, skeletal injuries as well as a range of cancers. The community must be assured nuclear substances and waste is handled safely and with care. An independent review by Professor Andrew Hopkins, which reported in October 2018, was commissioned to look at safety at ANSTO. Despite recommending the federal government commit to a replacement facility for Building 23, as soon as practicable, the government has no plans to do anything. The government must stop with its cuts to science, research and innovation. Instead of keeping an \u201copen mind\u201d about establishing a nuclear power plant in Australia, the government must fix the issues it already faces at ANSTO and the many other locations around the country where radioactive waste is currently managed. Wilson: You just said there was no process. Husic: He does not want to hear the end of the sentence. The reality is, people tried to find somebody desperately when they were concerned about the size of a debt that had been alleged they owed and they couldn\u2019t get through, the frustration and the number of cases where this occurred is already on the public record. The government last year ... nearly 40 people lost their jobs last year, the last line of defence on this, because the government was so confident the automated system would work the way it would and it didn\u2019t. But if Tim reckons it is working fine and dandy, let us see how he reacts when people respond to his comments. Wilson: I have to respond to that. He started the answer by saying there was no process and people should contact the ... office to ask for one, he went through every criticism he had of the process existing. This is the dishonesty sitting at the heart of the debate \u2013 people have an issue they should contact the department, raise the fact that they believe they have been incorrectly sent a notice and work towards a pathway to resolution, not deceive national television. The main argument was on robodebt, after Stuart Robert apologised in parliament for the department pursuing a $7,000 debt against a woman\u2019s deceased son. Tim Wilson: This is the same process the minister outlined under the previous government, the one before that, because when there is a discrepancy between somebody\u2019s tax return and the amount of money provided through welfare or benefit from the taxpayer, we have to go through a process of recouping. We can do that more accurately and most distinctly, the main thing is we are doing everything we can to get that right, because if not we are forgoing $1.9bn of revenue the opposition thinks we should not follow up. Ed Husic: I just need to jump in, we had Stuart Robert attempt this today \u2013 the system has been around for ages. What has been around is to collect money if it has been improperly extended to someone. What has happened under the Coalition with robodebt is the automation of this. The Coalition is looking to automate, looking to automate a number of processes and the way in which they have done this process has gone off the rails. No one is disputing the need to recover money if it has been received by somebody who has not validly received that benefit. In this case, the automated system, a seven-year program of automation under this government announced, in particular respect of robodebt, has gone off the rails, people were sent notices because they were not being double checked by a human pair of eyes, this was just sent out, and people were getting debt notices or debts they did not owe. Wilson: This point is dishonest \u2013 the idea that a human pair of eyes is happy to go through every single debt collection notice and every single history of somebody\u2019s tax payments and welfare payments, and make sure everything occurs, is verging on impossible, especially when talking on scale. That is why we have automated systems to compare to make sure there isn\u2019t anybody doing the wrong thing. As soon as a problem is identified, there is a pathway for people to raise it and respond. I\u2019m not trying to pretend that there may not be shock when people receive a notice \u2013 that is why we have a pathway to make sure that when there is evidence to the contrary they can take appropriate action. Husic: It is not. Frankly, Tim, you are the gift that keeps on giving when you just told viewers that there would be a system in place to be able to correct these things quickly. There is. The reality is anybody who watched you then pick up the phone to your office to set you straight, the experience of people was contrary. My point was that on the system, when it was seen. People have said, Tim, experience of people has been they could not get through quickly to have the resolution. Tim Wilson and Ed Husic have had to stop arguing on Patricia Karvela\u2019s Afternoon Briefing, because a division has been called in the House. It also looks like Scott Morrison used the \u201cunfunded empathy\u201d line in 2015, in relation to Gillian Triggs, the former human rights commissioner. Mike Bowers was in the chamber: Bob Katter, on Sky, says it is one of the terrible things about this country that we like to bring down tall poppies. He then says he loves bringing down tall poppies. But he is a bit sad in this case. Because the tall poppies here are the Packer family and he says the Packers have done great things for the country. Adam Bandt has responded to this: Labor and Liberal are on a unity ticket on coal. We are in a climate emergency and governments around the world are recognising it. Thermal coal exports need to be phased out by 2030 and we need to urgently support coal workers and communities during the transition. Parliament should be supporting a transition plan for coal workers as we phase out thermal coal exports. If Anthony Albanese is serious about fighting climate change and supporting coal communities, he should instruct his party room to boycott this group. Richard Marles was right when he said the global market for thermal coal has collapsed. Labor should be focusing on a plan to phase out coalmining in Australia so the industry can transition in an orderly and just way, rather than teaming up with climate-denying Craig Kelly on political stunts.\u201d It\u2019s been pointed out to me that the phrase Scott Morrison used yesterday in regards to Labor\u2019s question on Newstart, \u201cunfunded empathy\u201d, has turned up before. One of those places is the 2017 book Retaking America: Crushing political correctness, by Nick Adams. A quick perusal finds it: In my world, traditional American masculinity, predicted on masculine toughness and stoicism with doing the right thing, has no peer. It\u2019s erosion is one of the most untold tragedies of the last half-century. Unfortunately, this trend has extended to our national politics, too. Many of these people are afraid of their own shadow, incapable of leadership, dispensing tough love, and enacting painful reform, for fear of offending groups considered \u2018victim groups\u2019 by politically correct elitists. Economic reform, for example, is almost impossible, when one side of politics is all about unfunded empathy. And Scott Morrison calls time on question time. Andrew Wallace gets the next dixer, reminding me of his existence. Tony Smith again has to address members of the government not jumping when it is their question: \u201cThe call is going to alternate. I say to the House very briefly, there\u2019s people jumping \u2013 I\u2019m trying to alternate the call. There\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s not secret there\u2019s arrangements with an independent question early on in question time. If the government\u2019s decided not to jump, that doesn\u2019t mandate who I call. I did call \u2013 I did call the leader of the opposition immediately after the member for Maribyrnong. I did that on the basis that I thought he was first getting to this feet ahead of the member for Melbourne, but I do point out in any event, given the position of the leader of the opposition, if it was a contest, I would have called the leader of the opposition anyway. It obviously presents a difficulty with me. \u201cBut we had two questions from that side, and one from the government. We now had one from this side. All I can do is ensure that in allocating the call I alternate. And if members wish to have things run more smoothly with respect to the independents, it\u2019s something they have to sort out with the processes. It\u2019s not up to me to simply pick an independent because the government hasn\u2019t jumped. So, and what I have tried to do now is allocate the call as fairly as I can. The member for Melbourne had sought the call after being denied it as well. I thought that was the fair thing to do. So we\u2019ll now go back to the regular alternating of the call.\u201d Christian Porter, with the nod: There\u2019s two matters that we can provide in response. And perhaps the first is with respect to the statement that I made earlier today, and that is that all of the matters that have been raised in recent days in the media have now been referred by me to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, pursuant to section 18 of that act. And I noted for the members\u2019 benefit this morning, in making that referral, I\u2019m simply saying there are sufficient concerns that have been raised to allow for that precautionary refer to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. They may decide to take further action. They may report back to me there\u2019s not enough in it to warrant a full investigation, but that\u2019s the body that is best placed to investigate the matters raised in the media. As to the broad nature of the issue that you raise, I can say that with respect to the idea that there is some kind of favouritism or fast-tracking, there\u2019s systems in place, where a variety of passport holders, particularly referenced in the white paper on developing Northern Australia, are able to access and facilitate quick visa processing. There\u2019s nothing new in that. That occurred on both sides of the House, but if there\u2019s any specific allegations the member wants to make, then perhaps he needs to make them. Adam Bandt to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister and it\u2019s about his statement of ministerial standards. You said there was nothing before you to warrant taking action on Crown. Today you and Labor opposed a parliamentary inquiry into ministers and former ministers. The attorney general has referred some of the allegations to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity commissioner, but it won\u2019t look into if your ministers have acted inappropriately. Given the stench from allegations regarding the matters, can you ensure the House you have fully investigated and none of your ministers lobbied home affairs on behalf of Crown, or is it a case of don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell, with the government running a protection racket for ministers with ties to Crown Casino? Christian Porter: With respect to standing order 90 and reflections on members, that is a reflection on all ministers here without identifying particularly which minister he is reflecting on, and indeed, there were no allegations of the type he raised in the media specifically or otherwise. I think it\u2019s clearly out of order. Tony Smith: It\u2019s not up for me to judge what is in or out of the media. With respect to this point of order, the practice makes very clear on reflections. They generally have to be direct reflections on particular members of the parliament. You would find a precedent for questions of this nature have been asked before. Obviously, it was a long question. And the full 45 seconds worth. So I will allow the question and obviously the prime minister has given \u2013 I just say to the member for Melbourne, given the amount of preamble commentary, and the nature of the 45-second contribution, that wasn\u2019t all the question. The prime minister has extreme latitude in how he wishes to answer it. And I call the attorney general. I give the attorney the same latitude. We go to a dixer, and then we are going to Adam Bandt. Someone missed the jump, because Anthony Albanese calls Stuart Robert back to the box with this question: \u201cWhen will the government finally admit that its robodebt experiment has failed?\u201d Robert does not answer the question, and instead goes to the government having a lawful responsibility to recover outstanding debts. Which was not the question. Bill Shorten to Stuart Robert: \u201cIn May ... Anastacia McCardel was told her son owed a debt of almost $7,000. She has said, and I quote, \u2018I wanted to know how they thought Bruce would have worked his way through his paperwork when he was actually dead.\u2019 What advice can the minister give Ms McCardel?\u201d Robert: Let me first of all pass on my sincere condolences to Mrs McCardel. In many cases when the department raises a debt against someone who is deceased, and the knowingly know about it, if the debt is big enough, they will seek to recover it from the estate. In the vast majority of times, the debt will be wiped. Because of the size of the debt being uneconomical to recover and the length of time, the department should have simply waived the debt. They didn\u2019t, my department was wrong. I apologise for it.\u201d It\u2019s amazing how MPs can slam a billion-dollar industry though, just to own inner-city lefties. From an Ibis world report on Australia\u2019s coffee and cafe industry: Revenue for the cafes and coffee shops industry has grown moderately over the past five years, supported by Australia\u2019s vibrant coffee culture. Industry revenue is expected to grow at an annualised 2.5% over the five years through 2018-19, to $9.9bn.\u201d Obviously quaffing coffees is good for the economy. No matter where you are. Mike Kelly to Stuart Robert: \u201cI refer to the minister\u2019s previous answer. Can the minister explain why a 74-year-old widower was sent a letter this week claiming a debt from 21 years ago?\u201d Robert: \u201cLet me thank the member for his question. In relation to the specific case he mentioned, my understanding is the gentleman is a former public servant [who was] incorrectly sent a letter dealing with income stream issue, not a compliance. The department has recognised the error and apologised profusely in the media.\u201d Someone from the government benches yells \u201cthat was a wasted question\u201d and guffaws loud enough for the broadcast to pick it up. Bill Shorten to Stuart Robert: \u201cLast night he told the ABC and I quote, \u2018Bank records, of course, are always available for seven years. And the department won\u2019t be going back after seven years in terms of recovering that.\u2019 Does the minister stand by that statement?\u201d Robert: \u201cI thank the member for this question. I do stand by that statement, as at today, the Department of Human Services forward letters will say ... they will be starting at the 2013-14 financial year. There may well be some outstanding notices from previous financial years, but forward letters going out to ask about a discrepancy will be from 2013-14 financial year and onwards.\u201d Darren Chester is delivering a dixer and proving that you can be a National MP and minister and not actually be a complete dunderhead while answering a question your office has written. Bill Shorten to Stuart Roberts: \u201cHow many debt notices issued under the government\u2019s robodebt program have turned out to be wrong?\u201d (He seemed a little nervous, but that is to be expected, I suppose.) Robert: \u201cUnder the income compliance checking process, checking and updating the past income process, we have since 1 July recovered $1.9bn. Of the 800,000, 80% have resulted in a debt being collected. 80%. 80%. \u201cTo give some ... [context] ... right now across Australia ... there\u2019s $1.54m outstanding debts. \u201cThis government, like all governments, has a lawful responsibility to collect, where citizens have mismatched what they said they earned, versus what through their tax return they have been shown to earn. \u201cNow that mutual obligation is something that has been around for decades and decades. \u201cGovernments of all persuasions over the last 20-plus years have sought to recover debts that have arisen because citizens have put forward an assessment of their income and when their tax return came through, that was different. And that difference has to be accounted for. \u201cThat\u2019s the mutual obligation that citizens have with their government. So can I say to all citizens who are receiving income support, or indeed, family assistance payments, regularly update through either the myGov application, through a telephone service, or through a service centre, update the assessment of your income. Because when your tax return is returned, they\u2019ll be matched, they\u2019ll be checked and if there\u2019s any discrepancy at all, we have a legal obligation to contact the citizen concerned and seek to explain the deficit. \u201cThis has been a process that governments have done for well over 20 years, not just this government, but many members of the frontbench over there have been part of that. \u201cFrom 2010, the member for McMahon was the minister for DHS. That member did this process. The member for McMahon was the member for Sydney, following the member for Sydney, was the member for Gorton. He also followed that process. As will subsequent members. We seek to do it compassionately and sensibly, but there\u2019s a lawful requirement to ensure the right people get the right funds at the right time.\u201d Kevin Andrews gets ANOTHER dixer. That\u2019s like the third day in a row or something. It\u2019s been a while since he has seen this much action during question time. But I guess he\u2019s still coming to terms with Tony Abbott\u2019s absence and they do say it is best to keep busy. Anthony Albanese to Stuart Robert: My question is addressed to the Minister for Government Services. Have any victims of the Townsville flood received debt notices under the government\u2019s robodebt program? Robert: I thank the leader of the opposition for his question. And let me say at present under the income compliance program, no victims in the four postcodes around Townsville have received a debt notice. That was quick. From Chris Bowen\u2019s office: \u201cMinister Hunt must respond in detail as to why he awarded a Medicare MRI licence to a clinic operated by the vice president of the Liberal party South Australia, Cara Miller. \u201cIn April this year the government granted a Medicare MRI licence to Sound Radiology in Parkside, Adelaide, overlooking 443 other applications. This is despite Sound Radiology operating within 5km of nine other partially or fully Medicare-eligible MRI machines. \u201cIn a response to a question on notice on the MRI licence from the April budget estimates, the department responded claiming that the final decision was taken by the government. \u2018The successful applications were decided by the government, taking into account the assessment information provided by the department.\u2019 \u201cThe department also denied any knowledge that the clinic was operated by Ms Miller. \u2018The department was not aware that the CEO of Sound Radiology holds a position in the South Australian Liberal party.\u201d \u201cThe Liberals awarded just five Medicare MRI licences in their first five years of power. \u201cThe minister must not hide the truth about which clinics he is awarding MRI licences to and why, because under his watch out-of-pocket health costs have never been higher, and waiting lists have never been longer.\u201d Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg: When today\u2019s median household income datas proves that Australians are going backwards, why is this government always banging on about Labor instead of coming up with an economic policy to increase wages and living standards? Frydenberg: \u201cMr Speaker, we won\u2019t be lectured by Sir Tax-a-Lot over there, Sir Tax-a-lot. He\u2019s quite pleased and proud of Labor\u2019s housing tax and retirees tax.\u201d Ooooh sick burn. Frydenberg is really pleased about this line, because he shouts it again. \u201cWell, Mr Speaker, we won\u2019t be lectured by Sir Tax-a-Lot over there, Sir Tax-a-Lot. He\u2019s quite pleased and proud of Labor\u2019s housing tax and retirees tax. The co-architect with the member for McMahon over there, and the member for Maribyrnong will never forgive them, Mr Speaker. \u201cThe reality is this Hilda survey you refer to today, oh, he\u2019s very chirpy now, Sir Tax-a-lot is up and again. \u201cThis is a quote from the report that you just cited: \u2018Employment growth picked up in 2017, particularly for women who saw their employment rate rise from 69.5% in 2016, to 71.4% in 2017.\u2019 \u201cThe highest it\u2019s been in the history of the survey, Mr Speaker. We on this side of House, we\u2019re in favour of 1.4 million new jobs, Mr Speaker. We on this side of the House are in favour of lower taxes, Mr Speaker. We\u2019re in favour of $100bn of new infrastructure spending, and we on this side of House are in favour of record spending on schools, hospitals, and aged care. But we\u2019re not in favour of Labor\u2019s $387bn of higher taxes.\u201d In Senate question time, Michaelia Cash, representing home affairs minister Peter Dutton, was asked about our report just 11 people had access to the medevac briefing that was leaked to the Australian, despite the AFP\u2019s claims that there were too many people to investigate. The shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, asked Cash whether the investigation would be reopened. Cash responded the AFP considered the matter finalised. So that\u2019s a \u201cno\u201d then. The Greens are taking up the attack on the ACLEI referral of the allegations about fast-tracking visas for Crown casino. Greens leader Richard Di Natale asks if the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has inquired into the report that two federal ministers and one federal MP lobbied the department of home affairs to allow high rollers to bring cash from the airport. Mathias Cormann, representing the PM, warned Di Natale against \u201cwhat appears to be a desire to be both police officer charging, judge, jury and executioner all at the same time\u201d. He notes his answer yesterday that departmental officials have no discretion to waive visa character requirements. Di Natale asks if the ACLEI referral was made \u201cbecause they can\u2019t investigate politicians\u201d. Cormann rejected the premise of the question. He added that the department of home affairs has \u201cno evidence\u201d visa requirements were waived and says the \u201csame legal criteria are applied to all applications\u201d. Crown\u2019s share price has taken a 3% tumble as a result of Andrew Wilkie\u2019s speech in parliament detailing new whistleblower allegations against it. The company\u2019s share price is off 38c today, to $11.88 as of about 2.25pm. This follows a 3.24% fall yesterday as the market digested allegations in Nine newspapers and on its flagship TV current affairs show, 60 Minutes. Anthony Albanese to Josh Frydenberg: Does the Hilda survey released today show that Australians are better off or worse off than in 2013? Frydenberg: They\u2019re certainly better off. When he refers to the Hilda survey, they\u2019re better off since 2013, and when he refers to the Hilda survey, that was conducted to December 2017. Since then the unemployment rate has come down from 5.6 to 5.2%, the wage price index has increased from 2.1 to 2.3%. Real wages has increased. The participation rate has increased. And the ABS household income and wealth survey released earlier this month, that takes into account the full 2017-18 year, shows real median household disposable incomes has increased by over $2,000 per year compared to 2007-08. The other point about the Hilda survey \u2013 when it comes to poverty line it\u2019s fluctuated over time, but the broad trend has been downwards. This is especially true since 2007, when 12.4% of the population was in relative poverty. In 2016, the proportion had fallen to 9.6%. The bottom line is this government, this side of the House, has been responsible for helping to create the conditions where more than 1.4 million new jobs have been created, Mr Speaker. And lower taxes, lower taxes have ensured that Australians can earn more, and keep more of what they earn.\u201d It continues, but honestly, I am too busy quaffing coffees to pay attention. The minister for originality, Michael McCormack, delivers us the very original attack of slagging off city dwellers for *gasp* drinking coffee. \u201cWhile the warriors from Newtown and Marrickville sat ... about quaffing their piccolos ...\u201d HOW FRICKING DARE THEY? Personally, whenever I go to regional and rural Australia, I join the locals in a bracing cup of concrete, because according to our deputy prime minister, no one drinks coffee beyond the goat cheese curtain. Michael McCormack: we really need to unite the city and country and improve the discourse. Also Michael McCormack; look at those city dwellers quaffing their tiny coffees! FFS. Siri: what is the definition of \u201ca punish\u201d? David Gillespie saddles the despatch box, and therefore us, with Michael McCormack, which gives me the permission I needed to go make a cup of tea. \u201cAll politics is local, as it should be,\u201d says Sliced White. And I\u2019ve just added a bathroom visit to that break. Andrew Wilkie has the first independent\u2019s question. It\u2019s on what is being done to wipe Tasmania\u2019s debt to the federal government for its social housing \u2013 or at least the interest bill \u2013 as well as what is being done to address the issue of social housing in Tasmania. You may remember that Jacqui Lambie negotiated with the government to have something done on that debt, or social housing, in return for her vote on tax cuts. Michael Sukkar: (On the debt: it has been discussed.) Sukkar concludes with this: Through the agreement with Tasmania, we\u2019re contributing $33.7m, $3m of which is permanent, where it wasn\u2019t previously, and that is solely dedicated to homelessness. In addition, across the country the Coalition has announced a $78m commitment to support women and children escaping domestic violence, of which I know there are projects under way in Tasmania already, and this includes $60m to build emergency accommodation.\u201d Chris Bowen to Greg Hunt: Can the minister confirm that the Department of Health has advised Senate estimates that, and I quote, \u2018Successive applications were decided by the government.\u2019 Can the minister confirm the CEO of sound radiology is also the vice president of the South Australian branch of the Liberal party? There you go. Hunt: In relation to the latter item, I can\u2019t confirm. That matter isn\u2019t known to me, and to the best of my knowledge, has never been known to me. We receive submissions from the department, and the submissions are signed off in the ministerial office ... I would note in relation to fully eligible MRI units per 1,000 population, in the electorate of Adelaide, an opposition electorate, the rate of 100,000 people is 0.7. That is significantly lower than in south-east Melbourne, in Perth south, and east Melbourne, in the Australian Capital Territory, with 0.5, in western Sydney with 0.5, in Nepean-Blue Mountains, in Central Coast and Hunter with 0.6. These things are determined on a basis of need. What that does is it sets out the fact that area is significantly lower in MRI concentration than all those other regions of Australia.\u201d If Christian Porter is writing these dixers, it is just indicative of how busy he is, because OMG it might just be easier to put a microphone on the prime minister when he delivers his joint party room rah rah than put up with this. Put it in a press release. Let backbenchers ask questions that actually matter to their communities. #Deathtodixers Chris Bowen to Greg Hunt: Can the minister confirm that Sound Radiology in Adelaide is situated within 5km of nine other MRI machines with existing MRI Medicare licences? Hunt: I\u2019m very happy to check the details on that. But let me run through the criteria for this process. I understand the ALP ran a parallel process, but there was no identification of the grounds, there was no identification of the basis for ... for applications, and there was no identification of a formal process. In particular, I can indicate that on 4 February 2019 the government announced further investment in the MRI program, bringing the total units to over 50. On 23 September 2018, the government announced an invitation to apply an ITA process, to allocate Medicare eligibility to up to 20 additional MRI units comprising a mix of fully eligible units and partial units in metropolitan and regional areas. The closing time for lodging applications was 2 September 2018. In terms of the streams through which applications were available, they included the upgrade of partially eligible MRI equipment to full eligibility. Stream two is full Medicare eligibility for MRI equipment applicants with either an operational MRI unit at the practice, or will have one at the location by 31 December 2020. The grounds are set out in those terms and that\u2019s the process that\u2019s been followed. Chris Bowen is about to get back up \u2013 which means there is more to that MRI licence he just asked about . The prosecution of whistleblower Witness K \u2013 who revealed Australia spied on East Timor \u2013 and his lawyer Bernard Collaery was in the ACT magistrates court this morning. The hearing revealed that Collaery wants his case to be resolved in the supreme court on indictment but Witness K is still in negotiations with commonwealth prosecutors to deal with his case summarily. This morning Collaery and Witness K asked for hearing dates next week to determine the scope of national security information in the case to be vacated because what\u2019s the point in the magistrates court ruling if the supreme court will determine that point anyway? And as negotiations could fail, the substantive Witness K matter could end up in the supreme court as well. Counsel for the attorney general said the commonwealth would prefer the hearings were not vacated until it\u2019s clear that is necessary, and even if Collaery is off to the supreme court it wouldn\u2019t bind chief magistrate Lorraine Walker in the Witness K matter. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to split us,\u201d Collaery was overheard to say in the courtroom, although he later declined to give a statement. Walker: \u201cIt seems to me that it\u2019s important that the [Collaery matter] is committed as soon as is sensibly achievable. But I note there is some desire that that should go alongside that of Witness K in the event [his case is determined in the supreme court]. It is also desirable that any time that has been allocated for a hearing be utilised for a hearing should a hearing be necessary. There has already been considerable delay ... If there are to be conversations between representatives of Witness K and the commonwealth they should take place expeditiously.\u201d Walker adjourned both matters for mention at 9.30am on 6 August. So the procedural can has been kicked down the road, and it depends how negotiations go. The first dixer is straight out of the joint party room meeting about \u201cdemonstrating\u201d that the government is \u201con the side of local communities\u201d. #deathtodixers Chris Bowen to Greg Hunt: My question is to the minister for health. Can the minister confirm that the government has granted an MRI medical licence to Sound Radiology in Parkside, Adelaide, while overlooking 443 other applications? Hunt: The government has granted 53 licences and 43 have already commenced. The process was done through an independent process where applications were called and assessed by the department. But very interestingly, 53 announced, 43 already commenced. Two of them them have not commenced. In Kalgoorlie, in Western Australia, where we\u2019re waiting on the West Australian government to purchase the machines. And in Queensland, in relation to one of their own hospitals to deliver and do that. That is the situation. 53 announced, 43 already under way, and we\u2019re awaiting on the governments of Queensland and Western Australia as exemplars to deliver the final part. Speaking before Andrew Wilkie made his fresh set of allegations against Crown in parliament this afternoon, the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, defended the state\u2019s under-fire gaming regulator against allegations it has failed to properly supervise the company\u2019s Melbourne casino. \u201cNo, I think the regulator is particularly well resourced; they\u2019ve been provided with additional money in this year\u2019s budget; they\u2019ve got the powers that they need,\u201d Andrews said. Wilkie has long slated the Victorian commission for gambling and liquor regulation as an inadequate regulator, today calling it and Victoria police \u201cincapable or unwilling\u201d to enforce the law against Crown. There was a \u201cpeculiar power Crown has over VCGLR and Victoria police,\u201d Wilkie told parliament. The VCGLR has had little to say about the series of allegations aired against Crown over the past few days \u2013 a stance that is consistent with its general reluctance to discuss its activities. Its chief executive, Catherine Myers, doesn\u2019t appear to have given a single interview since she took on the role in 2015 (the Guardian has asked for one). \u201cAnyone who\u2019s got concerns about Crown or any other operator within our gaming industry should with confidence go forward to Victoria police if they think it\u2019s a criminal matter or go to the VCGLR,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cI know that they take issues of probity and integrity across the industry very seriously and I\u2019m very confident that they have everything they need to guarantee that probity and integrity as we look to the future.\u201d He denied that Crown, which is one of Melbourne\u2019s single biggest employers, was too big to fail: \u201cNo one gets a pass on integrity and probity when it comes to this industry or any industry.\u201d That was quite the hour! It\u2019s question time, time and given the amount of running around in the last bit, I won\u2019t make it to the chamber in time, so I\u2019ll be reporting from the broadcast. And why is the crossbench pissed? Mostly because the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement and Integrity doesn\u2019t have the powers to investigate ministers and former ministers. Hence no one involved in the parliament will be part of any potential commission inquiry. And Christian Porter finished with: I would say though that I think the member for Mayo\u2019s comments that anything other than support for the motion before the House reveals that the major parties are somehow beholden to the gambling industry is a frankly absurd contention to put. This has now been referred to ACLEI as I have noted. I think that is the appropriate course of action. I might also note for the benefit of the House, Mr Deputy Speaker, l did advise the member for Denison of the fact that I have already sent this mater to ACLEI as I am able to under section 18 of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act. My observation is that it was probably the better course to withdraw the motion in those circumstances but of course it is up the member for Denison to determine what he considers is the appropriate course. But having had the matter referred to ACLEI, which is the body appropriately place to investigate it, pursuing a motion to set up a parallel parliamentary committee inquiry is wrong-headed; it would actually discourage and withdraw efficacy from the ACLEI investigation. But if the motion is not going to be withdrawn it would be the government\u2019s view that it should be opposed and we will oppose it on the basis that this has already been referred through to the appropriate authority.\u201d Continued: ACLEI is I might say to Members who have supported this motion and spoken in favour of it is a very appropriate and in fact the most appropriate body to consider these allegations. They have very significant investigatory powers; very significantly stronger than those of a parliamentary committee, obviously including the ability to apply for search warrants, issue notices that attract a criminal penalty if not complied with. I would note that ACLEI also has the ability to hold hearings, exercise coercive powers and seize evidence. It is highly experienced in these types of investigations and indeed in considering prima facie allegations to determine whether or not a full investigation is necessary. And it\u2019s obviously better resourced to quickly and effectively consider the need for an investigation and to conduct that investigation into any alleged corruption if that is required. I might say that in addition to the observation that ACLEI is clearly the best placed body to consider these allegations I would also offer the observation that a Parliamentary Committee of the type that you now seek to have formed is totally ill-equipped to deal with an inquiry of the nature that your envisage or that may be required in a matter of this type. And I\u2019d also offer the observation that it would be significantly detrimental to have some form of Parliamentary inquiry running parallel to a potential ACLEI inquiry. There would be very likely significant legal issues and risks that could arise for any witnesses called before both hearings. And in fact a Parliamentary Committee inquiry would likely cause enormous difficulties to the efficacious running of ACLEI\u2019S inquiry if they determined to undertake one. I would also note that if ACLEI uncovered conduct by any other public service officers outside those determined in its remit as law enforcement officers or indeed civilians or employees of a commercial organisation who do not fall within ACLEI\u2019s jurisdiction, ACLEI can of course refer that information, and further allegations, to the AFP for further investigation. Now I just note as these allegations have now earlier today already been referred to ACLEI under the section of Act that I have nominated, it would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage. Here is Christian Porter\u2019s official statement on why the government is not supporting the cross bench push for a parliamentary inquiry into Crown: The Government is not intending to support the motion and I will explain in detail. Obviously it is the case Mr Deputy Speaker that the Australian Government takes all allegations of illegal activity very seriously. Everyone must abide by the Australian law and that is particularly the case for any members of our law enforcement, our immigration or our customs authorities. They, of course, as part of the broader Australian law enforcement community hold very privileged positions and as such are expected to uphold the highest standards of integrity and professionalism at all times. A strong integrity and professional standards culture is fundamental to public confidence in our work and the Australian Government\u2019s work. I have considered the allegations that have been raised in media reporting and particularly as they touch upon allegations which are either directly relatable to, or tangentially relatable to, Commonwealth officers. It is my view that there are sufficient concerns raised at least to warrant further investigations. Now I might note for the benefit of Members that were speaking to this motion that saying that there are sufficient concerns to warrant me as Attorney-General to refer this matter for consideration under section 18 of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006, is not to say that I have before me, or that there is any obvious evidence otherwise available that supports allegations against law enforcement, immigration or customs authorities. Rather it is the case that s18 of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act might be called a precautionary referral provision and I have already enacted that provision earlier today. So i can inform the House that I have already referred this matter, these allegations, to the Australian Commissioner for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI), under section 18 of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006. And under that referral provision it would now become open for ACLEI to decide whether or not to launch an investigation or indeed if they determined not to, that would be a matter which they would need to inform me as to what it was that they considered was appropriate and if it was no further action they would need to advise me of that and obviously that is advice that I would relay publicly. Kim Carr is unhappy. Pretty interesting ructions in today\u2019s Labor caucus meeting, particularly in light of the podcast interview we published at the weekend, which involved Anthony Albanese outlining Labor\u2019s strategy in this parliament (a strategy that has been dubbed \u201cbitch and fold\u201d in our office). The former Labor frontbencher Kim Carr expressed strong objections during today\u2019s meeting about the potential for Labor to vote against its own platform when considering an upcoming piece of legislation which gives effect to some of the recommendations from the royal commission set up by the former Labor prime minister, Julia Gillard. The bill deals with combating child sexual exploitation and includes mandatory sentencing for some offences, including (I gather), possession of child-like sex dolls. The recommendation to today\u2019s caucus meeting was the legislation be not opposed in the House, and the shadow cabinet to determine a final position after a Senate inquiry reports back. According to people at today\u2019s meeting, the relevant shadow minister, Kristina Keneally, telegraphed to colleagues that Labor might end up supporting the proposal, despite it containing mandatory sentencing provisions. Labor opposes mandatory sentencing in its federal policy platform. At that point, Carr rose in high dudgeon. He asked why Labor would support legislation contrary to the party\u2019s platform. He also wanted to know what the argument was for folding on the legislation if Labor proposed amendments that were ultimately unsuccessful. A lively conversation ensued. Various shadow ministers spoke in favour of the recommendation, including, I\u2019m told, Joel Fitzgibbon, who said Labor shouldn\u2019t be guided exclusively by the platform. Again, according to the accounts I\u2019ve been given, the shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, spoke in favour of the recommendation, but also expressed opposition to mandatory sentencing as a principle. Separately to that, Albanese took caucus members through a very similar conversation to the one he and I had in the podcast. He told MPs Labor was in a very similar position to where it washed up after the 2004 election (when John Howard gained control of the Senate after Mark Latham crashed out in the contest). He told colleagues there was now a conservative majority in the Senate, and the government would succeed in getting most of its agenda through. He said it would be a regular event in this parliament \u2013 situations like the tax package, where Labor tried to amend the package but ultimately did not vote against it because the government already had the numbers. It\u2019s fair to say Carr\u2019s objections today were both objections of principle and a proxy for disquiet within Labor about the post-election repositioning under way. Andrew Probyn: Do you take personal responsibility for the loss? Bill Shorten: That\u2019s why I stood down, absolutely. You have to take some responsibility. But I came here to talk about robodebt ... AP: Before we move on, can I just ask, now that you have referenced the fact that Labor is going through a review. Do you acknowledge that there is a difference between the merit of policies that you took to the election and perhaps the mistakes made in the messaging? BS: Oh, listen, I think you are a formidable interviewer, but what I am not going to do is preempt the review. AP: Are you in politics for the long haul? BS: I love being in politics; it\u2019s a chance to make a difference. I love being part of a united team. I am very grateful to the voters in my electorate for giving me another term. AP: Is a really credible to ditch policies you have held for so long? BS: The party is reviewing the whole election and what I am going to do is give time for that process to happen. While I am a very staunch defender of the ABC, I am very alarmed with the cuts that have happened to the ABC. [But I will not be pre-empting the review.] AP: Do you have any resentments, finally? BS: No. I am very privileged to be very fortunate. On Labor\u2019s election loss, Bill Shorten says he takes responsibility and that is why he stood down as leader: Andrew Probyn: You haven\u2019t done much media since the election, so thank you for joining us today. The Coalition thought you would win on 18 May. What sort of grieving process do you go through when you experience something so deeply personal like that? Bill Shorten: Well, it was very disappointing. Very, very disappointing. AP: It was more than that, wasn\u2019t it? BS: Very disappointing for the nation, for the people who voted for Labor, and very disappointing personally, but I have had some time off with the family, I am still in parliament and I have had the chance to hold the government to account and work for the opposition. You have got to move on; the party is going to have a review and we will see what comes out of that, but in the meantime I am very grateful to the united team who supported me for the success and the millions of people who voted for Labor. We will learn the lessons and be a very diligent and united opposition. AP: On the personal shock, though, what sort of grief process do you go through when there is such a grand expectation that you are going to be the next prime minister? BS: Oh, listen, it\u2019s happened. What I have been able to do is reconnect with my family, and that is a silver lining. And to the millions of Australians who voted Labor, Labor will still be a very determined opposition and we will still keep advocating our values that plenty of people wanted to vote for us, and we will have to learn our lessons which is why the party is engaging in a very extensive review. AP: Did you find any comfort in the fact that the election was relatively close? BS: It was very disappointing. Just plainly, very disappointing, and disappointing for me, and I think disappointing for a lot of people, but nonetheless it has happened, that\u2019s the democracy, as I said on the night. The people have expressed their view so we need to move on and be the best possible opposition. It\u2019s a privilege to serve in parliament. I understand that and I have still got the fire for parliament and making sure that a work as a united team. Bill Shorten is prosecuting the robodebt issue in his interview with Andrew Probyn on the ABC: The robodebt system is causing untold hardship. It\u2019s seriously malfunctioning. Did you know that over 100,000 of our fellow Australians have received incorrect demands to pay debts to government that they didn\u2019t owe? It is causing unnecessary distress, and the government needs to go back to the drawing board. It\u2019s not that people shouldn\u2019t pay money they owe the government, but just relying on algorithms and automated systems, taking up the human factor, just giving people a number without asking how it has been arrived at. Asking people to find financial records [from] 20 years ago, it\u2019s causing too much hardship and unfairness.\u201d How to recoup over payments? If you make 100,000 mistakes, I think time is up, isn\u2019t it? One of the social institutes who researches this matter has an alarming statistic, that 429 people under the age of 35 after getting robodebts have died. This is a problem, and it is not the job of government to intimidate and harass its own citizens, especially when they won\u2019t even explain, when people get this letter of demand from the government, how the number has been arrived at.\u201d I think, given this, you can also expect to see Bill Shorten make his 46th parliament question time debut. It sounds like the joint party room was very much about everyone in the government needing to demonstrate that \u201cthey are on your side\u201d. Zali Steggall is also speaking in favour of the parliament launching its own inquiry. If the government and Labor are opposing this in the House, there is a stronger chance than me drinking all of the mimosas a drag queen can hand me this weekend (which is a very strong chance) that both will oppose this in the Senate as well, meaning a parliamentary inquiry will be dead in the water \u2013 for the moment. Witness K was in court today Adam Bandt is on his feet and he is QUITE cranky over the government and Labor refusal to back the parliamentary inquiry. He says the parliament is running \u201ca protection racket for ministers and former ministers with connections to Crown casino\u201d. Mark Dreyfus says Labor will also oppose the parliamentary inquiry, given the referral to the law enforcement integrity commissioner. Christian Porter is responding to crossbench calls for an inquiry. He says he has referred the allegations to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, which he says is the correct place for the inquiry to take place. The government will not support a parliamentary inquiry. The commission will look at the referral and decide whether to hold an inquiry or not. Porter says it would be counterproductive and potentially damaging to any ACLEI investigation. Centre Alliance MP Rebekha Sharkie is seconding the motion Andrew Wilkie has put forward. Andrew Wilkie is detailing whistleblower claims, told to his staff in interviews, which level further allegations against Crown casino. Given the content, I\u2019ll wait until I have a proper transcript of what he has said, but it is hard to see how there won\u2019t be an inquiry into this. Christian Porter\u2019s office has just sent out an alert saying the attorney general will make a statement on the Crown issue in the House as soon as Andrew Wilkie has finished speaking. He is in the chamber having a chat to Tony Burke from the looks of things. This follows the Nine network and newspapers reporting into Crown and its dealings. The Greens are trying for one in the Senate, but Andrew Wilkie is trying to get an inquiry into Crown in the House. Just on that last post: if only there was some form of mechanism \u2013 almost like a national energy guarantee \u2013 which could potentially take the best of both worlds and set this country up with an energy policy for the first time in a decade. You could even give it some naff name, like \u201cthe Neg\u201d to make it easy to talk about. And if only there was some sort of minister who could lead the way in talking to the states about energy ... but that would take the federal energy minister actually calling the other energy ministers in the council of Australian governments together for a meeting in some sort of energy Coag, and he seems a bit busy at the moment. The energy Coag, which is meant to meet twice a year, has been delayed, and there is no word on when it will be held. Because Angus Taylor wasn\u2019t facing enough pressure elsewhere: the New South Wales energy minister, Matt Kean, has again raised the spectre of the national energy guarantee, the policy the federal Coalition dumped along with Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s prime ministership. In a speech to the Clean Energy Council summit in Sydney, Kean said the Berejiklian government still hoped for a national climate and energy policy but may take matters into its own hands if its federal counterparts refused to take action. The NSW government still supports the national energy guarantee and will continue to support a national mechanism that integrates climate and energy policy. As I\u2019ve said before, if the commonwealth won\u2019t get on board NSW will consider going it alone.\u201d Acknowledging competition in clean energy development is global, Kean said NSW wanted to be the easiest jurisdiction in the OECD for energy construction. He said the state had $26bn in renewable plants at various stages of development. It has doubled its large-scale clean energy capacity in just 14 months. The Greens will hold a press conference at 1pm as the MPs attempt to get support for an inquiry into Crown casino\u2019s dealings. All this press release from Catherine King means is that we will all have more Michael McCormack \u201ccongestion-busting\u201d mangling to endure in question time. Don\u2019t say you haven\u2019t been warned. Australians are spending on average 4.5 hours a week getting to and from work, a rise of 23% since 2002. The data revealed in the latest Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda) survey, shows that average weekly travel times to and from work rose from 3.7 hours to 4.5 hours. While Australians are struggling with ever-increasing commute times the Morrison government refuses to bring forward infrastructure investment needed to bust congestion. Commuters in Sydney are experiencing a massive 71-minute average journey to and from work each day, while Melburnians are spending an average of 65 minutes. Australians living outside our capital cities fare no better, with huge blowouts in average daily commute times across the regions. More Australians are facing longer commutes, with one in six Australians travelling more than two hours to and from work, up from one in eight in 2002.\u201d One of my side gigs is being ever vigilant to the ways of the emu, given they did in fact, defeat our army. I regret to inform you that the scouts are back. When will our politicians deal with the *real* issues? * *Yes, we will return to regular auspol programming immediately The bells are ringing, meaning the parliamentary day is officially about to get under way. In the Senate today, the Greens will be aiming to get a motion up to get an inquiry into the Crown issue, raised by the Nine network and newspapers, through the legal and constitutional affairs committee. No word on whether Labor or the crossbench will be supporting it as yet, but the Greens are \u201chopeful\u201d. Remember how Andrew Colvin said the AFP didn\u2019t even start the investigation into who leaked the medevac security advice to Simon Benson at the Oz because there was not a huge chance of success given how many people had access to the advice? Well, Josh Taylor reports, yeah, nah: More than 200 public servants were suspected of being the source of a Department of Home Affairs leak on apparent security risks in the medevac legislation, documents obtained by Guardian Australia reveal. The legislation, which passed parliament this year, facilitates the transfer of refugees from Manus and Nauru to Australia for medical treatment. While parliament was debating the bill in February, the Australian\u2019s Simon Benson reported a classified ministerial briefing from Asio and Border Force that warned the bill would \u201cundermine regional processing\u201d and would \u201ccompromise Australia\u2019s strong border protection regime\u201d. The Department of Home Affairs asked Australian federal police to investigate the leak as a potential breach of the Crimes Act. Case notes for the referral to the AFP, obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws, reveal that the department was focused on two documents: a classified briefing prepared in December and an unclassified version of the briefing requested by the immigration minister, David Coleman. It looks like the MPs are starting to emerge from their party room meetings. Well that makes everything OK then. From Stuart Robert\u2019s office: The first round of National Disability Insurance Scheme data has been released as part of the Morrison government\u2019s commitment to demonstrate full transparency of the NDIS. Today the minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, Stuart Robert, released data collected directly from participants, their families and carers and providers. \u2018The outcomes data collected by the National Disability Insurance Agency represents one of the largest surveys of those within the disability sector that has ever been conducted in Australia,\u2019 Robert said. \u2018Data on participant outcomes shows improvements across various domains including children\u2019s development, community participation, personal relationships, and choice and control for people with disability since the NDIS began. \u2018We will continue to release further data and I am committed to open information sharing which both guides and measures the progress of the NDIS, a world first and the largest social reform since Medicare. \u2018As demonstrated with today\u2019s release, the data will build a clear and accurate picture of what is working in the NDIS and what challenges we need to overcome to ensure long term outcomes for participants.\u2019 All data released as part of the transparency agenda can be found on the NDIS website: https://www.ndis.gov.au/about-us/data-and-insights/. All of the shared data is subject to strict privacy controls so that individuals cannot be identified. The MPs are in their various party room meetings, which is why it has gone quiet. We\u2019ll let you know what was discussed when they break. Kristina Keneally and Mark Dreyfus are picking up the attack on Peter Dutton. Ed Husic started this \u2013 he has been a rallying cry within the party room since the election to take the fight up to the home affairs minister, who, given his powers, is the most powerful minister in the government, outside the prime minister. And for a few days there \u2013 he was more powerful than the prime minister. Dutton is in the UK, talking all things Five Eyes, and so hasn\u2019t been here to do the usual LABOR IS SOFT ON BORDERS routine, despite Labor having voted with the government on every single piece of national security legislation for years. But now, with a raft of new national security bills before the parliament, Labor seems to be speaking up about its concerns with legislation which largely has received a tick and flick the moment \u201cnational security\u201d is mentioned. That hasn\u2019t gone so great, as we have seen with the metadata consequences, raids on journalists and tech companies questioning their business in Australia. Keneally and Dreyfus though, are focused on Dutton: For the second week in a row, home affairs minister Peter Dutton has been caught out failing to have legislation in place to keep Australians safe. Last week we learned 40 so-called \u2018jihadis\u2019 were able to return to Australia unmanaged because Mr Dutton failed for four years to introduce a temporary exclusion order (TEO) scheme to control the return of foreign fighters. Now, Mr Dutton continues his pattern of mismanagement as the government seeks to resume debate in the House of Representatives on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Amendment (Sunsetting of Special Powers Relating to Terrorism Offences) Bill 2019. The home affairs minister\u2019s embarrassing legislation seeks to extend Asio\u2019s \u2018questioning and detention warrant\u2019 (QDW) power and \u2018questioning warrant\u2019 (QW) power which are both due to \u2018sunset\u2019 on 7 September 2019. This legislation can only be characterised as Mr Dutton admitting he has not done his job. Over the past three years, Asio itself, three independent national security legislation monitors, and the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security (PJCIS) have all said these powers are in need of reform. Mr Dutton has done nothing to reform these powers and now wants another year to do the work. This is especially concerning as Asio themselves have said the QW power needs to be reformed so that they can better protect Australia against espionage and foreign interference \u2013 something the head of Asio, Duncan Lewis, revealed over the weekend is at \u2018an unprecedented level of activity\u2019. Given Mr Dutton\u2019s failure to do his work, Labor will seek to amend the government\u2019s bill to give Mr Dutton three more months \u2013 rather than the additional 12 months he is asking for \u2013 to get on with the job. Labor\u2019s amendments will also mean the QDW power, which has never been used since it was introduced in 2003, will sunset on 7 September 2019. Australia would be safer if Mr Dutton had spent more time working on national security and less time plotting to become prime minister.\u201d The other issue ticking along today is the government\u2019s request that the Asio powers, which allow the security agency to detain suspects for up to a week, and question them for up to 24 hours, without charge, be extended for another year. These powers have been in place since 9/11 now, so I think we can give up the pretence these are \u201ctemporary\u201d powers now. The parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, which we just ignore now when we want, said last year it was time, once again, to review those powers. You will be shocked to learn that has not happened. So Labor, in its latest round of \u201cwe have concerns\u201d about national security bills, wants the powers extended for just three months. This was Richard Marles this morning, on ABC radio: Well we\u2019re going to be moving amendments today to reflect what has been put forward by the parliamentary joint committee. I mean, it\u2019s not good enough that the minister essentially comes into the parliament looking at his shoes and announces that the dogs eaten his homework. We actually need the minister to come forward with a more modern regime in respect of Asio\u2019s questioning powers ... The three months is an extension, so what we\u2019re saying is we\u2019ll give you an extension of three months not 12 \u2013 but, actually, do your job. Don\u2019t come in here saying the dog ate your homework, actually do your job and come up with what should be a modern regime fit for purpose in 2019, rather than having Asio rely on a set of powers which date back to 2001 and have been significantly criticised by a whole range of parties since then.\u201d If the government says no, will we see another #bitchnfold? Stay tuned. And given that we are talking about Stuart Robert again, just your semi-regular reminder that he has written a book called In the Footsteps of Jesus and his Amazon \u201cabout the author\u201d is a book in itself. Stuart currently serves his nation as a member of the Australian parliament representing the northern Gold Coast electorate of Fadden in the House of Representatives, a seat he has held since 2007. He has been a minister of state, serving at different times as the assistant minister for defence, the minister for veterans\u2019 affairs, minister for human services and the minister assisting the prime minister for the centenary of Anzac. Prior to entering parliament, he co-owned a medium-sized information technology company that was twice named as one of the fastest growing 100 companies in Australia. He previously served in the Australian army for 12 years as an infantry and intelligence corps officer and is a graduate of the Australian Defence Force Academy and a top 10 graduate of the Royal Military College Duntroon. He saw operational service in 1998 on the PNG island of Bougainville following the devastating civil war. He was a founding director of Watoto Australia and a member of the Watoto International board. Based in Uganda, Watoto operates the world\u2019s largest non-institutional orphan care program and is now exporting this program globally. He holds a masters in business administration, masters in information technology and a bachelor of arts (hons). Stuart\u2019s previous books include Hope the Watoto Journey and The trial of Lieutenant General Hiroshi Tamura: a question of command responsibility. He is married to his beautiful wife Chantelle and has three sons. He loves four-wheel driving with his family, paragliding, learning Chinese, playing the piano and serving in his local church. Anthony Albanese also says Labor won\u2019t be letting the Angus Taylor matter dropped. Asked why the opposition didn\u2019t pursue the Nine Crown revelations in question time yesterday, the Labor leader had this to say: We\u2019ll set our own priorities for question time, and yesterday we had the ongoing scandal around Angus Taylor that we\u2019ve concentrated on. I mean, Angus Taylor\u2019s circumstances just don\u2019t add up. You have circumstances whereby he says he made representations on behalf of local farmers, but he can\u2019t produce a single letter or a single email. All he can say is: he ran into a bloke in Yass and had a chat. This is absurd. We know, also, from the documents that have been produced, that they were concerned about land clearing on one particular farm being a breach of the EPBC Act. So that\u2019s why we asked: \u201cWas that farm the one connected with Jam Land?\u201d Angus Taylor has so many questions to answer. He stood up in parliament yesterday and gave a statement that was incomplete, that didn\u2019t satisfy anyone. And no wonder, he sits on the frontbench there with his colleagues inching away from him, further and further, so they\u2019re not in the shot. The person who is in the gun on this issue is Angus Taylor. He has real questions to answer and we\u2019ll continue to pursue these issues. This is a very serious abuse of power by a minister in a government that abuses power all the time. Bill Shorten isn\u2019t speaking on it, on camera. At least not yet. I think you can probably guess why. So instead Jim Chalmers was sent out to doors this morning, to push Labor\u2019s case on why it should go: The system is ruining people\u2019s lives. Robodebt has been a shambles from the beginning. The Morrison government needs to take responsibility for the fact that we\u2019ve seen revelations about the woeful, shameful pursuit of some of the most vulnerable people in our community. This government has form when it comes to cracking down on the most vulnerable people in Australia. Robodebt hasn\u2019t worked. It isn\u2019t working. And the government\u2019s incompetence is ruining people\u2019s lives when they\u2019re at their most vulnerable. Anthony Albanese also had some things to say about it this morning: The government\u2019s ongoing robodebt scandal means that this system should be scrapped. You now have circumstances whereby they\u2019re sending debt notices to the families of dead people. This is not on. One hundred per cent of my local constituency [who] came to my office with robodebt concerns and had their debts either fully scrapped, or reduced. One hundred per cent were mistakes. The fact is, that this is a scam from the government in order to try to get money from people who don\u2019t actually owe that money. I\u2019ve got an idea for the government: why don\u2019t they actually employ some humans to relate to other humans on Human Services, on service delivery? Instead, they have attacked people \u2013 set up a system of robodebt which is having disastrous consequences. It\u2019s putting real pressure on families. Shorten\u2019s statement continues: It is not just Bruce McCardel\u2019s mum Anastasia. Every day brings another robodebt horror story. There is Norm Austwick, a recently widowed 79-year-old who was hounded for $67.55 from last century (1998) that he never actually owed. We have a government minister contradicting a member of her department and the Townsville Community Legal Centre in denying robodebt has been unleashed in flood-ravaged Townsville. There is that disturbing statistic from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare where at least 429 Australians under 35 have died after receiving a robodebt notice. Lawyers for the Department of Human Services admitted in court on Friday the government agency got it \u201cwrong\u201d as the legality of the whole robodebt scheme faces scrutiny in two federal court actions. Robodebt is inaccurate, harsh and unfair. It is a system that is malfunctioning and the minister needs to go back to the drawing board. He should no longer ignore the trail of human heartache that is occurring in robodebt\u2019s wake. But ... Labor has spoken out, for the first time, against robodebt. Bill Shorten, who heads up the shadow portfolio which takes it in, says it has so \u201cseriously malfunctioned\u201d it \u201cmust be scrapped\u201d. Bill Shorten\u2019s statement: Revelations from a mourning mother that her disability pensioner son continued to be hounded over an alleged debt even after his death should shame government services minister Stuart Robert to finally act and address the problems at the heart of this scheme. We recognise the right of government to recoup legitimate debts that are owed. But robodebt is not that, it is a mess: \u2022 It is inaccurate: the computerised calculation is claiming false debts that when challenged have led to more than 100,000 claims being changed. (The inaccuracies not only relate to the amount of money owed but have extended to clients\u2019 student histories.) \u2022 The operation of that computerised calculation has little to no human oversight. Centrelink officers act to enforce the debt number but apparently do not check that it is correct. \u2022 Recipients of debt notices are given no evidence or detail of how the figure claimed is arrived at. \u2022 The onus of proof is reversed meaning recipients must prove they do not owe the amount of money being claimed. (With many of the debts claimed several years old this can be a painstaking and torturous process of trying to obtain historical statements from banks.) The minister will not concede any of this is a problem. Yet robodebt is not just inaccurate. It is being enforced in a harsh and cruel way and we now know it is being driven from above. The ABC\u2019s 7.30 Report has revealed Centrelink compliance officers are being pushed on their \u201cdaily targets\u201d and \u201cindividual and team performance\u201d. It is increasingly clear that this government intends to balance the books on the backs of some of our most needy and vulnerable people. This, last night, did not go well for Stuart Robert. Robert is not the strongest media performer on his best day. Put him against someone with Laura Tingle\u2019s experience and, well, it\u2019s sort of like watching a reality TV star go up against Beyonc\u00e9. That shiz is never going to end well. Labor, after their shellacking in coal country \u2013 Queensland and the Hunter region included \u2013 are partway through the \u201cwe should have spoken up more in defence of coal\u201d stage, led by Joel Fitzgibbon, who has done many a mea culpa on the issue. In the Parliamentary Friends of Australian Coal Exports, both Craig Kelly and his co-chair want to celebrate the $68bn in export revenue in the last financial year \u2013 which is 208m tonnes of thermal coal and 179m tonnes of metallurgical coal. In terms of jobs though, coalmining is not the mecca it is often held up as \u2013 the latest Labour Force Survey showed that in the four quarters to February this year 52,600 people were employed by the coal industry. In coalmining, for the last financial year, it was just over 38,000. Remember this? It\u2019s happening. Craig Kelly has sent out an email invite to colleagues, inviting \u201call senators and members to join and celebrate the invaluable contribution that Australian coal exports make to our nation\u201d with co-chair, Joel Fitzgibbon. Those wanting to join, just have to email Kelly \u201cand simply say \u2018I\u2019m in\u2019.\u201d Cool beans. As the government, led by Christian Porter, begins whirring up to get the ensuring integrity bill up (short title: unions are terrible), the union movement is starting to speak up against the bill \u2013 louder. The ACTU president, Michele O\u2019Neil, told ABC radio this morning that John Setka, the government\u2019s poster child for why this bill is necessary (even though it is is not retrospective and wouldn\u2019t actually impact him), is not representative of the entire union movement: This bill is not about one person and not about one union as much as the government wants to hammer that issue ... It\u2019s like ... anything when we find anything that\u2019s wrong with the behaviour of one company or one individual, that every company or individual should be treated the same. Centre Alliance wants the bill expanded to cover private organisations as well, not just the union movement. Jacqui Lambie has said she wants Setka out, but has some concerns about the legislation. So Porter, who now seems to be the busiest person in the government, has some work to do. Bet he is THRILLED. Less than 24 hours after Jim Chalmers asked Josh Frydenberg in question time how many recommendations from the banking royal commission had been legislated (spoiler: not many) we get this from Frydenberg\u2019s office: The Coalition government has today released exposure draft legislation that extends the unfair contract term (UCT) regime to insurance contracts. Recommendation 4.7 of the royal commission into misconduct in the banking, superannuation and financial services industry recommended extending the application of the unfair contract terms regime to insurance contracts. In the government\u2019s response to the royal commission it agreed to implement this recommendation. Consumer law currently protects consumers against unfair contract terms that: \u2022 would cause a significant imbalance in their rights and obligations under a contract \u2022 are not reasonably necessary to protect the business, and \u2022 would cause detriment (financial or otherwise) to a consumer. In his final report, commissioner Hayne observed the considerations that render a UCT regime appropriate for other contracts of financial products and services apply equally to insurance contracts, and there was no reason for the current exemption for insurance contracts to continue. Removing the exemption for insurance contracts from the UCT regime will ensure consumers and small businesses have the same protections regardless of which financial service or product they are purchasing. The government is taking action on all 76 recommendations contained in the final report of the royal commission and will continue to take the necessary steps to restore trust in Australia\u2019s financial system. Just a day after the prime minister declared he would not engage in \u201cunfunded empathy\u201d the latest Hilda survey finds poverty in Australia has continued to increase \u2013 and welfare is a pretty big factor. As Luke Henriques-Gomes reports: Poverty in Australia is increasing again after several years of decline, a respected University of Melbourne study has found, with changes to welfare policies cited as a possible contributor. The annual Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda) survey, released on Tuesday, found the proportion of people living below the relative poverty line \u2013 50% of the median income \u2013 increased in 2017, from 9.6% to 10.4%. Poverty rates also rose using the lower \u201canchored\u201d measure in both 2016 and 2017. Researchers said the trend was likely caused by the \u201ctightening of the screws\u201d of the welfare system, which has seen many Australians moved off higher pension benefits and on to the Newstart allowance. But it is not in the government\u2019s plan to raise Newstart. Even with, Barnaby Joyce\u2019s motivations aside, pressure is mounting within the Coalition. So the deputy prime minister wants you to just \u201cmove\u201d. Others, in some of the richest electorates, like Wentworth, are asking you to consider the cost to the budget. But like climate change, so often the cost of not doing anything is even worse. The Hilda survey will see the focus stay on Newstart \u2013 and for the reasons it should \u2013 not because a politician\u2019s six-figure salary is less than their previous six-figure salary, but because it is too low to live on. It\u2019s cruel. We\u2019ll bring you that and everything else which happens today. It\u2019s party room and caucus day, so you\u2019ll have that as well. Mike Bowers will be making his way through the hallways, and you\u2019ll have access to Katharine Murphy and Paul Karp as well. Someone needs to bring me a coffee. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

      "bodyText": "Soccer was a huge passion in Oliver Strong\u2019s young life. Right up to his death from acute myeloid leukemia in June 2015 at the age of 12, he was a standout athlete and goalkeeper, a healthy, vibrant and popular boy with a zest for living that inspired his teammates, friends and family. So when Oliver died suddenly at a Miami children\u2019s hospital, just 36 hours after doctors first diagnosed the disease, his parents Simon and Vilma started looking for answers. What they found was disturbing. Cases of pediatric cancer in the United States surged by almost 50% from 1975 to 2015, according to alarming but under-reported statistics by the National Cancer Institute, and in 2018 up to 16,000 children from birth to age 19 will have received a new diagnosis. Yet what really elevated the disquiet of Oliver\u2019s parents was increasing concern over the role that carcinogenic environmental toxicants, including industrial waste and pollutants, were believed to be playing in the rise of childhood cancer. \u201cThere\u2019s almost an unspoken scientific consensus that it\u2019s always environmental,\u201d said Simon Strong, who with his wife set up Oliver Forever Strong \u2013 a foundation in their son\u2019s memory. Oliver\u2019s Forever Strong has now teamed up for an ambitious research study with scientists at the Texas Children\u2019s Hospital, home to the nation\u2019s largest pediatric cancer center, and the Baylor College of Medicine. Through the website thereasonswhy.us, the study will harness social media to help collate information from a wide geographical spread. Families with their own experiences of childhood cancers will sign up and receive a questionnaire in the coming months seeking information including the manifestation and progression of their cancers as well as demographics. Dr Michael Scheurer, director of the childhood cancer epidemiology and prevention program at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital, said: \u201c[This research] \u2026 will allow families who might not live near one of the existing study centers to participate as they are comfortable. \u201cWe realize individuals won\u2019t know if they\u2019ve been exposed to a certain chemical or specific agent so we try to gather an overview of their environment, where have they lived over the course of time, when the child was conceived, during mom\u2019s pregnancy, during early childhood, up to the point they developed their cancer. Are those residences located near Superfund sites, or in areas with high levels of air pollution or water contaminants? \u201cIn the end, if we see that several kinds of cancers share some risk factors that\u2019s important information, but we want to start with a very homogeneous group of cancers and start looking into these patients first. Signposts will pop up along the way.\u201d Environmental factors Strong says the hope is to eventually build a more detailed picture of the correlation between toxicants and childhood cancer. \u201cI, like most people, thought it\u2019s just bad luck and dodgy genes, and you discover we\u2019re quietly encouraged to think that,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] I found a paper published by the World Health Organization \u2026 it\u2019s always triggered by external agents that damage our DNA and the body\u2019s ability to deal with that damage.\u201d In his own son\u2019s case, Strong admits to second guessing events in the months and weeks leading up to Oliver\u2019s death, which came after a week of headaches. Strong says he has no idea if it was any kind of factor in his son\u2019s death but that he regrets using Roundup on their patio to get rid of weeds. \u201cOliver\u2019s brother Edward said they both hated the smell of that stuff. [On one occasion] I looked at the container and saw glyphosate, and looked that up and saw it was declared a probable human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. \u201cAnd we all know now about the jury verdicts regarding glyphosate [three juries in the US have awarded damages linking the weed killer to cancer; Bayer its manufacturer insists it is safe and is appealing]. Strong said someone had also told him about artificial turf and \u201cthe role it might be having in an apparently high level of childhood cancer\u201d. He said: \u201cLook at the turf and the black spongy stuff that\u2019s in it. It\u2019s mostly diced up, used vehicle tires, it\u2019s petrochemical stuff. There are strict regulations for the disposition of full vehicle tires, but nothing when it comes to dicing them up and using them as a spongy surface for athletes to play on. \u201cSo I\u2019d been exposing Oliver to Roundup, he\u2019d been playing for six months as a goalkeeper on this stuff.

Cancer research funding cut by government Privately-funded research will likely increase in importance as federal funding falls for tackling pediatric cancer, the leading cause of death in the US for children past infancy. In February, Donald Trump announced a $500m appropriation over 10 years, compared to a seven-year, $1.8bn investment under Barack Obama. The president has also slashed environmental protections that Strong says has contributed to the \u201cemasculation\u201d of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). There are tens of thousands of synthetic chemicals registered by the EPA but only a small proportion tested for toxicity, Strong says. \u201cIt\u2019s in our foods, packaging and clothing, building materials, cleaning products, cosmetics, toys and baby bottles. And even less is known about the effects of simultaneous exposure to multiple chemicals. \u201cThere are hundreds of communities across the country where people are raising their voices.

      "bodyText": "The Australian manufacturer of weapons systems being sold to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates has maintained none of its products have ever been used in Yemen. The chief executive of EOS Defence Systems, Ben Greene, defended the company against suggestions its equipment had been, would be, or could be used in any human rights violations. Greene also said the equipment sent to the UAE was only a demonstration unit ahead of future sales. Last week it was revealed the Australian government had approved the export of Australian weapons systems to the two Gulf nations, despite global concern about the supply of weapons to countries in the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, which has been accused of human rights violations and atrocities. Photographs taken inside Sydney\u2019s international airport showed the shipments were destined to Saudi and UAE government forces, with some sent the same week a UK court ruled it illegal to sell arms to Saudi Arabia. The photographs also identified the sellers as Australian firm Electro Optics Systems (EOS), and ATK Alliance Techsystems Operations (Orbital ATK), a US-based company which sells EOS equipment. EOS was first identified as a supplier in December, but it would not confirm who the buyer was, instead saying only that its products had never gone to Yemen. In the wake of last week\u2019s story, EOS maintained its assertion that \u201cno EOS product has, at any time, been deployed to or used in Yemen\u201d. \u201cFurthermore, no EOS product has been supplied to military forces which have been or are currently deployed to Yemen.\u201d Internal documents obtained by the ABC showed the company previously said that Saudi Arabia\u2019s ministry of interior, to whom the weapons were intended, had no mandate to operate beyond the Saudi-Yemen border. Greene told Guardian Australia he had personally gone through reported lists of human rights violations in Yemen, and confirmed none involved equipment which EOS or its competitors produced. Greene said the equipment sent to Saudi Arabia was supplied for US programs to support the Saudi Ministry of Interior for its border operations, and did not cross over. \u201cWe are physically in contact with the equipment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to install it and maintain it.\u201d He said EOS employees or local Saudi contractors would perform maintenance on the equipment every few weeks on average, which could range from cracked glass to bullet holes. He said much of the equipment sent to Saudi Arabia had not left warehouses yet. Asked about the shipments to the UAE, Greene said \u201cnothing has been delivered to the UAE\u201d. Asked about a photograph of a shipment inside Sydney airport, which listed the beneficiary as the UAE Armed Forces Joint Logistics Command in Abu Dhabi, Greene first said the photo could be faked, or that the shipment was either still at the airport or in the air. The photographed label shows the package was consigned to EOS\u2019s Abu Dhabi office. Greene said the EOS office was the recipient of the system and the UAE Armed Forces were listed as beneficiary because it had to approve the import licence. It was the first time the R400S system had been sent to EOS in the UAE, he said, and related to a $450m contract announced in February for remote weapon systems for UAE Navy and for critical UAE infrastructure protection. \u201cIt has no lethality whatsoever, its purpose is only for demonstration and test,\u201d said Greene. \u201cIt\u2019s tested in advance of future shipments which might happen. \u201cSubsequently at some stage later on, if the shipments start under the contract we\u2019ve already announced, that could make up part of our shipments.\u201d Charities have warned Australia\u2019s approach is undermining global efforts to prevent foreign weapons being used in the war in Yemen. Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Finland and Germany have all refused to sell arms to Saudi Arabia. In February, Germany extended its arms exports ban despite pressure to back down. Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has previously threatened to cancel a multimillion-dollar defence contract in response to the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Save the Children\u2019s policy and advocacy adviser, Kavitha Suthanthiraraj, said Australia should follow Europe\u2019s lead. Suthanthiraraj said the conflict had already resulted in the deaths of 85,000 children \u201cfrom causes including starvation, malnutrition and disease\u201d. \u201cThe reported sale and export of Australian-made weapon systems to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates is deeply concerning and undermine global efforts to prevent foreign weapons being used in the war in Yemen,\u201d she said. \u201cBoth Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been accused of extensive human rights abuses in Yemen, including the targeting of civilians, which the UN said may amount to war crimes.\u201d Ghassan Hage, a spokesman for the Gulf Institute for Democracy and Human Rights, urged the Australian government to \u201crespect and carefully consider\u201d the decisions of those countries which have stopped or are considering ending exports to the Saudi-led coalition. \u201cAustralia is obligated by international standards [set] on 24 December 2014 when Australia became a signatory to the international Arms Trade Treaty,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must prevent our national industry from getting involved in human rights violations.\u201d",

Her father was a striking miner who worked at the Lofthouse colliery, among others; her mother raised her and her two brothers against the backdrop of one of the most bitter and protracted industrial disputes in living memory.</p> <p>The experience shaped her. She grew up on stories about the kindness of her community, dining on tinned peaches from unlabelled cans donated by a family friend who worked at the local canning factory, and the importance of pulling together and looking after each other.</p> <p>\u201cI grew up in a politicised household,\u201d she says. \u201cMy dad is a central figure for me in how I think about things. I grew up with a sense of fairness, and of what injustice looks like, and also healthy cynicism about critically analysing the way information is delivered to you. That sense of \u2018when we stand together and we act collectively we are stronger\u2019 has always informed my thinking.

After school and A-levels at Wakefield College, she studied industrial relations at Lancaster University, where she went on to do a master\u2019s on the causes, consequences and solutions of the pensions crisis. Her PhD was about pension disputes, trade unions and the pension crisis.</p> <p>She landed a job as a lecturer at Leicester University in 2009, moving to Sheffield where she became a senior lecturer in employment relations in 2017. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the past 14 to 15 years researching trade unions, industrial relations and pensions. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anybody more specialised in that area in the UK than me.\u201d</p> <p>Grady admits it was a huge emotional burden having to tell her students last year about the teaching they would miss because of their lecturers\u2019 industrial action. \u201cTo know you are essentially abandoning these people who you care very much for and who rely on you, yes, that was difficult.\u201d</p> <p>Overwhelmingly, however, she says students gave lecturers their backing \u2013 with many of them joining the picket lines and sharing the banter, sense of solidarity and the cakes \u2013 and going on to organise student occupations in support.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/16/universities-accused-of-importing-sports-direct-model-for-lecturers-pay\">Universities accused of 'importing Sports Direct model' for lecturers' pay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For staff, there was a new camaraderie and shared sense of pride. \u201cWe were not all alone in our offices, we were together every day. It was a real democratising moment where all the hierarchies that existed in your day-to-day working environment just disappeared.\u201d</p> <p>The pickets braved \u201cthe beast from the east\u201d. Only the geographers, says Grady, were appropriately dressed. \u201cI don\u2019t think the employers could have predicted that by allowing the dispute to go on for as long as it did that they were creating that alternative space for those solidarities to flourish.\u201d</p> <p>As the grassroots candidate to succeed the outgoing UCU general secretary, Sally Hunt, forced to retire in February because of ill-health, Grady won with a significant mandate, picking up 64% of the vote in the second round, with a record turnout. Come September she will be touring branches up and down the country, doing everything possible to get people to vote for strike action.</p> <p>This time there will be simultaneous strike ballots, one to defend pensions, and a second to secure a fair deal on pay, workload, equality, and job security. Ballots open on 9 September and will run until the end of October.</p> <p>On the pensions ballot, Grady warns: \u201cWe are heading towards another round of industrial action, because employers are refusing to cover the cost of the extra contributions USS has demanded.\u201d And on the second ballot: \u201cPay has been held down for too long. It is time for a comprehensive deal for university staff on pay, equality, workload and job security that puts staff first.\u201d</p> <p>The UCU\u2019s higher education committee will meet in November to discuss the results of the ballot and what comes next. Grady is optimistic. \u201cOne of the refreshing things that you see in the sector is an appetite for people to stand up for themselves.\u201d If strike action follows, there will almost certainly be cake.</p>",

Her father was a striking miner who worked at the Lofthouse colliery, among others; her mother raised her and her two brothers against the backdrop of one of the most bitter and protracted industrial disputes in living memory. The experience shaped her. She grew up on stories about the kindness of her community, dining on tinned peaches from unlabelled cans donated by a family friend who worked at the local canning factory, and the importance of pulling together and looking after each other. \u201cI grew up in a politicised household,\u201d she says. \u201cMy dad is a central figure for me in how I think about things. I grew up with a sense of fairness, and of what injustice looks like, and also healthy cynicism about critically analysing the way information is delivered to you. That sense of \u2018when we stand together and we act collectively we are stronger\u2019 has always informed my thinking. When you grow up in a working-class community, you really feel that.\u201d After the miners\u2019 strike finally ended, her father left the colliery and her parents opened a pub \u2013 \u201cthe community living room\u201d \u2013 where Grady worked on Saturdays and Christmas Day, sending lonely older neighbours home with Christmas leftovers. After school and A-levels at Wakefield College, she studied industrial relations at Lancaster University, where she went on to do a master\u2019s on the causes, consequences and solutions of the pensions crisis. Her PhD was about pension disputes, trade unions and the pension crisis. She landed a job as a lecturer at Leicester University in 2009, moving to Sheffield where she became a senior lecturer in employment relations in 2017. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the past 14 to 15 years researching trade unions, industrial relations and pensions. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anybody more specialised in that area in the UK than me.\u201d Grady admits it was a huge emotional burden having to tell her students last year about the teaching they would miss because of their lecturers\u2019 industrial action. \u201cTo know you are essentially abandoning these people who you care very much for and who rely on you, yes, that was difficult.\u201d Overwhelmingly, however, she says students gave lecturers their backing \u2013 with many of them joining the picket lines and sharing the banter, sense of solidarity and the cakes \u2013 and going on to organise student occupations in support. For staff, there was a new camaraderie and shared sense of pride. \u201cWe were not all alone in our offices, we were together every day. It was a real democratising moment where all the hierarchies that existed in your day-to-day working environment just disappeared.\u201d The pickets braved \u201cthe beast from the east\u201d. Only the geographers, says Grady, were appropriately dressed. \u201cI don\u2019t think the employers could have predicted that by allowing the dispute to go on for as long as it did that they were creating that alternative space for those solidarities to flourish.\u201d As the grassroots candidate to succeed the outgoing UCU general secretary, Sally Hunt, forced to retire in February because of ill-health, Grady won with a significant mandate, picking up 64% of the vote in the second round, with a record turnout. Come September she will be touring branches up and down the country, doing everything possible to get people to vote for strike action. This time there will be simultaneous strike ballots, one to defend pensions, and a second to secure a fair deal on pay, workload, equality, and job security. Ballots open on 9 September and will run until the end of October. On the pensions ballot, Grady warns: \u201cWe are heading towards another round of industrial action, because employers are refusing to cover the cost of the extra contributions USS has demanded.\u201d And on the second ballot: \u201cPay has been held down for too long. It is time for a comprehensive deal for university staff on pay, equality, workload and job security that puts staff first.\u201d The UCU\u2019s higher education committee will meet in November to discuss the results of the ballot and what comes next. Grady is optimistic. \u201cOne of the refreshing things that you see in the sector is an appetite for people to stand up for themselves.\u201d If strike action follows, there will almost certainly be cake.",

But the EU has been very consistent in the position it\u2019s taken. It\u2019s been very united and if you\u2019re pinning the entire strategy on the belief that suddenly that\u2019s going to change then that\u2019s doomed to failure, or it\u2019s a strategy that\u2019s destined to fail because you actually want the alternative which is a no-deal Brexit.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sturgeon said the hour-long meeting had involved a \u201clively exchange of views\u201d about independence.</p> \n<p>Asked about the prospect of a second independence vote when he was at Faslane, Johnson refused to state categorically that he would block a second vote but restated his position that the 2014 vote had been \u201ca once in a generation consultation of the people\u201d, adding: \u201cThe confidence of the public in politicians would be undermined even further if we were to go back on that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sturgeon, who has already put forward legislation to enable a second referendum, said she would consider over the summer whether to accelerate the framework bill and discuss it with MSPs once Holyrood reconvened after the summer recess.</p>",

Johnson was criticised throughout his leadership campaign for appearing to promise different things to different people, with moderate Tory backers convinced he will strike a deal and hardline Eurosceptics relishing the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. During the campaign, he said the chances of a no-deal were a \u201cmillion to one\u201d but he also pledged to take the UK out of the EU on 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d. Johnson was warned before his visit by the Scottish Tory leader, Ruth Davidson, that she could not sign up to his plan for a no-deal Brexit. But she said her meeting with him in Edinburgh on Monday afternoon had been \u201cincredibly constructive\u201d and they talked about \u201cthe need to make sure we can get a deal across the line\u201d. Johnson heaped praise on her before the meeting, claiming he was \u201cwith Ruth in wanting to avoid a no-deal Brexit\u201d and describing her as \u201ca fantastic leader\u201d. Davidson has made no secret of her reservations about the new prime minister and Johnson infuriated her last week by sacking her ally David Mundell as Scottish secretary, against her advice. But after the meeting, Davidson said that she \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d backed the prime minister\u2019s Brexit strategy. While touring the Faslane military base earlier, Johnson insisted there there was an \u201cassumption that we can get a new deal\u201d and claimed he was reaching out a hand to EU leaders to see if an agreement could be made. \u201cThe backstop is no good. It\u2019s dead. It has got to go. The withdrawal agreement is dead, it\u2019s got to go. But there is scope to do a new deal,\u201d he said. He argued his approach was \u201cvery outward-going and that he did not want the UK \u201cto be aloof or hanging back, I want us to engage, to hold out the hand, to go the extra thousand miles\u201d to do a deal with EU leaders. This was at odds with his deputy official spokeswoman who had made clear hours earlier that the government\u2019s main assumption was that the UK was heading for a no-deal Brexit on 31 October unless EU leaders changed their minds on reopening the withdrawal agreement. \u201cI think he has been clear that the backstop has to be abolished,\u201d she said. \u201cHe remains confident that the EU will stop claiming that the withdrawal agreement cannot be changed. But until that happens we must assume that there will be a no deal Brexit on 31 October.\u201d She went on to make clear that Johnson would not be taking up invitations from Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, until they were willing to concede the Irish backstop must be replaced. It also emerged that Johnson has only just got round to scheduling a call with Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, who is central to any decision taken by the EU in relation to the backstop. Irish officials are understood to view the delay in contacting Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, as indicative of an unwillingness to enter serious talks. Varadkar is adamant that the backstop must stay to prevent a return to a hard border on the island of Ireland and preserve the integrity of the single market. Sturgeon said she was not sure if Johnson\u2019s lack of clarity was part of a deliberate approach, but added: \u201cI think more likely he doesn\u2019t know the answer. I think he wants a no-deal Brexit. In taking the hardline position [that he will not negotiate unless the backstop is removed], I don\u2019t see how you can conclude anything other from that than he either wants a no deal or is pretty relaxed about a no-deal Brexit.\u201d Sturgeon said she had gleaned no real clarity about his plans for meeting other EU leaders. \u201cThe only strategy you can get from him is that he thinks the EU is going to blink. But the EU has been very consistent in the position it\u2019s taken. It\u2019s been very united and if you\u2019re pinning the entire strategy on the belief that suddenly that\u2019s going to change then that\u2019s doomed to failure, or it\u2019s a strategy that\u2019s destined to fail because you actually want the alternative which is a no-deal Brexit.\u201d Sturgeon said the hour-long meeting had involved a \u201clively exchange of views\u201d about independence. Asked about the prospect of a second independence vote when he was at Faslane, Johnson refused to state categorically that he would block a second vote but restated his position that the 2014 vote had been \u201ca once in a generation consultation of the people\u201d, adding: \u201cThe confidence of the public in politicians would be undermined even further if we were to go back on that.\u201d Sturgeon, who has already put forward legislation to enable a second referendum, said she would consider over the summer whether to accelerate the framework bill and discuss it with MSPs once Holyrood reconvened after the summer recess.",

It is David Hare\u2019s new version of <a href=\"https://www.theatreroyal.org.uk/event/uncle-vanya/\">Uncle Vanya</a>, in which Everett also stars, and all did not go as planned in its first preview. \u201cIn a fight scene I elbowed the leading actor, John Light [who plays Dr Astrov],\u201d says Everett. \u201cHe really hurt his eye and had to go to hospital. He came back and then, leaning around the stage with his one eye, he fell off it and really hurt his leg.\u201d</p> <p>The play\u2019s opening has been pushed back a week, until Light is back on his feet, but if this production returns Chekhov\u2019s 1898 play to the farce that Everett says it was written to be, and not a straightforwardly bleak tale of midlife ennui and angst, then the mishap has an edge of black humour, too.</p> <p>Talk about breaking a leg, I say. Yes, says Everett, and describes the strain of the unexpected on stage. \u201cI\u2019m in a state of collapse.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps because he is an actor accustomed to playing arch, unflappable types, he does not look as if he is in a state of collapse. He appears equanimous and elegant, sitting in a back room of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre-royal-bath\">the Theatre Royal</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre-royal-bath\"> Bath</a>, bearing the mildly aristocratic air of a gentleman farmer. Aged 60, he lives in the West Country these days, having moved in with his 85-year-old mother a few ago, together with his partner of 10 years. \u201cI now like trees and birds. And cows. I love cows..\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3fe9feea60f1bae5711ea0127008b9c8cb2ad100\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fe9feea60f1bae5711ea0127008b9c8cb2ad100/0_0_2184_1456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"rehearsing Chekhov\u2019s Uncle Vanya at Theatre Royal Bath with John Light.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rehearsing Chekhov\u2019s Uncle Vanya at Theatre Royal Bath with John Light.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nobby Clark</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It wasn\u2019t always so. In the late 70s he ran away from private school, the shires and his military family\u2019s Catholicism to make his name in acclaimed films such as <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086904/\">Another Country</a> and <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088987/\">Dance With a Stranger</a>. He also spent years doing drugs, clubs and parties, looking incandescently beautiful alongside Hollywood types.</p> <p>Life now is a far cry from all that. The ferocious beauty has mellowed into a gentler, crinklier handsomeness. He has a modesty that may reflect the lessons learned from the extreme gyrations of his career \u2013 from A-list stardom to the much-documented wilderness years.</p> <p>When I ask him about directing a play for the first time, he says it has been challenging \u201cfor a flake\u201d but , at this age, he feels lucky to be challenged. While directing is new, the stage isn\u2019t. He learned his trade at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/mar/04/ian-mcdiarmid-citizens-theatre-glasgow-1970s\">Citizens Theatre</a> in Glasgow. Three years before the film of Another Country<em>,</em> he starred in the play. Where is he more at home? \u201cBecause one is continually questioning oneself and what one is doing, you\u2019re never really at home. You\u2019re always starting at zero. I love being involved with theatre and film and with stories in general. I find each of them very challenging. Everything is a potential train crash, but that\u2019s the nature of our business.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3c949bdbec463eb37020ec1d89f1366897d01e5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c949bdbec463eb37020ec1d89f1366897d01e5e/0_0_2098_1417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Acclaim \u2026 Rupert Everett and Colin Firth in 1984 breakthrough film Another Country.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Incandescent \u2026 Everett and Colin Firth in 1984 breakthrough film Another Country.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vanya, the character Everett plays, is 47 and in the grip of midlife crisis. The play grapples with the loss of youth alongside the complications of love. Does ageing bother Everett? \u201cNo, I feel thrilled not to be young. I\u2019m older, but I haven\u2019t got any maladies yet.\u201d</p> <p>And when you look in the mirror? \u201cI don\u2019t look in the mirror. Not much. I\u2019ve spent a long time looking in the mirror \u2026 I had that gay shame when I was young. I wanted to be better looking all the time. I was always striving to look right.\u201d</p> <p>Some of it was because of his size. He grew 12 inches when he was 15. His limbs are still rangy though he swears he has shrunk a couple of inches from his once 6ft 6in(-ish) frame. Back then, he had a 19in waist and was rake-thin. \u201cThat\u2019s why I never felt good-looking. Immediately after I started working, I found these two queens who made padding. I had a padded bum, padded legs, padded shoulders.\u201d</p> <p>Things have got better as he has aged. \u201cI learned how to be more interesting as an actor. I learned how to write a bit. I feel very lucky that so many things came along.\u201d</p> <p>He is right about the writing. His two autobiographies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/20/vanished-years-rupert-everett-review\">showcased a genuine talent</a>, though writing is not an easy option, he says. \u201cAn actor is a group animal and a writer is a solitary animal. For a group person to isolate themselves and have just themselves to feed off is very complicated. Sometimes it goes well, but mostly it\u2019s a process of endless reworking and getting it wrong.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2segbP94SE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P2segbP94SE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Writing has also given him the freedom to create roles that were not being offered to him in film, he has said. He came out as gay in an era when it could kill an actor\u2019s career, at the height of the Aids epidemic. He has said that it led to typecasting ever since, exemplified by his role as the gay friend opposite Julia Roberts in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/may/02/my-guilty-pleasure-my-best-friends-wedding\">My Best Friend\u2019s Wedding</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think people who say they have no regrets are a bit wacky. There are so many things to regret</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Might he be tempted not to come out if he had his time again? \u201cFor me it wasn\u2019t possible. There was no way I was going to pretend. I was so proud to be part of it all. The gay scene at the beginning of the Thatcher years was so remarkable because you counted just for showing up. And it was classless and ageless. You\u2019d go to the <a href=\"https://davidsmemoirs.wordpress.com/2016/12/28/tales-of-the-coleherne/\">Coleherne Arms</a> [a former gay pub in west London] and you\u2019d see a duke of 70 chatting to a plumber of 25 and then they\u2019d go off to spank each other.\u201d</p> <p>Still, the dearth of acting roles is what led him to write the screenplay for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/22/the-happy-prince-film-review-rupert-everett-oscar-wilde\">The Happy Prince</a>, a biopic of the elderly Oscar Wilde, which he also directed and starred in. It was a labour of love for Everett, who worked on it for over a decade, and it should have won the Oscars it was predicted to scoop. He has starred as Wilde on stage, too, in a revival of Hare\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/sep/12/the-judas-kiss-review\">The Judas Kiss</a>, for which he brought back the padding of his youth. \u201cI always imagined Wilde was revoltingly well hung. So I wore a padded cock and the front five rows, I could see, were thinking, \u2018My God, I had no idea Rupert Everett was so well hung!\u2019 I had go down a few sizes because it was taking over.\u201d That was four years ago in the West End. \u201cMaybe I should put it back in for Vanya!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8d83e93b0017d36462fa143eb9946753562a2a75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d83e93b0017d36462fa143eb9946753562a2a75/0_0_3964_2672/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Padded \u2026 as Oscar Wilde with Freddie Fox in The Judas Kiss by David Hare in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Padded \u2026 as Oscar Wilde with Freddie Fox in The Judas Kiss by David Hare in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The writing also became more necessary because of the growth of ageism, as he sees it, which means even male actors now must present eternal youth on screen. Men he says, had it very easy for a long time. \u201cYou could be a man aged 73 and have a 22-year-old girlfriend. That\u2019s all changed. The result for us is that we haven\u2019t got roles going off into the grey distance.\u201d</p> <p>The prospects for gay actors have changed in Hollywood, he thinks, but only because the industry has been forced to accept it. Ironically, he has observed the erosion of gay rights in the real world. \u201cIt seems to me that there\u2019s no \u2018live and let live\u2019 any more,\u201d he says. \u201cLast year I was opening my film in Italy, and you\u2019d go to a place like Genoa, where the state withdrew funding for its gay pride march, and there would be other horrible things you\u2019d hear, about families who\u2019d locked up their lesbian daughter \u2026\u201d</p> <p>The world is changing in a way that gives him another reason to be happy about ageing. He is particularly despairing of British politics. \u201cThe end of it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/04/ann-widdecombe-likens-brexit-to-emancipation-of-slaves\">Ann</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/04/ann-widdecombe-likens-brexit-to-emancipation-of-slaves\"> Widdecombe\u2019s speech in Brussels</a>. The most alarming, repulsive, depressing, shaming thing that I\u2019ve ever seen. More shaming than Nigel Farage somehow, right down to the old cockney rolling of the Rs,\u201d he says, and demonstrates the sound.</p> <p>Despair is a central theme of Chekhov\u2019s play; Vanya\u2019s midlife crisis is filled with disappointment as he reflects on the past. I wonder about Everett\u2019s midlife audit. There is regret at losing friends, he says, but he won\u2019t be drawn on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/28/rupert-everett-memoir-vanished-years\">his famous falling-out with Madonna</a>. \u201cI think people who say they have no regrets are a bit wacky. There are so many things to regret. The way one treats people; the way one writes off relationships; the way one, looking back, backstabs. Middle age is a reckoning. You need nerves of steel to get through it.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8YiltlZGB0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/G8YiltlZGB0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There is disappointment, too. The reality of his life did not \u2013 and perhaps could not \u2013 meet the totality of his ambitions as a young man. \u201cI wanted to be that big Hollywood movie star as a kid. I was so blindly ambitious that I would have done anything to get along. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t have killed ...\u201d</p> <p>But doesn\u2019t he see through that kind of fame now? \u201cYes, but still \u2026 I think everybody\u2019s disappointed. Everybody wants to have more.\u201d</p> <p>So what is the ambition now? He is working on another autobiography about the 10 years it took to make his Wilde film. He has also written the screenplay for<em> </em>a film about Paris in the 1970s, which he is trying to get financed, and a TV series about a boyband. He swings between doubt, despair and hope as he lists the projects. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can write any more,\u201d he says in one breath, and then in the next: \u201cI\u2019ve got tons of things I\u2019d like to try and do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he says, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to know the time to stop trying so hard.

      "bodyText": "When Nasiru Ibrahim goes on patrol around his village, he\u2019s not looking out for criminal activities, or the usual community problems. Instead, Ibrahim is making sure people in Yammawar Kafawa, in northern Nigeria\u2019s Kano state, are using toilets. Last October, the villagers agreed to stop defecating in fields, bushes and streets, and instead use the newly-built toilets, as part of the Nigerian government\u2019s drive to end open defecation by 2025. \u201cMy message to our people is simple: use your toilets and make sure you wash your hands after,\u201d said 36-year-old Ibrahim, who belongs to a community committee working to create awareness around good sanitation and encourage residents to use and build better latrines. Every year more than 70,000 children under five die in Nigeria from diarrhoea as a result of unsafe water and poor sanitation conditions. At least 24% (47 million people) of the population practise open defecation, according to a 2018 national survey. The government has acknowledged the dire situation, with Muhammadu Buhari, the Nigerian president, declaring a state of emergency on water, sanitation and hygiene in November 2018. This was followed by a national campaign \u2013 Clean Nigeria: Use the Toilet \u2013 launched in April 2019 to jumpstart the implementation of a national action plan to reach the 2025 target. The government is working with the UN children\u2019s agency, Unicef, the UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DfID), the EU, and NGO WaterAid. Ibrahim, a father of six, admitted to practising open defecation until government officials visited the village and explained how the habit endangered health. The visit had an instant effect. Villagers worked as a group to improve sanitation and to encourage families to dig pit latrines. Now, anyone found defecating in the open faces a fine. Hand-pump boreholes were also dug with the support of Unicef and DfID to encourage people to wash their hands after going to the toilet, and villagers built a hand-washing site. In April, Yammawar Kafawa became open-defecation free, a status that state authorities are working to certify officially. Abubakar Sale, 50, a a father of seven, said villagers\u2019 lives have been changed. \u201cBefore we used to have several illnesses. We could not walk along the [regular] site where we defecated in the open without closing our nose. Some people even did it in their farms or at the back of their houses,\u201d he said. \u201cSince we started building toilets and got this borehole there is better health among us; we are fine and healthy. There are toilets everywhere now and our children are not getting sick easily like before. If you look at the children they are smiling and happy, without problems.\u201d Community-led projects like those in Yammawar Kafawa are proving effective elsewhere in Nigeria. A four-year evaluation of WaterAid schemes in 247 communities in Enugu and Ekiti states, by the London-based Institute of Fiscal Studies and Royal Holloway, University of London, found that community-led total sanitation programmes increased toilet ownership by 10 percentage points, and decreased open defecation by 9\u201310 percentage points. \u201cOur evaluation of the Nigerian programme implies that resources can be used in a more efficient manner by targeting sanitation programmes at poorer rural areas where they are more likely to be effective,\u201d they wrote. \u201cBetter targeting of sanitation policies such as CLTS (community-led total sanitation) should take into account the fact that there are no silver bullets and that these approaches may not be appropriate in all contexts.\u201d However, only 13 of the 774 local government areas in Nigeria have been certified as being free of open defecation so far. \u201cWe need to take the message to the public, we need to take the message to communities, and to households, so people can buy into the campaign and own it,\u201d said Bayo Ogunjobi, a water and sanitation specialist with Unicef Nigeria. Ogunjobi added that more money and better collaboration between the government and local communities were needed, as was better access to safe water and improved sanitation in markets, motor parks, highways, religious centres, schools, and health facilities. \u201cIt is hard to say whether [Nigeria\u2019s target to eliminate open defecation by 2025] will be met, but it is fair to say that it will be hard work,\u201d said Britta Augsburg, one of the authors of the study and deputy director of the development sector at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. \u201cFrom all I know, the government is putting important steps into place to improve their strategy and ensure financing for the same,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this is important as I believe that business as usual, would not get them to meet their target.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Just after 6am, Victor Funez fills a three-gallon plastic pitcher with water from a tap in the cemetery, balances it on his head and trudges home, where his wife waits to soak maize kernels so she can make tortillas for breakfast. Funez, 38, stops briefly to help his daughter with some homework before heading back to the cemetery with the pink urn. This load fills large plastic milk and juice bottles used for drinking throughout the day. The tap is the family\u2019s only source of water, so Funez makes the journey along the dusty dirt road 15 to 20 times each day. \u201cMy husband\u2019s job is to fetch the water so I can do the housework. It\u2019s like this every day, all day,\u201d said Bianca Lopez, 46. \u201cWe can live without electricity \u2013 we have candles and lamps \u2013 but water, that\u2019s essential.\u201d La Estaci\u00f3n is a makeshift community of 59 households along disused railway tracks that cut across Nejapa \u2013 a semi-urban municipality on the northern outskirts of El Salvador\u2019s capital. This tiny Central American state is one of the most murderous in the world, plagued by warring gang factions and security forces who shoot to kill. Relentless bloodshed and chronic unemployment have driven wave after wave of migration as Salvadorans seek a better life. But in recent years, widespread water shortages are increasingly helping fuel unrest and forced displacement. \u201cMarginalized communities struggle day to day to get access to enough water. It\u2019s not a question that this could one day cause social conflict \u2013 it already is \u2026 the whole country is close to crisis,\u201d said Silvia de Larios, the former director of ecosystems and wildlife at the ministry of environment and natural resources (known by its Spanish acronym, Marn). El Salvador is the most densely populated country in Central America. It also has the region\u2019s lowest water reserves, which are depleting fast thanks to the climate crisis, pollution and unchecked commercial exploitation. According to one study, El Salvador will run out of water within 80 years unless radical action is taken to improve the way the country manages its dwindling water supplies. As in just about every aspect of life in El Salvador, the water problem is only exacerbated by corporate interests, corruption and the country\u2019s vicious street gangs. Local women have long used the banks of the San Antonio River as an open-air laundry. But the laundry spot lies within Barrio 18 territory, whereas La Estaci\u00f3n is controlled by the rival MS-13 gang \u2013 and crossing gang boundaries can get you killed. Nejapa has one of the highest murder rates in the country, with 71 homicides per 100,000 habitants in 2018, according to research by Elizabeth G Kennedy, a migration and violence scholar. L\u00f3pez\u2019s only income comes from washing her neighbour\u2019s clothes, but she endures the hardship of the tap and pitchers rather than crossing the frontline. \u201cIt would be much easier at the river, but it\u2019s not worth my life.\u201d For some, there\u2019s no choice but to take the risk. At 10.30am, Elena Fuente, 46 and daughter-in-law Jocelyn \u00c1lvarez, 23, rush towards a waiting rickshaw with plastic bowls jam-packed with freshly washed clothes balanced on their heads. \u00c1lvarez loses her balance and falls, scraping her knees badly. She\u2019s new to the river laundry, as their MS-13-controlled neighbourhood previously had running water every night, but there\u2019s been not a drop for the past 22 days, and no one knows why. \u201cWe risk the gangs because we\u2019ve no other choice \u2013 we\u2019d run out of clean clothes,\u201d said Fuente. None of the women would dream of bringing a man to the spot, she added. \u201cThat would cause a problem.\u201d Years of drought has prompted water rationing in urban and rural areas across the country. Yet much is wasted: most rainwater is lost due to widespread deforestation and eroded river basins; once in the system, 48% of water is lost through leaks. Sources are already running dry: the Nejapa aquifer provides 40% of the water used by the overcrowded capital, but the water level has shrunk by 20% in the past five years alone. Meanwhile, a lush forest, known as the lungs of Nejapa, is being chopped down to make way for gated housing developments with private underground wells. Nejapa\u2019s biggest industrial water guzzlers and alleged polluters \u2013 the local Coca-Cola bottling company and sugar cane plantations \u2013 have been unaffected by rationing. In the fields behind the Coca-Cola factory, murky, foul-smelling water can be seen pumping into a stream. AB InBev, the world\u2019s largest brewer which controls the bottling company, did not respond to specific questions about the pollution, but said it was committed to sustainability and conservation. At least 90% of El Salvador\u2019s surface water is contaminated by untreated sewage, agricultural and industrial waste, according to studies by Marn. \u201cThere are no clear rules, no sanctions, no monitoring, and big business uses these legal vacuums to exploit water as a product for profit. It\u2019s the poorest who suffer most,\u201d said De Larios. The suffering is stark in nearby Joya Galana, a campesino canton of 53 families with a bird\u2019s-eye view \u2013 and smell \u2013 of the country\u2019s biggest open rubbish dump, which has polluted every river and underground water source for several miles. Joya\u2019s water supply is piped in from another community, but was recently cut off for three months after thousands of dollars were stolen from a maintenance fund and a waterhole fund dried up. The supply is back for now, but the situation is precarious. \u201cToday we have water, tomorrow who knows?\u201d said Sonia Guardado, 40, who, like many others, is considering leaving the country. \u201cOur water supply isn\u2019t secure. We need solution, or else we\u2019ll have to leave.\u201d Amid the escalating water crisis, a network of grassroots groups, environmentalists and the Catholic church convinced lawmakers to make history in 2017 by banning metal mining \u2013 a major cause of pollution. But politicians have so far refused to create an independent regulatory system, which campaigners argue would put human consumption and sustainability above corporate interests. Andres McKinley, a water and mining scholar from the Central American University (UCA), said: \u201cThis is a huge political issue; we must change who controls water. That\u2019s the war we\u2019re in.\u201d La Estaci\u00f3n was built on disused state land in 2015 by families unable to afford anything else. Four years later, it\u2019s still battling for running water, a sewage system and land titles (the community is technically illegal). It\u2019s a constant grind to get water \u2013 and to get rid of it \u2013 and both challenges fuel health problems and tensions between neighbours. At 2pm, thunder rolls and rain crashes down on the metal sheet roofs. Some neighbours rush outside to uncover tall barrels to collect the precious drops, but the rain also floods shallow ditches along the unpaved roads. As the storm subsides, clouds of mosquitoes appear above the dirty puddles. Last year, health inspectors blamed the community\u2019s contraband water supplies and makeshift drainage system for a spike in mosquito-borne dengue and chikungunya. Neighbours in adjacent communities with running water stopped selling it to La Estaci\u00f3n under threat of fines; others put up barbed wire fences to stop them laying hoses. So the inhabitants of La Estaci\u00f3n have had to be creative. Health and water officials clock off at 4pm. At about 4.01, Esmeralda Cerritos, 29 , a local union activist, unspools a long hose and attaches it to a tap in a the house of a neighbour who charges her $2 a month. She dangles the other end of the hose into the pila, a deep trough next to the cement sink in the yard, and gathers dozens of containers and bottles, each specifically identified in the precise lexicon of water storage: balde, pinchanga, barril, tambor, c\u00e1ntaro, juacal, pinchel and garrof\u00f3n. It takes three hours to fill the receptacles, which will last the family three or four days. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to get running water for four years, but there\u2019s always another hurdle,\u201d she said. A community meeting is held to discuss the latest challenge: the health ministry will only authorize running water for households with septic toilets, which cost about $500. This either means the poorest neighbours will be left without water, or the entire community will be forced to wait another a year until a sewage plant is built. The community votes to wait, in order to avoid further divisions: in 2015, a mayoral candidate promised people running water in exchange for $250 and their votes. Fifteen households agreed: they have water (though no legal permits), and they refuse to share with neighbours. Cerritos spoke out against the deal, but received death threats. With gang members on either side of the division, Cerritos backed off. \u201cThe cycle of violence begins when the state abandons communities by not providing fundamental human rights like water, education, health and jobs \u2013 which end up being the fertile ground in which gangs and violence grows,\u201d said Jeanne Rikkers, a violence prevention expert with the NGO Cristosal. \u201cBut the fix is only ever about the violence, never the root causes.

But the relationship dwindled and the university hasn\u2019t had anything to do with Barton Hill since the 1970s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/may/01/universities-told-to-be-more-flexible-about-pupils-a-level-results\">Universities told to be more flexible about pupils\u2019 A-level results</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That is all about to change.

Upstairs will be tiny bedsits for people who want to study but need a place with a stable low rent, or time away from complicated situations at home, to make that possible.</p> <p>Holmes says people in her community aren\u2019t short of aspirations. \u201cA lot of our families have two adults working three jobs between them; working all hours of the day and night. They get basic qualifications and then drop out of the system because there is nothing that fits their lives. It makes it hard to break out,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cWe are saying to local mums, \u2018Don\u2019t just do as many cleaning jobs as you can so your kids can go to university.

He is working on a business case for a new flexible degree for local people. The plan is that you could take a short course in one of the Barton Hill shipping containers \u2013 or in the local library in Hartcliffe \u2013 and get 30 credits that count towards a degree.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"598e339de4bd2cf0f7900d2deac274e538cb7920\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/598e339de4bd2cf0f7900d2deac274e538cb7920/0_287_4943_2966/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wills memorial building Bristol University\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bristol\u2019s Clifton campus is in an area where every school leaver goes on to university.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf you do that in your local library and find it\u2019s achievable and not all that scary, it maybe seems less scary to think about going to the main campus,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Bristol has already experimented with access courses, which are not common in Russell Group universities.

The course is publicised widely in local media and the university runs taster courses with community organisations, including Bristol Refugee Rights and the Single Parent Action Network.</p> <p>Myla Lloyd was part of the first year of this foundation course in 2013 and now works for a local MP. \u201cI got good results in my GCSEs, but my Dad passed away and that started a trajectory where everything was knocked off course for me,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She left home at 17 with no A-levels and worked mainly in coffee shops until she started the foundation course at 21, going on to gain a first-class degree in history of art at the university and says the foundation course changed her life.</p> <p>Lloyd hopes Bristol\u2019s new project will open up the university to local people who have found themselves shut out from education. \u201cThe university is this big fancy building and it must seem very far removed if you live on an estate in Hartcliffe,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople often can\u2019t even afford a bus ticket to get into the centre.

Joanna Holmes, CEO of the Barton Hill Settlement, a community centre offering services from legal advice to bringing people together for barbecues, says that over in Clifton the university is unreachable in more ways than one. \u201cIt is symbolically posh,\u201d she says. \u201cThis new campus feels like the university coming down the hill to the rest of us.\u201d Holmes\u2019s settlement was actually set up by the university in 1911. The idea then was that Bristol staff and students would live there and spread enlightenment: it was a radically liberal community, supporting campaigns such as votes for women and feeding the families of local workers when they went on strike. But the relationship dwindled and the university hasn\u2019t had anything to do with Barton Hill since the 1970s. That is all about to change. In addition to the new campus, due to open in 2022, the university is planning a \u201cmicro-campus\u201d in brightly painted shipping containers within the Barton Hill settlement for people who still find the whole idea of university a step too far. It will have three containers in which to teach its students. Upstairs will be tiny bedsits for people who want to study but need a place with a stable low rent, or time away from complicated situations at home, to make that possible. Holmes says people in her community aren\u2019t short of aspirations. \u201cA lot of our families have two adults working three jobs between them; working all hours of the day and night. They get basic qualifications and then drop out of the system because there is nothing that fits their lives. It makes it hard to break out,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are saying to local mums, \u2018Don\u2019t just do as many cleaning jobs as you can so your kids can go to university. You can go too.\u2019\u201d Tom Sperlinger, professor of literature and engaged pedagogy at Bristol, has been tasked with finding ways of pulling people from deprived communities such as Barton Hill and Hartcliffe into the new Temple Quarter campus. He is working on a business case for a new flexible degree for local people. The plan is that you could take a short course in one of the Barton Hill shipping containers \u2013 or in the local library in Hartcliffe \u2013 and get 30 credits that count towards a degree. \u201cIf you do that in your local library and find it\u2019s achievable and not all that scary, it maybe seems less scary to think about going to the main campus,\u201d he says. Bristol has already experimented with access courses, which are not common in Russell Group universities. Ninety per cent of students on its year-long foundation programme in the arts and humanities don\u2019t have A-levels \u2013 and the university says three-quarters of them go on to study a degree at Bristol or elsewhere. The course is publicised widely in local media and the university runs taster courses with community organisations, including Bristol Refugee Rights and the Single Parent Action Network. Myla Lloyd was part of the first year of this foundation course in 2013 and now works for a local MP. \u201cI got good results in my GCSEs, but my Dad passed away and that started a trajectory where everything was knocked off course for me,\u201d she says. She left home at 17 with no A-levels and worked mainly in coffee shops until she started the foundation course at 21, going on to gain a first-class degree in history of art at the university and says the foundation course changed her life. Lloyd hopes Bristol\u2019s new project will open up the university to local people who have found themselves shut out from education. \u201cThe university is this big fancy building and it must seem very far removed if you live on an estate in Hartcliffe,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople often can\u2019t even afford a bus ticket to get into the centre. And if you haven\u2019t ever been to a youth centre, let alone a museum, why would it occur to you to go to university?\u201d",

Despite now claiming the referendum delivered a mandate for a hard Brexit, Dominic Raab is among those who campaigned on the basis that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/29/what-vote-leave-leaders-really-said-about-no-deal-brexit\">deal with the EU was a certainty</a> but is now making rather different noises.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Terror plotter will stay nameless \u2013 </strong>The identity of Britain\u2019s youngest terrorist, who plotted to murder police officers in Australia, will remain a secret for the rest of his life following a high court ruling. The teenager from Blackburn, Lancashire, can be identified only as RXG. When he was 14 he instructed an Australian jihadist to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/29/britains-youngest-terrorists-identity-to-remain-secret\">launch attacks during a 2015 Anzac Day parade in Melbourne</a>. Now 18, he was jailed for life at Manchester crown court in October 2015 after he admitted inciting terrorism overseas. A ban on identifying him would normally expire upon his 18th birthday but Dame Victoria Sharp granted him lifelong anonymity in a ruling delivered on Monday.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Trump\u2019s race problem \u2013 </strong>Donald Trump is facing fresh accusations of racism after a tirade against Elijah Cummings, a prominent minority Democratic congressman, and referring to his majority black electoral district of Baltimore as a \u201crodent-infested mess\u201d. The Baptist minister and activist Rev Al Sharpton has accused Trump of attacking the city in \u201cthe most bigoted and racist way\u201d, adding that the president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/29/donald-trump-baltimore-racist-attack-backlash-response-latest\">\u201chas a particular venom for blacks and people of colour\u201d</a>.

Marian Fitzgerald, criminologist and former Home Office official, says the new recruits will need mentoring and supervision, placing greater demand on experienced officers. \u201cThe promise is calculated to appeal to the public. Yet if [Johnson] keeps it, with no commitment to fund other aspects of policing, the public will be paying a lot more for little observable improvement.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c179610387127617bc62bc146390018c5f574c90\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c179610387127617bc62bc146390018c5f574c90/0_418_5047_3030/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Composite image showing Boris Johnson in a bobby's helmet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson on the beat.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Jamie Grierson writes that with violent crime up and and the proportion of cases solved falling, the Tories\u2019 claim to be the party of law and order is under threat. The government\u2019s serious violent crime strategy states there are clear links to \u201cpoor life outcomes\u201d \u2013 and alongside policing budgets, funding is being cut for early intervention services that deal with these issues. So <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/30/boris-johnson-promises-will-police-hiring-spree-make-streets-safer\">can rising violent crime be tackled through increased policing alone</a>?</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Environment defenders under siege \u2013 </strong>The Philippines under President Rodrigo Duterte has replaced Brazil as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/30/philippines-deadliest-country-defenders-environment-global-witness\">most murderous country in the world for people defending their land and environment</a>. Global Witness says 164 defenders were killed across the world in 2018 for standing up to miners, loggers, farmers, poachers and other industries. In the Philippines, 30 were killed in 2018, with half of the deaths related to agribusiness. Globally, mining was the sector responsible for the most killings \u2013 43. But the sharpest rise was in murders of people trying to protect water sources, which increased from four to 17.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Wake-up call on CBT \u2013 </strong>Cognitive behavioural therapy is an effective way to tackle chronic insomnia and should be used more widely, researchers say. Sleeplessness is thought to badly affect about 10-15% of adults, and is linked to depression, difficulties in functioning and accidents. CBT techniques include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/30/insomnia-sufferers-can-benefit-from-therapy-new-study-shows\">staying away from the bed when awake and restricting the number of hours spent in bed</a>. A review of four controlled trials found participants fell asleep nine to 30 minutes sooner after completing a CBT course for insomnia, and lay awake at night for between 22 and 36 minutes less.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Note to Corbyn \u2013 \u2018You need to step up now\u2019 Good morning \u2013 I\u2019m Warren Murray, let\u2019s get your day started. Alastair Campbell, who was Tony Blair\u2019s director of communications, has declared he no longer wishes to be a Labour member. Campbell was expelled from the party after revealing he voted Lib Dem in the European elections. The \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d campaigner now says, in a letter to Jeremy Corbyn, that he intends to leave regardless of the outcome of his appeal against suspension: \u201cI see no strategy in place that remotely meets the electoral or policy challenges ahead \u2026 To have any chance of stopping [Boris] Johnson and stopping a hard Brexit, you need to step up now, and signal leadership of the anti-Brexit, anti-populist cause, though it may be that loss of trust in your approach to Brexit means it is too late to win back many former supporters.\u201d The Economist\u2019s Anne McElvoy, who has been touring Europe for a BBC Radio 4 documentary, writes for the Guardian today that \u201cthe timeline and the \u2018Boris factor\u2019 are changing the calculation on the continent\u201d around how to handle the threat of no deal. \u201cNow there\u2019s a growing realisation that parliament may not reject this option, and that Brussels will have to face up to the prospect.\u201d As the country heads towards the 31 October deadline, the Guardian has analysed the previous stated positions of some of the key players in the Vote Leave camp. Despite now claiming the referendum delivered a mandate for a hard Brexit, Dominic Raab is among those who campaigned on the basis that a deal with the EU was a certainty but is now making rather different noises. * * * Terror plotter will stay nameless \u2013 The identity of Britain\u2019s youngest terrorist, who plotted to murder police officers in Australia, will remain a secret for the rest of his life following a high court ruling. The teenager from Blackburn, Lancashire, can be identified only as RXG. When he was 14 he instructed an Australian jihadist to launch attacks during a 2015 Anzac Day parade in Melbourne. Now 18, he was jailed for life at Manchester crown court in October 2015 after he admitted inciting terrorism overseas. A ban on identifying him would normally expire upon his 18th birthday but Dame Victoria Sharp granted him lifelong anonymity in a ruling delivered on Monday. * * * Trump\u2019s race problem \u2013 Donald Trump is facing fresh accusations of racism after a tirade against Elijah Cummings, a prominent minority Democratic congressman, and referring to his majority black electoral district of Baltimore as a \u201crodent-infested mess\u201d. The Baptist minister and activist Rev Al Sharpton has accused Trump of attacking the city in \u201cthe most bigoted and racist way\u201d, adding that the president \u201chas a particular venom for blacks and people of colour\u201d. From Barack Obama to \u201cthe Squad\u201d and others, Sabrina Siddiqui, one of our reporting team in Washington, lists some of the prominent political leaders of colour whom Trump has singled out for attack in highly personalised ways. * * * Is police surge the answer? \u2013 Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for 20,000 new police could prove a recipe for disaster rather than addressing Britain\u2019s violent crime wave, an expert says. Marian Fitzgerald, criminologist and former Home Office official, says the new recruits will need mentoring and supervision, placing greater demand on experienced officers. \u201cThe promise is calculated to appeal to the public. Yet if [Johnson] keeps it, with no commitment to fund other aspects of policing, the public will be paying a lot more for little observable improvement.\u201d Jamie Grierson writes that with violent crime up and and the proportion of cases solved falling, the Tories\u2019 claim to be the party of law and order is under threat. The government\u2019s serious violent crime strategy states there are clear links to \u201cpoor life outcomes\u201d \u2013 and alongside policing budgets, funding is being cut for early intervention services that deal with these issues. So can rising violent crime be tackled through increased policing alone? * * * Environment defenders under siege \u2013 The Philippines under President Rodrigo Duterte has replaced Brazil as the most murderous country in the world for people defending their land and environment. Global Witness says 164 defenders were killed across the world in 2018 for standing up to miners, loggers, farmers, poachers and other industries. In the Philippines, 30 were killed in 2018, with half of the deaths related to agribusiness. Globally, mining was the sector responsible for the most killings \u2013 43. But the sharpest rise was in murders of people trying to protect water sources, which increased from four to 17. * * * Wake-up call on CBT \u2013 Cognitive behavioural therapy is an effective way to tackle chronic insomnia and should be used more widely, researchers say. Sleeplessness is thought to badly affect about 10-15% of adults, and is linked to depression, difficulties in functioning and accidents. CBT techniques include staying away from the bed when awake and restricting the number of hours spent in bed. A review of four controlled trials found participants fell asleep nine to 30 minutes sooner after completing a CBT course for insomnia, and lay awake at night for between 22 and 36 minutes less. Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, says it supports the idea that CBT for insomnia should be offered through GPs. She called on the NHS to honour pledges for more mental health therapists and more psychologists trained to deliver CBT. Today in Focus podcast: Carl Beech and the VIP paedophile ring In 2014 Carl Beech claimed he had been a victim of child sexual abuse by high-profile politicians. His allegations snowballed into a multimillion-pound police investigation, but, rather than exposing a paedophile ring, Beech ended up jailed for perverting the course of justice. Simon Murphy discusses the story. And: Shaun Walker on the possible poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.

More than a dozen MPs, including the health minister, Brad Hazzard, are co-sponsoring the bill, which has the support of the premier, Gladys Berejiklian. But despite that conservative figures have attempted to mount an insurgent campaign against the bill. On Tuesday the Catholic archbishop of Sydney, Anthony Fisher, revealed he had written to the premier, together with the heads of the Anglican and Greek Orthodox churches, calling on her to delay the bill. He said in a statement he had urged local priests and parishoners to contact local MPs to campaign against the bill, claiming it would \u201crequire Catholic (and other) doctors and hospitals to collaborate by either taking part in the abortion or referring patients to someone who will. It is yet another attack upon the rights of people of faith. \u201cIt is the dream bill of the abortion industry, which they have already pressed upon several other states; but it will leave unborn children and unsupported pregnant women even more at risk,\u201d he said. The private member\u2019s bill is based on laws in Queensland and Victoria and has the backing of the NSW branch of the Australian Medical Association and Pro-Choice Alliance. Under the proposed legislation a woman would not commit an offence if she procures a termination within the bill\u2019s framework. It would also repeal provisions of the Crimes Act relating to abortions and common law offences. The bill would allow for terminations up to 22 weeks \u2013 and later if two doctors believe it should be performed given the medical, physical, social and psychological circumstances. It would also create a new criminal offence under the Crimes Act for anyone who assists in terminations without authorisation.",

      "bodyText": "We are sailing on eerily calm blue-grey seas a few miles off the north Norfolk coast. There is no sand visible but the hidden banks below us are written in the surrounding water in the form of ripples, white lines of surf and patches of smooth water. These treacherous shallows possess romantic names on the sea charts \u2013 Pandora Sand, Thief Sand, Stubborn Sand \u2013 but sailors\u2019 lives depend on avoiding them. Patrick Barkham aboard the Salford, a restored whelk boat The captain of Salford, our beautifully restored whelk boat, is trying to do the opposite, however: he\u2019s trying to run aground on one. Our depth gauge drops from 6.9m to 1.4m. We stop and wait for the tide to beach us. Will we soon discover pristine golden sand? Picnicking and playing cricket on sandbanks at low tide was regarded as a grand day out by hail-and-hearty Victorians but messing around on shifting sands is not favoured in our risk-averse era. When a BBC film crew staged a cricket match on the notorious Goodwin Sands in the Channel a few years back, the in-rushing tide turned their boat over, requiring a lifeboat rescue. Skipper Dom takes the Salford out of harbour. Author Patrick Barkham is on the left, seated So, the decision by the Coastal Exploration Company, a band of capable mariners who take visitors to less-well-known spots on the north Norfolk coast in vintage sailing boats, to restart holidaymaking on sandbanks looks a little reckless. But I had to give it a go. Dom, the skipper, steers our 30ft boat through Wells-next-the-Sea\u2019s pretty harbour in the morning sunshine. Our plan: breakfast on the boat, while we sail west to reach the Wash at low tide and \u201cfind a nice little sandbank to dry out on,\u201d as Dom puts it \u2013 for lunch and cricket. \u201cAny kind of waves would pick the boat up and slam it onto the sand but these conditions are nice and calm,\u201d he says. Top left, Patrick Barkham (left) listens as skipper Dom (second right) explains their route; chef Charlie Hodson is second left; details and view from onboard the Salford Wells\u2019 straggly line of colourful beach huts framed by white sand and dark pines slowly diminish as we head into the North Sea. The calm sea may be safe for us but it\u2019s terrible for sailing. Luckily, Salford has a new engine that purrs as we potter along the coast at 4 knots. Beach huts on the shore at Wells-next-the-Sea The seas here are shallow and studded with sandbanks, many of which now house offshore wind farms. It was once Doggerland and even today it sometimes looks like you can walk across the Wash from Norfolk to Lincolnshire at low tide. I\u2019m astonished to learn that this great expanse of low water also contains a section called The Well, which is 47 metres deep. \u201cEverything about the water is dangerous,\u201d warns Charlie Hodson, our expedition chef and former lifeboat man, which could come in handy. \u201cIt\u2019s about how you respect that water in return.\u201d Chef Charlie Hodson prepares breakfast Charlie gives this warning as we pass the black silhouette of a ship wrecked on the sands beyond Scolt Head Island. This vessel was deliberately scuppered and filled with explosives to stop German invaders entering Brancaster harbour but we pass two more authentic wrecks visible on the vast sandy shores of north Norfolk. The charts and instruments that help the Salford\u2019s crew Despite the depth gauge reading 1.4m, the sandbank above which we first float doesn\u2019t appear even as low tide nears. So we sail further along this wild, tranquil coast of sand dunes, windmills and flint church towers and around Gore Point. Ahead shimmies a line of gold: Sunk Sand, rising around two metres out of the water on the lowest of tides. Cormorants stand on the bank, drying their wings like enormous bats; on the far side lounge the banana shapes of a dozen grey seals. Slowly, cautiously, we head towards Sunk Sand. Just beyond 1.5m, we run aground. The water around us is still chest-deep, so we blow up an inflatable dinghy to carry our lunch. I jump in and swim \u201cashore\u201d, which is not as glamorous as it sounds \u2013 it\u2019s easier to wade in the shallow water. Preparing the dinghy, and then taking supplies and utensils to the sandbank We step onto our own utterly otherworldly, (extremely) temporary island. We can see Hunstanton in the distance to the south and Skegness to the far north but there is nothing else, and no one else, for miles around. The sand is smooth, wet, and scattered with giant starfish and dozens of sea urchins. Patrick Barkham and the Salford\u2019s crew arrive on the sandbank for their lunch \u2013 and, later, a game of cricket Abruptly, the sun vanishes and a murk creeps in. Charlie hurriedly lights his stove, showing us how to fillet the seabass in the shallows. As he rustles up lunch we notice his pop-up kitchen is getting closer to the water. The tide is coming in already. Our sandbank island is shrinking. Chef Charlie Hodson shows how to fillet seabass and cooks lunch and, bottom left, Patrick helps Charlie move their \u2018kitchen\u2019 location We move the kitchen 50 yards from the sea. It only gives us 10 minutes. The tide seeps over the sand and Charlie blowtorches the locally caught seabass for his take on \u201cfish and peas and ham with a Masala flavour\u201d. It\u2019s delicious, and there is just enough time for a quick game of cricket. Salford is afloat again, and suddenly looking a long way away. Storm clouds build in the Wash\u2019s huge skies. Cricket on the sandbank, and Patrick fuelling up with Charlie Hodson\u2019s food We swim-wade hurriedly back to the boat, and head home. The sea has turned choppy, the breeze gets up, and we fly past Scolt Head Island as sandwich terns dive into the water and emerge, in a twinkle, gobbling silver fish. Rain arrives just as we enter the sanctuary of Wells harbour, sailing smoothly up the channel on a rising tide. This surreal day does not feel dangerous in such capable hands. Instead, the grand peaceful arena of this coast is profoundly soothing. And the wilderness of its salt marshes is nothing compared to the wilderness out there, among the sandbanks and cormorants, a strange liminal landscape where sand meets sea and the tide is the master of all. \u2022 The Coastal Exploration Company offers bespoke sailing adventures on the north Norfolk coast.

About 15 years before the avenue was laid out in 1667 in Paris, India\u2019s Mughal emperor Shah Jehan built a grand mile-long street in his capital to reflect the glory of the empire at its height.</p> <p>It ran from Fatehpuri mosque at one end to the colossal Red Fort at the other and was lined with trees, elegant mansions, mosques and gardens. Provisions for the Red Fort, the imperial residence, were carried down the boulevard by elephants, camels and horse-drawn carriages.</p> <p>In the centre ran the clear waters of a canal, reflecting the moonlight, or <em>chandni</em> \u2013 giving the street its name, Chandni Chowk (<em>chowk</em> means open market space).

The area known as the Walled City, or Old Delhi, is probably the most congested place in India.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We need a total facelift to create order and cleanliness out of this chaos</p> <footer> <cite>Santosh Verma, shopkeeper</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a cool, tranquil studio in Aya Nagar, far away from the chaos, an architect is working to restore the Mughal splendour of Chandni Chowk. Pradeep Sachdeva\u2019s firm, commissioned by the Delhi government, began work in December. The area has already been dug up and work is under way in an effort to meet the January 2020 completion date.</p> <p>On his computer screen is an image of how it will look. The most striking feature is the absence of cars. His design shows a calm street lined with trees, benches and lights, with wide pavements on either side of a green central lane. The electrical and telecom cables and water lines are buried underground.</p> <p>Since this is one of the busiest market areas in India (the Khari Baoli spice market by Fatehpuri mosque is Asia\u2019s oldest), vehicles have to be allowed in to unload goods \u2013 but this will be restricted to the early hours of the morning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"789aac24890023c5c3195c5fa7598dec597df88b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/789aac24890023c5c3195c5fa7598dec597df88b/0_137_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chandni Chowk in the 1860s, photographed by Samuel Bourne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chandni Chowk in the 1860s, photographed by Samuel Bourne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: V&amp;A Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is one of the most important street designs in the world because few streets are this old and few embody so much urban complexity,\u201d says Sachdeva. \u201cIt represents all that is complex about urban India and if we get the transformation right it will become an example for hundreds of such precincts across the country.\u201d</p> <p>He says western designs don\u2019t work in India because they lack the cycle rickshaws, the street hawkers and the high density of people.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We know from our other projects that we can\u2019t look after bodies of water in India.

They get full of waste. So we have symbolised the canal by placing water-like patterns in the central median.\u201d</p> <p>Another tricky decision was where to place public toilets and police kiosks. He settled on placing them in the central strip, rather than on the footpaths where they would have been an obstruction.</p> <p>Sachdeva is acutely aware of how important the redevelopment of Chandi Chowk is for the residents of Old Delhi, the historic old quarter where the majority of residents are Muslim. For decades, they have felt neglected by the authorities who seemed to care more for other areas of the capital over the of part which, ironically, boasts all the heritage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef3f1f3d4e2366e77986bfc31714ffdf6ede3074\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef3f1f3d4e2366e77986bfc31714ffdf6ede3074/0_0_4700_3919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A haveli, or townhouse. on Chandni Chowk in 1858.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"834\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A <em>haveli</em>, or townhouse. on Chandni Chowk in 1858.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felice Beato/Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over the years, affluent Hindu families fed up with the congestion and pollution vacated their <em>havelis</em> \u2013 mansions featuring a courtyard, fluted columns and doors high enough for elephants to enter \u2013 and moved to modern houses in south Delhi.</p> <p>Many Muslim residents, emotionally attached to the Walled City and its Mughal heritage, stayed on. The Walled City was, after all, the capital of the Mughals until the last emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was deposed and exiled by the British in 1858. In 1911, the British transferred the capital from Kolkata to Delhi and built a new city \u2013 New Delhi \u2013 on the south side of Old Delhi.</p> <p>Old Delhi lost its status, but residents still derive pride from its historical importance and the fact that Chandi Chowk was once one of the most beautiful streets in the world.

      "bodyText": "The Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es is one of the most famous streets in the world, but you could say the French were beaten to it by the Mughals. About 15 years before the avenue was laid out in 1667 in Paris, India\u2019s Mughal emperor Shah Jehan built a grand mile-long street in his capital to reflect the glory of the empire at its height. It ran from Fatehpuri mosque at one end to the colossal Red Fort at the other and was lined with trees, elegant mansions, mosques and gardens. Provisions for the Red Fort, the imperial residence, were carried down the boulevard by elephants, camels and horse-drawn carriages. In the centre ran the clear waters of a canal, reflecting the moonlight, or chandni \u2013 giving the street its name, Chandni Chowk (chowk means open market space). On hot summer evenings, the Bishti, a tribe of water carriers, would sprinkle water from their goat-hide canteens to cool the street. But while the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es has retained its grandeur, Chandi Chowk and the area around it have degenerated into a mess of heaving crowds, dense traffic, decrepit buildings, pavements taken over by hawkers, tangled overhead electrical wires and general mayhem. The area known as the Walled City, or Old Delhi, is probably the most congested place in India. In a cool, tranquil studio in Aya Nagar, far away from the chaos, an architect is working to restore the Mughal splendour of Chandni Chowk. Pradeep Sachdeva\u2019s firm, commissioned by the Delhi government, began work in December. The area has already been dug up and work is under way in an effort to meet the January 2020 completion date. On his computer screen is an image of how it will look. The most striking feature is the absence of cars. His design shows a calm street lined with trees, benches and lights, with wide pavements on either side of a green central lane. The electrical and telecom cables and water lines are buried underground. Since this is one of the busiest market areas in India (the Khari Baoli spice market by Fatehpuri mosque is Asia\u2019s oldest), vehicles have to be allowed in to unload goods \u2013 but this will be restricted to the early hours of the morning. \u201cThis is one of the most important street designs in the world because few streets are this old and few embody so much urban complexity,\u201d says Sachdeva. \u201cIt represents all that is complex about urban India and if we get the transformation right it will become an example for hundreds of such precincts across the country.\u201d He says western designs don\u2019t work in India because they lack the cycle rickshaws, the street hawkers and the high density of people. One of the first decisions he made was to not recreate the canal. \u201cWe know from our other projects that we can\u2019t look after bodies of water in India. They get full of waste. So we have symbolised the canal by placing water-like patterns in the central median.\u201d Another tricky decision was where to place public toilets and police kiosks. He settled on placing them in the central strip, rather than on the footpaths where they would have been an obstruction. Sachdeva is acutely aware of how important the redevelopment of Chandi Chowk is for the residents of Old Delhi, the historic old quarter where the majority of residents are Muslim. For decades, they have felt neglected by the authorities who seemed to care more for other areas of the capital over the of part which, ironically, boasts all the heritage. Over the years, affluent Hindu families fed up with the congestion and pollution vacated their havelis \u2013 mansions featuring a courtyard, fluted columns and doors high enough for elephants to enter \u2013 and moved to modern houses in south Delhi. Many Muslim residents, emotionally attached to the Walled City and its Mughal heritage, stayed on. The Walled City was, after all, the capital of the Mughals until the last emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was deposed and exiled by the British in 1858. In 1911, the British transferred the capital from Kolkata to Delhi and built a new city \u2013 New Delhi \u2013 on the south side of Old Delhi. Old Delhi lost its status, but residents still derive pride from its historical importance and the fact that Chandi Chowk was once one of the most beautiful streets in the world. Most living here want it preserved as a beautiful historic quarter where visitors can walk without fear of being run over and where residents can enjoy a good quality of life. \u201cIt\u2019s about restoring the original beauty of Old Delhi but it\u2019s also about being good for business,\u201d says Santosh Verma, the owner of a stationery shop. \u201cWe need a total facelift to create order and cleanliness out of this chaos.\u201d The revamp of the entire area has been discussed for more than 15 years but no government has had the will to push it through. Sachdeva believes the Chandni Chowk project will kickstart the transformation of the whole Old Delhi area, but he has run into his own problems. A group of conservationists and architects have filed petitions in the Delhi high court objecting to one major feature of Sachdeva\u2019s design: the placing of utilities in the central median. They claim this will act as a \u201cwall\u201d between the two sides of the street and destroy the area\u2019s visual integrity. \u201cIn redeveloping an area you must respect its heritage, but the spirit of this processional avenue is being destroyed with this design,\u201d says AG Krishna Menon, an architect and urban planner. \u201cYou can\u2019t put electrical transformers and public toilets in the middle.

And, as a linguistic signal of wokeness, it can also easily be co-opted.</p> <p>For instance, as Otamere Guobadia recently observed in <a href=\"https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/45297/1/sexuality-fluidity-in-pop-culture-pansexuality-and-personal-journeys\">Dazed</a>, the sexuality spectrum\u2019s \u201chaziness and flexibility\u201d connects to pop stars like Ariana Grande and Harry Styles being able to claim vaguely queer identities<strong> </strong>to court LGBTQ+ fans in an exploitative move known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/jun/29/why-cultures-queerbaiting-leaves-me-cold-amelia-abraham\">queerbaiting</a>.</p> <p>Conceptualizing gender and sexuality on a spectrum does allow for more diversity than binary thinking. Yet just as not everybody fits into one category, such as male or female, straight or gay, not everybody relates to the idea of falling on a spectrum between such points, either. Individuals who identify as non-binary are drawn to a more fluid sense of identity, one that defies the idea of a spectrum. (If that sounds a little flakey, consider the words of Walt Whitman: \u201cI contradict myself, I am large, I contain multitudes.\u201d Or: people change.)</p> <p>\u201cEven the idea of the spectrum may be too narrow,\u201d says the lexicographer Kory Stamper. Because \u201ca spectrum falls between two points\u201d, it implies a regimented, linear order against which characteristics are judged, which may exclude more radical or amorphous thought. \u201cIf you\u2019re used to a binary, it doesn\u2019t matter how you cut up the space in between, you still think in binary terms,\u201d says Stamper.</p> <p>For the medical community, \u201cspectrum\u201d is less about semantics and more about clinical specificity \u2013 the term has led to improved understanding of the variances within diagnoses of mental health disorders such as anxiety, ADHD, and most notably autism.</p> <p>Yet although \u201cthere has been great value in better understanding patients who are in the higher-functioning end of the autism spectrum\u201d, according to Dr Jeffery Baker, director of the Trent Center for Bioethics, Humanities &amp; History of Medicine at Duke University, \u201cspectrum\u201d language still has some adverse side effects.</p> <p>The relatively recent shift in understanding autism as a spectrum disorder has \u201ccontributed to the perception that there\u2019s an autism epidemic\u201d, says Baker. \u201cAnd that perception has had some negative effects, such as helping drive controversy about vaccines,\u201d and putting pressure on limited resources.<br><br>Despite their limitations, spectrums can encourage greater flexibility in our understanding of the world. And while they\u2019re not the be-all and end-all of progressive thought, their increased use may \u2013 more or less \u2013 reflect a growing sophistication of our conceptual discourse.

For instance, as Otamere Guobadia recently observed in Dazed, the sexuality spectrum\u2019s \u201chaziness and flexibility\u201d connects to pop stars like Ariana Grande and Harry Styles being able to claim vaguely queer identities to court LGBTQ+ fans in an exploitative move known as queerbaiting. Conceptualizing gender and sexuality on a spectrum does allow for more diversity than binary thinking. Yet just as not everybody fits into one category, such as male or female, straight or gay, not everybody relates to the idea of falling on a spectrum between such points, either. Individuals who identify as non-binary are drawn to a more fluid sense of identity, one that defies the idea of a spectrum. (If that sounds a little flakey, consider the words of Walt Whitman: \u201cI contradict myself, I am large, I contain multitudes.\u201d Or: people change.) \u201cEven the idea of the spectrum may be too narrow,\u201d says the lexicographer Kory Stamper. Because \u201ca spectrum falls between two points\u201d, it implies a regimented, linear order against which characteristics are judged, which may exclude more radical or amorphous thought. \u201cIf you\u2019re used to a binary, it doesn\u2019t matter how you cut up the space in between, you still think in binary terms,\u201d says Stamper. For the medical community, \u201cspectrum\u201d is less about semantics and more about clinical specificity \u2013 the term has led to improved understanding of the variances within diagnoses of mental health disorders such as anxiety, ADHD, and most notably autism. Yet although \u201cthere has been great value in better understanding patients who are in the higher-functioning end of the autism spectrum\u201d, according to Dr Jeffery Baker, director of the Trent Center for Bioethics, Humanities &amp; History of Medicine at Duke University, \u201cspectrum\u201d language still has some adverse side effects. The relatively recent shift in understanding autism as a spectrum disorder has \u201ccontributed to the perception that there\u2019s an autism epidemic\u201d, says Baker. \u201cAnd that perception has had some negative effects, such as helping drive controversy about vaccines,\u201d and putting pressure on limited resources. Despite their limitations, spectrums can encourage greater flexibility in our understanding of the world. And while they\u2019re not the be-all and end-all of progressive thought, their increased use may \u2013 more or less \u2013 reflect a growing sophistication of our conceptual discourse. Spectrums can be useful, but they\u2019re not the only way to see the light.",

      "bodyText": "Much has been written about the boom in Irish writing, buoyed by the apparently ceaseless tide of new voices: not a smattering of talent making a splash but waves and waves of writers, going beyond much repeated names such as Sally Rooney and Eimear McBride to the equally talented and ambitious Mike McCormack, Sara Baume, Colin Barrett, Anakana Schofield, Gavin Corbett and Lisa McInerney. Now there\u2019s more. Having been an all-American affair in 2018, this year the shortlist for the Sunday Times Audible Short Story Award (the world\u2019s richest short story prize \u2013 \u00a330,000 for a single story!) is dominated by the Irish: Kevin Barry, winner of the award in 2012 and just longlisted for this year\u2019s Booker; Danielle McLaughlin from the Republic and Louise Kennedy from Northern Ireland. Joining them on the shortlist are Joe Dunthorne (Welsh), Paul Dalla Rosa, based in Melbourne, and Emma Cline, the sole representative of the US. The notion of \u201cnew\u201d voices though, while much beloved of publishers and literary journalists, does not tell the whole truth. McCormack, for instance, whose 2016 novel, Solar Bones, won both the Goldsmiths Prize, which celebrates innovation in the form, and the Dublin International Literary Award, is in his 50s. The novel, a ghost story written in a single sentence, is his fifth book and struggled to find a home until it landed on the desks of the brilliant and fearless independent publishers Tramp. \u201cI couldn\u2019t give my work away, to be honest with you,\u201d McCormack told the Guardian in 2017. \u201cNo one wanted to know.\u201d Anna Burns, now 57, whose dystopian exploration of the Troubles, Milkman, won last year\u2019s Booker, famously declared she would have to inform social services that she was no longer in need of benefits. Similarly, it took McBride nine years to find a publisher for the multi-award winning A Girl is a Half-Formed Thing \u2013 and once again, it was a tiny publisher, Galley Beggar Press, based in Norwich, which took the gamble (Galley Beggar, incidentally, is also responsible for one of the most unusual books to have captured the imagination of this year\u2019s Booker panel; Lucy Ellmann\u2019s Ducks, Newburyport runs to over a thousand pages, but takes only eight sentences to do so. Imagine what Jacob Rees-Mogg and his full-stop obsession would make of that). How is this happening? Some credit the financial crash and its particularly harsh impact on an Ireland still bedazzled by the notion of a Celtic Tiger for the creative explosion \u2013 although many writers of the previous generation or two might disagree with such a one-note explanation. And despite changes in setting and subject matter, there is a continuity between writers such as Sebastian Barry, Anne Enright and Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn and those who have come to prominence more recently. But the crash perhaps aligned particularly well with one of the recurrent preoccupations of Irish writers: the way that fracture \u2013 social, economic, personal \u2013 can be built into the language we use. When I moved to Ireland just over a year ago, I wrote of glorying in hearing people talk, and was ticked off online for painting the Irish as charming country-dwellers who greeted me with a \u201cTop of the morning\u201d every day. But it wasn\u2019t that, honestly. It was more that day-to-day conversation seemed to be more vivid and unexpected than I was used to. An electrician arrived in the middle of a kitchen renovation and inspected the chaos. \u201cYou are all asunder,\u201d he said to me, gravely.

Reflect clients receive automated texts after sessions with questions like, \u201cHow well do you feel heard on a scale of one to five?\u201d Their feedback goes directly to their therapists.</p> <p>The companies can cull some trends from the data they collect, like what is bringing people to therapy most often. At Reflect, it\u2019s career stress and relationship issues, said founder Jonathan TranPham. Two Chairs said many clients sought therapy for depression, anxiety, and adjustment disorders as well as substance use disorders and trauma.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"928b226fd229a17b546ee2fecab8a12cb70387ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/928b226fd229a17b546ee2fecab8a12cb70387ab/192_0_988_593/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Reflect app.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Reflect app.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Reflect</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In an age of increasing concern over how companies are managing our data, these startups stand in stark contrast: they cannot sell their users\u2019 data. It is all voluntarily reported by clients and stored on secure platforms. Therapy sessions are confidential, as they would be elsewhere under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (Hipaa).</p> <p>While the startup Kip believes that in-person connection remains key, its private app works to fill in the gaps that can emerge between sessions. The app prompts clients to record what\u2019s on their minds, their moods and any issues they want to talk about.</p> <p>Ashwin Kumar, who saw a Kip therapist for about a year to deal with the stress of founding a company, used the app to track his sleep and fill out \u201cthought journals\u201d whenever he became anxious or started going down a rabbit hole of negative thinking. His therapist could also send him resources and administer clinical assessments to keep tabs on his progress. All of this data would become the starting point for their next session.</p> <p>Kumar described the app as \u201cthe glue between the therapist and the patient\u201d. \u201cIt was like getting therapy in the session itself but also having the benefit of therapy in between,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A software engineer, Kumar did at first have concerns about his data privacy \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m writing some really personal stuff in here,\u201d he thought. \u201cWhat if something happens?\u201d \u2013 but ultimately felt assured by the fact that the app is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as his therapy sessions are.</p> <p>Kip charges $180 a session in San Francisco and $200 in Palo Alto.</p> <h2><strong>Technology\u2019s \u2018false promises\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Anja Schmitz, a licensed clinical psychologist and Kip\u2019s chief clinical officer, said she was \u201cimmediately taken\u201d by the idea of using technology to have a more complete picture of what her clients experience between sessions. She likened the app having \u201ca microphone stuck in their head \u2013 what would I be hearing?\u201d</p> <p>But her enthusiasm for tech\u2019s potential in mental health care has its limits. Without the close involvement of therapists who know the relevant research and best practices, the benefits quickly diminish, she said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There is no replacement for the in-person connection</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere are a lot of false promises out there,\u201d Schmitz said. \u201cHaving people who know what the current state-of-the-art treatments are and responsibly using technology to deliver those treatments is important.\u201d</p> <p>Other therapists expressed reservations about Silicon Valley\u2019s explosion in their field, particularly the shift into digital-only tools whose efficacy has not yet been studied rigorously. The American Psychiatric Association now runs an app evaluation taskforce to more rigorously assess an area whose growth, the organization said, is \u201cunprecedented in the history of medicine\u201d.</p> <p>Research shows that \u201cface-to-face interactions encourage vulnerability, intimacy, and empathy between clients and therapists \u2013 which we know are fundamentally human experiences that technology cannot offer\u201d, Roundfield said. \u201cIn my clinical opinion, there is no replacement for the in-person connection felt between two people in the therapy room, and the potency of that connection facilitates therapeutic change.\u201d</p> <p>The therapists said they believed in the startups\u2019 commitments to keeping in-person therapy at the core of what they do, despite their dual identity as tech companies.</p> <p>All of these startups are quick to champion their results. More than 90% of Two Chairs clients are satisfied with their matches. Reflect has a 95% retention rate after the first session. Kip clients report improvements in depression, anxiety and stress symptoms.</p> <p>But what happens when the matching process fails?</p> <p>They collect more data.</p> <p>Reflect asks people not only why they selected their therapist but why they didn\u2019t choose the other two offered to them. Yet another data point, it\u2019s fed back into the algorithm, TranPham said, in a continuing effort to improve technology\u2019s influence on human-driven therapy.</p>",

The companies can cull some trends from the data they collect, like what is bringing people to therapy most often. At Reflect, it\u2019s career stress and relationship issues, said founder Jonathan TranPham. Two Chairs said many clients sought therapy for depression, anxiety, and adjustment disorders as well as substance use disorders and trauma. In an age of increasing concern over how companies are managing our data, these startups stand in stark contrast: they cannot sell their users\u2019 data. It is all voluntarily reported by clients and stored on secure platforms. Therapy sessions are confidential, as they would be elsewhere under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (Hipaa). While the startup Kip believes that in-person connection remains key, its private app works to fill in the gaps that can emerge between sessions. The app prompts clients to record what\u2019s on their minds, their moods and any issues they want to talk about. Ashwin Kumar, who saw a Kip therapist for about a year to deal with the stress of founding a company, used the app to track his sleep and fill out \u201cthought journals\u201d whenever he became anxious or started going down a rabbit hole of negative thinking. His therapist could also send him resources and administer clinical assessments to keep tabs on his progress. All of this data would become the starting point for their next session. Kumar described the app as \u201cthe glue between the therapist and the patient\u201d. \u201cIt was like getting therapy in the session itself but also having the benefit of therapy in between,\u201d he said. A software engineer, Kumar did at first have concerns about his data privacy \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m writing some really personal stuff in here,\u201d he thought. \u201cWhat if something happens?\u201d \u2013 but ultimately felt assured by the fact that the app is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as his therapy sessions are. Kip charges $180 a session in San Francisco and $200 in Palo Alto. Technology\u2019s \u2018false promises\u2019 Anja Schmitz, a licensed clinical psychologist and Kip\u2019s chief clinical officer, said she was \u201cimmediately taken\u201d by the idea of using technology to have a more complete picture of what her clients experience between sessions. She likened the app having \u201ca microphone stuck in their head \u2013 what would I be hearing?\u201d But her enthusiasm for tech\u2019s potential in mental health care has its limits. Without the close involvement of therapists who know the relevant research and best practices, the benefits quickly diminish, she said. \u201cThere are a lot of false promises out there,\u201d Schmitz said. \u201cHaving people who know what the current state-of-the-art treatments are and responsibly using technology to deliver those treatments is important.\u201d Other therapists expressed reservations about Silicon Valley\u2019s explosion in their field, particularly the shift into digital-only tools whose efficacy has not yet been studied rigorously. The American Psychiatric Association now runs an app evaluation taskforce to more rigorously assess an area whose growth, the organization said, is \u201cunprecedented in the history of medicine\u201d. Research shows that \u201cface-to-face interactions encourage vulnerability, intimacy, and empathy between clients and therapists \u2013 which we know are fundamentally human experiences that technology cannot offer\u201d, Roundfield said. \u201cIn my clinical opinion, there is no replacement for the in-person connection felt between two people in the therapy room, and the potency of that connection facilitates therapeutic change.\u201d The therapists said they believed in the startups\u2019 commitments to keeping in-person therapy at the core of what they do, despite their dual identity as tech companies. All of these startups are quick to champion their results. More than 90% of Two Chairs clients are satisfied with their matches. Reflect has a 95% retention rate after the first session. Kip clients report improvements in depression, anxiety and stress symptoms. But what happens when the matching process fails? They collect more data. Reflect asks people not only why they selected their therapist but why they didn\u2019t choose the other two offered to them. Yet another data point, it\u2019s fed back into the algorithm, TranPham said, in a continuing effort to improve technology\u2019s influence on human-driven therapy.",

      "body": "<p>Collserola Natural Park looms over Barcelona, rising to about 500 metres at the Tibidabo peak. This forested ridge effectively walls off the city\u2019s growth. Collserola is rich with wildlife, home to more than 190 animal species. Overlooking a city of more than 1.5 million residents, which welcomes tens of millions of tourists each year, it has become a battlefront between humans and nature. On many a hot Catalan night, wild boar from Collserola, alone or in gangs, descend on the city and mingle with the human population carousing after hours.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/aug/09/boar-wars-how-wild-hogs-are-trashing-european-cities-podcast\">Boar wars: how wild hogs are trashing European cities \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The encounters between Barcelonan and beast are numerous, peaking in 2016 when police logged 1,187 phone calls about nuisance boars on the loose \u2013 wild hogs rooting up turf, munching trash, attacking dogs, plundering cat-feeders, holding up traffic and running into cars. For the past decade, Barcelona has been desperately searching for a way to keep the boar from colonising the leafy neighbourhoods \u2013 some home to footballers, bankers and celebrities \u2013 that back up against Collserola. The low point came in 2013 when a policeman shot at a boar with his service revolver, but hit and maimed his partner instead.</p> <p>Listed on the World Conservation Union\u2019s most invasive species list, the wild boar does well in just about any environment, from semi-arid plains to alpine forests and marshy grasslands. But more and more, they are drawn to city life. In Barcelona and Berlin, Houston and Hong Kong, groups of wild boar have been seen roaming around town at all hours. In Rome, where I live, boars rooting through uncollected piles of trash have come to symbolise the decline of the city.</p> <p>The arrival of wild boar in town squares and city parks is forcing us to confront a new reality: we are bumping up against the limits of urbanisation. This is a crisis we have largely inflicted on ourselves. City sprawl is driving the species out of its dwindling natural habitats and forcing it to live alongside us. At the same time, we entice it with the tides of garbage and wasted food that wash around our cities. For years, boar have been fattening up on our crops. And now they follow us into our dirty, sprawling cities. Although their numbers are increasing as they migrate to the cities, the move is making them \u2013 and us \u2013 sick. Boars carry a host of diseases, including tuberculosis, hepatitis E and influenza A, that can make the jump to humans.</p> <p>In addition to spreading disease, wild boar each year cause thousands of road accidents. In January, a group of wild boar crossed a highway south of Milan, leading to a three-car pile-up which killed one driver and injured several more. The boar destroy property, devour ground-nesting animals \u2013 including <a href=\"https://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/wildlife_damage/2016/fsc-feral-swine-impacts-tes.pdf\" title=\"\">endangered turtles\u2019 eggs</a> \u2013 and crops, such as fragile vine roots and shoots. Italian farmers <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.it/20170320/italy-mulls-wild-boar-sterilization-after-man-killed-in-boar-scooter-collision\" title=\"\">estimate</a> the boar inflict \u20ac100m (\u00a390m) worth of crop damage annually. As the animals\u2019 toll on public health and the economy climbs, communities from Texas to New South Wales have begun to wage war on the species \u2013 a campaign fought in public parks, on golf courses, on farmland and on street corners at dusk.</p> <p>It was in 2014, when this species seriously threatened the global pork industry, that the boar\u2019s presence went from nuisance to existential threat. Boars can carry African swine fever (ASF), an incurable and highly contagious virus. Known as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/06/millions-of-pigs-culled-across-asia-african-swine-fever-spreads-thailand-\" title=\"\">pig ebola</a>\u201d, it kills wild and domestic pigs, creating an animal health crisis that is rapidly becoming a geopolitical one. To save the bacon from ASF, countries have been erecting physical borders with neighbours, threatening embargos, incinerating millions of farmyard pigs and offering bounties for the culling of wild boar.</p> <p>A European consortium of wildlife experts, conservationists and healthcare experts, <a href=\"https://enetwild.com/the-project/\" title=\"\">Enetwild</a>, has, since 2017, been tasked with leading research into the link between wild boar and ASF. \u201cThe wild boar problem has been progressing for decades,\u201d says Joaqu\u00edn Vicente Ba\u00f1os, a Spanish scientist and coordinator of Enetwild. \u201cIt\u2019s just that now we are seeing the consequences.\u201d</p> <p>Wild boar now number more than 10m in the EU, the group says. \u201cConflicts between humans and wild boar will increase,\u201d says Ba\u00f1os. The numbers are putting more pressure on cities to manage the population of a pest that\u2019s bigger than a rat, with behaviours more complex than a pigeon or stray cat.</p> <p>Boar eradication strategies have been trialled, including contraception, poison and selective culling. In Berlin, the <a href=\"https://www.bz-berlin.de/berlin/charlottenburg-wilmersdorf/stadtjaeger-erlegen-12-wildschweine-im-brixpark\" title=\"\">city pays a team of </a><em><a href=\"https://www.bz-berlin.de/berlin/charlottenburg-wilmersdorf/stadtjaeger-erlegen-12-wildschweine-im-brixpark\" title=\"\">stadtj\u00e4ger</a></em>, or trained street hunters, to pick off nuisance wild boar within city limits. They have shot thousands, but there are still roughly 3,000 in the German capital, populating the city\u2019s green outlying enclaves and parks and venturing on to streets at night, according to the German hunting lobby.</p> <p>In rural Texas, they use helicopters to flush the wild hogs into the open. A marksman, flying shotgun, picks them off one by one. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive on a per-hour basis,\u201d says Michael J Bodenchuk, a wildlife biologist and director of Texas Wildlife Services, a division of the US Department of Agriculture, who often does the shooting. \u201cBut cheap on a per-pig basis. Because we\u2019ve got so many pigs!\u201d The only thing to put a crimp in his kill rate was the recent federal government shutdown. \u201cWe lost a month of flying,\u201d said Bodenchuk, which put them behind their kill targets.</p> <p>Barcelona takes a different approach. Shortly after the calamitous 2013 police shooting, the city hired a team of veterinary scientists from the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). The vets practise a form of wildlife management on the streets of one of Europe\u2019s most densely-populated cities. Their duties involve pre-planned kills \u2013 targeting females in their prime reproductive years and their young, rather than adult males \u2013 they also accompany police on late-night calls in case they are needed to euthanise a boar. During the day, they conduct citizen outreach efforts and supply data and reports to city officials about waste management and where the city is falling behind on trimming vegetation along roads, parks and squares. The effect of this partnership is that boar-human clashes in Barcelona have fallen by more than half, results that are gaining attention across Europe. \u201cThey\u2019re doing great stuff,\u201d Sebastian Vetter at the Research Institute of Wildlife Ecology in Vienna, told me.</p> <p>But while scientists and conservationists see real promise in the Barcelona programme, politics and public opinion might just sink it. Brussels last year rejected a UAB-led funding request that, the team hoped, would lead to an EU-wide plan to manage the urban boar problem along the lines of the Barcelona model. Jorge Ram\u00f3n L\u00f3pez Olvera, the UAB vet scientist managing the programme, told me his contract with Barcelona, which expires in 18 months, hinges on the whims of city hall. Urban boar are a new urban issue, Olvera says, one that is confounding and dividing city dwellers. Homeowners want them off their street. Animal rights activists want them relocated in a humane way. Hunters prefer the status quo, while politicians just want the problem to go away. And they don\u2019t all agree on whether Olvera\u2019s methods are best for Barcelona. After six years on the job, Olvera has learned that what to do about the boar has become an emotionally charged question. \u201cIt\u2019s a human-to-human conflict as much as a human-to-wildlife one,\u201d he says. </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>One evening in late May, Olvera picked me up in a beat-up Dacia Logan station wagon with a blowgun in the back and enough drugs to knock out a charging elephant. We drove to <a href=\"https://www.barcelona.cat/es/conocebcn/pics/atractivos/llars-mundet_92168173838.html\" title=\"\">Llars Mundet</a> on the periphery of Collserola. Within its 14 wooded hectares there are public-housing projects, a sports complex, a senior-care home, a primary school and the Universitat de Barcelona campus, where residents and staff endure frequent unwelcome visits from families of wild boar. City hall, the local council and Olvera\u2019s team had scheduled for that evening a \u201cproactive capture\u201d, one of eight planned for hotspots throughout the summer months.</p> <p>We came across a white van parked in a clearing. It belonged to Estrateko, a local animal control firm that works with Olvera\u2019s team. A few metres beyond, suspended above the ground, was a drop-net trap that Estrateko had set up, and a circle of corn feed strategically placed below the netting. They had rigged the trap with a wifi-enabled trigger. All the boar action \u2013 if there were any \u2013 could be viewed on a private app from a smartphone or tablet. Swipe right on the app and a signal would trigger the release of the trap\u2019s central spring, dropping the 10-by-10-metre net on the ground, ensnaring any animals below. The plan was to catch two boar families after dark.</p> <p>I took a seat in the front of the van, with Enric Vila from Estrateko and a scientist, the Catalan naturalist Jordi Baucells Colomer. These catch-and-kill stakeouts are scheduled at night when there are more boar than people about. I had never been on a trapping expedition before, so I didn\u2019t know what to expect. But when I spied a cyclist, then a jogger and then dog-walkers from my vantage point in the van, the whole hunting vibe vanished. Then I noticed we were parked right next to the trap. I figured this would be a long night.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"30b990d49791c294e453683b872d41ae77b95865\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30b990d49791c294e453683b872d41ae77b95865/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The net trap, ready for wild boar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The net trap, ready for wild boar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SEFaS/Ajutament de Barcelona</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just then Vila pointed. \u201c<em>Senglar!</em>\u201d (Catalan for boar), he whispered excitedly. Two sturdy females and eight striped piglets were directly in front of us. A lone female tentatively approached the bait. The others hung back. Vila predicted they wouldn\u2019t go for it. Sure enough, they all trotted off. A few minutes later, however, an even larger group arrived. Vila and Colomer had expected them, but not quite so soon. And then something surprising happened: a third group, unknown to my fellow van passengers, showed up. A confrontation between the two groups \u2013 more than 20 boars in all \u2013 broke out. The original group protected its turf, chasing off the newcomers. This was not going to plan. \u201cIt\u2019s getting too hot,\u201d Colomer said. We high-tailed it out of there, joining Olvera and the others a safe distance from the trap.</p> <p>Olvera and his colleagues are not exterminators. There is no \u201cBoar Busters\u201d logo on the side of the Dacia. The car is property of UAB where, as a professor of veterinary science, Olvera teaches undergraduates and is part of the department\u2019s wildlife ecology and health group. The unit outsources its expertise to municipalities and local firms. Olvera\u2019s other research projects take him out of town, to study mainly chamois in the Pyrenees and Iberian ibex \u2013 ungulates, like the wild boar. His boar work is more complex, if only because there are so many humans to contend with. Planning meetings with alarmed business and property owners can get animated, as can gatherings with hunters who don\u2019t always care for hunting tips from \u201cthe university guys\u201d. Animal rights activists would like nothing more than to shut the boar-catching operation down. Olvera\u2019s philosophy is to keep a low profile: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to call attention to ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>But it is clear Olvera, a native Barcelonan with a cyclist\u2019s build and a near endless reserve of energy, likes to talk about boar. He shares with me tales of the more than 300 emergency calls they have responded to in the past six years. There was the time a frisky male descended into the heart of the city, appearing in Plaza Catalunya just as the clubs shut for the night. Carles Conejero Fuentes, the youngest member of Olvera\u2019s team at 28, took care of that situation. (The clubbers, mostly inebriated, failed to notice the 49kg animal in their midst, Fuentes said.) Gregorio Mentaberre, Olvera\u2019s friend and colleague for 20 years, had a close call when one charged him in an alley. He leapt out of its path and felt the animal graze his leg, before recovering enough to take aim with his blow-dart.</p> <p>Olvera, 43, seems to get the trickiest calls, including when police, in the small hours of the morning, had to shut down a major roadway outside the CosmoCaixa science museum because a group repeatedly zipped across a grassy central reservation into east- and west-bound traffic. Olvera had trouble with one particular boar that he couldn\u2019t get out of the road. He and an officer approached it in the Dacia at low speed. The officer grabbed hold of the steering wheel as Olvera leaned out the window, steadied the blow pipe and forced from his lungs a burst of air. The tranquilliser dart sank into the boar\u2019s fleshy backside.</p> <p>Once the boars are incapacitated, blood tests are taken. They are then euthanised on the spot. Autopsies are performed the next day in a lab at UAB. Blood tests indicate the overall health of the boar population and whether they pose a risk to the public.</p> <p>Olvera views the city as a giant laboratory, and the boar an indicator of Barcelona\u2019s ecological health. He is collaborating with Jordi Serra Cobo, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/sep/17/bats-coronavirus-infection-majorca\" title=\"\">a Spanish biologist famous</a> for his work on how viruses make the leap from animals to humans. The two were introduced by an official in city hall. They want to know how many urban boar carry hepatitis E, and what that means to humans. In the blood tests of city-caught boar, they see worrying seasonal up-ticks; 44% carried hepatitis E this spring. Olvera calls the work a potential early warning system for the city. \u201cWild boars are pissing and defecating in city parks where children play. If children can get sick, we want to know before it becomes a problem,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The boar management plan relies heavily on the data they collect on population size and migration patterns. A major objective is to identify the \u201cboar corridors\u201d \u2013 feeder roads and paths into town \u2013 and halt their movements from Collserola, their natural habitat, to the bustling city streets below. They can now predict where the boar are likely to appear next during the May-to-September high season. They build heat maps by gauging numerous factors including rainfall, temperature levels (hot, dry conditions tend to send adults on a quest into the city for shade, food and water) and matching that with police phone logs of citizen boar sightings. \u201cIf we know where the wild boar hot spots are,\u201d Olvera explained. \u201cwe can plan our captures where we believe it will have the biggest impact\u201d.</p> <p>It is not enough to track and trap boar where the city meets nature. Since 2013, the UAB team has been on the street almost daily. They are on call round the clock. They also work closely with city officials to make rubbish bins and park entrances boar-tight. They run an education campaign, visiting school children and talking to park-goers to explain the need to keep food waste contained, and to keep a safe distance should they encounter, say, an unpredictable sow with her cute piglets in tow (no selfies!). Last year, boar pest calls fell to 480 \u2013 a 60% drop from 2016. Olvera is cautiously optimistic the situation is coming under control. \u201cWe are effectively chasing them back into the forest now,\u201d he says. </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Across much of the world, the wild boar population has exploded since the 1980s, coinciding with the arrival of warmer winters, the improved crop yields of industrialised farming and the declining number of predators, including hunters. (Hunters grumble that millennials and property developers are killing their sport.) The boar\u2019s adaptability and high intelligence make them one of the most prolific large mammals on Earth. \u201cThe wild hog,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/12/12/hogs-wild\" title=\"\">observed The New Yorker writer Ian Frazier</a>, \u201cis an infestation machine.\u201d</p> <p>Young sows can produce as many as two litters per year, averaging 5-6 piglets \u2013 <a href=\"https://articles.extension.org/pages/63668/feral-hog-reproductive-biology\" title=\"\">and as many as 14</a> \u2013 per brood. Boar become sexually mature when they reach about 35kg. If food supplies are plentiful early in life, females reach breeding age well before their first birthday. Meanwhile, their taste for junk food or crops such as corn and cereals boosts fertility: wild boars that feed on such a high-calorie diet, scientists observe, produce larger litters, and more often. Olvera observes something else. \u201cUrban boars,\u201d he says, \u201clive large and fast. They die younger than the boars of the forest.\u201d</p> <p>Wild boar are smaller than the farmyard pig, but they are growing more prodigious. Some are so accustomed to human foods (they love factory-made cat food, too), they are becoming obese. In the autopsy lab on UAB campus, Olvera\u2019s colleague Fuentes cut back a piece of an exterminated urban boar\u2019s midsection revealing a thick layer of spongy tummy fat. He measured up the girth between his thumb and index finger. \u201cIn boars, it should be half that,\u201d he told me. (UAB autopsies routinely reveal in the stomach traces of rubbish, including pieces of plastic, and undigested human-prepared foods such as chicken and sandwich meat.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3a7e95a848ce341e402df226ca9d0762ec90690e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a7e95a848ce341e402df226ca9d0762ec90690e/0_5_1501_901/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aiming a tranquilliser dart at a family of wild boar in Barcelona.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aiming a tranquilliser dart at a family of wild boar in Barcelona.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SEFaS/Ajutament de Barcelona</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Swine, or <em>sus scrofa</em>, have confounded humans for millennia, since pigs were domesticated 9,000 years ago. Keeping pigs penned in is not always easy, and the ones that escape adapt to the wild in a matter of months. They don\u2019t just change their habitat, but also behaviour and appearance in subsequent generations. They grow a coat of coarse hair. Their tails straighten. Tusks lengthen. They become super-adapters, shape-shifting problem solvers with speed and agility. \u201cWild pigs can run up to 30 mph. They can jump over fences less than 3ft high and have \u2018climbed\u2019 out of pig traps with walls 5 to 6ft high,\u201d <a href=\"https://feralhogs.tamu.edu/frequently-asked-questions/frequently-asked-questions-wild-pigs/\" title=\"\">writes Billy Higginbotham</a>, a wildlife conservation expert at Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Research.</p> <p>If the wild boar senses it is being hunted, it becomes more nocturnal. \u201cIn the forest, a wild boar can smell you well before you can see it,\u201d says Torsten Reinwald, a German hunter and press officer for Deutscher Jagdverband, the German hunting lobby. In the city, the boar\u2019s innate \u201cflight distance\u201d threshold \u2013 the distance in which it perceives a human as a threat \u2013 drops to five metres, Reinwald says. The traditional hunting tactic, known as drive hunting is massively inefficient for conservation. It typically involves more than a dozen hunters and their hounds, working in concert for hours, to bag a few boar. The objective is to startle the prey in the direction of the line of fire, a tactic that occasionally puts hunters in the line of fire too.</p> <p>Hunters and scientists attest to the animal\u2019s intelligence. Sebastian Vetter, of the Research Institute of Wildlife Ecology in Vienna, tells me he finds it increasingly difficult to round up new specimens for behavioural studies. Despite abundant numbers, wild boar become scarce precisely at the moment the researchers seek to lure them into a wood-fenced enclosure for observation. Vetter wonders if changing something \u2013 his entrapment strategy, his appearance, his car, anything \u2013 might improve the odds. \u201cThey seem to know all my tricks,\u201d he marvels. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re smarter than me.\u201d</p> <p>A native to Eurasia and north Africa, the wild boar, thanks to its adaptability, can be found on every continent outside of Antarctica. In almost every case of humans introducing swine to a new region, a vast number escape and quickly find the new surroundings to their liking. And then they multiply.</p> <p>British hunters drove the wild boar to the brink of extinction centuries ago. At the time of George Orwell\u2019s Animal Farm, there were virtually none in the UK. In recent decades, though, UK boar numbers have swelled. Their reintroduction, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), can be explained by \u201cescapes and deliberate releases from wild boar farms\u201d. Defra estimates wild boar numbers in the past 10 years jumped from a few hundred to more than 4,000 in Wales, Scotland and England, including the group that turned parts of the Stourhead National Trust estate in Wiltshire into a no-go zone last year, and another that ran amok in Kent, <a href=\"https://www.kentonline.co.uk/maidstone/news/a21-closed-as-police-chase-wild-a55291/\" title=\"\">shutting down the A21</a>. Bodenchuk, who frequently speaks at international conferences on wild boar management practices, says he sees the tell-tale signs in the UK \u2013 rapid urbanisation squeezing an already dwindling habitat and no central plan to control the numbers \u2013 for what he calls \u201ca pig bomb in about 60 years.\u201d </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>African swine fever has been raging in parts of Europe for the past five years, putting pressure on health officials and scientists to contain it. For Barcelona, the closest active ASF problem area is in Belgium, 620 miles away. But the naturalist Jordi Baucells Colomer told me that, even at that distance, nobody assumes they are safe. Spanish pork production accounts for roughly 1% of GDP. And Catalonia, with a population of 3m pigs, is particularly vulnerable, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of if, but when,\u201d he said. And then, using the same metaphor as Bodenchuk, he concluded: \u201cIt\u2019s a bomb.\u201d</p> <p>There is no vaccine to combat African swine fever, one of agriculture\u2019s most feared animal diseases. Pigs, feral or domesticated, pass it to other pigs. With a near 100% mortality rate, ASF kills swine within 10 days, putting whole farms and boar colonies at risk. (It poses no health risk to humans.) ASF causes high fever, weakness and vomiting in the stricken pig, its skin turning red or blue. Affected pregnant sows often abort spontaneously.</p> <p>Vets first observed swine fever in Kenya in 1921. It spread through the pig population of European settlers there, most likely as the non-native swine came into contact with warthogs and other indigenous species. Because the virus persists for months in the carcass of the infected swine, the contagion is extremely difficult to halt if boars perish in the bush. ASF jumped around Africa for decades, appearing most notably wherever European colonials wanted to keep pigs. In the second half of the 20th century, following global trade routes, ASF spread from Angola to Portugal, then to Spain, the Caribbean and Brazil, ravaging parts of the pork industry for years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"139c969fcf8fe62de6c484cdaf0d5d076683eecf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/139c969fcf8fe62de6c484cdaf0d5d076683eecf/0_0_2592_1944/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wild boar bin-raiding in Spain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wild boar bin-raiding in Spain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SEFaS/Ajutament de Barcelona</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most recent strain bedevilling the EU arrived via Georgia in 2007. It spread to Russia and Belarus and then bordering EU states in 2014, as well as into China, where it has had a devastating impact. The nature of the outbreak \u2013 ravaging some regions, but sparing neighbouring territories \u2013 leaves little doubt: people, not animals, are the main disease vector. The virus can latch on to clothing and persists in food scraps, leaving pigs or wild boar that eat, say, a discarded salami sandwich, or those who come into contact with contaminated hunters or farmers, especially vulnerable. To date, 10 EU countries have reported ASF outbreaks (it is active in nine), causing the quarantining of pig farms along the EU\u2019s eastern border from <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/ad_control-measures_asf_pl-lt-regionalisation.pdf\" title=\"\">Estonia to Romania</a>.</p> <p>According to European commission data from June this year, between quarantines and culls, ASF outbreaks on farms is beginning to come under control. ASF among wild boar, however, is as bad as ever. In 2015, as reports of the disease were streaming in, European Food Safety Authority officials convened an emergency panel of conservationists and wildlife disease experts. They laid out an unsparing containment strategy: if you drastically reduce the number of wild boar, you will eradicate ASF. In practice, that means cutting off their food supply and upping the kill rate \u2013 to 70% of the wild boar population within impacted regions \u2013 with the explicit targeting of young sows and piglets. </p> <p>Beginning in 2015, many EU countries responded by extending boar hunting season year-round. Bounties were paid to hunters and record numbers were slaughtered. Those measures may have backfired in places. In Poland, a group of scientists <a href=\"https://enetwild.com/2019/01/12/experts-against-the-proposal-to-depopulate-wild-boar-in-poland/\" title=\"\">wrote an open letter</a> to prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki in January, urging an end to the eradication hunts. With so many hunters traipsing through the forest, and handling dead carcasses, they argued, it gave rise to the perfect conditions for spreading swine fever. Sure enough, nearly 1m wild boar were killed in Poland from 2015-2017, and the number of confirmed cases in Poland went from 44 in 2015 to, according to commission data, more than 2,500 a year ago.</p> <p>The stakes are high. If a producer lands on an ASF quarantine list it can be ruinous \u2013 for them, and their region. In January, after Australian authorities discovered Chinese imports carrying the virus, officials raised the spectre of restricting the global pork trade from affected countries. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about it in the US,\u201d Bodenchuk told me. With a $22 billion pork industry to protect, the USDA <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-pork/china-cancels-us-pork-import-order-as-us-china-trade-war-drags-on-idUSKCN1SM2D9\" title=\"\">announced in May</a> it would begin testing Asian pork imports for ASF.</p> <p>In Europe, as ASF spreads from east to west, fears of contagion are beginning to divide the bloc from within. Hog-tight barriers have already been erected along the French/Belgian, Danish/German and Bulgarian/Romanian borders in the past year. Boar barriers have become highly unpopular gestures in some countries, reopening old wounds. \u201cUnder the guise of biosecurity, it brings back the argument of erecting fences on Europe\u2019s eastern border,\u201d Marianna Szczygielska, a Polish researcher and postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin, told me. In a sign of how political Europe\u2019s boar problem has become, thousands of mainly urbanite Poles <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/11/planned-wild-boar-cull-in-poland-angers-conservationists\" title=\"\">took to the streets</a> of Warsaw in January to protest against the government\u2019s boar crackdown measures. Or so it seemed. \u201cI\u2019m sure not everyone was out there in the name of animal rights,\u201d Szczygielska added. \u201cIt became the perfect vehicle for anti-government protesting.\u201d</p> <p>In Italy, several hunters, farmers and urban wildlife management officials have told me the boar plaguing Italian towns and causing car accidents are not a local breed, but rather an overly aggressive invader from eastern Europe. Scientists say there is no evidence, but that has not stopped officials, including a southern Italian politician closely aligned with Matteo Salvini, the far-right interior minister, from using this argument to justify boar culls in Puglia. Before Italian politics turned overtly anti-immigrant, it was anti-boar.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Back in Llars Mundet on that May evening, darkness fell. On a gravel road near the park\u2019s entrance, Olvera and the Estrateko team discussed trapping strategy, one eye on a tablet device broadcasting the live feed from the trap\u2019s infrared camera. Footage showed several boar circling. Clearly, the racket we had made minutes earlier, racing away from the trap site, hadn\u2019t fazed the animals.</p> <p>One of those who joined the trapping operation as an observer that evening was Mercedes Vidal, a politician whose constituency includes this district. The day before, Barcelonans had gone to the polls in a tightly contested mayoral race. The boar problem never rose to the level of a talking point in the mayoral campaign. Barcelona has bigger issues. Mass tourism and the secessionist question loom over every discussion about the city\u2019s future. Nonetheless, the boars are a frequent complaint in her district, Vidal told me. \u201cA concern,\u201d she added, \u201cnot a panic.\u201d</p> <p>Vila from Estrateko approached Vidal and me. He held out the tablet. We could see that a group of boars had settled in to feast on the bait. It was time. With a swipe, he set off the trap. Terrorised screams filled the night. We ran in the direction of the commotion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9db4bf739949368969ab89f448c40685bf03b522\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9db4bf739949368969ab89f448c40685bf03b522/0_264_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Their taste for junk food or crops such as corn and cereals boosts fertility.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Their taste for junk food or crops such as corn and cereals boosts fertility.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SEFaS/Ajutament de Barcelona</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I arrived at the trap site somewhat winded. The squeals were deafening. Eleven boars were captured in the netting, the nylon strands wrapping tighter and tighter around their thighs the more they bucked and struggled. Olvera and Mentaberre pounced, injecting each boar in the backside with a tranquilliser.</p> <p>Before long the boars were breathing easy, then snoozing, then snoring. Olvera and Mentaberre took blood samples. A few minutes later they administered the euthanising injection. Lifeless boars were stacked in the van, and the trap was set up for round 2. Just before midnight, more hellish squeals pierced the gloom. Again, the catch was knocked out, blood was drawn and they were killed, bringing the death toll for the evening to 21 \u2013 eight adult females and 13 piglets.</p> <p>The following night, in Nou Barris, another part of the city, the trap was set up again \u2013 this time in a grassy clearing a few metres from a bus stop. Down the road was an asphalt football pitch, high-rise apartment buildings and a school. The team caught and killed eight more \u2013 seven females and one large aggressive male.</p> <p>In mid-June, the preliminary lab tests on the 29 slain boars came back. I scrolled through the results on my mobile. These four-legged city dwellers were sick and contagious. One tested positive for salmonella. Three carried <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7624/\" title=\"\">rickettsia-infected ticks</a>, a pathogen that can move from animal to human. Fourteen had <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/campylobacter\" title=\"\">campylobacter</a>, which the World Health Organization calls a top cause for diarrhoeal diseases in humans, and \u201cthe most common bacterial cause of human gastroenteritis in the world\u201d. Seventeen tested positive for the antibodies against the hepatitis E virus, with six showing signs of ongoing infection. One consolation: no trace of ASF.</p> <p>On my last day in Barcelona, Olvera and I met with M\u00edriam Mart\u00ednez, a vet who oversees wild and farm animal protection for <a href=\"http://faada.org/conocenos-quienes-somos\" title=\"\">FAADA</a>, the Spanish animal rights group. It has the ear of many in city hall and has sparred with Olvera in the past. Mart\u00ednez and Olvera agree on one thing: that for the safety and wellbeing of citizens and animals, the number of urban boar must be reduced. But she believes Olvera\u2019s methods to achieve that end are morally wrong. The animals should be repatriated to reserves, or sterilised, she insists, not euthanised. When Olvera pointed out the science on sterilisation serums is still unproven and that the cost, legality and health risks of moving boar to a distant reserve make it near unfeasible, Mart\u00ednez cut him off. \u201cWe are here to find alternative solutions, and we will work with government officials on it,\u201d she said.The meeting ended with the two sides far apart.</p> <p>This discord reveals the precariousness of Olvera\u2019s position. If the local political winds were to shift, he acknowledges, their city contract may not be renewed at the end of 2020. Olvera plans to re-pitch the EU for funds, but unless they find the right European partners and backers in Brussels, it is a longshot.</p> <p>On the drive back to the UAB campus, Olvera shared his professional journey. He had wanted to work with animals \u2013 \u201cwildlife, not a dog-and-cat vet\u201d \u2013 since he was a boy. During his studies, he became fascinated with ecology, and then grew concerned about the impact humans have on nature. Criticism of his current work, he says, doesn\u2019t bother him. He is not sentimental about the urban boars he is contracted to kill, not even the piglets. He is proud of the science they are contributing to this new field of urban wildlife management. Despite the long odds, he hopes that science will restore the natural balance \u2013 the distance that once kept us safely apart. In short, he wants science to help save the boar from us.</p> <p>\u201cThe urban boar has become a species unto itself,\u201d he says, a species that is looking less like its wild forebears from the forest. \u201cIt\u2019s become habituated to city life, and we are transforming it. It\u2019s not healthy \u2013 for the boar, or for us.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 July 2019 to clarify the figures given for Barcelona\u2019s population.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Collserola Natural Park looms over Barcelona, rising to about 500 metres at the Tibidabo peak. This forested ridge effectively walls off the city\u2019s growth. Collserola is rich with wildlife, home to more than 190 animal species. Overlooking a city of more than 1.5 million residents, which welcomes tens of millions of tourists each year, it has become a battlefront between humans and nature. On many a hot Catalan night, wild boar from Collserola, alone or in gangs, descend on the city and mingle with the human population carousing after hours. The encounters between Barcelonan and beast are numerous, peaking in 2016 when police logged 1,187 phone calls about nuisance boars on the loose \u2013 wild hogs rooting up turf, munching trash, attacking dogs, plundering cat-feeders, holding up traffic and running into cars. For the past decade, Barcelona has been desperately searching for a way to keep the boar from colonising the leafy neighbourhoods \u2013 some home to footballers, bankers and celebrities \u2013 that back up against Collserola. The low point came in 2013 when a policeman shot at a boar with his service revolver, but hit and maimed his partner instead. Listed on the World Conservation Union\u2019s most invasive species list, the wild boar does well in just about any environment, from semi-arid plains to alpine forests and marshy grasslands. But more and more, they are drawn to city life. In Barcelona and Berlin, Houston and Hong Kong, groups of wild boar have been seen roaming around town at all hours. In Rome, where I live, boars rooting through uncollected piles of trash have come to symbolise the decline of the city. The arrival of wild boar in town squares and city parks is forcing us to confront a new reality: we are bumping up against the limits of urbanisation. This is a crisis we have largely inflicted on ourselves. City sprawl is driving the species out of its dwindling natural habitats and forcing it to live alongside us. At the same time, we entice it with the tides of garbage and wasted food that wash around our cities. For years, boar have been fattening up on our crops. And now they follow us into our dirty, sprawling cities. Although their numbers are increasing as they migrate to the cities, the move is making them \u2013 and us \u2013 sick. Boars carry a host of diseases, including tuberculosis, hepatitis E and influenza A, that can make the jump to humans. In addition to spreading disease, wild boar each year cause thousands of road accidents. In January, a group of wild boar crossed a highway south of Milan, leading to a three-car pile-up which killed one driver and injured several more. The boar destroy property, devour ground-nesting animals \u2013 including endangered turtles\u2019 eggs \u2013 and crops, such as fragile vine roots and shoots. Italian farmers estimate the boar inflict \u20ac100m (\u00a390m) worth of crop damage annually. As the animals\u2019 toll on public health and the economy climbs, communities from Texas to New South Wales have begun to wage war on the species \u2013 a campaign fought in public parks, on golf courses, on farmland and on street corners at dusk. It was in 2014, when this species seriously threatened the global pork industry, that the boar\u2019s presence went from nuisance to existential threat. Boars can carry African swine fever (ASF), an incurable and highly contagious virus. Known as \u201cpig ebola\u201d, it kills wild and domestic pigs, creating an animal health crisis that is rapidly becoming a geopolitical one. To save the bacon from ASF, countries have been erecting physical borders with neighbours, threatening embargos, incinerating millions of farmyard pigs and offering bounties for the culling of wild boar. A European consortium of wildlife experts, conservationists and healthcare experts, Enetwild, has, since 2017, been tasked with leading research into the link between wild boar and ASF. \u201cThe wild boar problem has been progressing for decades,\u201d says Joaqu\u00edn Vicente Ba\u00f1os, a Spanish scientist and coordinator of Enetwild. \u201cIt\u2019s just that now we are seeing the consequences.\u201d Wild boar now number more than 10m in the EU, the group says. \u201cConflicts between humans and wild boar will increase,\u201d says Ba\u00f1os. The numbers are putting more pressure on cities to manage the population of a pest that\u2019s bigger than a rat, with behaviours more complex than a pigeon or stray cat. Boar eradication strategies have been trialled, including contraception, poison and selective culling. In Berlin, the city pays a team of stadtj\u00e4ger, or trained street hunters, to pick off nuisance wild boar within city limits. They have shot thousands, but there are still roughly 3,000 in the German capital, populating the city\u2019s green outlying enclaves and parks and venturing on to streets at night, according to the German hunting lobby. In rural Texas, they use helicopters to flush the wild hogs into the open. A marksman, flying shotgun, picks them off one by one. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive on a per-hour basis,\u201d says Michael J Bodenchuk, a wildlife biologist and director of Texas Wildlife Services, a division of the US Department of Agriculture, who often does the shooting. \u201cBut cheap on a per-pig basis. Because we\u2019ve got so many pigs!\u201d The only thing to put a crimp in his kill rate was the recent federal government shutdown. \u201cWe lost a month of flying,\u201d said Bodenchuk, which put them behind their kill targets. Barcelona takes a different approach. Shortly after the calamitous 2013 police shooting, the city hired a team of veterinary scientists from the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). The vets practise a form of wildlife management on the streets of one of Europe\u2019s most densely-populated cities. Their duties involve pre-planned kills \u2013 targeting females in their prime reproductive years and their young, rather than adult males \u2013 they also accompany police on late-night calls in case they are needed to euthanise a boar. During the day, they conduct citizen outreach efforts and supply data and reports to city officials about waste management and where the city is falling behind on trimming vegetation along roads, parks and squares. The effect of this partnership is that boar-human clashes in Barcelona have fallen by more than half, results that are gaining attention across Europe. \u201cThey\u2019re doing great stuff,\u201d Sebastian Vetter at the Research Institute of Wildlife Ecology in Vienna, told me. But while scientists and conservationists see real promise in the Barcelona programme, politics and public opinion might just sink it. Brussels last year rejected a UAB-led funding request that, the team hoped, would lead to an EU-wide plan to manage the urban boar problem along the lines of the Barcelona model. Jorge Ram\u00f3n L\u00f3pez Olvera, the UAB vet scientist managing the programme, told me his contract with Barcelona, which expires in 18 months, hinges on the whims of city hall. Urban boar are a new urban issue, Olvera says, one that is confounding and dividing city dwellers. Homeowners want them off their street. Animal rights activists want them relocated in a humane way. Hunters prefer the status quo, while politicians just want the problem to go away. And they don\u2019t all agree on whether Olvera\u2019s methods are best for Barcelona. After six years on the job, Olvera has learned that what to do about the boar has become an emotionally charged question. \u201cIt\u2019s a human-to-human conflict as much as a human-to-wildlife one,\u201d he says. * * * One evening in late May, Olvera picked me up in a beat-up Dacia Logan station wagon with a blowgun in the back and enough drugs to knock out a charging elephant. We drove to Llars Mundet on the periphery of Collserola. Within its 14 wooded hectares there are public-housing projects, a sports complex, a senior-care home, a primary school and the Universitat de Barcelona campus, where residents and staff endure frequent unwelcome visits from families of wild boar. City hall, the local council and Olvera\u2019s team had scheduled for that evening a \u201cproactive capture\u201d, one of eight planned for hotspots throughout the summer months. We came across a white van parked in a clearing. It belonged to Estrateko, a local animal control firm that works with Olvera\u2019s team. A few metres beyond, suspended above the ground, was a drop-net trap that Estrateko had set up, and a circle of corn feed strategically placed below the netting. They had rigged the trap with a wifi-enabled trigger. All the boar action \u2013 if there were any \u2013 could be viewed on a private app from a smartphone or tablet. Swipe right on the app and a signal would trigger the release of the trap\u2019s central spring, dropping the 10-by-10-metre net on the ground, ensnaring any animals below. The plan was to catch two boar families after dark. I took a seat in the front of the van, with Enric Vila from Estrateko and a scientist, the Catalan naturalist Jordi Baucells Colomer. These catch-and-kill stakeouts are scheduled at night when there are more boar than people about. I had never been on a trapping expedition before, so I didn\u2019t know what to expect. But when I spied a cyclist, then a jogger and then dog-walkers from my vantage point in the van, the whole hunting vibe vanished. Then I noticed we were parked right next to the trap. I figured this would be a long night. Just then Vila pointed. \u201cSenglar!\u201d (Catalan for boar), he whispered excitedly. Two sturdy females and eight striped piglets were directly in front of us. A lone female tentatively approached the bait. The others hung back. Vila predicted they wouldn\u2019t go for it. Sure enough, they all trotted off. A few minutes later, however, an even larger group arrived. Vila and Colomer had expected them, but not quite so soon. And then something surprising happened: a third group, unknown to my fellow van passengers, showed up. A confrontation between the two groups \u2013 more than 20 boars in all \u2013 broke out. The original group protected its turf, chasing off the newcomers. This was not going to plan. \u201cIt\u2019s getting too hot,\u201d Colomer said. We high-tailed it out of there, joining Olvera and the others a safe distance from the trap. Olvera and his colleagues are not exterminators. There is no \u201cBoar Busters\u201d logo on the side of the Dacia. The car is property of UAB where, as a professor of veterinary science, Olvera teaches undergraduates and is part of the department\u2019s wildlife ecology and health group. The unit outsources its expertise to municipalities and local firms. Olvera\u2019s other research projects take him out of town, to study mainly chamois in the Pyrenees and Iberian ibex \u2013 ungulates, like the wild boar. His boar work is more complex, if only because there are so many humans to contend with. Planning meetings with alarmed business and property owners can get animated, as can gatherings with hunters who don\u2019t always care for hunting tips from \u201cthe university guys\u201d. Animal rights activists would like nothing more than to shut the boar-catching operation down. Olvera\u2019s philosophy is to keep a low profile: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to call attention to ourselves.\u201d But it is clear Olvera, a native Barcelonan with a cyclist\u2019s build and a near endless reserve of energy, likes to talk about boar. He shares with me tales of the more than 300 emergency calls they have responded to in the past six years. There was the time a frisky male descended into the heart of the city, appearing in Plaza Catalunya just as the clubs shut for the night. Carles Conejero Fuentes, the youngest member of Olvera\u2019s team at 28, took care of that situation. (The clubbers, mostly inebriated, failed to notice the 49kg animal in their midst, Fuentes said.) Gregorio Mentaberre, Olvera\u2019s friend and colleague for 20 years, had a close call when one charged him in an alley. He leapt out of its path and felt the animal graze his leg, before recovering enough to take aim with his blow-dart. Olvera, 43, seems to get the trickiest calls, including when police, in the small hours of the morning, had to shut down a major roadway outside the CosmoCaixa science museum because a group repeatedly zipped across a grassy central reservation into east- and west-bound traffic. Olvera had trouble with one particular boar that he couldn\u2019t get out of the road. He and an officer approached it in the Dacia at low speed. The officer grabbed hold of the steering wheel as Olvera leaned out the window, steadied the blow pipe and forced from his lungs a burst of air. The tranquilliser dart sank into the boar\u2019s fleshy backside. Once the boars are incapacitated, blood tests are taken. They are then euthanised on the spot. Autopsies are performed the next day in a lab at UAB. Blood tests indicate the overall health of the boar population and whether they pose a risk to the public. Olvera views the city as a giant laboratory, and the boar an indicator of Barcelona\u2019s ecological health. He is collaborating with Jordi Serra Cobo, a Spanish biologist famous for his work on how viruses make the leap from animals to humans. The two were introduced by an official in city hall. They want to know how many urban boar carry hepatitis E, and what that means to humans. In the blood tests of city-caught boar, they see worrying seasonal up-ticks; 44% carried hepatitis E this spring. Olvera calls the work a potential early warning system for the city. \u201cWild boars are pissing and defecating in city parks where children play. If children can get sick, we want to know before it becomes a problem,\u201d he says. The boar management plan relies heavily on the data they collect on population size and migration patterns. A major objective is to identify the \u201cboar corridors\u201d \u2013 feeder roads and paths into town \u2013 and halt their movements from Collserola, their natural habitat, to the bustling city streets below. They can now predict where the boar are likely to appear next during the May-to-September high season. They build heat maps by gauging numerous factors including rainfall, temperature levels (hot, dry conditions tend to send adults on a quest into the city for shade, food and water) and matching that with police phone logs of citizen boar sightings. \u201cIf we know where the wild boar hot spots are,\u201d Olvera explained. \u201cwe can plan our captures where we believe it will have the biggest impact\u201d. It is not enough to track and trap boar where the city meets nature. Since 2013, the UAB team has been on the street almost daily. They are on call round the clock. They also work closely with city officials to make rubbish bins and park entrances boar-tight. They run an education campaign, visiting school children and talking to park-goers to explain the need to keep food waste contained, and to keep a safe distance should they encounter, say, an unpredictable sow with her cute piglets in tow (no selfies!). Last year, boar pest calls fell to 480 \u2013 a 60% drop from 2016. Olvera is cautiously optimistic the situation is coming under control. \u201cWe are effectively chasing them back into the forest now,\u201d he says. * * * Across much of the world, the wild boar population has exploded since the 1980s, coinciding with the arrival of warmer winters, the improved crop yields of industrialised farming and the declining number of predators, including hunters. (Hunters grumble that millennials and property developers are killing their sport.) The boar\u2019s adaptability and high intelligence make them one of the most prolific large mammals on Earth. \u201cThe wild hog,\u201d observed The New Yorker writer Ian Frazier, \u201cis an infestation machine.\u201d Young sows can produce as many as two litters per year, averaging 5-6 piglets \u2013 and as many as 14 \u2013 per brood. Boar become sexually mature when they reach about 35kg. If food supplies are plentiful early in life, females reach breeding age well before their first birthday. Meanwhile, their taste for junk food or crops such as corn and cereals boosts fertility: wild boars that feed on such a high-calorie diet, scientists observe, produce larger litters, and more often. Olvera observes something else. \u201cUrban boars,\u201d he says, \u201clive large and fast. They die younger than the boars of the forest.\u201d Wild boar are smaller than the farmyard pig, but they are growing more prodigious. Some are so accustomed to human foods (they love factory-made cat food, too), they are becoming obese. In the autopsy lab on UAB campus, Olvera\u2019s colleague Fuentes cut back a piece of an exterminated urban boar\u2019s midsection revealing a thick layer of spongy tummy fat. He measured up the girth between his thumb and index finger. \u201cIn boars, it should be half that,\u201d he told me. (UAB autopsies routinely reveal in the stomach traces of rubbish, including pieces of plastic, and undigested human-prepared foods such as chicken and sandwich meat.) Swine, or sus scrofa, have confounded humans for millennia, since pigs were domesticated 9,000 years ago. Keeping pigs penned in is not always easy, and the ones that escape adapt to the wild in a matter of months. They don\u2019t just change their habitat, but also behaviour and appearance in subsequent generations. They grow a coat of coarse hair. Their tails straighten. Tusks lengthen. They become super-adapters, shape-shifting problem solvers with speed and agility. \u201cWild pigs can run up to 30 mph. They can jump over fences less than 3ft high and have \u2018climbed\u2019 out of pig traps with walls 5 to 6ft high,\u201d writes Billy Higginbotham, a wildlife conservation expert at Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Research. If the wild boar senses it is being hunted, it becomes more nocturnal. \u201cIn the forest, a wild boar can smell you well before you can see it,\u201d says Torsten Reinwald, a German hunter and press officer for Deutscher Jagdverband, the German hunting lobby. In the city, the boar\u2019s innate \u201cflight distance\u201d threshold \u2013 the distance in which it perceives a human as a threat \u2013 drops to five metres, Reinwald says. The traditional hunting tactic, known as drive hunting is massively inefficient for conservation. It typically involves more than a dozen hunters and their hounds, working in concert for hours, to bag a few boar. The objective is to startle the prey in the direction of the line of fire, a tactic that occasionally puts hunters in the line of fire too. Hunters and scientists attest to the animal\u2019s intelligence. Sebastian Vetter, of the Research Institute of Wildlife Ecology in Vienna, tells me he finds it increasingly difficult to round up new specimens for behavioural studies. Despite abundant numbers, wild boar become scarce precisely at the moment the researchers seek to lure them into a wood-fenced enclosure for observation. Vetter wonders if changing something \u2013 his entrapment strategy, his appearance, his car, anything \u2013 might improve the odds. \u201cThey seem to know all my tricks,\u201d he marvels. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re smarter than me.\u201d A native to Eurasia and north Africa, the wild boar, thanks to its adaptability, can be found on every continent outside of Antarctica. In almost every case of humans introducing swine to a new region, a vast number escape and quickly find the new surroundings to their liking. And then they multiply. British hunters drove the wild boar to the brink of extinction centuries ago. At the time of George Orwell\u2019s Animal Farm, there were virtually none in the UK. In recent decades, though, UK boar numbers have swelled. Their reintroduction, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), can be explained by \u201cescapes and deliberate releases from wild boar farms\u201d. Defra estimates wild boar numbers in the past 10 years jumped from a few hundred to more than 4,000 in Wales, Scotland and England, including the group that turned parts of the Stourhead National Trust estate in Wiltshire into a no-go zone last year, and another that ran amok in Kent, shutting down the A21. Bodenchuk, who frequently speaks at international conferences on wild boar management practices, says he sees the tell-tale signs in the UK \u2013 rapid urbanisation squeezing an already dwindling habitat and no central plan to control the numbers \u2013 for what he calls \u201ca pig bomb in about 60 years.\u201d * * * African swine fever has been raging in parts of Europe for the past five years, putting pressure on health officials and scientists to contain it. For Barcelona, the closest active ASF problem area is in Belgium, 620 miles away. But the naturalist Jordi Baucells Colomer told me that, even at that distance, nobody assumes they are safe. Spanish pork production accounts for roughly 1% of GDP. And Catalonia, with a population of 3m pigs, is particularly vulnerable, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of if, but when,\u201d he said. And then, using the same metaphor as Bodenchuk, he concluded: \u201cIt\u2019s a bomb.\u201d There is no vaccine to combat African swine fever, one of agriculture\u2019s most feared animal diseases. Pigs, feral or domesticated, pass it to other pigs. With a near 100% mortality rate, ASF kills swine within 10 days, putting whole farms and boar colonies at risk. (It poses no health risk to humans.) ASF causes high fever, weakness and vomiting in the stricken pig, its skin turning red or blue. Affected pregnant sows often abort spontaneously. Vets first observed swine fever in Kenya in 1921. It spread through the pig population of European settlers there, most likely as the non-native swine came into contact with warthogs and other indigenous species. Because the virus persists for months in the carcass of the infected swine, the contagion is extremely difficult to halt if boars perish in the bush. ASF jumped around Africa for decades, appearing most notably wherever European colonials wanted to keep pigs. In the second half of the 20th century, following global trade routes, ASF spread from Angola to Portugal, then to Spain, the Caribbean and Brazil, ravaging parts of the pork industry for years. The most recent strain bedevilling the EU arrived via Georgia in 2007. It spread to Russia and Belarus and then bordering EU states in 2014, as well as into China, where it has had a devastating impact. The nature of the outbreak \u2013 ravaging some regions, but sparing neighbouring territories \u2013 leaves little doubt: people, not animals, are the main disease vector. The virus can latch on to clothing and persists in food scraps, leaving pigs or wild boar that eat, say, a discarded salami sandwich, or those who come into contact with contaminated hunters or farmers, especially vulnerable. To date, 10 EU countries have reported ASF outbreaks (it is active in nine), causing the quarantining of pig farms along the EU\u2019s eastern border from Estonia to Romania. According to European commission data from June this year, between quarantines and culls, ASF outbreaks on farms is beginning to come under control. ASF among wild boar, however, is as bad as ever. In 2015, as reports of the disease were streaming in, European Food Safety Authority officials convened an emergency panel of conservationists and wildlife disease experts. They laid out an unsparing containment strategy: if you drastically reduce the number of wild boar, you will eradicate ASF. In practice, that means cutting off their food supply and upping the kill rate \u2013 to 70% of the wild boar population within impacted regions \u2013 with the explicit targeting of young sows and piglets. Beginning in 2015, many EU countries responded by extending boar hunting season year-round. Bounties were paid to hunters and record numbers were slaughtered. Those measures may have backfired in places. In Poland, a group of scientists wrote an open letter to prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki in January, urging an end to the eradication hunts. With so many hunters traipsing through the forest, and handling dead carcasses, they argued, it gave rise to the perfect conditions for spreading swine fever. Sure enough, nearly 1m wild boar were killed in Poland from 2015-2017, and the number of confirmed cases in Poland went from 44 in 2015 to, according to commission data, more than 2,500 a year ago. The stakes are high. If a producer lands on an ASF quarantine list it can be ruinous \u2013 for them, and their region. In January, after Australian authorities discovered Chinese imports carrying the virus, officials raised the spectre of restricting the global pork trade from affected countries. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about it in the US,\u201d Bodenchuk told me. With a $22 billion pork industry to protect, the USDA announced in May it would begin testing Asian pork imports for ASF. In Europe, as ASF spreads from east to west, fears of contagion are beginning to divide the bloc from within. Hog-tight barriers have already been erected along the French/Belgian, Danish/German and Bulgarian/Romanian borders in the past year. Boar barriers have become highly unpopular gestures in some countries, reopening old wounds. \u201cUnder the guise of biosecurity, it brings back the argument of erecting fences on Europe\u2019s eastern border,\u201d Marianna Szczygielska, a Polish researcher and postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin, told me. In a sign of how political Europe\u2019s boar problem has become, thousands of mainly urbanite Poles took to the streets of Warsaw in January to protest against the government\u2019s boar crackdown measures. Or so it seemed. \u201cI\u2019m sure not everyone was out there in the name of animal rights,\u201d Szczygielska added. \u201cIt became the perfect vehicle for anti-government protesting.\u201d In Italy, several hunters, farmers and urban wildlife management officials have told me the boar plaguing Italian towns and causing car accidents are not a local breed, but rather an overly aggressive invader from eastern Europe. Scientists say there is no evidence, but that has not stopped officials, including a southern Italian politician closely aligned with Matteo Salvini, the far-right interior minister, from using this argument to justify boar culls in Puglia. Before Italian politics turned overtly anti-immigrant, it was anti-boar. * * * Back in Llars Mundet on that May evening, darkness fell. On a gravel road near the park\u2019s entrance, Olvera and the Estrateko team discussed trapping strategy, one eye on a tablet device broadcasting the live feed from the trap\u2019s infrared camera. Footage showed several boar circling. Clearly, the racket we had made minutes earlier, racing away from the trap site, hadn\u2019t fazed the animals. One of those who joined the trapping operation as an observer that evening was Mercedes Vidal, a politician whose constituency includes this district. The day before, Barcelonans had gone to the polls in a tightly contested mayoral race. The boar problem never rose to the level of a talking point in the mayoral campaign. Barcelona has bigger issues. Mass tourism and the secessionist question loom over every discussion about the city\u2019s future. Nonetheless, the boars are a frequent complaint in her district, Vidal told me. \u201cA concern,\u201d she added, \u201cnot a panic.\u201d Vila from Estrateko approached Vidal and me. He held out the tablet. We could see that a group of boars had settled in to feast on the bait. It was time. With a swipe, he set off the trap. Terrorised screams filled the night. We ran in the direction of the commotion. I arrived at the trap site somewhat winded. The squeals were deafening. Eleven boars were captured in the netting, the nylon strands wrapping tighter and tighter around their thighs the more they bucked and struggled. Olvera and Mentaberre pounced, injecting each boar in the backside with a tranquilliser. Before long the boars were breathing easy, then snoozing, then snoring. Olvera and Mentaberre took blood samples. A few minutes later they administered the euthanising injection. Lifeless boars were stacked in the van, and the trap was set up for round 2. Just before midnight, more hellish squeals pierced the gloom. Again, the catch was knocked out, blood was drawn and they were killed, bringing the death toll for the evening to 21 \u2013 eight adult females and 13 piglets. The following night, in Nou Barris, another part of the city, the trap was set up again \u2013 this time in a grassy clearing a few metres from a bus stop. Down the road was an asphalt football pitch, high-rise apartment buildings and a school. The team caught and killed eight more \u2013 seven females and one large aggressive male. In mid-June, the preliminary lab tests on the 29 slain boars came back. I scrolled through the results on my mobile. These four-legged city dwellers were sick and contagious. One tested positive for salmonella. Three carried rickettsia-infected ticks, a pathogen that can move from animal to human. Fourteen had campylobacter, which the World Health Organization calls a top cause for diarrhoeal diseases in humans, and \u201cthe most common bacterial cause of human gastroenteritis in the world\u201d. Seventeen tested positive for the antibodies against the hepatitis E virus, with six showing signs of ongoing infection. One consolation: no trace of ASF. On my last day in Barcelona, Olvera and I met with M\u00edriam Mart\u00ednez, a vet who oversees wild and farm animal protection for FAADA, the Spanish animal rights group. It has the ear of many in city hall and has sparred with Olvera in the past. Mart\u00ednez and Olvera agree on one thing: that for the safety and wellbeing of citizens and animals, the number of urban boar must be reduced. But she believes Olvera\u2019s methods to achieve that end are morally wrong. The animals should be repatriated to reserves, or sterilised, she insists, not euthanised. When Olvera pointed out the science on sterilisation serums is still unproven and that the cost, legality and health risks of moving boar to a distant reserve make it near unfeasible, Mart\u00ednez cut him off. \u201cWe are here to find alternative solutions, and we will work with government officials on it,\u201d she said.The meeting ended with the two sides far apart. This discord reveals the precariousness of Olvera\u2019s position. If the local political winds were to shift, he acknowledges, their city contract may not be renewed at the end of 2020. Olvera plans to re-pitch the EU for funds, but unless they find the right European partners and backers in Brussels, it is a longshot. On the drive back to the UAB campus, Olvera shared his professional journey. He had wanted to work with animals \u2013 \u201cwildlife, not a dog-and-cat vet\u201d \u2013 since he was a boy. During his studies, he became fascinated with ecology, and then grew concerned about the impact humans have on nature. Criticism of his current work, he says, doesn\u2019t bother him. He is not sentimental about the urban boars he is contracted to kill, not even the piglets. He is proud of the science they are contributing to this new field of urban wildlife management. Despite the long odds, he hopes that science will restore the natural balance \u2013 the distance that once kept us safely apart. In short, he wants science to help save the boar from us. \u201cThe urban boar has become a species unto itself,\u201d he says, a species that is looking less like its wild forebears from the forest. \u201cIt\u2019s become habituated to city life, and we are transforming it. It\u2019s not healthy \u2013 for the boar, or for us.\u201d \u2022Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here. \u2022 This article was amended on 30 July 2019 to clarify the figures given for Barcelona\u2019s population.",

Their spending has upended the local community, transforming it from a fishing village into \u201cKings Road-on-Sea\u201d.</p> <p>Anna says that, unfortunately, I can\u2019t stop in for dinner, as bookings are required weeks in advance. It\u2019s probably for the best, as a plate of sea bass sashimi would have set me back \u20ac200. An attempt to have a beer at the bar \u2013 where, without exception, all the customers, young and old, are dancing on the tables to thumping R&amp;B \u2013 is thwarted by a team of six security guards in black polo shirts and shorts.</p> <p>George, one of the guards, explains that only those who have booked a table are allowed to join the party. \u201cIt\u2019s like a normal restaurant until 6pm,\u201d he says. \u201cThen the party starts, every night. People spend huge amounts \u2013 \u20ac50,000 to \u20ac100,000 isn\u2019t unusual.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s more than George, who is from Athens and is on Mykonos for the summer, sharing a small apartment with five other seasonal workers, will make in 10 seasons. George\u2019s job is to prevent anyone who hasn\u2019t shelled out from joining the party, and to keep those enjoying themselves from unwanted attention. But attracting attention and flaunting your wealth appears to be one of the main reasons to visit Nammos, which sits on Psarou Bay, a 15-minute drive south of Mykonos town.</p> <p>Tonight, George is guarding the table of Australian YouTube influencer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/shanigrimmond/\" title=\"shanigrimmond\">Shani Grimmond</a>, whose 1.4 million followers are frequently treated to shots of her in swimwear in exactly this sort of location. On her table, adjacent to the one she is dancing on, are 34 bottles of Veuve Clicquot champagne. Each bottle of VC, as the clientele refer to it, costs \u20ac1,000. Grimmond declines to speak to me.</p> <p>In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/12/philip-green-no-longer-billionaire-fortune-halves-in-year-sunday-times-rich-list\" title=\"\">the one-time-billionaire Green</a> was caught on Instagram at Nammos <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4788684/Philip-Green-caught-spraying-3-000-bottles-champagne.html\" title=\"\">smashing plates and spraying champagne</a> with the property tycoon Robert Tchenguiz, the Kardashian matriarch Kris Jenner and the US designer Tommy Hilfiger.

It came of age in the 60s when the former US first lady Jackie Kennedy Onassis visited with her second husband, the shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis. Following her lead came Grace Kelly, Brigitte Bardot and Sophia Loren. There are two bars and a hotel dedicated to Jackie O on the island. The island became a destination for gay visitors in the 70s, when the Italian-American painter Pierro Aversa and a local fisherman, Andreas Koutsoukos, set up Pierro\u2019s, an LGBT-friendly bar.</p> <p>As is often the case, where the celebrities go, the super-rich follow. Psarou Bay, on which Nammos sits, proved particularly popular because it is a natural deepwater harbour protected from the notorious <em>meltemi</em> north winds. It is thus a perfect spot for billionaires to moor their superyachts. There are 11 of them at anchor when I visit, including the Maltese Falcon, a $300m (\u00a3240m) three-mast sail-powered superyacht built for the Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tom Perkins. <a href=\"https://www.burgessyachts.com/en/charter-a-yacht/yachts-for-charter/maltese-falcon-00006096\" title=\"\">The six-cabin yacht is available to charter for \u20ac480,000 a week</a> including jet skis and water jet packs. It has reportedly been hired by Google\u2019s co-founder Larry Page and the actors Tom Hanks and Hugh Jackman.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhmaB1AMMOA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jhmaB1AMMOA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>For those without sea legs, Nammos offers <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1324789374264802\" title=\"\">a private heliport a few hundred metres inland</a>. If you don\u2019t have your own helicopter, chartering one for the 35-minute journey to Athens will set you back \u20ac3,500.</p> <p>Seeing how much money rich visitors were dropping at the restaurant and beach bar, Nammos\u2019s owners expanded into luxury shopping. They transformed the land behind the bar into <a href=\"https://www.nammosvillage.com/news/nammos-village-grand-opening\" title=\"\">Nammos Village</a>, an enclave of 20 luxury boutiques. Kate Moss DJed at the opening party last year. In the Dior store, Breton-stripe tops emblazoned with \u201cJ\u2019Adior Mykonos\u201d sell for \u20ac1,200. They are a Mykonos exclusive.</p> <p>As well as the Gucci, Burberry and Louis Vuitton stores, there\u2019s the Eden art gallery, where works by the graffiti artist <a href=\"https://www.eden-gallery.com/art/alec-monopoly/\" title=\"\">Alec Monopoly</a> cost more than \u20ac200,000. Monopoly (not his real name; he wears a bandana at all times to conceal his identity) and his gallery clearly know their audience. \u201cIn Nammos, pretty much every person who comes in here can buy everything,\u201d says the gallerist, Akaash Mehta. \u201cThat\u2019s what this place was engineered for.\u201d</p> <p>The first work seen upon entering depicts the banker from Monopoly at the helm of a yacht with Disney\u2019s Scrooge McDuck in the background. The price is \u20ac250,000. Other works in Eden Mykonos include a giant black and silver American Express credit card embossed with \u201cYour Name Here\u201d. Mehta says there is no hidden meaning to the works \u2013 they\u2019re simply \u201cabout money, with Monopoly characters and [themes] showing the aspects of life of the wealthy\u201d.</p> <p>There are no fishermen left in Nammos; they have all sold out to property developers, according to staff at the bar and elsewhere. It\u2019s not the only place on the island to have been transformed to meet the demands of the super-rich. In 2015, German friends Thomas Heyne and Mario Hertel bought Scorpios bar on a promontory across the bay from Nammos and set about transforming it into another super-luxury party destination, also offering wellness activities including yoga and psychedelic breathing classes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJlcZ_xUE50\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oJlcZ_xUE50?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Elena, one of three Scorpios hostesses welcoming guests who arrive by road (the others are stationed on the jetty to welcome those arriving by sea) says that unfortunately I\u2019ve missed the big parties, which are on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays. \u201cThere can be a line out there of 2,000 to 3,000 people,\u201d she says, adding that the bar\u2019s policy is \u201cnever to play any Greek music\u201d.</p> <p>Famous faces are regularly spotted at Scorpios, but Elena says she doesn\u2019t always recognise them. \u201cWe had Gigi Hadid here, but I didn\u2019t know who she was. The restaurant was closing in 10 minutes and I said: \u2018If you\u2019re ready and know what you want to order, then OK, just this once \u2026\u2019 Then afterwards the other girls said: \u2018Elena, come on \u2013 it\u2019s Gigi Hadid. She can have dinner whenever she wants.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Scorpios proved such a hit with London\u2019s arts and media set that this year the private members\u2019 club Soho House bought it in a deal that included the 40-room San Giorgio hotel next door. The sale price was not disclosed.</p> <p>One of Scorpios\u2019 top DJs, <a href=\"https://www.scorpiosmykonos.com/artist-makers/jean-claude-ades\" title=\"\">Jean Claude Ades</a>, who takes to the decks for the Sunday night parties, commutes to Mykonos from his home on Ibiza on a new private-jet sharing service launched by the Canadian billionaire and Uber co-founder Garrett Camp.

Aero\u2019s Jaimee Zullo says the company created the route after clubbers complained of the difficulty of travelling between the two party islands, which normally requires a change of planes and can take hours.</p> <p>The number of international visitors to Mykonos airport, which is undergoing a \u20ac25m upgrade, increased by a fifth to 282,000 in the first six months of 2019 compared with 2018. Every day during the peak season in August, more than 200 planes, including a significant number of private jets, take off or land at the airport. Alexander Zinell, the boss of the airport operator Fraport Greece, says the airport overhaul will include two new VIP lounges when it opens in 2021. </p> <p>For those without their own superyacht, sleeping options include five-star hotels or ultra-luxurious villas, one of which is available to rent for more than \u00a31m a month. Roi Deldimou, the manager of the Mykonos branch of the London luxury estate agent Beauchamp Estates, says <a href=\"https://www.beauchamp.com/villa-rent-villa-tamarisk-myr0297\" title=\"\">Villa Tamarisk</a> \u201cis one for billionaires and VIPs\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWords can\u2019t do it justice,\u201d she says of the villa, which has near-270-degree sea views high on a cliff overlooking Mykonos town and the all-important sunset. \u201cThe views are so good, it is like a balcony in the Aegean.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz3j_X7l1_Z/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Size is important for rich clients, as \u201cbillionaires are used to living in big houses and it can be very hard to confine them in small villas\u201d.</p> <p>The villa comes complete with live-in staff. \u201cThere\u2019s everything you can need 24 hours a day,\u201d Deldimou says. \u201cThere\u2019s a butler, a chef and a sous chef, two waiters and a laundry room.\u201d The eight-bedroom, nine-bathroom villa also boasts an outdoor entertaining area that can seat 120. At \u20ac330,000 a week, the villa is more than \u20ac100,000 more expensive than the second-most-pricey rental home on the island.</p> <p>\u201cA lot [of customers] come from London,\u201d Deldimou says. \u201cIt may say they are British in their passports, but they are not British in origin. It is easy for them to come to Mykonos from London; it is just three and a half hours in their private jet.\u201d</p> <p>Some locals complain that the influx of wealthy holidaymakers has pushed up the prices of all homes on the island, making it difficult to find an affordable place to live.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s nowhere to buy a bucket and spade, but you can pick up a \u20ac10,000 (\u00a39,000) Gucci clutch handbag or a \u20ac250,000 piece of graffiti art. This strip of sand, on the south-west coast of the Greek island of Mykonos, is no ordinary beach. \u201cHa ha, no,\u201d says Anna, a smartly dressed hostess welcoming guests to Nammos beach club, when I pop by to ask if there is anywhere to buy a lilo or other traditional seaside paraphernalia. \u201cOur clients aren\u2019t usually those sorts of people.\u201d Nammos is a destination of choice for some of the world\u2019s wealthiest and most famous people \u2013 from Kate Moss, Lindsay Lohan and Ariana Grande to Philip Green, Wayne Rooney and Usain Bolt. Their spending has upended the local community, transforming it from a fishing village into \u201cKings Road-on-Sea\u201d. Anna says that, unfortunately, I can\u2019t stop in for dinner, as bookings are required weeks in advance. It\u2019s probably for the best, as a plate of sea bass sashimi would have set me back \u20ac200. An attempt to have a beer at the bar \u2013 where, without exception, all the customers, young and old, are dancing on the tables to thumping R&amp;B \u2013 is thwarted by a team of six security guards in black polo shirts and shorts. George, one of the guards, explains that only those who have booked a table are allowed to join the party. \u201cIt\u2019s like a normal restaurant until 6pm,\u201d he says. \u201cThen the party starts, every night. People spend huge amounts \u2013 \u20ac50,000 to \u20ac100,000 isn\u2019t unusual.\u201d That\u2019s more than George, who is from Athens and is on Mykonos for the summer, sharing a small apartment with five other seasonal workers, will make in 10 seasons. George\u2019s job is to prevent anyone who hasn\u2019t shelled out from joining the party, and to keep those enjoying themselves from unwanted attention. But attracting attention and flaunting your wealth appears to be one of the main reasons to visit Nammos, which sits on Psarou Bay, a 15-minute drive south of Mykonos town. Tonight, George is guarding the table of Australian YouTube influencer Shani Grimmond, whose 1.4 million followers are frequently treated to shots of her in swimwear in exactly this sort of location. On her table, adjacent to the one she is dancing on, are 34 bottles of Veuve Clicquot champagne. Each bottle of VC, as the clientele refer to it, costs \u20ac1,000. Grimmond declines to speak to me. In 2017, the one-time-billionaire Green was caught on Instagram at Nammos smashing plates and spraying champagne with the property tycoon Robert Tchenguiz, the Kardashian matriarch Kris Jenner and the US designer Tommy Hilfiger. Green\u2019s Nammos partying came soon after BHS, the department store he sold to a former bankrupt for \u00a31, collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs. Others papped at the bar or included in the 113-page Nammos magazine include Lewis Hamilton, the models Bella Hadid and Heidi Klum, the singer Nicole Scherzinger and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. For extra privacy, famous faces can rent a cabana, complete with an outdoor jacuzzi and butler: a snip at \u20ac5,000 a day. Cabanas at an equally pretty but far from glamorous beach a 10-minute drive away are \u20ac10. Mykonos has been attracting tourists since the 1920s, when archaeologists and antiquity hunters used it as a base to visit the ancient Greek ruins on neighbouring Delos. It came of age in the 60s when the former US first lady Jackie Kennedy Onassis visited with her second husband, the shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis. Following her lead came Grace Kelly, Brigitte Bardot and Sophia Loren. There are two bars and a hotel dedicated to Jackie O on the island. The island became a destination for gay visitors in the 70s, when the Italian-American painter Pierro Aversa and a local fisherman, Andreas Koutsoukos, set up Pierro\u2019s, an LGBT-friendly bar. As is often the case, where the celebrities go, the super-rich follow. Psarou Bay, on which Nammos sits, proved particularly popular because it is a natural deepwater harbour protected from the notorious meltemi north winds. It is thus a perfect spot for billionaires to moor their superyachts. There are 11 of them at anchor when I visit, including the Maltese Falcon, a $300m (\u00a3240m) three-mast sail-powered superyacht built for the Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tom Perkins. The six-cabin yacht is available to charter for \u20ac480,000 a week including jet skis and water jet packs. It has reportedly been hired by Google\u2019s co-founder Larry Page and the actors Tom Hanks and Hugh Jackman. For those without sea legs, Nammos offers a private heliport a few hundred metres inland. If you don\u2019t have your own helicopter, chartering one for the 35-minute journey to Athens will set you back \u20ac3,500. Seeing how much money rich visitors were dropping at the restaurant and beach bar, Nammos\u2019s owners expanded into luxury shopping. They transformed the land behind the bar into Nammos Village, an enclave of 20 luxury boutiques. Kate Moss DJed at the opening party last year. In the Dior store, Breton-stripe tops emblazoned with \u201cJ\u2019Adior Mykonos\u201d sell for \u20ac1,200. They are a Mykonos exclusive. As well as the Gucci, Burberry and Louis Vuitton stores, there\u2019s the Eden art gallery, where works by the graffiti artist Alec Monopoly cost more than \u20ac200,000. Monopoly (not his real name; he wears a bandana at all times to conceal his identity) and his gallery clearly know their audience. \u201cIn Nammos, pretty much every person who comes in here can buy everything,\u201d says the gallerist, Akaash Mehta. \u201cThat\u2019s what this place was engineered for.\u201d The first work seen upon entering depicts the banker from Monopoly at the helm of a yacht with Disney\u2019s Scrooge McDuck in the background. The price is \u20ac250,000. Other works in Eden Mykonos include a giant black and silver American Express credit card embossed with \u201cYour Name Here\u201d. Mehta says there is no hidden meaning to the works \u2013 they\u2019re simply \u201cabout money, with Monopoly characters and [themes] showing the aspects of life of the wealthy\u201d. There are no fishermen left in Nammos; they have all sold out to property developers, according to staff at the bar and elsewhere. It\u2019s not the only place on the island to have been transformed to meet the demands of the super-rich. In 2015, German friends Thomas Heyne and Mario Hertel bought Scorpios bar on a promontory across the bay from Nammos and set about transforming it into another super-luxury party destination, also offering wellness activities including yoga and psychedelic breathing classes. Elena, one of three Scorpios hostesses welcoming guests who arrive by road (the others are stationed on the jetty to welcome those arriving by sea) says that unfortunately I\u2019ve missed the big parties, which are on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays. \u201cThere can be a line out there of 2,000 to 3,000 people,\u201d she says, adding that the bar\u2019s policy is \u201cnever to play any Greek music\u201d. Famous faces are regularly spotted at Scorpios, but Elena says she doesn\u2019t always recognise them. \u201cWe had Gigi Hadid here, but I didn\u2019t know who she was. The restaurant was closing in 10 minutes and I said: \u2018If you\u2019re ready and know what you want to order, then OK, just this once \u2026\u2019 Then afterwards the other girls said: \u2018Elena, come on \u2013 it\u2019s Gigi Hadid. She can have dinner whenever she wants.\u2019\u201d Scorpios proved such a hit with London\u2019s arts and media set that this year the private members\u2019 club Soho House bought it in a deal that included the 40-room San Giorgio hotel next door. The sale price was not disclosed. One of Scorpios\u2019 top DJs, Jean Claude Ades, who takes to the decks for the Sunday night parties, commutes to Mykonos from his home on Ibiza on a new private-jet sharing service launched by the Canadian billionaire and Uber co-founder Garrett Camp. Tickets for Camp\u2019s Aero service, which launched last week, cost about \u20ac800 one-way on the 16-seater CRJ-200 plane. Aero\u2019s Jaimee Zullo says the company created the route after clubbers complained of the difficulty of travelling between the two party islands, which normally requires a change of planes and can take hours. The number of international visitors to Mykonos airport, which is undergoing a \u20ac25m upgrade, increased by a fifth to 282,000 in the first six months of 2019 compared with 2018. Every day during the peak season in August, more than 200 planes, including a significant number of private jets, take off or land at the airport. Alexander Zinell, the boss of the airport operator Fraport Greece, says the airport overhaul will include two new VIP lounges when it opens in 2021. For those without their own superyacht, sleeping options include five-star hotels or ultra-luxurious villas, one of which is available to rent for more than \u00a31m a month. Roi Deldimou, the manager of the Mykonos branch of the London luxury estate agent Beauchamp Estates, says Villa Tamarisk \u201cis one for billionaires and VIPs\u201d. \u201cWords can\u2019t do it justice,\u201d she says of the villa, which has near-270-degree sea views high on a cliff overlooking Mykonos town and the all-important sunset. \u201cThe views are so good, it is like a balcony in the Aegean.\u201d Deldimou says the villa is the biggest private house on Mykonos, at 1,400 sq metres, and may be the largest on all of the Greek islands. Size is important for rich clients, as \u201cbillionaires are used to living in big houses and it can be very hard to confine them in small villas\u201d. The villa comes complete with live-in staff. \u201cThere\u2019s everything you can need 24 hours a day,\u201d Deldimou says. \u201cThere\u2019s a butler, a chef and a sous chef, two waiters and a laundry room.\u201d The eight-bedroom, nine-bathroom villa also boasts an outdoor entertaining area that can seat 120. At \u20ac330,000 a week, the villa is more than \u20ac100,000 more expensive than the second-most-pricey rental home on the island. \u201cA lot [of customers] come from London,\u201d Deldimou says. \u201cIt may say they are British in their passports, but they are not British in origin. It is easy for them to come to Mykonos from London; it is just three and a half hours in their private jet.\u201d Some locals complain that the influx of wealthy holidaymakers has pushed up the prices of all homes on the island, making it difficult to find an affordable place to live. Nick, who works for a car rental company, says his rent on a small house inland has risen from \u20ac400 to \u20ac600 a month, which he says is two or three times the Greek average. \u201cThere have been tourists coming here for ever, but there are a lot more now and they are a lot richer and spend a lot of money. Local people want some of it, so they put their places on Airbnb, which means there are fewer houses for us to rent and the prices are going up. On the other hand, he says \u201cthe pay is also much higher in Mykonos. The tourists have caused the prices to rise, but they have also created a lot of jobs that pay well.\u201d Many of the staff working in the bars, restaurants and hotels have relocated here for the season. Some are from mainland Greece, where the youth unemployment rate is 40%, but word of the money to be made on Mykonos has travelled far and wide. Yazar Abbsa, 18, has come from Pakistan to sell clothes on the beach in the day and clean cars and learn English and Greek in the evenings. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more money to made here than in Pakistan or in Athens,\u201d Abbsa says as he waits for a lift to Super Paradise beach from Ano Mera, the inland town where seasonal workers live, often in dormitory-like conditions. \u201cIt\u2019s hard working here, but it\u2019s better than anywhere else I\u2019ve tried.\u201d",

The community has rapidly outgrown a prayer room at La Trobe University\u2019s regional campus, which has been in use since 1997. The first sod for the mosque was turned last week, five years after the project became a rallying point for right-wing extremists, most of them from out of town. Bendigo made international headlines in 2015 when anti-Islam protesters hijacked a council meeting and the far-right United Patriots Front and pro-diversity campaigners faced off at a series of rallies with a heavy police presence. A high court challenge to stop the mosque failed, and the extremists Neil Erikson and Blair Cottrell were convicted for racial vilification in 2017 over a mock beheading video outside the council chambers.

Amlo\u2019s approval rating remains on more than 60%, though he has stoked disquiet on the left \u2013 of which he claims to be a part \u2013 with moves such as announcing austerity measures, creating a militarised police to calm the country and attacking critical media outlets. \u201cHe benefitted from marches and protests and investigative journalism that revealed corruption or ineptitude on the part of politicians he once opposed,\u201d said Javier Garza, a political analyst in the city of Torre\u00f3n and former newspaper editor. \u201cNow that he\u2019s president, protests and journalistic investigations are going against him \u2013 and he doesn\u2019t like it.\u201d",

The legislation, which passed parliament this year, facilitates the transfer of refugees from Manus and Nauru to Australia for medical treatment. While parliament was debating the bill in February, the Australian\u2019s Simon Benson reported a classified ministerial briefing from Asio and Border Force that warned the bill would \u201cundermine regional processing\u201d and would \u201ccompromise Australia\u2019s strong border protection regime\u201d. The Department of Home Affairs asked Australian federal police to investigate the leak as a potential breach of the Crimes Act. Case notes for the referral to the AFP, obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws, reveal that the department was focused on two documents: a classified briefing prepared in December and an unclassified version of the briefing requested by the immigration minister, David Coleman. According to the notes, the department agreed to a joint investigation with the AFP and was \u201cvery supportive\u201d of search warrants being issued as part of the investigation. But by early March, after conducting an initial review of IT logs in the department to check who had access to the documents, the AFP decided not to investigate. According to the case notes, the first classified document was provided to home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, the home affairs secretary, Mike Pezzullo, the Border Force commissioner, Michael Outram, as well as three deputy secretaries, general counsel and four secretaries within the home affairs department. This means the document only initially went to 11 people. The second unclassified document was provided to Pezzullo as well as two secretaries and the legal division. Including the divisions within the department that worked on the document before it was completed, the list of suspects was at more than 200, according to the AFP including 171 in the department, the case notes state, recommending the case be dropped owing to the high number of suspects and the low prospect of prosecution: \u201cBased on the information provided and inquiries conducted, it is recommended the AFP take no further action in relation to this request.\u201d \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The AFP also expressed frustration that despite repeated requests to be provided with the ministerial briefings from the department, the documents were never handed over. Another FoI request by Guardian Australia revealed that the AFP had not spoken to Dutton\u2019s office in relation to its investigation. Shadow home affairs minister Kristina Keneally questioned why Dutton had gone silent on the leak, given it initially only went to 11 people, and called for him to explain what internal investigation was done by the department to find the source of the leak. \u201cGiven that the AFP never commenced an investigation, potential suspects responsible for the leaks were never questioned, in spite of the fact what seems a small number of people had access to the final documents,\u201d she said. \u201cMr Dutton also needs to come clean and explain what the internal investigation within his own department found about the leaks.

      "bodyText": "It has taken more than 11 years, but the benchmark ASX200 index has finally returned to the levels it set before the global financial crisis devastated the world economy. The ASX200 rose 44.3 points, or 0.65%, at the opening bell on Tuesday, to hit 6,870.1 \u2013 almost 20 points more than its previous high point of 6,852, set on 1 November 2007. While the broader All Ordinaries index busted through its pre-global financial crisis peak last week, the ASX200, which tracks the share prices of the top 200 companies listed on the Australian stock exchange, has been sitting just below its high water mark for the past few days. And while the market may finally have recovered from the dark days of the 2008 crisis, when almost every day seemed to bring a fresh threat of corporate collapse, its new peak comes amid growing concerns about whether Australia can maintain its record run of 28 years without an economic recession. This month, the Reserve Bank cut interest rates to a record low of 1% to try to stimulate an economy that, despite high commodity prices, remains anaemic. The bank is concerned about low spending by households, which has contributed to poor results for the retail sector, and the effect of low wages growth. While Australia\u2019s economy was kept from recession during the GFC by government stimulus, a bank guarantee and booming iron ore and coal prices, its market has been slower to recover than those in the US and Asia. Data provided by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, which maintains the ASX200 index, shows it hit its GFC-era bottom on 6 March 2009, meaning it has taken 10 years and almost five months to claw back its losses. The US equivalent, the S&amp;P500, hit its post-GFC low in March 2009 and had fully recovered about two years later. The S&amp;P Japan 500 recovered its GFC losses in 2017 and Hong Kong\u2019s S&amp;P Access index did the same in January last year, said Priscilla Luk, S&amp;P Dow Jones\u2019 head of global index research and design.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump is facing fresh accusations of racism after launching a Twitter tirade at the weekend against Elijah Cummings, a prominent minority Democratic congressman, and referring to Baltimore, in the latter\u2019s majority black district, as a \u201crodent-infested mess\u201d. The president\u2019s comments ignited yet another firestorm over race issues in Washington, just weeks after he was widely condemned for attacking four congresswomen of color, in what appears to be a deliberate strategy going into the 2020 election. Trump, who rose to political prominence by falsely insisting Barack Obama was born in Kenya, has a long history of targeting minorities and people of color. Some researchers have questioned if the divisive approach will work, particularly as polling finds that a growing majority of Americans believe Trump has made race relations worse. Here are prominent political leaders of color that Trump has attacked in personal ways: Al Sharpton Trump on Monday directed his ire at the Rev Al Sharpton, a longtime black activist who earlier in the day shared a photo of himself en route to Baltimore from his base in New York City. Stating that he had known Sharpton for 25 years, Trump went on to attack the the civil rights advocate, who is ally keenly sought by Democratic 2020 candidates, as someone who \u201chates whites and cops\u201d. \u201cHe would ask me for favors often. Al is a con man, a troublemaker, always looking for a score,\u201d Trump tweeted. Sharpton responded with a photo featuring himself, Trump, the Rev Jesse Jackson and soul great James Brown at a 2006 conference, adding Trump told him at the time he \u201crespects my work\u201d. \u201cDifferent tune now,\u201d Sharpton noted. The Squad Trump tweeted this month that four congresswomen of color \u2013 who are all US citizens \u2013 should \u201cgo back\u201d to where they \u201ccame from\u201d. The tweetswere directed at Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, and were widely decried as racist. Trump nonetheless doubled down and singled out the four freshmen Democrats, known as \u201cthe Squad\u201d, at a rally in North Carolina. His criticism of Omar, who came to America as a Somali refugee and is a naturalized citizen, prompted chants of \u201csend her back\u201d from the crowd. Omar described the episode as \u201ca defining moment in American history\u201d. Maxine Waters Maxine Waters, a congresswoman from California, has been a frequent target of Trump\u2019s, amid her fierce criticism of his administration. Trump has repeatedly derided Waters, a member of the congressional black caucus, as \u201ccrazy\u201d and an \u201cextraordinarily low-IQ person\u201d. The feud between the two escalated last year when Waters encouraged supporters to \u201cshow up\u201d and protest against Trump administration officials in public places, be it restaurants, stores or gas stations. Those comments drew a rebuke from Democratic Party leaders, who pushed back on \u201charassing\u201d political opponents. LeBron James and Don Lemon Last year, Trump mocked the intelligence of NBA superstar LeBron James and CNN host Don Lemon \u2013 both prominent men of color \u2013 after James criticized Trump in an interview with Lemon. \u201cLeBron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cHe made LeBron look smart, which isn\u2019t easy to do.\u201d James, whose interview focused on his work for at-risk children and inner city youngsters, said Trump was trying to use sport to divide the country. James\u2019 comments were a reference to Trump\u2019s attacks on sportspeople of color who have kneeled during the US national anthem to draw attention to police brutality and criminal justice reform. Andrew Gillum During the 2018 midterm elections, Trump went after Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in what opponents saw as racially loaded language. Gillum, who was vying to become the state\u2019s first black governor, had been serving as the mayor of Tallahassee. Without evidence, Trump labeled Gillum a \u201cthief\u201d and accused him of overseeing one of the \u201cmost corrupt cities\u201d in the country. Trump, who campaigned for Ron DeSantis, the Republican who went on to win the race despite a controversial attack on Gillum, also said Florida would become \u201ca crime-ridden, overtaxed mess\u201d if Gillum were elected governor. Barack Obama Trump\u2019s attacks on Barack Obama have been wide-ranging and a constant fixture of his political career. And many of them have invoked the former president\u2019s race, or made a thinly veiled attempt to cast the nation\u2019s first black president as \u2018foreign\u2019. Trump was among the most vocal proponents of conspiracy theories around Obama\u2019s birthplace. He repeatedly called on Obama, who was born in Hawaii, to release his birth certificate. When Obama did so, Trump falsely claimed it was a \u201cfraud\u201d. Trump also routinely linked Obama, a Christian, to Islam, in a bid to stoke fears around his faith. During the 2016 election he referred to Obama as the \u201cfounder of Isis\u201d and, years ago, Trump complained about crime in Baltimore and blamed \u201cour great African American president\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "There have been viral posts of influencers crying about the \u201cblood, sweat and tears\u201d they pour into Instagram, direct appeals to followers for more comments and a frenzy of media. But does it really matter that Instagram seems to be doing away with \u201clikes\u201d? The social media platform has been trialling a new formula in Australia by concealing the number of likes a post has received \u2013 a move which has the potential to dramatically change the commercial and cultural landscape of the social media platform. While users can still see the number of likes their own posts have accumulated and the change hasn\u2019t expanded to the desktop site yet, the average user\u2019s experience of the Instagram feed has changed markedly. Director of policy for Facebook Australia and New Zealand, Mia Garlick, said the change was made with the intention of freeing Instagram users from judgment and helping people to focus \u201cless on likes and more on telling their story\u201d. Responses on Twitter to Instagram\u2019s announcement of the change were near invariably negative, with many commenting that the decision was an example of \u201cmollycoddling\u201d and acting in the interests of \u201csnowflakes\u201d whose feelings were too easily hurt by seeing other people\u2019s relative popularity (this was Twitter, after all). The move has also been criticised by some users as threatening the influencer economy \u2013 a commercial universe that relies heavily on visible engagement with promotional posts. Last week, Melbourne-based influencer Mikaela Testa went viral after posting an emotional video and Facebook post condemning the likes concealment as threatening the livelihoods of people whose income is assured by the clicks of Instagram\u2019s red heart button. \u201cIt\u2019s real money down the drain. I\u2019ve put my blood sweat and tears into this for it to be ripped away, it\u2019s not just me suffering too, it\u2019s every brand and business i [sic] know,\u201d Testa wrote. Other Instafamous figures have taken a slightly more creative, problem-solving approach to the supposed catastrophe. Jem Wolfie, a fitness model who operates an Only Fans account off the back of her Instagram page, recently captioned a photo with \u201c1 comment = 1 like\u201d in an attempt to secure the same public-facing recognition on her post. Mahalia Handley, a model and activist for diversity in fashion with more than 42,000 followers on the platform, said that as she was a model long before beginning her Instagram account, the disappearance of the likes total has had little impact on her online life and she believes the company\u2019s decision could increase users\u2019 comfort with posting authentic material and displaying their creativity. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed a lot of friends saying they felt like they could now show who they are and I think that\u2019s amazing,\u201d Handley said. \u201cI think having the likes taken away present the opportunity for people to be more unique and inventive, more personal, and usher in more creativity in the fashion industry.\u201d However, other influencers remain sceptical that the changes to Instagram will make a great deal of difference in the long run, as users will invariably find alternative yardsticks on the app to measure one another by. Laura Albertin, a social media content writer and influencer with more than 188,000 followers, believes that once the likes disappear, people will simply start to focus on other measures of social validation \u201csuch as followers, comments and shares\u201d.

In addition to this, there is growing recognition that the feedback loop created by Instagram that appears to alter how users are experiencing their own lives as a result of the commodification of their identities may be unsustainable. One only need visit Bondi\u2019s Icebergs pool on a Saturday afternoon to witness influencers (and their imitators) taking photos to comprehend how the platform has lodged itself in many people\u2019s \u2013 and particularly young women\u2019s \u2013 self awareness. In 2017 the UK\u2019s Royal Society for Public Health published a report indicating that while Instagram appeared to provide a positive outlet for self-expression, it was shown to have negative impacts on sleep, body image and Fomo (fear of missing out). From a purely business perspective it may not be the end of influencers yet. Roxy Jacenko, director of Ministry of Talent, a Sydney-based agency that manages social media stars, said influencers needn\u2019t worry too much about the change as the reporting and analytics features are still available in the back end of profiles for users with business accounts. The \u201clike economy\u201d is ultimately only justified by commercial gain, Jacenko said, and even if influencers receive a daunting amount of likes for a post and the product advertised in that post doesn\u2019t see a noticeable increase in sales, \u201cyou\u2019d be asking, \u2018was that campaign really a success?\u2019\u201d.

But as a qualified nutritionist and mum, my nutrition philosophy is a little different to simply telling people to avoid certain foods.</p> \n<p>Instead, I teach parents to focus on all the wonderfully nutritious foods we should be introducing into our little one\u2019s food repertoire, and how important this is in helping them obtain as many different nutrients as possible for their growing bodies and brains.</p> \n<p>I consider dairy one of these important foods (unless your child has a diagnosed allergy). Dairy is a great source of protein, vitamins and minerals. It\u2019s also inexpensive, easily accessible, and, most importantly, kids enjoy it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca886bccd50cb5ff5bf06e700efe9f307b329190\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca886bccd50cb5ff5bf06e700efe9f307b329190/0_203_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"I teach parents to focus on all the wonderfully nutritious foods we should be introducing into our little one\u2019s food repertoire\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">I teach parents to focus on all the wonderfully nutritious foods we should be introducing into our little one\u2019s food repertoire</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tara Leong</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>I teach parents to focus on all the wonderfully nutritious foods we should be introducing into our little one\u2019s food repertoire</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>The array of nutrients in dairy is important for physical growth and brain development and great for building strong bones. Did you know that kids would need to eat eight cups of spinach to get the equivalent amount of calcium that\u2019s in a glass of milk?</p> \n<p>When you compare dairy to the so-called \u201csuperfoods\u201d on supermarket shelves that are wrapped in fancy packaging, have exorbitant price tags and very little science to back up their marketing claims, natural dairy trumps these heavily processed products by far.</p> \n<p>Dairy is an easy and nutritious food to feed kids, and fermented dairy is even better, with proven benefits for gut health and overall wellbeing.</p> \n<p><strong>Fermented dairy and gut health</strong></p> \n<p>The new kid on the block - fermented dairy (also known as cultured dairy) - takes things up another nutritional notch, as these products contain wonderful little good bacteria known as probiotics. Probiotics are proving very important for our physical health, including our immune function.</p> \n<p>Fermented dairy is made by either allowing the dairy to sour naturally or adding a bacterium culture that feeds on the natural sugars in the dairy. The fermentation process yields nutrients that our body needs, such as enzymes and fatty acids. Live bacteria remain in the food, acting as probiotics (or good bacteria), which effectively fight bad bacteria. It\u2019s this balance of good and bad bacteria living along our digestive tract that is proving central to the maintenance of overall health.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5bc0e3d1685ceb14666b04daf42a8695ea71bc6d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bc0e3d1685ceb14666b04daf42a8695ea71bc6d/0_0_1536_2048/750.jpg\" alt=\"The fermentation process yields nutrients that our body needs such as enzymes, and fatty acids.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The fermentation process yields nutrients that our body needs such as enzymes, and fatty acids.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tara Leong</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This balance can quite easily be achieved by consuming fermented probiotic-containing foods. Many cultures have relied on fermented dairy as a staple source of nutrition for centuries, and I\u2019m pleased to see fermented dairy getting the recognition it deserves. We can now quite easily get our hands on fermented dairy products that contain these important probiotics, including yoghurts, cheeses, cultured butter, kefir and labneh.</p> \n<p><strong>The science says</strong></p> \n<p>When it comes to proving the benefits of probiotics and fermented foods, the science is promising. Benefits to our psychological health, such as reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression, have been linked to the consumption of probiotics and fermented foods. The probiotics in fermented dairy may also help us to feel more satiated - the feeling of being full and content with what you\u2019ve eaten - and even assist with the management of allergies.</p> \n<p>Probiotics have been shown to improve immune function; a recent study investigating the effect of fermented dairy drinks on children\u2019s immune systems found that they may reduce the incidence of common infectious diseases such as diarrhoea and respiratory infections.</p> \n<p>This study, on three-to six-year-old children, found that those who consumed a fermented dairy drink each day had a 19% lower occurrence of these infectious diseases compared to children drinking the placebo that did not contain fermented dairy. And as a parent, you\u2019ve got to love anything that keeps those coughs and sleepless nights at bay.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4a54eb68-3687-41dd-9430-3c93c4437e50\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Berrylicious smoothie poles </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>My daughter has recently been teething, refusing to eat.

This may be because the fermentation process \u201ceats up\u201d and digests the lactose in dairy for us, making it easier for our intestine to tolerate.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e2c5b1c38d952d444d493aa207db2ac19ab30ad\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e2c5b1c38d952d444d493aa207db2ac19ab30ad/0_224_657_394/500.jpg\" alt=\"If you\u2019re confused about what to feed your child and would like to positively focus on which healthy foods to start introducing, dairy and fermented dairy can be a nutritionally important and interesting part of a balanced diet for children\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If you\u2019re confused about what to feed your child and would like to positively focus on which healthy foods to start introducing, dairy and fermented dairy can be a nutritionally important and interesting part of a balanced diet for children</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tara Leong</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>If you\u2019re confused about what to feed your child and would like to positively focus on which healthy foods to start introducing, dairy and fermented dairy can be a nutritionally important and interesting part of a balanced diet for children</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>It\u2019s also important to note that a dairy intolerance does not necessarily have to mean strict avoidance of all dairy products. Many children with a dairy intolerance have an individual tolerance level and can have some dairy (up to a cup of milk a day, for example) without any of the common side-effects, such as gas and bloating, before they reach their threshold and experience symptoms.

Instead, I teach parents to focus on all the wonderfully nutritious foods we should be introducing into our little one\u2019s food repertoire, and how important this is in helping them obtain as many different nutrients as possible for their growing bodies and brains. I consider dairy one of these important foods (unless your child has a diagnosed allergy). Dairy is a great source of protein, vitamins and minerals. It\u2019s also inexpensive, easily accessible, and, most importantly, kids enjoy it. I teach parents to focus on all the wonderfully nutritious foods we should be introducing into our little one\u2019s food repertoire The array of nutrients in dairy is important for physical growth and brain development and great for building strong bones. Did you know that kids would need to eat eight cups of spinach to get the equivalent amount of calcium that\u2019s in a glass of milk? When you compare dairy to the so-called \u201csuperfoods\u201d on supermarket shelves that are wrapped in fancy packaging, have exorbitant price tags and very little science to back up their marketing claims, natural dairy trumps these heavily processed products by far. Dairy is an easy and nutritious food to feed kids, and fermented dairy is even better, with proven benefits for gut health and overall wellbeing. Fermented dairy and gut health The new kid on the block - fermented dairy (also known as cultured dairy) - takes things up another nutritional notch, as these products contain wonderful little good bacteria known as probiotics. Probiotics are proving very important for our physical health, including our immune function. Fermented dairy is made by either allowing the dairy to sour naturally or adding a bacterium culture that feeds on the natural sugars in the dairy. The fermentation process yields nutrients that our body needs, such as enzymes and fatty acids. Live bacteria remain in the food, acting as probiotics (or good bacteria), which effectively fight bad bacteria. It\u2019s this balance of good and bad bacteria living along our digestive tract that is proving central to the maintenance of overall health. This balance can quite easily be achieved by consuming fermented probiotic-containing foods. Many cultures have relied on fermented dairy as a staple source of nutrition for centuries, and I\u2019m pleased to see fermented dairy getting the recognition it deserves. We can now quite easily get our hands on fermented dairy products that contain these important probiotics, including yoghurts, cheeses, cultured butter, kefir and labneh. The science says When it comes to proving the benefits of probiotics and fermented foods, the science is promising. Benefits to our psychological health, such as reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression, have been linked to the consumption of probiotics and fermented foods. The probiotics in fermented dairy may also help us to feel more satiated - the feeling of being full and content with what you\u2019ve eaten - and even assist with the management of allergies. Probiotics have been shown to improve immune function; a recent study investigating the effect of fermented dairy drinks on children\u2019s immune systems found that they may reduce the incidence of common infectious diseases such as diarrhoea and respiratory infections. This study, on three-to six-year-old children, found that those who consumed a fermented dairy drink each day had a 19% lower occurrence of these infectious diseases compared to children drinking the placebo that did not contain fermented dairy. And as a parent, you\u2019ve got to love anything that keeps those coughs and sleepless nights at bay. Dairy and the digestive system Studies on probiotics have shown that they may play a role in the treatment and prevention of bowel disease, and that fermented dairy products are well digested and tolerated by those who suffer from lactose intolerance. This may be because the fermentation process \u201ceats up\u201d and digests the lactose in dairy for us, making it easier for our intestine to tolerate. If you\u2019re confused about what to feed your child and would like to positively focus on which healthy foods to start introducing, dairy and fermented dairy can be a nutritionally important and interesting part of a balanced diet for children It\u2019s also important to note that a dairy intolerance does not necessarily have to mean strict avoidance of all dairy products. Many children with a dairy intolerance have an individual tolerance level and can have some dairy (up to a cup of milk a day, for example) without any of the common side-effects, such as gas and bloating, before they reach their threshold and experience symptoms. Hard cheeses are also generally well tolerated as they contain negligible amounts of lactose. Why my child eats dairy If you\u2019re confused about what to feed your child and would like to focus on which healthy foods to start introducing, dairy and fermented dairy can be nutritionally important and interesting part of a balanced diet for children. A good source of calcium, protein, vitamins and minerals, as well as beneficial probiotics, fermented dairy is a food group that ticks the nutritional boxes for me.

      "bodyText": "Labor has called for the government to scrap its controversial welfare debt recovery scheme, saying the so-called robodebt program is \u201cseriously malfunctioning\u201d. At the height of controversy around the scheme in 2017, the opposition called for it to be suspended, but it has never called for it to be abolished. The Coalition has used program to bolster the budget by raising more than $1bn in alleged welfare debts. Labor\u2019s human services spokesman, Bill Shorten, said on Monday night that the program was a mess, citing as the final straw an ABC report that detailed how the estate of a deceased disability pensioner had been targeted by the scheme. Shorten said the case should \u201cshame government services minister Stuart Robert to finally act and address the problems at the heart of this scheme\u201d. \u201cWe recognise the right of government to recoup legitimate debts that are owed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut robodebt is not that, it is a mess.\u201d More than 500,000 debts have now been raised under the program, but data released earlier in the year showed that about 113,000 \u2013 or around 20% \u2013 have been waived or reduced since the scheme began in 2016. As the government has ramped up the scheme this financial year, staff have told Guardian Australia they have continued to issue welfare debts they know could be incorrect under pressure to meet informal performance targets. On Monday night the ABC published contents of a newly issued handbook that contains specific targets for the time taken to raise debts. Shorten also cited reports that the social services minister, Anne Ruston, has contradicted the Department of Human Services about whether Centrelink has resumed robodebt activities in Townsville. Guardian Australia revealed this month that staff were told to lift a \u201cquarantine\u201d on the town, which was ravaged by floods earlier in the year. On Monday night Robert would not acknowledge flaws in the program, instead reiterating that people with concerns should contact Centrelink. He said he understood why people were angry about receiving debts they didn\u2019t believe they owed, but said the government had a responsibility to recover the money. \u201cI certainly understand that and I always encourage people, if in doubt, contact the department,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the last four or five years the department has recovered $1.9bn in overpayments and we have a legal responsibility to do that. I guess it\u2019s type of a mutual obligation.\u201d However, despite the large amount of debts raised, a Senate estimates hearing was told in February that only $500m had actually been paid back, meaning the program had so far cost nearly as much as it had recouped. The scheme is the subject of a legal challenge by Victoria Legal Aid which will go to trial later in the year. Robert also denied the program had been expanded to include more vulnerable welfare recipients, though government figures confirm it has significantly ramped up the number of debts it has raised this financial year. Shorten said: \u201cThe minister will not concede any of this is a problem. Yet robodebt is not just inaccurate. \u201cIt is being enforced in a harsh and cruel way and we now know it is being driven from above.\u201d In 2017, a Labor-Greens majority Senate inquiry recommended the scheme be suspended and for all debts calculated using the error-prone \u201cincome averaging\u201d process to be reassessed. During the 2019 election campaign, advocates had called on Labor to promise it would abolish the program, but the opposition declined to do so.",

Here is where the day stands so far: Trump renewed his attacks on representative Elijah Cummings and his congressional district in Baltimore, which he had previously called \u201ca disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.\u201d While visiting Baltimore, Al Sharpton accused Trump of attacking Cummings and his constituents \u201cin the most bigoted and racist way.\u201d \u201cHe attacks everybody,\u201d the longtime activist said of the president. \u201cBut he has a particular venom for blacks and people of color. He doesn\u2019t refer to any of his other opponents or critics as \u2018infested.\u2019 He does not attack their districts.\u201d Kamala Harris released her long-awaited health care plan, which was quickly criticized by both Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. Biden will likely bring up the issue when he and Harris share the debate stage on Wednesday. Elizabeth Warren also released her trade policy plan, which had some surprising overlap with Trump\u2019s comments on the issue. Stay tuned to see if Trump escalates his attacks against Cummings even further. Representative Mark Meadows, a close congressional ally of Trump\u2019s, put out a statement praising both the president and fellow congressman Elijah Cummings. \u201cHe\u2019s passionate about the people he represents, and no, Elijah is not a racist\u201d Meadows said of Cummings in his statement, which former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum read live on CNN. \u201cI am friends with both men, President Trump and Chairman Cummings, and I know them both well, and neither is a racist.\u201d A CNN reporter noted this: Trump issued an endorsement of Daniel Cameron, a Republican candidate for Kentucky attorney general who is black. Trump\u2019s praise of Cameron for being \u201ctouch on Crime\u201d and \u201cStrong on Borders\u201d comes after he has repeatedly slammed representative Elijah Cummings\u2019s majority-black district in Baltimore as crime-ridden. Mitch McConnell took to the Senate floor to lambaste those who criticized the majority leader for refusing to take up election security bills. The Kentucky Republican attracted a slew of negative headlines last week for twice rejecting consideration of election security bills, despite special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s warning that Russian election interference continues \u201cas we sit here\u201d. Comparing the criticisms to \u201cmodern-day McCarthyism,\u201d McConnell said he would not be \u201cintimidated\u201d into taking up the legislation. \u201cFor decades, I\u2019ve used my Senate seat to stand up to Russia and protect the United States of America,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of my record \u2026 and liars cannot gaslight it away.\u201d A Washington Post reporter tweeted this about his remarks: A Democratic congressman revealed he and his wife were attending the Gilroy garlic festival when last night\u2019s shooting occurred. Representative Dan Lipinski of Illinois said he and his wife Judy were \u201cokay\u201d and that they were praying for those killed and injured in the attack. A pastor who met with Trump today said he finds it \u201chard to believe\u201d that the president is a racist. Pastor Bill Owens participated in a White House meeting with the president that did not initially appear on Trump\u2019s public schedule. But Owens said the meeting had been planned for several days and included about 20 pastors. Some had speculated on whether the meeting was called at the last minute to change the narrative after Trump\u2019s racist attacks on representative Elijah Cummings and his Baltimore district. Senator Rand Paul, a Republican of Kentucky, offered to help pay for a plane ticket to Somalia for representative Ilhan Omar so that the Minnesota Democrat could learn to \u201cappreciate America more\u201d. The comments, made last week during an interview with the far-right outlet Breitbart News, came after Trump tweeted that Omar and three other minority congresswomen should \u201cgo back\u201d to where they came from. That comment precipitated a \u201csend her back\u201d chant at one of Trump\u2019s campaign rallies. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we forcibly send her anywhere,\u201d Paul told Breitbart. \u201cI\u2019m willing to contribute to buy her a ticket to go visit Somalia. I think she can look and maybe learn a little bit about the disaster that is Somalia.\u201d Slamming the country where Omar was born for having \u201cno capitalism\u201d or \u201cGod-given rights\u201d under a constitution, Paul said the congresswoman \u201cmight come back and appreciate America more\u201d after visiting Somalia. Omar did not respond directly to Paul\u2019s comments but did reshare tweets about them, including this one: Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker mocked Trump for attacking Al Sharpton after the president claimed the longtime activist was \u201ca con man, a troublemaker, always looking for a score.\u201d Another House Democrat has come out in favor of impeachment, as the caucus inches closer to a majority level of support for launching an inquiry. \u201cWhen looking at the evidence presented, there is obviously enough smoke to investigate the potential fire of corruption,\u201d representative Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri said in a statement. \u201cCongress has a constitutional responsibility to further investigate the evidence presented by the Special Counsel.\u201d Joe Biden\u2019s advisers fear another shaky debate performance could do lasting damage to his presidential campaign \u2013 particularly given that he will once again share a stage with Kamala Harris. Specifically, they are worried that more halting answers from the former vice president could shine a spotlight on concerns about his age. The New York Times reports: [I]nterviews recently with more than 50 Democratic voters and party officials across four states, as well as with political strategists and some of Mr. Biden\u2019s own donors, revealed significant unease about Mr. Biden\u2019s ability to be a reliably crisp and effective messenger against Mr. Trump. ... Some voters couched their misgivings in euphemisms about wanting \u2018new ideas\u2019 or \u2018new people.\u2019 Some expressed fears of appearing \u2018ageist\u2019 \u2014 a reflection of the good will Mr. Biden enjoys with much of the Democratic rank-and-file. Others referenced their own lives: If they have \u2018slowed down\u2019 upon reaching a certain age, the thinking goes, Mr. Biden must have as well. And a few people were blunt. \u2018Seventy-plus is too old,\u2019 said John Hampel, 68, of West Des Moines, Iowa, who said he would like to support a centrist candidate. Mr. Biden would fit that ideological bill, but Mr. Hampel, citing his own age, continued, \u2018I think he should pass the torch.\u2019 The latest Quinnipiac national poll confirms that Joe Biden\u2019s numbers are bouncing back after a temporary stumble following the first debates. Biden attracted the support of 34 percent of Democratic respondents, compared to Elizabeth Warren\u2019s 15 percent, Kamala Harris\u2019 12 percent and Bernie Sanders\u2019 11 percent. Those numbers represent a 12-point bump for Biden and an 8-point dip for Harris since the university\u2019s July 2 poll, while Warren and Sanders have remained relatively stable since then. As FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Nate Silver reported last week, Harris appears to have lost about a third of what she had gained after the debate, and Biden seems to have regained about two-fifths of what he had lost. So even though Harris is in better shape than she was before the first debates, Biden is still the clear frontrunner. But this week\u2019s debates could change that. Former intelligence officials warned that Trump\u2019s nomination of representative John Ratcliffe to replace Dan Coats as director of national intelligence was an attempt to \u201cneutralise\u201d US spy agencies. Julian Borger has more: Trump has indicated that he might not wait for [Ratcliffe] to receive Senate confirmation before wresting control over the office of the director of national intelligence, which coordinates the work of the other 16 intelligence agencies. \u2018The Acting Director will be named shortly,\u2019 Trump tweeted on Sunday, announcing the departure of Coats, and his choice of Ratcliffe, who has been a staunch defender of Trump in Congress. However, the statute that established the role of DNI states that in case of a vacancy, the principal deputy director acts in the role until a replacement is confirmed. That would be Sue Gordon, a career official with three decades\u2019 experience in intelligence. An attempt to break the rules and oust her will probably heighten the sense in the intelligence agencies that they are under attack. ... \u2018I fear that there is a slow takeover of the norms and procedures of governance by this president, amassing unprecedented executive power,\u2019 Mowatt-Larssen, now at Harvard University\u2019s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, added. \u2018To do that he needs to neutralise or at least silence the intelligence community. He has been doing that for three years, but this takes it to the new level.\u2019 The Michigan Democratic Party Black Caucus issued a statement endorsing Kamala Harris\u2019s presidential bid just one day before the second round of debates are set to start in Detroit. \u201cThe Michigan Democratic Party Black Caucus is proud to endorse Kamala Harris for President,\u201d said Keith Williams, the chairman of the caucus. \u201cShe is a proven leader who has given a voice to the voiceless and championed our community as District Attorney, Attorney General, and United States Senator. Her plans to close the racial wealth gap, invest in our classrooms and higher education is a clear investment in our future but also America\u2019s future and her continued economic growth.\u201d Williams had previously said Harris was his favorite candidate \u201cbecause she\u2019s a sister,\u201d but had declined to formally endorse her until today. Trump will soon meet with \u201cInner City Pastors,\u201d an event that did not initially appear on his public schedule. He will almost certainly bring up his attacks on representative Elijah Cummings\u2019 congressional district in Baltimore. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren released an extensive trade policy proposal that appears to echo Trump on certain issues, like the economic threat of China and jobs that have been lost to outsourcing. \u201cAs President, I won\u2019t hand America\u2019s leverage to big corporations to use for their own narrow purposes \u2014 I\u2019ll use it to create and defend good American jobs, raise wages and farm income, combat climate change, lower drug prices, and raise living standards worldwide,\u201d Warren wrote in a Medium post outlining her proposal. \u201cWe will engage in international trade \u2014 but on our terms and only when it benefits American families.\u201d Warren goes on to list nine preconditions countries must meet before entering a trade deal with America. They include eliminating all domestic fossil fuel subsidies, having a plan to meet the requirements of the Paris Climate Agreement and upholding internationally recognized human rights. But the proposal would fundamentally alter existing and future trade partnerships and is likely to face intense congressional opposition, Politico notes. The irony multiplies: House Republicans have scheduled their annual policy retreat in ... Baltimore. Despite Trump\u2019s concerns that the city is a \u201cvery dangerous &amp; filthy place,\u201d House Republicans plan to hold the September retreat at a downtown Baltimore hotel, the Washington Post reports. The GOP retreat was originally supposed to take place in January in West Virginia, but it was rescheduled due to the looming government shutdown. It is now set to occur between September 12 and 14 at the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront, which is just barely outside of representative Elijah Cummings\u2019 district. Trump\u2019s comments this morning to 9/11 first responders that he \u201cspent a lot time\u201d at Ground Zero are raising serious doubts. A New York Times reporter who spent years covering the fallout of the attacks for the New York Post tweeted this: Trump has made similar claims in the past. During a 2016 rally in Buffalo, New York, he said, \u201cI was down there and I watched our police and our firemen down on 7/11, down at the World Trade Center right after it came down. And I saw the greatest people I\u2019ve ever seen in action. I saw the bravest people I\u2019ve ever seen, including the construction workers, including every person down there. That\u2019s what New York values are about.\u201d The Associated Press reported at the time: Trump\u2019s reference to \u20187/11\u2019 was a slip of the lip. News accounts from days just after 9/11 include references to Trump giving high-fives to police officers and volunteers on their way to the World Trade Center site. \u2018I have a lot of men working down here. I want to make sure they\u2019re OK,\u2019 he said. Trump said his employers were cleaning and digging out, but declined to say where they were working. Joe Biden\u2019s campaign has released its own blistering criticism of Kamala Harris\u2019 health care plan. A statement from Biden\u2019s campaign accuses the California senator of having \u201creleased a health care plan that both backtracks on her long-promised \u2013 but then-hedged \u2013 support of Bernie Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All legislation while at the same time committing to still unraveling the hard-won Affordable Care Act that the Trump Administration is trying to undo right now.\u201d The statement specifically criticizes Harris\u2019s proposal to phase in the new system over 10 years. \u201cThis new, have-it-every-which-way approach pushes the extremely challenging implementation of the Medicare for All part of this plan ten years into the future, meaning it would not occur on the watch of even a two-term administration,\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign said. \u201cThe result? A Bernie Sanders-lite Medicare for All and a refusal to be straight with the American middle class, who would have a large tax increase forced on them with this plan.\u201d But the former vice president couldn\u2019t end the statement without issuing a very backhanded compliment to Sanders. \u201cTo their credit, the Sanders campaign has been honest that the only way to enact Medicare for All without substantially raising taxes on the middle class would require \u2018unicorns\u2019 and \u2018magic wands,\u2019\u201d the statement concludes. Campaign staffers for Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders are going back and forth defending their candidates\u2019 health care plans after Harris released her long-awaited proposal today. Sanders\u2019s staffers are basically saying Harris\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t go far enough, specifically citing the role of private insurers. While Harris would allow private insurers to participate in Medicare plans, Sanders would eliminate the companies\u2019 role. Sanders\u2019s policy director tweeted this about Harris\u2019s plan: And that sparked a tense exchange with Harris\u2019s press secretary: Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has released her campaign\u2019s health care plan, which seems to create a middle option between Bernie Sanders\u2019 Medicare-for-all plan and Joe Biden\u2019s proposal to largely maintain the status quo while adding a government-run insurance option. Harris outlined the plan in a Medium post, explaining that her proposal would allow Medicare to be expanded to all Americans over 10 years while preserving a role for private insurers. \u201cMedicare works. It\u2019s popular. ... Now, let\u2019s expand it to all Americans and give everyone access to comprehensive health care,\u201d Harris writes, noting that her proposed Medicare system would \u201ccover all medically necessary services, including emergency room visits.\u201d But the California senator diverges from Sanders and other progressives on private insurance companies. (Sanders\u2019 plan would eliminate the role of private insurers.) \u201c[W]e will allow private insurers to offer Medicare plans as a part of this system that adhere to strict Medicare requirements on costs and benefits. This would function similar to how private Medicare plans work today, which cover about a third of Medicare seniors, and operate within the Medicare system,\u201d Harris writes. \u201cThis preserves the options that seniors have today and expands options to all Americans, while also telling insurance companies they don\u2019t run the show.\u201d Harris does not mention that private insurance companies have profited extensively off their existing role in Medicare Advantage, which could help stifle industry opposition to her plan. Harris has previously offered mixed messages on her health care views, initially saying at a CNN town hall in January that she would \u201celiminate\u201d private insurance. She later walked that back. But during the first round of presidential debates, Harris raised her hand when the moderators asked who was in favor of getting rid of private insurance. Conservative commentator Bill Kristol provided this \u201csummary\u201d of Dan Coat\u2019s resignation letter as director of national intelligence: George Conway, who is married to senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, responded with this note: If you need a refresher: former defense secretary Jim Mattis resigned late last year with a letter delineating all of his ideological differences with Trump. Mattis specifically cited the poor treatment of international allies and the administration\u2019s approach to \u201cmalign actors\u201d as two key matters on which he and the president diverged. The letter concluded, \u201cBecause you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.\u201d Another House Democrat, representative Dina Titus of Nevada, has come out in favor of impeachment. The House Democratic caucus is now nearing a majority level of support for launching impeachment proceedings, Politico reported yesterday. Titus\u2019 announcement brings the number of pro-impeachment House Democrats up to about 109, which is nine short of a majority for the Democratic caucus. Al Sharpton addressed Trump\u2019s attacks on representative Elijah Cummings and his congressional district in Baltimore. Speaking to reporters in Baltimore, the longtime African American activist said Trump had attacked Cummings and his constituents \u201cin the most bigoted and racist way.\u201d \u201cHe attacks everybody,\u201d Sharpton said of the president. \u201cI know Donald Trump. He\u2019s not mature enough to take criticism. He can\u2019t help it. He\u2019s like a child. Somebody says something, he reacts. He\u2019s thin-skinned and not really matured that well. \u201cBut he has a particular venom for blacks and people of color,\u201d Sharpton noted. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t refer to any of his other opponents or critics as \u2018infested.\u2019 He does not attack their districts.\u201d Sharpton then went on to laud Cummings\u2019 constituents. \u201cThe fact of the matter is Elijah Cummings\u2019 district is the most well-educated and middle class-aspiring district of blacks in this country,\u201d he said. Trump has left the bill signing without taking any questions on his attacks against Baltimore, his new director of national intelligence or anything else. Trump interrupted his own remarks on the bill extending the 9/11 victims fund to claim he was \u201cdown there also\u201d after planes struck the Twin Towers. \u201cI was down there also, but I\u2019m not considering myself a first responder,\u201d Trump said at a Rose Garden event where first responders were present. Trump started his bill signing ceremony for the 9/11 victims fund extension by expressing condolences for those affected by the shooting in northern California. He also recognized former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who now serves as Trump\u2019s lawyer. Giuliani was the city\u2019s mayor when the 9/11 attacks occurred, and Trump said he considered Giuliani to be \u201cour greatest mayor.\u201d Trump has just appeared for a bill signing of the 9/11 victims fund extension. Watch as he delivers remarks here. Democratic presidential candidates are preparing for the debates that start tomorrow in Detroit, but Cory Booker\u2019s campaign is already looking ahead to the next face-off. The New Jersey senator announced this morning that his campaign had hit the donor threshold to qualify for the fall debate. Booker has received contributions from at least 130,000 unique donors and has registered at 2 percent or higher in enough qualifying polls, meeting the Democratic National Committee\u2019s heightened requirements for the September debate. The DNC\u2019s stricter qualifications are expected to significantly decrease the number of debate participants. The Detroit debates, split between tomorrow and Wednesday, will feature 20 candidates. Democratic presidential candidate Jay Inslee \u2014 who has centered his campaign around the climate crisis \u2014 has launched a new environmental justice proposal. The Washington governor would turn the White House Council on Environmental Quality into the Council on Environmental Justice, increase civil and criminal penalties for polluters, and create a fund to reduce energy bills for low-income families. His broader climate plan specifies that 40% or more of federal investments in a greener economy\u2014or $1.2 trillion\u2014would go to communities facing the most pollution, income inequality and impacts from global heating. Inslee in an op-ed in The New York Times on Sunday argued the climate crisis is a winning campaign issue and that President Donald Trump\u2019s record on the environment is a \u201chuge obstacle to his re-election.\u201d The governor says his White House would map overall environmental inequity\u2014from pollution from power plants, highways and fossil fuel facilities--and use the data in government decisions. Inslee would also ban uses of PFAS chemicals, which are polluting drinking water for hundreds of communities around the country, particularly around military bases that have used firefighting foam containing the toxic chemicals in drills. Another ironic twist to Trump\u2019s attacks on Baltimore: the president\u2019s son-in law and adviser Jared Kushner owns more than a dozen apartment complexes there that have been cited for, among many other things, rodent infestations. The Washington Post reports: Kushner Cos., which started operating in Maryland in 2013, has owned almost 9,000 rental units across 17 complexes, many of them in Baltimore County, the Baltimore Sun reported earlier this year. The properties generate at least $90 million in annual revenue. Kushner stepped down as chief executive of the company in 2017, when he became a senior White House adviser. ... In 2017, Baltimore County officials revealed that apartments owned by the Kushner firm were responsible for more than 200 code violations, all accrued in the span of the calendar year. Repairs were made only after the county threatened fines, local officials said, and even after warnings, violations on nine properties were not addressed, resulting in monetary sanctions. In an investigation by the New York Times and Pro Publica published earlier that year, tenants of Kushner properties reported mouse infestations, mold problems and maggots. A private investigator who looked into Kushner\u2019s property management company, Westminster Management, described the managers as \u2018slumlords.\u2019 Three people, including a six-year-old boy, were shot and killed by a gunman who opened fire at the Gilroy garlic festival in northern California. Authorities confirmed the gunman was also killed after a confrontation with police. Vivian Ho and Adam Gabbatt have more: The gunman used a rifle and gained entry to the Gilroy garlic festival by cutting through a fence to avoid tight security, including metal detectors, police said. A second suspect was \u2018involved in some way, we just don\u2019t know in what way\u2019, the Gilroy police chief, Scot Smithee, said at a late-night press conference. The police chief said the motive behind the killings remained unclear. On Monday it emerged that six-year-old Stephen Romero was among the victims. His grandmother, Maribel Romero, told KGO-TV that Romero was a \u2018loving boy\u2019 who was \u2018always kind, happy and, you know, playful\u2019. Romero\u2019s father, Alberto Romero said his son had been playing on a bouncy castle when the shooting happened. Romero was not at the festival, and learned that Stephen had been shot when his wife called from the hospital. Trump is attacking Al Sharpton as \u201ca con man, a troublemaker, always looking for a score\u201d as the longtime activist heads to Baltimore amid the president\u2019s attacks on the city. In response, Sharpton tweeted a photo of Trump attending a 2006 convention for the National Action Network, a civil rights organization founded by Sharpton. Good morning, live blog readers \u2013 and welcome to another week that has started with Donald Trump launching racist attacks against a black member of Congress. Just weeks after the president suggested four minority congresswomen should \u201cgo back\u201d to where they came from, he has now suggested that Baltimore, the home city of representative Elijah Cummings, is \u201ca disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess\u201d and \u201cthe worst run and most dangerous [district] anywhere in the United States\u201d. Trump continued with that line of racist criticism this morning, upon learning that Al Sharpton was going to visit the city. It is ironic that Trump is attacking Cummings for being \u201call talk, no action,\u201d given that the president\u2019s ire was first ignited because of the many investigative steps Cummings has taken as chairman of the House oversight committee. But the \u201call talk, no action\u201d line also echoed Trump\u2019s criticisms shortly after he was elected against representative John Lewis, a civil rights icon who was beaten by police during the famous 1965 march in Selma, Alabama. Trump also claimed Lewis\u2019s Georgia district was \u201cin horrible shape,\u201d an assertion that many of the congressman\u2019s constituents dismissed as a \u201cflat-out lie\u201d. Many residents of Cummings\u2019 majority-black district have similarly denied Trump\u2019s characterization of their home, suggesting that the president\u2019s false attacks are based largely on who lives there. CNN host Victor Blackwell touched on this issue during an emotional segment discussing Baltimore, where he grew up. \u201cThere are challenges no doubt. But people are proud of their community,\u201d said Blackwell, who is African American. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound self-righteous, but people get up and go to work there, they care for their families there, they love their children who pledge allegiance to the flag just like children do in districts of congressmen who support you, sir. They are Americans too.\u201d Here are a few other things the blog is keeping its eye on today: Director of national intelligence Dan Coats is leaving his post next month, clearing the way for representative John Ratcliffe, a Trump loyalist who grilled special counsel Robert Mueller last week. Trump will almost certainly be thrown questions about Coats and his attacks on Cummings when he participates in a signing ceremony for the 9/11 victims fund at 10 a.m. EDT. But there\u2019s no guarantee he\u2019ll respond. 2020 candidates are preparing for the next round of debates, which start tomorrow in Detroit. We\u2019re covering all of that and more today, so stay tuned.",

      "body": "<p>The Philippines has replaced Brazil as the most murderous country in the world for people defending their land and environment, according to research that puts a spotlight on the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte.</p> <p>More than three defenders were killed across the world every week in 2018, according to the annual toll by the independent watchdog Global Witness, highlighting the continued dangers facing those who stand up to miners, loggers, farmers, poachers and other extractive industries.</p> <p>The latest global total of 164 deaths was down from 2017\u2019s peak of 201, a decrease that campaigners partly put down to growing focus on the subject by indigenous groups, NGOs, the United Nations and the media.</p> <p>But Global Witness said companies and governments were increasingly using non-lethal tactics to quash dissent, including criminalisation and threats, while killings remain at an alarmingly high level.</p> <p>For the first time since the annual toll began in 2012, Brazil did not top the list.

      "bodyText": "The Philippines has replaced Brazil as the most murderous country in the world for people defending their land and environment, according to research that puts a spotlight on the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte. More than three defenders were killed across the world every week in 2018, according to the annual toll by the independent watchdog Global Witness, highlighting the continued dangers facing those who stand up to miners, loggers, farmers, poachers and other extractive industries. The latest global total of 164 deaths was down from 2017\u2019s peak of 201, a decrease that campaigners partly put down to growing focus on the subject by indigenous groups, NGOs, the United Nations and the media. But Global Witness said companies and governments were increasingly using non-lethal tactics to quash dissent, including criminalisation and threats, while killings remain at an alarmingly high level. For the first time since the annual toll began in 2012, Brazil did not top the list. The number of defenders murdered in South America\u2019s biggest nation fell in 2018 by almost two-thirds, from 57 to 20. This was partly due to an overall decline in homicide rates across the country, but also came ahead of a transition of power and rising international attention. Last year the UN environment programme put more pressure on governments to protect defenders and organised a conference in Rio de Janeiro to push for international recognition of the human right to a healthy environment. There was also more media attention on the problem, including from the Guardian, which ran a series about land and environment defenders in conjunction with Global Witness. Indigenous groups said they had contributed to the decline thanks to a better reporting mechanism for alerting the outside world to murders that might otherwise have gone unreported. \u201cWe should be the ones recognised for this change because we are the ones who are drawing attention to what is happening,\u201d said S\u00f4nia Guajajara, an indigenous activist. It is also possible that land-grabbers now have more power to get what they want without resorting to violence, because the agricultural lobby has an increasingly dominant position in politics. Campaigners fear last year\u2019s decline in Brazil could be short-lived if a new phase of conflict erupts as a result of President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s efforts to weaken indigenous territorial rights and protections for nature reserves. Underlining these concerns last week, Emyra Wai\u00e3pi, an indigenous leader, was murdered in the Wai\u00e3pi indigenous reserve in the state of Amap\u00e1 ahead of an invasion by dozens of illegal miners. In the Philippines, 30 defenders were killed last year, following 48 in 2017, which was the highest ever recorded in an Asian country. A third of the deaths were on the island of Mindanao, which is at the centre of the Duterte administration\u2019s plans to allocate 1.6m hectares of land to industrial plantations.
