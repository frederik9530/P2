Another policy suggestion calls on aviation companies to advertise their emissions in an easy-to-understand manner, for example as a proportion of an average annual household\u2019s output, so that customers could make informed decisions. The report, by Dr Richard Carmichael of Imperial College London, goes beyond aviation policies to consider a range of other lifestyle changes the public must make to tackle the climate crisis. These include reduce meat and diary consumption, trading cars for bikes, and swapping gas boilers at home for electric alternatives. Surface transport accounts for the biggest proportion of a household\u2019s carbon footprint at 34%, followed by diet (30%), home heating (21%) and aviation (12%). Regulations should be introduced to require all schools to offer pupils at least one plant-based meal option and food packaging should display a \u201ctraffic light\u201d system indicating its carbon footprint. Domestic travel recommendations include dropping prices on intercity rail services to reduce demand for cars and planes, and re-opening disused rail lines. The report also recommends VAT on the installation of insulation and low-carbon heating systems be removed.

      "body": "<p>\u201cFootball, and you can put this in your article,\u201d John Barnes says as he leans forward and points at the dictaphone on the table between us, \u201cis the least racist industry in this country. Yes, you have people shouting racist abuse and throwing bananas on the field, and there are issues regarding the number of black coaches and managers in the game, but which other industry allows a young black boy the exact same opportunity as a young white boy? Even at League One and League Two level you\u2019ll see five or six black players, because they are given an opportunity to maximise their potential.\u201d</p> <p>Barnes has never been afraid to speak his mind when it comes to the issues that have increasingly come to define him \u2013 race and racism, on and off the field. He is arguably the most famous black player in England and had to endure racism as a player \u2013 the picture of him back-heeling a banana off the pitch during a Merseyside derby in 1988 is iconic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/12/howard-gayle-england-walk-off-racism-bulgaria\">If England walk off the pitch because of abuse, racism wins | Howard Gayle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He is a pioneer and an inspiration, but for many he has also become an apologist for cases of racism in recent months and that is why we are meeting at De Montfort University in Leicester before Barnes gives a talk there \u2013 so he can defend himself and have his say. It proves to be an engrossing hour or so in the company of the former Liverpool and England winger.</p> <p>For Barnes it started in February when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/08/liam-neeson-john-barnes-race-bias-racism\" title=\"\">came out in support of Liam Neeson</a> after the actor had revealed during an interview that he once set out to kill a random black man in revenge for a woman he knew being raped. Barnes claimed Neeson \u201cdeserved a medal\u201d for his honesty and that the only thing he was guilty of was unconscious bias. That led to criticism before the storm passed, only to break out again last month when Barnes spoke in defence of his former teammate Peter Beardsley after he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/19/peter-beardsley-banned-football-seven-months-racist-language\" title=\"\">suspended by the Football Association</a> for making racist comments to young black players in his capacity as Newcastle\u2019s under\u201123 coach.</p> <p>Then came Barnes\u2019s backing of Bernardo Silva after the midfielder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/02/bernardo-silva-charged-fa-benjamin-mendy-tweet-ban-manchester-city\" title=\"\">tweeted an image of his Manchester City teammate Benjamin Mendy</a> alongside the logo for the Spanish chocolate confectionery company Conguitos and compared the two. Silva was accused of racial stereotyping by the anti-racist group Kick It Out and has been charged by the FA with misconduct. But Barnes saw nothing wrong in what Silva did, which led to more outrage, especially on social media where the 55-year-old was accused of being out of touch and, yes, an apologist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5115499576f90010c04cdbb6d7236ac6778f749\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5115499576f90010c04cdbb6d7236ac6778f749/0_318_2736_1642/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Barnes, Everton v Liverpool\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Barnes backheels a banana thrown at him during a Merseyside derby at Goodison Park in 1988.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: unknown/BTS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m not an apologist,\u201d Barnes insists. \u201cI give balanced, constructive views and what happens is that bits and pieces of what I say are used against me. For a long time John Barnes was seen as the voice of reason when it came to race. John Barnes hasn\u2019t changed; what\u2019s changed is the reporting of John Barnes.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Barnes what he means by that and he goes on to speak about \u201celite black groups\u201d in this country that sought his involvement in helping tackle racism in football but then did not want to know after he said he would only work with them if he could also focus his efforts on what is happening to black children growing up in inner-city areas, from a social, educational and vocational point of view.</p> <p>\u201cFor these groups it is only about how terrible discrimination is in Montenegro or how terrible it is when Chelsea fans abuse Raheem Sterling, but these things have no impact on the black community. They are not what I want to focus my agenda on, and it was when I made that clear that the reporting of me changed.\u201d</p> <p>It is an intriguing and characteristically strongly delivered answer from Barnes, who goes on to reference this country\u2019s \u201cblack elite\u201d on more than one occasion. There is clear anger there and also defiance, which is equally notable when Barnes reiterates his defence of Neeson, Beardsley and, in particular, Silva. \u201cWhat is wrong with a black man with big lips and a round head?\u201d he says in reference to the Conguitos logo. \u201cIf you had to draw, say, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 as a cartoon, how would he look? Would he not have black skin, big lips and a round head? Why is that negative?\u201d</p> <p>I make the point that the issue many people have with the Conguitos logo is its historical context. Conguitos literally means \u201clittle people of Congo\u201d and its logo, dating back to the country\u2019s independence from Belgium in 1960, appears quite clearly to be wrapped up in racist tropes from the time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf you go back to the cartoons the logo originates from then yes, that is unacceptable. But I\u2019m pretty sure Bernardo Silva has not seen those cartoons, nor was he referencing them in his tweet,\u201d Barnes replies. \u201cAll he\u2019s come across is a picture on a Spanish sweet and a picture of Benjamin Mendy and said he thinks they look alike. Also, Sterling came out and said he saw nothing wrong with Silva\u2019s tweet. Where is the criticism towards him?</p> <p>\u201cFor a long time, images of black men with big lips and a round head were used to make us feel inferior, but it doesn\u2019t need to be like that, we don\u2019t need to self\u2011loathe. We can change the narrative. Many members of the black elite agree with me on that but, off the record, they claim we can\u2019t say that publicly because that\u2019s a very intellectual way to look at things and the black community isn\u2019t ready for that. So are the black elite saying the black community is too thick to understand that? I want no part of that.\u201d</p> <p>Barnes is talking at De Montfort as part of the campus\u2019s Black History Season.

      "bodyText": "\u201cFootball, and you can put this in your article,\u201d John Barnes says as he leans forward and points at the dictaphone on the table between us, \u201cis the least racist industry in this country. Yes, you have people shouting racist abuse and throwing bananas on the field, and there are issues regarding the number of black coaches and managers in the game, but which other industry allows a young black boy the exact same opportunity as a young white boy? Even at League One and League Two level you\u2019ll see five or six black players, because they are given an opportunity to maximise their potential.\u201d Barnes has never been afraid to speak his mind when it comes to the issues that have increasingly come to define him \u2013 race and racism, on and off the field. He is arguably the most famous black player in England and had to endure racism as a player \u2013 the picture of him back-heeling a banana off the pitch during a Merseyside derby in 1988 is iconic. He is a pioneer and an inspiration, but for many he has also become an apologist for cases of racism in recent months and that is why we are meeting at De Montfort University in Leicester before Barnes gives a talk there \u2013 so he can defend himself and have his say. It proves to be an engrossing hour or so in the company of the former Liverpool and England winger. For Barnes it started in February when he came out in support of Liam Neeson after the actor had revealed during an interview that he once set out to kill a random black man in revenge for a woman he knew being raped. Barnes claimed Neeson \u201cdeserved a medal\u201d for his honesty and that the only thing he was guilty of was unconscious bias. That led to criticism before the storm passed, only to break out again last month when Barnes spoke in defence of his former teammate Peter Beardsley after he was suspended by the Football Association for making racist comments to young black players in his capacity as Newcastle\u2019s under\u201123 coach. Then came Barnes\u2019s backing of Bernardo Silva after the midfielder tweeted an image of his Manchester City teammate Benjamin Mendy alongside the logo for the Spanish chocolate confectionery company Conguitos and compared the two. Silva was accused of racial stereotyping by the anti-racist group Kick It Out and has been charged by the FA with misconduct. But Barnes saw nothing wrong in what Silva did, which led to more outrage, especially on social media where the 55-year-old was accused of being out of touch and, yes, an apologist. \u201cI\u2019m not an apologist,\u201d Barnes insists. \u201cI give balanced, constructive views and what happens is that bits and pieces of what I say are used against me. For a long time John Barnes was seen as the voice of reason when it came to race. John Barnes hasn\u2019t changed; what\u2019s changed is the reporting of John Barnes.\u201d I ask Barnes what he means by that and he goes on to speak about \u201celite black groups\u201d in this country that sought his involvement in helping tackle racism in football but then did not want to know after he said he would only work with them if he could also focus his efforts on what is happening to black children growing up in inner-city areas, from a social, educational and vocational point of view. \u201cFor these groups it is only about how terrible discrimination is in Montenegro or how terrible it is when Chelsea fans abuse Raheem Sterling, but these things have no impact on the black community. They are not what I want to focus my agenda on, and it was when I made that clear that the reporting of me changed.\u201d It is an intriguing and characteristically strongly delivered answer from Barnes, who goes on to reference this country\u2019s \u201cblack elite\u201d on more than one occasion. There is clear anger there and also defiance, which is equally notable when Barnes reiterates his defence of Neeson, Beardsley and, in particular, Silva. \u201cWhat is wrong with a black man with big lips and a round head?\u201d he says in reference to the Conguitos logo. \u201cIf you had to draw, say, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 as a cartoon, how would he look? Would he not have black skin, big lips and a round head? Why is that negative?\u201d I make the point that the issue many people have with the Conguitos logo is its historical context. Conguitos literally means \u201clittle people of Congo\u201d and its logo, dating back to the country\u2019s independence from Belgium in 1960, appears quite clearly to be wrapped up in racist tropes from the time. \u201cIf you go back to the cartoons the logo originates from then yes, that is unacceptable. But I\u2019m pretty sure Bernardo Silva has not seen those cartoons, nor was he referencing them in his tweet,\u201d Barnes replies. \u201cAll he\u2019s come across is a picture on a Spanish sweet and a picture of Benjamin Mendy and said he thinks they look alike. Also, Sterling came out and said he saw nothing wrong with Silva\u2019s tweet. Where is the criticism towards him? \u201cFor a long time, images of black men with big lips and a round head were used to make us feel inferior, but it doesn\u2019t need to be like that, we don\u2019t need to self\u2011loathe. We can change the narrative. Many members of the black elite agree with me on that but, off the record, they claim we can\u2019t say that publicly because that\u2019s a very intellectual way to look at things and the black community isn\u2019t ready for that. So are the black elite saying the black community is too thick to understand that? I want no part of that.\u201d Barnes is talking at De Montfort as part of the campus\u2019s Black History Season. He is dressed in a dark jacket, blue shirt and dark trousers and is clearly energised by the prospect of sharing his thoughts on race and racism with an audience, something he has regularly been doing at colleges and universities since retiring as a player two decades ago. The same principles are brought up: scapegoating achieves nothing and that each case needs to be judged on its own merit, with the understanding that unconscious bias \u2013 something everyone is guilty of \u2013 could be at play. In regards to football specifically, Barnes also believes that racism cannot be eradicated from stadiums until it is eradicated from society. It is in this context that Barnes disagrees with the idea of players walking off the pitch in protest against racist abuse, something members of England\u2019s current squad, among them Sterling and Tammy Abraham, have said they are willing to do, starting, potentially, with Monday\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier in Bulgaria. \u201cIt depends on what we consider to be racist abuse,\u201d says Barnes. \u201cBecause while we know monkey chants are illegal, if the whole stadium wants to boo a black player every time he gets the ball, while we know why they\u2019re doing it from a racial perspective, booing is not illegal. So we ban booing, but then they\u2019ll clap instead. But again, clapping is not illegal. So what do we do then \u2013 ban clapping? \u201cThe simple fact is there are no laws you can pass to stop people racially abusing black footballers. So the solution is to come up with something that doesn\u2019t make people want to abuse black footballers in the first place.\u201d Barnes then homes in on his insistence that racism in football is directly linked to racism in society and, in doing so, calls on those involved in the sport, Sterling included, to play a more active role. \u201cRaheem gave 550 FA Cup semi-final tickets to schoolchildren in Wembley, where he\u2019s from. Instead of that why doesn\u2019t he take those 550 children in to a press conference and tell the world\u2019s media that these young people are being disenfranchised, that they haven\u2019t got a good education, a good level of housing, that\u2019s there\u2019s crime in their area?

By improving the lives of black people they\u2019ll change the perception of black people, which in turn will see the entire black community prosper. That is the real fight against racism and what I have been championing for years.\u201d By now Barnes is full flow. The power and eloquence of his words are striking, and while his views are controversial they are also thought-provoking and unique among his peers. When I ask Barnes where that comes from he immediately references his late father, Ken. \u201cMy dad was a colonel, second in command of the Jamaican army, and when I meet soldiers who knew him they always say how much they loved him.

The 14 figureheads, some of which were so badly water-damaged that their insides had turned into a soggy mulch, are to be suspended from the ceiling of The Box gallery and museum, which is due to open in the spring. They include a two tonne, 4 metre-high (13ft) figure of William IV carved in Devonport, Plymouth in 1833 that once stood tall and bold at the prow of the ship HMS Royal William, and a depiction of a bearded river god inspired by the River Tamar, the traditional border between Devon and Cornwall. After they were retired from service, William IV and the other figureheads were stored in various locations, sometimes exposed to the elements. In the 1950s or 60s, while at the Devonport Naval Heritage Centre, some were given a coating of fibreglass to help protect them.

It is the figure of a bearded river god with a laurel wreath adorning its head. Three specialist conservation teams in Devon, Cornwall and London, led by Orbis Conservation, have spent more than two years painstakingly restoring the figureheads. Another challenge was restoring the colour of the carvings. Experts carried out microscopic analysis of the paint the figureheads had been decorated with over the years.

      "bodyText": "Renewable energy sources provided more electricity to UK homes and businesses than fossil fuels for the first time over the last quarter, according to new research. The renewables record was set in the third quarter of this year after its share of the electricity mix rose to 40%. It is the first time that electricity from British windfarms, solar panels and renewable biomass plants has surpassed fossil fuels since the UK\u2019s first power plant fired up in 1882. The new milestone confirms predictions made by National Grid that 2019 will be the first year since the Industrial Revolution that zero-carbon electricity \u2013 renewables and nuclear \u2013 overtakes gas and coal-fired power. A string of new offshore windfarms built this year helped nudge renewables past fossil fuels, which made up 39% of UK electricity, in a crucial tipping point in Britain\u2019s energy transition. Fossil fuels made up four-fifths of the country\u2019s electricity fewer than 10 years ago, split between gas and coal, but the latest analysis by Carbon Brief shows that coal-fired power was less than 1% of all electricity generated. British coal plants are shutting down ahead of a 2025 ban. By next spring just four coal plants will remain in the UK: the West Burton A and Ratcliffe-on-Soar plants in Nottinghamshire, Kilroot in Northern Ireland and two generation units at the Drax site in North Yorkshire, which are earmarked for conversion to burn gas. Gas-fired power makes up the bulk of the dwindling share of fossil fuels in the energy system at 38%. Nuclear power provided slightly less than a fifth of the UK\u2019s electricity in the last quarter, the report said. Wind power is the UK\u2019s strongest source of renewable energy and made up 20% of the UK\u2019s electricity following a series of major windfarm openings in recent years. Electricity from renewable biomass plants made up 12% of the energy system, while solar panels contributed 6%. The world\u2019s largest offshore windfarm, the Hornsea One project, began generating electricity off the Yorkshire coast in February, reaching a peak capacity of 1,200MW in October. It followed the opening of the Beatrice windfarm off the north-east coast of Scotland over the summer. Together these schemes almost doubled the 2,100MW worth of offshore capacity which began powering homes in 2018. Kwasi Kwarteng, the minister for energy and clean growth, said the renewables record is \u201cyet another milestone on our path towards ending our contribution to climate change altogether by 2050\u201d. He said: \u201cAlready, we\u2019ve cut emissions by 40% while growing the economy by two thirds since 1990. Now, with more offshore wind projects on the way at record low prices we plan to go even further and faster in the years to come.\u201d Luke Clark, of Renewable UK, said the industry hopes to treble the size of its offshore wind sector by 2030 to generate more than a third of the UK\u2019s electricity. Under the Labour party\u2019s plans for Green Industrial Revolution the offshore wind industry would grow five-fold in a decade, with the addition of an extra 37 giant offshore windfarms and 70,000 new jobs. According to Renewable UK, the growth of the renewables industry is good news for energy bills, as well as the environment, due to the steep fall in the cost of wind and solar power technologies over recent years. \u201cThe cost of new offshore wind projects, for example, has just fallen to an all-time low, making onshore and offshore wind our lowest-cost large scale power sources,\u201d Clark said. The next generation of offshore windfarms is expected to cost about \u00a340 for every megawatt hour of electricity generated, less than the average market price for electricity on the wholesale energy markets. \u201cIf government were to back a range of technologies \u2013 like onshore wind and marine renewables \u2013 in the same way as it is backing offshore wind, consumers and businesses would be able to fully reap the benefits of the transition to a low carbon economy,\u201d Clark said. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 October 2019 because an earlier version said the Hornsea One project was off the Norfolk coast, when the Yorkshire coast was meant. This has been corrected.",

Cech was frustrated with the manner of the first goal he conceded given the puck squirmed in at his near post but, ultimately, this was a day for him to remember and one he wants to build on while continuing his duties as a technical and performance advisor at Stamford Bridge. \u201cIt was a childhood dream for me to play even one game of ice hockey,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve done that now and nobody can take that from me.\u201d",

England advanced as Pool C winners by virtue of the match against France on Saturday being cancelled, cruising through to the last eight with comfortable bonus point wins against Tonga, USA and Argentina, who were down to 14 men early on.

      "body": "<p>Violent and sexual criminals as well as foreign national offenders who return to the UK will face drastically heavier penalties under measures that will form the centrepiece of a Queen\u2019s speech aimed at wresting the agenda away from the delicate Brexit negotiations.</p> \n<p>With just days to go before the deadline for Boris Johnson to clinch a last-ditch Brexit deal in Brussels, the Queen will on Monday set out his government\u2019s priorities for a new session of parliament, including 22 new bills.</p> \n<p>But with MPs deadlocked over Brexit, few at Westminster believe a general election will be long in coming \u2013 and the Conservatives hope the policies will form the basis of their campaign.</p> \n<p>Under the proposals, violent and sexual offenders will serve a minimum of two-thirds of their sentence before becoming eligible to be released on licence, compared with half under current guidelines. But there were warnings from prison reformers that the plans could put staff in danger by taking away hope from inmates.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, amid claims from the home secretary, Priti Patel, that the UK has been a \u201csoft touch on foreign criminals\u201d for too long, maximum sentences for foreign nationals who breach a deportation order will be \u201cdrastically increased\u201d from the present six months.</p> \n<p>Critics of the proposals, including prison reform charities, have already warned they will impose extra pressure on overcrowded jails and that the public is being misled into believing sentencing policy is softer than it really is. Criminal barristers point out most serious offenders are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/02/tories-tough-talk-crime-shameless-cynical-justice\">not automatically released</a> at the halfway point in their sentence.</p> \n<p>The emphasis on harsher punishment is being urged on a criminal justice system that has been chronically underfunded since 2010 and in which ministers are accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/23/barristers-accuse-moj-false-economies-crown-court-backlogs\">refusing to tackle the existing backlog of cases</a>.</p> \n<p>But Conservative strategists believe the move will appeal to voters in Labour-held seats who are believed to be sympathetic to a tougher line on law and order. The same voters are being targeted with extra spending set aside for schools and hospitals after almost a decade of austerity, and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/30/conservatives-pledge-raise-national-living-wage-by-2024\">recently</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/30/conservatives-pledge-raise-national-living-wage-by-2024\"> announced increase in the minimum wage</a>. At the Conservative conference in Manchester, ministers repeatedly called those plans the \u201cpeople\u2019s priorities\u201d.</p> \n<p>The changes to sentencing policy were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/30/conservatives-scrap-automatic-early-release-prisoners-england-wales\">outlined by the justice secretary</a>, Robert Buckland, last month.</p> \n<p>He announced that offenders guilty of violent and sexual crimes that carry a maximum sentence of life \u2013 such as manslaughter, rape, and grievous bodily harm \u2013 and who are sentenced to at least four years in prison will be required to serve two-thirds of the sentence in prison before being released on licence.</p> \n<p>Targeting foreign national offenders who attempt to re-enter the UK after they have served their sentence and been deported is expected to affect an estimated 400 individuals a year, according to the government.</p> \n<p>Priti Patel, who is emerging as one of the most hardline home secretaries in many years, said the new sentencing measures would \u201cmake our country safer\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have been a soft touch on foreign criminals for too long,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sentence for breaching a deportation order is far too low at the moment and many criminals conclude that it\u2019s worth trying to get back in the country when all you get is a slap on the wrist. Deterring foreign criminals from re-entering the country and putting those that do behind bars for longer will make our country safer.\u201d</p> \n<p>In her party conference speech in Manchester, Patel said the Tories\u2019 message to criminals was: \u201cwe are coming for you\u201d.</p> \n<p>But her Labour shadow, Diane Abbott, said it was the Tories who had been soft on crime by relentlessly cutting funding for police and the criminal justice system.</p> \n<p>\u201cPriti Patel is right that the Tories have been a soft touch for criminals, with policies that predictably led to more crime. We always argued that cuts have consequences, and now the Tories are trying to pretend the consequences have nothing to do with them,\u201d Abbott said.</p> \n<p>She added: \u201cThis Queen\u2019s speech is farcical. It is just an uncosted wish list which the government has no intention and no means to deliver, and nothing more than a pre-election party political broadcast.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/13/conservatives-accused-of-election-rigging-leaked-id-plans-voter-fraud\">Conservatives accused of election rigging over leaked photo ID plans</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Frances Crook, chief executive from the Howard League for Penal Reform, said the sentencing changes were not \u201ca sensible, evidence-based policy\u201d. She said: \u201cIt is the politics of the lynch mob \u2026 this is about making people spend more time in prison, which will affect thousands of men and will probably put staff in danger by taking hope away from people. We already know that prisoners are in appalling conditions, with a lot of violence, injury and suicides. A lot of it is directed at staff.

      "bodyText": "Violent and sexual criminals as well as foreign national offenders who return to the UK will face drastically heavier penalties under measures that will form the centrepiece of a Queen\u2019s speech aimed at wresting the agenda away from the delicate Brexit negotiations. With just days to go before the deadline for Boris Johnson to clinch a last-ditch Brexit deal in Brussels, the Queen will on Monday set out his government\u2019s priorities for a new session of parliament, including 22 new bills. But with MPs deadlocked over Brexit, few at Westminster believe a general election will be long in coming \u2013 and the Conservatives hope the policies will form the basis of their campaign. Under the proposals, violent and sexual offenders will serve a minimum of two-thirds of their sentence before becoming eligible to be released on licence, compared with half under current guidelines. But there were warnings from prison reformers that the plans could put staff in danger by taking away hope from inmates. Meanwhile, amid claims from the home secretary, Priti Patel, that the UK has been a \u201csoft touch on foreign criminals\u201d for too long, maximum sentences for foreign nationals who breach a deportation order will be \u201cdrastically increased\u201d from the present six months. Critics of the proposals, including prison reform charities, have already warned they will impose extra pressure on overcrowded jails and that the public is being misled into believing sentencing policy is softer than it really is. Criminal barristers point out most serious offenders are not automatically released at the halfway point in their sentence. The emphasis on harsher punishment is being urged on a criminal justice system that has been chronically underfunded since 2010 and in which ministers are accused of refusing to tackle the existing backlog of cases. But Conservative strategists believe the move will appeal to voters in Labour-held seats who are believed to be sympathetic to a tougher line on law and order. The same voters are being targeted with extra spending set aside for schools and hospitals after almost a decade of austerity, and a recently announced increase in the minimum wage. At the Conservative conference in Manchester, ministers repeatedly called those plans the \u201cpeople\u2019s priorities\u201d. The changes to sentencing policy were outlined by the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, last month. He announced that offenders guilty of violent and sexual crimes that carry a maximum sentence of life \u2013 such as manslaughter, rape, and grievous bodily harm \u2013 and who are sentenced to at least four years in prison will be required to serve two-thirds of the sentence in prison before being released on licence. Targeting foreign national offenders who attempt to re-enter the UK after they have served their sentence and been deported is expected to affect an estimated 400 individuals a year, according to the government. Priti Patel, who is emerging as one of the most hardline home secretaries in many years, said the new sentencing measures would \u201cmake our country safer\u201d. \u201cWe have been a soft touch on foreign criminals for too long,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sentence for breaching a deportation order is far too low at the moment and many criminals conclude that it\u2019s worth trying to get back in the country when all you get is a slap on the wrist. Deterring foreign criminals from re-entering the country and putting those that do behind bars for longer will make our country safer.\u201d In her party conference speech in Manchester, Patel said the Tories\u2019 message to criminals was: \u201cwe are coming for you\u201d. But her Labour shadow, Diane Abbott, said it was the Tories who had been soft on crime by relentlessly cutting funding for police and the criminal justice system. \u201cPriti Patel is right that the Tories have been a soft touch for criminals, with policies that predictably led to more crime. We always argued that cuts have consequences, and now the Tories are trying to pretend the consequences have nothing to do with them,\u201d Abbott said. She added: \u201cThis Queen\u2019s speech is farcical. It is just an uncosted wish list which the government has no intention and no means to deliver, and nothing more than a pre-election party political broadcast.\u201d Frances Crook, chief executive from the Howard League for Penal Reform, said the sentencing changes were not \u201ca sensible, evidence-based policy\u201d. She said: \u201cIt is the politics of the lynch mob \u2026 this is about making people spend more time in prison, which will affect thousands of men and will probably put staff in danger by taking hope away from people. We already know that prisoners are in appalling conditions, with a lot of violence, injury and suicides. A lot of it is directed at staff. It\u2019s very irresponsible.\u201d She later tweeted: \u201cDesperate and weak governments always try to curry favour by stirring up hate, increasing punishment is a race to the bottom of politics, particularly as it flies in the face of evidence and won\u2019t protect victims.\u201d Other new laws expected to be laid out in the speech include the requirement for voters to present photo ID \u2013 a measure Labour has warned amounts to \u201cvoter suppression\u201d; scrapping rail franchising; and a new environment bill, setting binding targets on reducing plastic and other forms of pollution. There will also be several Brexit-related pieces of legislation, including the institution of a new \u201cpoints-based\u201d immigration regime from 2021. The Queen will deliver the speech from a throne in the House of Lords, after processing from Buckingham Palace to Westminster in a carriage, amid the traditional pomp of a state opening of parliament. Johnson\u2019s government suspended parliament last week, to prepare for Monday\u2019s speech. A longer planned shutdown, from early September, was struck down by the supreme court amid fears that it would stifle debate on Brexit. MPs are expected to debate the measures outlined in the speech for up to five days, and will then hold a vote \u2013 which Johnson could lose. He has lost seven votes in parliament since becoming prime minister in July, and won none. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, losing a vote on a Queen\u2019s speech is no longer formally a no-confidence vote, but it would be expected to increase the intense pressure on Johnson\u2019s fragile administration. The extra demands imposed on the justice system follow a period during which the Ministry of Justice, which oversees the courts and prisons, has suffered deeper budget cuts \u2013 40% since 2010 \u2013 than any other Whitehall department. Reductions in the number of judicial sitting days in order to make short-term savings have added to frustrations among lawyers. A pledge to give police powers to arrest fugitives on the basis of an Interpol red notice without having to apply for a warrant will set a new precedent. Critics have warned some countries will abuse the system by targeting political opponents. The government said the scheme will initially apply to a only few trusted countries: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the US, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. The Queen\u2019s speech proposals on the domestic abuse bill may be more broadly welcomed, with a proposal to allow victims to testify via video-link rather than in person. Campaigners have been urging the government to deliver on its long-delayed pledge on banning the cross-examination in court of victims of abuse by perpetrators in domestic abuse cases.",

Three games, then. Three games for Wales to qualify for another European Championship: Croatia at home tonight, then Azerbaijan (A) and Hungary (H) next month. If they win the lot they will be at Euro 2020, although there\u2019s a credible scenario whereby two wins is enough.</p> <p>It\u2019s all pretty complicated, but in essence a draw tonight would be a very good result for Wales, never mind a win, and even defeat would not completely crush the dreams of small children who were too young for Euro 2016 and dream of seeing their side at a major tournament. </p> <p>Although Wales are playing the World Cup finalists, and are without the injured Aaron Ramsey, they will quietly fancy their chances tonight. Their home record under Ryan Giggs is pretty solid, even if the performances haven\u2019t always been convincing, while Croatia\u2019s away form in this group hasn\u2019t been great. They hammered Slovakia 4-0, sure, bring that up if you must, but they also lost in Hungary and drew in Azerbaijan.</p> <p>Those results mean they can\u2019t take anything for granted in this group. A win tonight would ensure qualification for Euro 2020; a defeat would leave them vulnerable to a potential sting when they host Slovakia in their final game. </p> <p><strong>Kick off is</strong> at 7.45pm. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-13T17:16:17.079Z\">at 6.16pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Here is Ben Fisher\u2019s report: Here\u2019s Dan James \u201cWe knew it would be tough. There were a few tackles flying in but you expect that in these games. I\u2019m fine \u2013 he caught me in the head but I didn\u2019t get knocked out unfortunately \u2026 fortunately, sorry! We showed character to come from behind and it\u2019s a good result against a great team. So, Wales earn an honourable draw against Croatia in a bruising game of few chances. Gareth Bale scored a masterful equaliser just before half-time after an early goal from Nikola Vlasic; and though Bale\u2019s goal should have been ruled out for a foul by Ben Davies in the build-up, Wales deserved their draw on the balance of play. The result means Wales should - should - qualify if they win their last two group matches against Azerbaijan (A) and Hungary (H). But it is, for the first time, out of their hands. If Slovakia win their last two matches, at home to Azerbaijan and away to Croatia, Wales will be out. Peep peep! 90+8 min Vlasic grossly overhits a through pass to Perisic. Had he weighted it correctly, Perisic would have been clear on goal. In his defence, the angles meant there was almost no margin for error. 90+6 min James is booked, a little harshly, for an aerial challenge on Jedvaj. 90+5 min One thing in Wales\u2019 favour is that Croatia play their last group game before Hungary - in other words, they will need a point at home to Slovakia to be certain of qualification. And if they get that, Wales will qualify if they win away to Azerbaijan and at home to Hungary. They\u2019dve took it. 90+4 min Croatia have completely dominated possession for the last 20 minutes, though their domination has been entirely sterile. In fact, I don\u2019t think Wayne Hennessey has made a save since Perisic\u2019s header in the 13th minute. 90+2 min Bale can barely move. He\u2019s still on the pitch, but all he can really do is hop. It\u2019s been a bruising game for both teams. 90 min The injured Modric is replaced by Milan Badelj. There will be eight minutes of added time. Bale is also limping heavily; Wales have used all their subs. 88 min Connor Roberts has a close-range shot blocked by Jedvaj. The chance came after an exhilarating run from Wilson, who was then flattened by Modric. The ball ran through to Tyler Roberts, who in turn picked out Connor Roberts. Modric is booked; both he and Wilson are still down. 86 min Kieffer Moore, who worked very hard without much reward, is replaced by Tyler Roberts. 86 min Allen is booked for a kick at Brekalo, who was leading a Croatia break. That means he\u2019ll miss next month\u2019s match in Azerbaijan. 85 min Rakitic is booked for a late lunge at Wilson. 84 min It increasingly looks like both teams have settled for a draw; or, at least, that they aren\u2019t willing to take any risks in pursuit of victory. 83 min James makes good ground down the left, only to slice his cross out of play. The Wales attackers look tired. 80 min Wales need to be careful as Croatia are starting to pin them back. It\u2019s harmless possession at the moment, at least. 77 min Croatia have had more of the ball in the last five minutes. It\u2019s so delicately poised, and neither side knows whether to stick or twist. A draw is a decent enough result for both; a win would be pure gold. 75 min \u201cNo shame in Williams\u2019 performance,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cWhen it comes to Wales, no one but Ramsey is truly \u2018Ramseyish.\u2019 Otherwise, 2016 would have been even better.\u201d 73 min A draw would be a pretty good result for Wales. If it stays like this, they will qualify if they win their last two games unless Slovakia are victorious away to Croatia. 72 min Jedvaj, teed up by Rebic 20 yards from goal, spins a sweet shot with the outside of the right foot that drifts a few yards wide. Hennessexy had it covered. 70 min Perisic is lucky not to be booked for a foul on the breaking Wilson. 68 min Another Wales change: Harry Wilson replaces Jonny Williams, who did some nice things without quite having a Ramseyish influence. 68 min \u201cI know the Guardian does not encourage violence to either fish or full-back,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cBut just in case memories of Joe Jordan have faded here\u2019s a refresher.\u201d 67 min Apart from the first 15 minutes, Wales have been the equal of the World Cup finalists. There\u2019s merit in that, for all the frustration over Giggs\u2019s tactics. 66 min \u201cJust curious,\u201d says Bob Kenyon. \u201cDo you take the time to make every mention of Wales a link to a webpage, or does it happen by magic?\u201d The latter. In fact, I had no idea it happened. 65 min After a fine move from Croatia, Perisic\u2019s dangerous cutback is crucially cleared by Roberts. 64 min If Croatia draw tonight, they will need a draw in their final game at home to Slovakia to be sure of qualifying. It\u2019s a bit too close for comfort. 63 min Croatia make another change, with Ante Rebic replacing Bruno Petkovic. 61 min Bale goes on a scintillating run, beating Rakitic, Modric and Barisic before losing his balance just inside the area. There was a slight touch from Barisic, though Bale stayed on his feet and the only penalty appeals came from the crowd. 61 min This is anyone\u2019s game. Wales have played with greater snap since half-time. Ethan Ampadu, meanwhile, has just returned to the Wales bench after being assessed by the medical staff. 59 min \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cI feel a bit for Wales (and both Irish teams), what with their realistic prospects of qualification. There\u2019s a lot to be said for the Scottish method of total inadequacy, punctuated by the odd shellacking of a part-time pub team, with no chance of qualification, and therefore no resulting disappointment. The Manchester United of international football, if you will.\u201d That\u2019s a bit harsh on Chelsea. 58 min Moore is booked for a high tackle on Lovren. 57 min Perisic\u2019s dangerous cross from the right hits the arm of Jedvaj. Kuipers awards a free-kick to Wales, which is a relief to those with memories of Joe Jordan. 55 min Wales are having a fine spell. James runs at Lovren on the left side of the box, shifts the ball down the line and cracks a shot from a tight angle that is blocked by Livakovic. He couldn\u2019t hold it but there were no Wales players around to take advantage. 53 min \u201cFor a man who only played under Alex Ferguson at club level, it\u2019s odd that the main feature of Giggs\u2019 team is players looking to pass sideways or backwards at the first opportunity,\u201d says Jonny Bull. \u201cWales thrived under Speed and Coleman, who set the team up to emphasise their strengths. The flashes of quality this team shows seem to come when they don\u2019t follow the plan.\u201d It\u2019s odd \u2013 I would have bet my dignity on a Giggs team playing with aggression and high tempo. 51 min I forgot to say, because of that Ampadu injury, that Ivan Rakitic replaced the injured Mateo Kovacic at half-time. 50 min \u201cWell,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cIf there\u2019s going to be controversy, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d rather the moral ambiguity of a foul-not-given over Lawrence potentially coming on and making a difference.\u201d 49 min Ampadu is helped from the field, not on a stretcher, and Morrell replaces him. 48 min Ampadu is still down, and a stretcher is being brought onto the pitch. Lincoln\u2019s Joe Morrell is getting ready to replace him. I\u2019m not sure whether Ampadu was injured by the contact with Petkovic of the landing. 46 min Petkovic is booked after 15 seconds of the second half for flattening Ampadu as the pair jumped for a high ball. That three-touch finish from Bale gets better every time you see it. His touch and awareness in such a tight space - and under such pressure - were so classy. It was definitely a foul by Davies in the build-up; he got the ball, but came through Kovacic to get it. Half-time reading \u201cFail to see how not pressing the opposition at all in their half when you basically need to win is a good idea, especially when they are leaving Modric free rein,\u201d says Nick Goolding. \u201cGreat equaliser though - looked like Ben Davies didn\u2019t get the memo and went on a rampage.\u201d Peep peep! Gareth Bale\u2019s superb - and controversial - injury-time equaliser has changed the mood in Cardiff. Croatia were comfortable through the first half, and deservedly led through Nikola Vlasic\u2019s early goal. 45+6 min Croatia finally kick off. Kovacic has limped off in a manner which suggests we won\u2019t see him for the second half. 45+5 min Lovren has been booked for dissent. Croatia still haven\u2019t kicked off because of the Kovacic injury. 45+5 min Kovacic is still down, having been clattered by Davies in the build up. Davies charged forward from the halfway line and slid the ball towards Bale on the edge of the box. He couldn\u2019t control it, but Davies won the loose ball with a very strong - and probably illegal - tackle on Kovacic 30 yards from goal. Then he got his head up and slid a fine angled pass to Bale just inside the box, to the left of centre. He controlled it deftly on the run, moved it away from Lovren and slid a precise low shot across Livakovic. That was classily taken by Bale, because he had very little space in which to work. All three touches were immaculate. Superb goal! Croatia will be fuming but it was beautifully taken. 45 min There will be four minutes of added time. 44 min Modric, for the umpteen hundredth time in his career, has had the most touches of anyone on the field. It\u2019s his game; the other 21 just play in it. 42 min Wales need more from James and especially Bale, who looks nowhere near his awesome best. 37 min Petkovic wins a ... goalkick for Wales. That should have been a corner. 35 min Although Wales are playing better, they can\u2019t lay a glove on the Croatia defence. Kieffer Moore, who had such a fine full debut against Slovakia, hasn\u2019t seen much of the ball tonight. 33 min \u201cHey Rob,\u201d says J.R. in Illinois. \u201cI\u2019ll preface this by saying I\u2019m not a doctor but there is no way Daniel James should be playing right now and there\u2019s no way he was adequately tested for a concussion in a couple minutes on the pitch. He was unconscious. Here in the U.S. the announcer, Taylor Twellman, who knows a thing or two about concussions, said the decision to let James keep playing was \u2018disgusting\u2019 and I agree with him. European football is for some reason lagging behind on this issue.\u201d I don\u2019t know enough \u2013 about concussions, never mind this specific incident \u2013 to comment. It\u2019s so easy to say it\u2019s disgusting, etc, etc, and I don\u2019t doubt there have been examples of players being allowed back on the field when they should not have been. But I suspect there have been many more examples of decent, experienced medical professionals being abused without just cause. 30 min There\u2019s a break in play because of a pitch invasion. The gentleman in question, his trousers so low that all concerned can appreciate his red underpants with white band, is now being bundled off the field. You 29 min A quiet period in the game. It\u2019s a more even contest now, though Wales have yet to create a serious chance. 26 min Kovacic plays a nice short pass to Perisic, who is in the act of shooting when Davies comes on the blindside to make a vital interception. 22 min Davies wins a corner for Wales, who have come to life since James was flattened by Vida. Nothing comes of it but the last five minutes have been much more encouraging. 21 min \u201cAm I the only one who thinks that a team in red shouldn\u2019t be allowed to play a team in black?\u201d says Matt Burtz. \u201cThere\u2019s contrast with the numbers and the trim, sure, but at first glance it\u2019s not great. Oh, and as an Everton fan, the lack of playing time that Vlasic got, and then his quick loan and sale, leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\u201d It can\u2019t be much fun being the taste buds of an Everton fan. 20 min Bale rams his free-kick into the wall, flattening Petkoric in the process. The referee stops plays so that he can receive treatment. 19 min Modric is adjudged to have fouled Moore, 25 yards from goal. It looked soft, but Wales won\u2019t care if Bale roofs one from here. 18 min \u201cYou (quite understandably) didn\u2019t mention the League of Nations or Nations League or whatever it is playoff route to Euro 2020 in your preamble, but I think if Denmark qualify then Wales would be in the playoffs even if they finish 4th in their group,\u201d says Phil Grey. \u201cI could be wrong. I could be right.\u201d 16 min James gets to his feet, looking very groggy. He\u2019s going to continue, so I assume he has passed a concussion test. 15 min Vida is pretty lucky to get way with a yellow card. It was a flying knee in the head, basically, as James shaped to control a high ball. James is still being treated, though he is conscious. The immediate reaction from the Croatia players was really worrying. 14 min A horrible collision between James and Vida near the halfway line. This looks really nasty, and the physios were onto the field even before the referee had stopped play. One of the Croatia players was also frantically waving them on as he ran straight towards James. Vida has been booked, and James is still down receiving treatment. 13 min: Excellent save from Hennessey! Croatia are playing superbly. Petkovic, on the left wing, swings a long cross/pass over the Wales defence to find Perisic near the penalty spot. He flicks a header towards the bottom corner, and Hennessey scrambles to his left to push it round the post. I thought that was going to sneak in. 12 min If Wales lose tonight, they will only qualify if they win their last two games and Croatia win their final match at home to Slovakia. Not at all beyond the realms, although Croatia will already have qualified if they win this match. 11 min Bale cuts infield and hits a shot that is comfortably saved by Livakovic. A dreadful start for Wales. Brekalo surged down the left before moving infield, away from Lockyer. He pushed the ball back to Petkovic, who in turn teed up Vlasic on the edge of the box. His low shot, though not especially well struck, was precise enough to beat the diving Hennessey and go into the net off the post. One-nil! 8 min Wales appeal for a penalty when Lovren shoulder barges the charging James off the field. It was a risky challenge, that - probably not enough for a penalty, but it was close. 8 min Croatia continue to dominate, though everything has been in front of the Wales defence. 6 min A long ball is headed down by Petkovic to Brekalo, who slashes the bouncing ball well wide from 20 yards. 4 min It\u2019s been a confident, authoritative start from Croatia, with the first few minutes taking place almost exclusively in the Wales half. 1 min Peep peep! Croatia, in their dark blue and black away strip, kick off from right to left. Wales are in red. There\u2019s a storming atmosphere in Cardiff, as you\u2019d expect. The captains Gareth Bale and Luka Modric, team-mates for most of the last 11 years, embrace in the centre circle. \u201cPlease knock off the anti-Welsh stuff,\u201d says David Crouch. \u201cWelsh is not the language of animals.\u201d Unsubscribe. \u201cReit, mae\u2019r bechgyn rygbi wedi gwneud eu gwaith,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cNawr, dyma dro\u2019r bechgyn p\u00eal-droed.\u201d Funnily enough I just said exactly the same thing to my dog, P\u00eal-droed. Italy and Russia have qualified for Euro 2020. They join Belgium, who were the first team to confirm their place at next summer\u2019s jamboree. Hungary 1-0 Azerbaijan is the final score in Budapest. It seems Bahlul Mustafazade had an injury-time equaliser dubiously ruled out for handball. It doesn\u2019t change Wales\u2019 task, as they would have budgeted for a Hungary win, but it would have been a lovely boost going into the Croatia game. I\u2019m still trying to find out what happened in the Hungary match, but the official Uefa site briefly said it was 1-1. Hang on, it\u2019s been ruled out! Azerbaijan have scored an injury-time in equaliser in Hungary! That\u2019s a huge boost for Wales. Pre-match reading Wales are unchanged. Croatia are without Marcelo Brozovic, who is suspended, while Ivan Rakitic and Ante Rebic drop to the bench. Wales (4-2-3-1) Hennessey; Roberts, Rodon, Lockyer, Davies; Allen, Ampadu; Bale, J Williams, James; Moore. Substitutes: Ward, Davies, Gunter, N Taylor, A Williams, Roberts, Vokes, Wilson, Morrell, Lawrence, Matondo, Vaulks. Croatia (4-2-3-1) Livakovic; Jedvaj, Lovren, Vida, Barisic; Modric, Kovacic; Perisic, Vlasic, Brekalo; Petkovic. Substitutes: Kalinic, Sluga, Melnjak, Peric, Rakitic, Orsic, Bradaric, Skoric, Pasalic, Rebic, Badelj, Bartolec. Referee Bjorn Kuipers (Netherlands). Hello. Three games, then. Three games for Wales to qualify for another European Championship: Croatia at home tonight, then Azerbaijan (A) and Hungary (H) next month. If they win the lot they will be at Euro 2020, although there\u2019s a credible scenario whereby two wins is enough. It\u2019s all pretty complicated, but in essence a draw tonight would be a very good result for Wales, never mind a win, and even defeat would not completely crush the dreams of small children who were too young for Euro 2016 and dream of seeing their side at a major tournament. Although Wales are playing the World Cup finalists, and are without the injured Aaron Ramsey, they will quietly fancy their chances tonight. Their home record under Ryan Giggs is pretty solid, even if the performances haven\u2019t always been convincing, while Croatia\u2019s away form in this group hasn\u2019t been great. They hammered Slovakia 4-0, sure, bring that up if you must, but they also lost in Hungary and drew in Azerbaijan. Those results mean they can\u2019t take anything for granted in this group. A win tonight would ensure qualification for Euro 2020; a defeat would leave them vulnerable to a potential sting when they host Slovakia in their final game. Kick off is at 7.45pm.",

I don\u2019t know how far we\u2019ll go \u2026 but we can dream.\u201d Emily Finch, an Anglo-Japanese woman who travelled from London to watch the rugby, said: \u201cIt was an incredibly stressful morning after the typhoon wondering if the Japan vs Scotland match could actually happen or not. I don\u2019t think we found out until around 11 am if the match would actually go ahead and I\u2019d come all the way to Japan for just two games so I would have been devastated if Japan didn\u2019t play today. \u201cI can\u2019t describe how happy I am to see Japan win against Scotland, especially as Japan is not an old rugby nation and are the underdogs. Scotland played well but Japan just seemed to want victory so much more and ultimately annihilated them. I cannot be happier. \u201cBeing half-Japanese half-British myself, it\u2019s fantastic to see the whole country back such a diverse Japanese team. It truly shows Japan is starting to change their definition of what it means to be actually \u2018Japanese\u2019 and accept all kind of backgrounds into their country. \u201cMy dad bought the tickets for this match last year but he sadly died unexpectedly in May and he couldn\u2019t make it so I came in his place with his best mate. He would have loved watching Japan beat Scotland.\u201d Japanese fans were already mingling with Scotsmen in kilts and posing for photographs outside the stadium a couple of hours after World Rugby announced that the match would go ahead. There was no such reprieve for the northeastern town of Kamaishi, where flooding had left the organisers with no choice but to cancel the lunchtime game between Canada and Namibia. It was a cruel blow for the town, whose involvement in the tournament is inextricably linked with another natural disaster \u2013 the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, in which almost 19,000 people died, including more than 1,000 in Kamaishi. With their match at the Recovery Memorial Stadium cancelled, Canadian players grabbed shovels and helped clear the mud from Kamaishi\u2019s streets. Residents flew fishermen\u2019s flags at 12.15pm, the time the match should have kicked off, while volunteers repaired the fan zone to ensure it was ready for Japan\u2019s evening kick-off against with Scotland. The match may have been called off, \u201cbut the amazing people here aren\u2019t letting that ruin things! They are rebuilding the Fan Zone, as I type, for the community to come together and continue celebrating,\u201d tweeted Jennifer Nieuwendyk, a Canadian rugby fan. In Yokohama, the talk among home supporters was of resilience and the potential for sport to lift the gloom, even for a couple of hours. Japan had fought for their win beneath clear skies, but on a day that had begun with news of the death and destruction Typhoon Hagibis had left in its wake. World Rugby attempted to reassure visiting fans about large amounts of water that had built up around the stadium, which is located within the city\u2019s engineered flood defences. \u201cThis is normal and should not alarm fans,\u201d the governing body said in a statement. Masaya Nara, a Yokohama resident who was at the match with his son, said: \u201cI understand why some people felt it was inappropriate to hold the match here after the typhoon, and I wondered if perhaps I felt the same way. But for the same reason it\u2019s important for Japan to win and give people heart \u2026 you can see it from both sides.\u201d Fittingly, the teams\u2019 first duty once they entered the stadium was to observe a moment\u2019s silence for the 25 people then reported to have died in the typhoon. Bill Beaumont, the World Rugby chairman, said in a statement: \u201cOn behalf of World Rugby, our thoughts and sympathies are with everyone in Japan at this difficult time. \u201cJapan has proven to be the warmest, the best of Rugby World Cup hosts. We stand together with you in solidarity. Such devastation and threat to human life places everything into perspective and, while we have been doing everything we can to ensure \u2026 matches take place as scheduled, the bigger picture of wellbeing and safety is far more important.\u201d Like many other travelling fans, Scotland supporter Chris McGill, who was combining rugby matches with a business trip, had set his alarm early to wait for World Rugby\u2019s announcement. \u201cWhen there was an earthquake in Tokyo as well as the typhoon I thought, now it\u2019s going to be an act of God that sends us home,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to say that the Japanese authorities have done a great job, but your heart has to go out to the people who have been affected by the typhoon.\u201d As Japan\u2019s players hugged each other and shook the hands of the team they had sent out of the tournament, the crowd stayed on their feet and clapped their way through the J-pop hit Rising Sun. After another breathtaking night for Japanese and World Cup rugby, Michael Leitch and his team must now answer the question: how high can the sun go?",

With Pompeo\u2019s irritation increasingly visible, Amons asked if he had met Rudy Giuliani on a visit to Warsaw this year. The former New York mayor is commonly described as Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer although it is not clear what legal work he might do for the president.

The US had come to believe the Kurds are attempting to \u201ccut a deal\u201d with the Syrian army and Russia to counter the invading Turks, Esper said. As a result, Trump \u201cdirected that we begin a deliberate withdrawal of forces from northern Syria\u201d. On Sunday afternoon, Syrian state media said units from President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s army were moving north to \u201cconfront Turkish aggression on Syrian territory\u201d. In tweets on Sunday, Trump said: \u201cVery smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change \u2026 Others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them!\u201d Esper said he would not discuss a timeline for the US pullback, but said it would be done \u201cas safely and quickly as possible\u201d. He did not say how many US troops would leave the north, but said they represented most of the troops in Syria. The Pentagon had said before the Turkish operation began that the US military would not support it, and the US pulled about 30 special operations troops out of observation posts along the invasion route on the Syrian border. Esper said he was aware of reports of hundreds of Isis prisoners escaping as a result of the Turkish invasion and of atrocities being committed against Syrian Kurds by members of a Turkish-supported Syrian Arab militia. \u201cIt gets worse by the hour,\u201d Esper said. \u201cThese are all the exact things\u201d that US officials warned Erdo\u011fan would probably happen if he ignored US urgings not to invade northern Syria. More than 130,000 people have been displaced from rural areas around Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ayn as a result of the fighting, the United Nations said on Sunday. Eliot Engel, the Democratic chair of the House foreign affairs committee, told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press he could \u201cthink of nothing more disgusting in all the years I\u2019ve been in Congress than what this president is allowing to happen with the Kurds. \u201cThey have been our loyal and faithful allies for so many years, and after this, who again would trust the United States to be an ally of them?\u201d Esper said there was \u201cno way\u201d US forces could have stopped the Turks, who assembled a force of about 15,000 on the Syrian border, supported by air power. \u201cWe did not sign up to fight Turkey, a longstanding Nato ally, on behalf of the [Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces]. This is a terrible situation,\u201d he said. The Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, held out the possibility of quick action to impose sanctions on Turkey, a move Trump has threatened if the Turks push too far. \u201cWe\u2019ll be taking in new information and we\u2019re ready to go at a moment\u2019s notice to put on sanctions,\u201d Mnuchin told ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cNow we have warned the Turks \u2026 They know what we will do if they don\u2019t stop these activities.\u201d Trump tweeted that he was dealing with Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican senator who has stringently criticised the withdrawal, \u201cand many members of Congress, including Democrats, about imposing powerful sanctions on Turkey. Treasury is ready to go, additional legislation may be sought. \u201cThere is great consensus on this. Turkey has asked that it not be done. Stay tuned!\u201d",

Dev absolutely could have given it more thrust and shimmy, but the music choice definitely lent itself to something cooler and more laid-back.

I\u2019m still processing the events of last night \u2013 I rewatched the dances this morning just to check I had my contact lenses in last night, and still think there was some VERY weird scoring going on. </p> <p>Which makes this evening a pretty interesting one \u2013 Alex and Neil and Will and Karen are at the bottom of the table, but there\u2019s a good chance the public vote will have saved Will for being incredibly inspiring and determined. I\u2019m sure Alex also picked up some bonus votes for getting a rough ride from the judges, but I\u2019m not sure it will be enough to keep her out of the dance off. David is probably safe this week, which leaves Chris, Dev and Emma W at the mercy of the public \u2013 Chris and Dev are both popular with the viewers, so I\u2019m putting my money on an Alex/Emma W dance-off, which Emma will probably win.</p> <p>Kick off is at 7.15pm, feel free to watch along as this theory is proved to be a load of old rubbish \u2013 if there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned from Strictly over the years, there\u2019s always at least one shock eviction that causes us all to throw our toys out of the pram.

      "bodyText": "Well that was quite the bombshell, I\u2019m not really sure what to say. Might go and throw some cushions. The Strictly journey is a rollercoaster, and (in the immortal words of Ronan Keating) we just have to ride it. I\u2019ll be back next week for another spin; thank you all for joining in, feel free to swing by Twitter @heidistephens if you want to air your views about this weekend\u2019s goings-on. Have a good week! Hx Dev and Dianne both look a bit shocked, but manage to say lovely things about each other before taking to the floor for their final dance to When You\u2019re Gone by Bryan Adams (featuring, very importantly, Mel C). As the song goes, things just feel so wrong. This is awful. Dev absolutely doesn\u2019t deserve to be kicked out in Week 4, I had him down as a shoo-in for the final. I know this is only a TV show, but I\u2019m really quite outraged on his behalf. This is even worse than Aston Merrygold 2017. Craig votes to save Emma and Aljaz (wait what), and Motsi does likewise. Bruno also saves Emma and Aljaz, which means DEV AND DIANNE are leaving the competition. OH MY LORD. This is a perfectly decent Jive from Emma but nothing exceptional, can\u2019t see how they\u2019ll survive this. I\u2019ll be sad to see Aljaz go, he\u2019s always a Strictly fave. Dev and Dianne first, in the first dance-off this year that isn\u2019t a done deal. It\u2019s quite stressful. Watching this Cha Cha again, the matching red outfits on a red background really don\u2019t help to showcase Dev\u2019s moves, particularly with Dianne spinning like a muppet in a car wash. Dev absolutely could have given it more thrust and shimmy, but the music choice definitely lent itself to something cooler and more laid-back. I really liked it. So who is it going to be? Emma had one more point on the scoreboard last night, although I\u2019d argue Dev\u2019s Cha Cha was undermarked and Emma\u2019s Jive was over. Surely the judges will save Dev, he\u2019s a FAR better dancer. So who is joining Emma and Aljaz in tonight\u2019s dance-off? Kelvin and Oti are safe (shame we don\u2019t get to watch that again), along with Mike and Katya (people\u2019s fave), Michelle and Giovanni and Alex and Neil! Which means DEV and DIANNE are in the dance-off. Wow. That\u2019s an absolute shocker. Ooh, Bruno is having his annual Californian sabbatical *winks to camera* next week, which means the legendary ALFONSO RIBEIRO will be in his chair. Motsi appears to have gaffer-taped her legs, I\u2019m worried about how she\u2019s going to get that off later. Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of Australian/New Zealand country crooner Keith Urban. According to the internet he\u2019s very big on the country music scene, and also married to Nicole Kidman. He\u2019s singing a song called Never Comin\u2019 Down. This is everything I know about Keith Urban, although he appears to have Mark Owen\u2019s hair from 2006. More results \u2013 Saffron and AJ are safe, along with Will and Janette and Emma and Anton. First couple in the bottom two: EMMA AND ALJAZ! As we thought, suspect they might be up against Alex and Neil. So who is safely through to next week? Chris and Karen are safe (see? Public LOVE him), along with Karim and Amy (obvs), Catherine and Johannes and David and Nadiya, who quite rightly looks thrilled. LAST NIGHT ON STRICTLY: a fever-dream jumble of weird music, testicle dresses, certifiable scoring and nanxiety. Nothing made sense, gapping and limited content were fine unless they weren\u2019t, mistakes and dodgy timing were rewarded with 9s and 10s, apart from when this was no longer OK. Kelvin and Oti did a Rumba and a nation turned its central heating down, and Johannes did a Charleston that I can\u2019t stop watching \u2013 I believe Catherine was there too but that\u2019s an unconfirmed rumour at this stage. I have absolutely no idea how tonight is going to pan out, but I have a very bad feeling about it. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in a hot pink pantsuit with a saggy bust, Claudia in a black pussy bow blouse that\u2019s a different shade of black from the trousers. Maybe this is cool now. And we\u2019re off! Tonight\u2019s opening pro dance takes place in a tanning booth, to \u2018I Wish You Well\u2019 by Sigala ft. Becky Hill. It\u2019s quite fierce and mostly hairography. Ooh, they\u2019ve all changed outfit! This week\u2019s Countryfile Casual Weatherperson is the lovely Sarah Keith-Lucas, looking delightful in a sensible navy/floral Joules combo and a pebbly Prue Leith necklace. Not nearly casual enough, I\u2019m afraid - Week 2\u2019s Ben Rich is still in pole position for the cover photo of the 2020 Countryfile Casual Weatherperson Calendar (all proceeds to Heidi\u2019s In Need Of A Holiday). Countryfile has gone full 999 Michael Buerk; crime is rife in rural villages. Apparently you nick a tractor to smash and grab a village cashpoint. Is everyone taking notes? Evening all, and welcome back to this week\u2019s Strictly results show! I\u2019m still processing the events of last night \u2013 I rewatched the dances this morning just to check I had my contact lenses in last night, and still think there was some VERY weird scoring going on. Which makes this evening a pretty interesting one \u2013 Alex and Neil and Will and Karen are at the bottom of the table, but there\u2019s a good chance the public vote will have saved Will for being incredibly inspiring and determined. I\u2019m sure Alex also picked up some bonus votes for getting a rough ride from the judges, but I\u2019m not sure it will be enough to keep her out of the dance off. David is probably safe this week, which leaves Chris, Dev and Emma W at the mercy of the public \u2013 Chris and Dev are both popular with the viewers, so I\u2019m putting my money on an Alex/Emma W dance-off, which Emma will probably win. Kick off is at 7.15pm, feel free to watch along as this theory is proved to be a load of old rubbish \u2013 if there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned from Strictly over the years, there\u2019s always at least one shock eviction that causes us all to throw our toys out of the pram. Could be this week, let\u2019s wait and see. Have managed to avoid spoilers so far! Thank you all for joining in with your comments, I\u2019ll be back here tomorrow for the Results Show at 7.15pm, so don\u2019t forget to come back. In the meantime you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens if you want to say hello. Enjoy the rest of your Saturday, and I\u2019ll see you tomorrow! Hx So that\u2019s it for the dancing, and the voting is now open! Karim and Amy and Kelvin and Oti are at the top of the leaderboard, with Alex and Neil and Will and Janette at the bottom. Scoring tonight was even more bonkers than usual, and the music choices were a bit crackers too. Time for a recap \u2013 my votes this evening would go to Emma and Anton, Kelvin and Oti and Dev and Dianne. Oh hang on, forgot Michelle. How many votes am I allowed? Who do you reckon for the bottom two? Tough one to call this week \u2013 feels like Chris and Karen and Alex and Neil might be a possibility, or maybe Emma and Aljaz? Could be any one of half a dozen couples this week, the mad scoring has thrown everything wide open. Scores: 9,10,9,10 \u2013 a total of 38 for Karim and Amy. Ditching the panda suit was a very good idea. Shirley thought it was an amazing close to the show \u2013 Karim kept the frame throughout. Bruno thought it had power, passion and precision, Karim killed it. Craig loved finally seeing a male celebrity lead and it was incredible. Motsi thought it was the best dance of the evening. I have no idea what\u2019s real any more. As expected, this has got plenty of attack from Karim \u2013 fast for a Tango and I\u2019m not sure this music works, but lovely quality of footwork and nice light and shade in the timing. Quite a lot of gapping, but impressive. And FINALLY it\u2019s KARIM AND AMY! This week they\u2019re dancing the Tango to \u2018Paradise\u2019 by George Ezra. I imagine paradise for Karim was getting out of that sweaty panda costume last week, then deleting all the weird emails from the furry community. Let\u2019s pretend that never happened. They\u2019re wrapping up tonight\u2019s show, which suggests this is going to be a bit special. Kids! Parents! DRINK! Scores: 7,8,9,9 \u2013 a total of 33 for Saffron and AJ. Motsi loved the vulnerability and the strength and poise Saffron showed. Shirley loved the music choice and the connection - Saffron executed it for her nanny (DRINK). Bruno thought Saffron and AJ were finally tuned to each other, it was inspired. Craig wanted more \u2013 it felt a bit mechanical in places but overall a really good dance. Should have danced round her nan. Grandparent hugs! DRINK. Fog drink! Bare feet drink! Face touching drink! This is proper contempo-waft, executed nicely by Saffron and AJ. Some lovely lifts, great storytelling and some really nice flow and footwork from Saffron. Pretty impressive, enjoyed that a LOT. Next up it\u2019s SAFFRON AND AJ! This week they\u2019re dancing a Couple\u2019s Choice Contemporary routine to \u2018Because You Loved Me\u2019 by Celine Dion. Bonus bingo drinks for bare feet, ankle fog and stroking each other\u2019s faces. YouTube followers, siblings, crying nan! DRINK EVERYTHING. Scores: 7,9,8,8 \u2013 a total of 32 for Mike and Katya. I have NO idea what\u2019s going on this evening, the scoring is insane. Craig thought it was fast and furious \u2013 he didn\u2019t love the comedy elements and Mike lost his posture and hold in places, but he\u2019s come into his own. Motsi loved the energy and the entertainment \u2013 Mike is a different man and the hard work has paid off. Shirley thought it had real sophistication and the end was genius. Bruno can finally see Magic Mike, which is not a thought I want to consider. Katya is weeping. Oh god, it\u2019s a skiffle version. Just when I thought it couldn\u2019t get any worse. Some decent Quickstep from Mike, but his frame is all over the shop and his toes point inwards. That said, this is a genuine improvement on previous weeks and we\u2019re starting to see some pretty good dancing from Mike. Good work. Three to go! It\u2019s time for MIKE AND KATYA! This week they\u2019re dancing the Quickstep to 80s dungaree bilgefest \u2018Come on Eileen\u2019 by Dexys Midnight Runners. Everyone has a song that makes them scramble to switch off the radio or escape to the bar at a wedding, and this is mine. Those opening violins induce an irrational loathing \u2013 the only thing I can imagine that would be worse is watching someone Quickstep to it, possibly twice in one weekend. I might have to mute this for a few minutes. Scores: 6,6,6,6 \u2013 a total of 24 for Will and Janette. Bruno could see how tough it was for Will, but he maintained the elegance although it lost the flow. Craig thought Will needs to soften his movements, but he agrees that Will\u2019s frame was good throughout. Motsi thought Will gave great partnership skills, and there was good expression in his upper body. Shirley loved Will\u2019s soft knees and he kept a great postural line \u2013 a great job. Janette has put together a classy routine for this Foxtrot, which works around Will\u2019s challenges and brings out the best in his personality. This is clearly a tricky dance for him, but he executes it really well and there\u2019s a lovely chemistry between these two. Nice. Next up it\u2019s WILL AND JANETTE! This week they\u2019re dancing the Foxtrot to \u2018Se\u00f1orita\u2019 By Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello. This has been my song of the summer, I absolutely love it. Feels like a Latin song though, intrigued to see how Janette has made this work as a Foxtrot. This is a HUGE challenge for Will, I\u2019m rooting for him. Message from my mum (not now family, I\u2019m busy) \u2013 \u201cmusic choices are crap tonight\u2026apart from Kelvin \u2013 wow!\u201d Calm down mum. Scores: 7,8,8,8 \u2013 a total of 31 for Michelle and Giovanni. Shirley thought it oozed sensuality, Michelle is a real rhythm dancer. Bruno was savouring the Latin flavour, which was full of colour and spice and gay abandon. Craig wanted more forward and back basics, but Michelle is a confident and comfortable dancer. Motsi was impressed with the speed of the dance, and Michelle attacked it \u2013 it was cheeky and hot. God that dress is disgusting, but Michelle is working it nonetheless. Some lovely Salsa basics from Michelle, and some nice quality to her footwork. Sadly I can\u2019t stop staring at the giant sparkly testicles on her chest. My daughter has just messaged me with \u201cevery time I see Emma and Aljaz I get a flash forward to our wedding\u201d. Hahaha. Are we there yet? Of course not, we haven\u2019t seen MICHELLE AND GIOVANNI! This week they\u2019re dancing the Salsa to \u2018Quimbara\u2019 by Johnny Pacheco and Celia Cruz. This is a proper Salsa tune, and we already know that Michelle has some serious moves. Have very high hopes for this \u2013 these two are rapidly shaping up to be my favourite Strictly in ages. Scores: 7,7,7,7 \u2013 a total of 28 for Emma and Aljaz. Motsi thought it had great energy and speed, and Shirley agrees \u2013 what an improvement. Bruno loved the confidence and Emma is staring to believe in herself. Craig thought it was fast and furious, and a huge improvement. I need to watch that again later, I thought it was a bit meh. So confused. Quite a lot of denim in this jive, but sadly not a huge amount of energy from Emma. She\u2019s got very decent footwork and lovely to see her personality shining through, it just all feels a bit\u2026lethargic. I need MORE. It\u2019s time for EMMA AND ALJA\u017d! This week they\u2019re dancing the Jive to \u2018Kids in America\u2019 by Kim Wilde. This dance could be a turning point for Emma (in either direction) \u2013 we\u2019ll see if she\u2019s got the stamina for an energetic Jive, and the performance skills to sell it convincingly. Right now I don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve seen the best of her. Scores: 9,9,9,9 \u2013 a total of 36 for Kelvin and Oti. Bruno, you gave that a 9 and David an 8? Are you on crack? Craig thought Kelvin was very much in touch with himself \u2013 it oozed masculinity and was FILTH. Motsi was \u2018hold on Kelvin, that\u2019s my sister, stop it\u2019, and it\u2019s \u2018finished Craig off\u2019 (woah steady on). Shirley doesn\u2019t know which bit to start with \u2013 she\u2019s never seen a Rumba like that and her temperature has gone through the roof. Bruno is basking in the afterglow and everyone\u2019s hyperventilating \u2013 the quality was excellent and Kelvin\u2019s hips are WEAPONS. Christ, I need a lie down. Hello Kelvin in your mesh shirt. This is my kind of Rumba, none of that platonic nonsense - Kelvin\u2019s face is absolute filth and there\u2019s some lovely shaping. I can take or leave the Rumba as a rule, but I\u2019ll take that several times over thanks *hyperventilates* Next up it\u2019s KELVIN AND OTI! This week they\u2019re dancing the Rumba to \u2018Ain\u2019t No Sunshine\u2019 by Bill Withers. We know Kelvin has Latin hips for days and can deliver a decent ballroom turn, but interesting to see if he can deliver a sensual, perfectly placed Rumba too. Drink the rest of the bottle if anyone mentions how hard this dance is for a man. Scores: 6,7,7,8 - a total of 28 for David and Nadiya. You\u2019ve GOT to be kidding me. Bruno thought that was a miraculous recovery \u2013 David was properly dancing and he\u2019s never seen a transformation like it. Craig agrees \u2013 David has picked himself up and finally arrived. Motsi doesn\u2019t think David deserves to be in the dance-off today, despite having seen less than half the dances. Shirley loves how David keeps coming back, and she\u2019s absolutely gobsmacked. Did I watch a different dance?? David really does scrub up quite nicely, doesn\u2019t he? Sadly it\u2019s somewhat spoiled by the dancing, which is all over the shop in places. He\u2019s trying his best and having a lovely time, but sadly the timing of this Quickstep needs a lot to be desired. That said, when he\u2019s on time there are some nice steps, and this dance has a lovely energy. Who\u2019s next? It\u2019s DAVID AND NADIYA! This week they\u2019re dancing the Quickstep to \u2018From Now On\u2019 by Hugh Jackman. This is not the quickest of Quickstep songs, which will hopefully help David get his limbs in some semblance of order. He\u2019s made a bit of progress in the last couple of weeks but remains the weakest dancer left in the competition \u2013 he\u2019s got a battle on his hands to stay out of the bottom two and I\u2019m not sure even Hugh Jackman levels of emoting can save him. Cute kids! DRINK! Scores: 4,6,6,7 \u2013 a total of 23 for Alex and Neil. Bit harsh from Craig. Shirley thought some of it looked a bit stiff, but Alex\u2019s frame is definitely getting better \u2013 not a major improvement since last week, but a bit. Bruno thought it was good to see Alex exploring different facets of her personality, but something went wrong. Craig thought the footwork was all over the shop and it looked like Alex was being thrown about a bit, but he loved the staccato and Alex\u2019s acting. Motsi agrees that Alex is improving, but she\u2019s being careful and needs to have more fun. I LOVE this look for Alex, it\u2019s very Vampy Duchess of Sussex. It\u2019s all a bit Paso at the start, but the Tango sections in hold look not bad at all \u2013 some nice heel leads from Alex and plenty of attack. She could definitely have given it more welly, but a really nice effort. Next up it\u2019s ALEX AND NEIL! This week they\u2019re dancing the Tango to \u2018Go Your Own Way\u2019 by Fleetwood Mac. Hopefully Alex\u2019s feet will go the way they\u2019re supposed to, and she can deliver dancefloor fierce \u2013 right now she seems far too ladylike for this Latin business. She and Neil have nice chemistry though, it\u2019s one of my favourite couplings this year. Shout out for Catherine\u2019s little boy! DRINK Scores: 6,8,8,8 \u2013 a total of 30 for Catherine and Johannes. Motsi thought Catherine kept it up and she loved the energy. Shirley thought it was a blast, a very good performance from Catherine. Bruno thought it was a pink explosion, and they couldn\u2019t have fitted anything else in. Craig thought the footwork was quite random and messy in places, and the swivel was haphazard. THANK YOU. So much hot pink, my eyes are hurting. This is a high speed version of Single Ladies, but Catherine is doing her best to keep up and Johannes is very clearly living his best life. A few timing issues and a bit messy in places, but nice swivel and good characterisation \u2013 sadly she starts to run out of puff towards the end, but a nice effort. It\u2019s time for CATHERINE AND JOHANNES! This week they\u2019re dancing the Charleston to \u2018Single Ladies\u2019 by Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Dani Harmer and Vincent did a Samba to this years ago, so I\u2019m kind of interested to see how it works as a Charleston. Mostly I think this is an excuse for Johannes to do some performative booty shaking, which I am very much here for *twerks on sofa * Scores: 6,7,7,7 - a total of 27 for Dev and Dianne. Craig liked the hip isolation, but not working correctly with a straight leg, he also wanted a bit more personality from Dev. Motsi thought Dev made it look easy, but Dev needs to have more fun with it. Shirley thought Dev needed more flow, he is the ultimate body dancer and needs to bear that in mind for future Latin dances. Bruno thought it was great quality, but ultimately Dev needs to learn how to sell it. This is all quite alarmingly red, but Dev has hips! It\u2019s not as fluid as we\u2019d like, but he\u2019s a lovely dancer to watch and it all feels quite effortlessly cool. Not everyone\u2019s cup of tea I imagine, but I really enjoyed that. Next up it\u2019s DEV AND DIANNE! This week they\u2019re dancing the Cha Cha to \u2018Dancing With a Stranger\u2019 by Sam Smith featuring Normani. I wasn\u2019t blown away by their Couple\u2019s Choice last week, although the judges absolutely loved it. I think part of the problem is I don\u2019t really get Couple\u2019s Choice and have no idea what amazing looks like, which is why I\u2019ve been liveblogging from my sofa in Wiltshire for the past ten years rather than sitting behind the judges\u2019 desk*. Anyway we haven\u2019t seen Dev do any Latin yet so let\u2019s see if he\u2019s got some hip action. If he has, he\u2019s an absolute contender for this year\u2019s Glitterball. *Possibly not the only reason. Scores: 8,9,9,9 - a total of 35 for Emma and Anton. That was for her nan, apparently. DRINK. Bruno thought it was their best dance yet \u2013 a beautiful interpretation of the character and he has goosebumps. Craig thought it was classy, super-stylish and gawgus. Motsi thought the dance spoke for itself \u2013 it was so special. Shirley thought they imagined it and achieved it, and Emma held her frame beautifully. Emma and Anton have had a barney, but they\u2019re sorting it out with a dance. It\u2019s a heartfelt performance from Emma, and quite mesmerising to watch - lovely and smooth on the Viennese footwork too. Would have liked to see more dance and less emoting, but charming nonetheless. Students count as adorable kids - DRINK. Next up (slot of death) it\u2019s EMMA AND ANTON! This week they\u2019re dancing the Viennese Waltz to \u2018Send in the Clowns\u2019 by Barbra Streisand. This is the most beautiful song, and regardless of how exhausting you find Anton on a weekly basis, there\u2019s no denying he can deliver a stunning Viennese. So quite looking forward to this. That said, am very much hoping this routine doesn\u2019t feature actual clowns. I\u2019m really quite scared of them, so please don\u2019t send them in. Time for this week\u2019s Terms &amp; Conditions, courtesy of 80s pop cheesemeister Jason Donovan. He sounds ROUGH. Scores: 6,7,7,6 - a total of 26 for Chris and Karen. Shirley thinks that Chris is continuing to improve, but there were a few mistakes. Bruno noticed that Chris went wrong, but a good performance. Craig thought it looked a little flat-footed, and he would have liked to see Chris being a bit nimble; loved the character though. Motsi thought it was authentic and full of energy \u2013 this is what Strictly is all about. Everything about these outfits is horrible, but not nearly as wild as Chris\u2019s Jive footwork. His timing isn\u2019t too bad, but it\u2019s all a bit squidgy and his kicks and flicks aren\u2019t nearly sharp enough. On this upside, that was identifiably a Jive, so that\u2019s something. First up tonight it\u2019s CHRIS AND KAREN! This week they\u2019re dancing the Jive to \u2018Saturday Night\u2019s Alright (For Fighting)\u2019 by Elton John. Personally I\u2019d prefer an aggro-free weekend, but maybe that\u2019s just me. Also why didn\u2019t they do Rocketman for Movie Week last week? Chris and Karen appear to be deploying the Latin Avoidance tactic, presumably after their week one Cha Cha that barely scored double figures. Trouble is you eventually find yourself in a Samba/Salsa/Rumba dead end with no option but to shimmy your way out in the tightest sparkly trousers you can find. Out come the stars! Chris has gone full Elton, and Michelle looks like someone has sicked up the 1980s. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in tinfoil wrapped in clingfilm, Claudia as a velvet bat with shoulders that could take your eye out. SURE. And we\u2019re off! Last Saturday\u2019s Movie Week special saw the first tens for Kelvin and Oti (too early, Shirley) and a farewell to 80s jumpsuit icon Anneka Rice. Now we get to enjoy Kevin bobbing about in the Clauditorium and treating us all to Sunday night barefoot contempo-waft; personally I prefer to think of him staring wistfully at the wall of a poorly-lit room, occasionally popping another piece in a giant jigsaw of Grimsby harbour. This week\u2019s Strictly Come Bingo SPECIAL FAMILY EDITION \u2013 a slug of that special tipple you were saving for a Brexit emergency if you spot any of these in the wild: Bingo nannas Adorable kids Proud parents Random siblings Pets Evening all, and welcome to this week\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing liveblog! After the cinematic madness of Movie Week, it\u2019s Strictly business as usual for a couple of weeks until the horror chest is opened for Halloween. Latest Heidi\u2019s Hunches is below \u2013 with Challenged Anneka helicoptered out of Elstree, David remains very much in the danger zone, but I think Mike and Katya and Emma and Aljaz are now flirting with the exit door too. Definitely some space opening up for the top four couples though \u2013 right now it\u2019s hard to imagine the final not being Kelvin, Michelle, Karim and Dev. That said, we didn\u2019t include Stacey in the lead group at this stage last year; any one of Alex, Saffron or Catherine could be on a similar Strictly JourneyTM. Group 1: driving for December \u2013 Kelvin and Oti, Michelle and Giovanni, Karim and Amy, Dev and Dianne Group 2: battling for Blackpool \u2013 Emma B and Anton, Catherine and Johannes, Will and Janette, Saffron and AJ, Alex and Neil Group 3: happy to see Halloween \u2013 Chris and Karen, Emma W and Aljaz Group 4: dodging the dance-off \u2013 David and Nadiya, Mike and Katya Kick off is at 6.40pm, and we\u2019ve finally slipped under the two hour mark to 1 hour and 56 minutes. Bring provisions and elasticated clothing, and I\u2019ll see you then!",

      "bodyText": "A breakthrough in the Brexit talks has failed to materialise after a weekend of intensive negotiations, with European Union capitals concluding that it may now be impossible for the UK to leave the EU by 31 October with a deal. In a briefing to EU ambassadors on Sunday evening, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, raised the prospect of the talks having to continue after the forthcoming leaders\u2019 summit on Thursday, such was the lack of progress. Barnier told diplomats for the member states that the latest British customs proposals for the Irish border remained an \u201cuntested\u201d risk that the bloc could not countenance. He said that it would require a fresh \u201cpolitical impulse\u201d from Boris Johnson for a deal to be realisable this week. On the UK\u2019s proposed Stormont veto on Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s single market for goods, the Irish representative told the room that such an arrangement was \u201cnot a notion that is included in the Good Friday agreement\u201d. A Brexit extension \u2013 whether \u201ctechnical\u201d if the two sides get close to a deal in late October or longer to accommodate a general election \u2013 was raised in the EU27\u2019s discussions for the first time in months. Johnson had hinted at the problems during an update of his cabinet on Sunday lunchtime. He offered few details, but a No 10 spokesperson said the prime minister had told his colleagues that \u201ca pathway to a deal could be seen, but that there is still a significant amount of work to get there and we must remain prepared to leave on 31 October\u201d. The lack of progress over the weekend has left scant hope, however, of a decisive moment in the Brexit saga this week. Barnier said the EU should give Britain \u201cone last chance\u201d to find a realistic replacement for the Irish backstop as he proposed last-ditch talks until the eve of the EU summit on Wednesday. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, reminded the UK that it would become a \u201cpotential competitor\u201d with the EU in global markets \u201calong with China and the US\u201d after Brexit. \u201cEurope needs to show what it\u2019s made of\u201d as Brexit looms, she said before a dinner with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in Paris. \u201cA lot of work remains to be done,\u201d an official statement from the commission said following Barnier\u2019s briefing for the EU capitals. Johnson executed a major policy U-turn at the end of last week by accepting that there could not be a customs border on the island of Ireland, raising some optimism on both sides of the channel. Under his alternative proposal as briefed by Barnier, a pared-down version of Theresa May\u2019s customs partnership, Northern Ireland would leave the EU customs union. But the UK would agree to enforce the bloc\u2019s customs rules and tariffs on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland. There would be a rebate system to compensate affected businesses. Barnier told the ambassadors that it would involve an untried system of tracking goods and he spoke of the risks that would be facing the single market. \u201cThere were lots of ifs and maybes \u2013 too many,\u201d said one EU diplomat of the discussions. A second senior EU diplomat warned it would be impossible to hammer out such a \u201ctotally new concept\u201d to replace the Irish backstop within days. The source said the UK would not be able leave the EU with a deal as scheduled on 31 October unless it embraces a previous plan, the Northern Ireland-only backstop \u2013 the EU\u2019s original proposal which would leave the region in an EU customs union and following most of the single market\u2019s rules. If the UK wanted a brand-new concept on customs for Northern Ireland a deal is \u201cimpossible\u201d by the end of October, said the diplomat. Earlier on Sunday, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said he would back such a prolongation of the UK\u2019s membership. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the Brits to decide if they will ask for an extension,\u201d Juncker told the Austrian newspaper Kurier on Sunday. \u201cBut if Boris Johnson were to ask for extra time \u2013 which probably he won\u2019t \u2013 I would consider it unhistoric to refuse such a request.\u201d Despite scepticism in Brussels, the prime minister is still hoping to make sufficient progress at the European council on Thursday and Friday to be able to hold a Commons vote on his Brexit plans in a rare Saturday sitting next weekend. The Benn act, passed by parliament in a bid to block a no-deal Brexit, obliges the prime minister to request a delay if he has not agreed a deal with the EU27 and secured the backing of the House of Commons for it by 11pm on Saturday. Backers of the People\u2019s Vote campaign, which will be holding a mass rally outside parliament on Saturday as MPs meet inside, hope to amend any motion tabled by the government to attach a requirement for a referendum \u2013 though it is unclear whether a majority exists to do so. Meanwhile the first independent economic assessment of Johnson\u2019s proposed deal, published on Sunday by the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe, suggests it would be significantly more damaging than May\u2019s plans. The analysis suggests GDP would be between 2.3% and 7% smaller in a decade\u2019s time than if Britain remained in the EU \u2013 compared with a range of 1.9% to 5.5% under the May deal. Prof Jonathan Portes, a senior fellow at UK in a Changing Europe, said: \u201cOur modelling shows that the much more distant economic relationship with the EU envisaged by Boris Johnson will mean that the economic impacts of Brexit on trade and hence growth will be considerably more severe.

The Maghreb country, often held up as the lone success story of the Arab spring, appears set to successfully carry out its second-ever presidential elections, with an earlier round of voting winnowing the field from 26 candidates to the two self-styled outsiders, the lawyer Kais Saied and the businessman Nabil Karoui. An exit poll released on Sunday night showed a decisive victory for Saied, who was the choice of 72% of those surveyed by the Emrhod Consulting group. Analysts said the choice of the two candidates over better-known political faces, including many associated with the country\u2019s revolution or with the old regime of the overthrown president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, reflected widespread discontent with the country\u2019s ailing economy \u2013 a key factor that drove Tunisianson to the streets in 2011. \u201cThe tremendous disappointment with the lack of economic reform is paramount on Tunisian voters\u2019 minds,\u201d said Safwan Masri, a professor of Middle Eastern and north African politics at Columbia University in New York. \u201cThe fact that presidential candidates such as the country\u2019s defence minister or its prime minister didn\u2019t do well sends a strong message that \u2018we\u2019re done with you, we\u2019re done with the establishment and their failed promises\u2019.\u201d Turnout by 3:30pm local time was around 39%, the same as in the runoff elections on 15 September and much lower than the 64% of registered voters who cast their ballots in the presidential contest five years ago.

While the Kenyan Lawrence Cherono bounded to victory in 2hr 5min 45sec, Farah had pain etched across his face as he crossed the line in eighth place in a modest 2:09:58.</p> <p>Every time the Briton has run the marathon since retiring from the track in 2017, he has insisted that he is still learning how to best deal with going 26.2 miles.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/13/brigid-kosgei-world-marathon-record-paula-radcliffe-chicago\">Brigid Kosgei smashes Paula Radcliffe\u2019s world marathon record by 81 seconds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But on an unseasonally bitter day in the midwest, Farah learned perhaps the biggest lesson of all: that for all his devastating prowess on the track, when it comes to the ultimate test of distance running his old powers do not work nearly as well.</p> <p>Perhaps Farah\u2019s poor performance can be partly attributed to outside factors. It cannot have been easy seeing his former coach Alberto Salazar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/01/athletics-coach-alberto-salazar-receives-four-year-ban-for-doping-violations\" title=\"\">banned for four years</a> for doping offences \u2013 or UK Athletics dropping his personal physiotherapist and confidant, Neil Black, as performance director.

      "bodyText": "A miserable fortnight for Mo Farah took a sharp turn for the worse in Chicago on Sunday as he trudged home more than four minutes behind the leaders in his worst ever marathon time. While the Kenyan Lawrence Cherono bounded to victory in 2hr 5min 45sec, Farah had pain etched across his face as he crossed the line in eighth place in a modest 2:09:58. Every time the Briton has run the marathon since retiring from the track in 2017, he has insisted that he is still learning how to best deal with going 26.2 miles. But on an unseasonally bitter day in the midwest, Farah learned perhaps the biggest lesson of all: that for all his devastating prowess on the track, when it comes to the ultimate test of distance running his old powers do not work nearly as well. Perhaps Farah\u2019s poor performance can be partly attributed to outside factors. It cannot have been easy seeing his former coach Alberto Salazar banned for four years for doping offences \u2013 or UK Athletics dropping his personal physiotherapist and confidant, Neil Black, as performance director. Yet when Farah spoke to the press on Friday he promised he was in great form \u2013 and would not be distracted. But his increasingly punchy exchanges with the media, in which he appeared to be more critical of them than Salazar before accusing them of racism, can not have made for a smooth buildup. Either way, it was evident from early on that this was not going to be Farah\u2019s day when he began to slip off a moderate pace after just eight miles. By the time the leaders went through halfway in 1:02.14, he was 40 seconds back in seventh and in no man\u2019s land with just his training partner Bashir Abdi for company. True, Farah did at least perform better than the two Nike Oregon Project athletes still coached by Salazar \u2013 with his former friend Galen Rupp dropping out with a calf strain after 23 miles, and Jordan Hasay withdrawing after feeling a sharp pain in her hamstring after two miles. Increasingly, however, Farah looked every one of his 36 years. With 20 miles he was two minutes off the pace and looking like he wanted the ground to swallow him up. And while he deserves credit for continuing, this will be a bitter blow to his increasingly faint hopes of winning a marathon medal at the Olympic Games in Tokyo next year.

They just need a few million pounds first.</p> <p>One promises to solve hair loss with a gadget in a cap; another will make fabric out of CO2: all come armed with PhDs, slick presentations and rictus grins.</p> <p>Depending on your viewpoint, this is either a sign of Europe\u2019s flourishing tech scene or further evidence of the investment bubble that fuelled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/10/uber-goes-into-reverse-as-first-day-stock-price-disappoints\">bloated valuations of Uber</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/30/wework-scraps-share-sale-adam-neumann\">WeWork</a> and looks set to burst \u2013 with potentially disastrous consequences for the economy.</p> <p>The founders gathering in King\u2019s Cross recently have all come through the six-month <a href=\"https://www.joinef.com/\">Entrepreneur First</a> (EF) programme, which brings together ambitious individuals in the hope that they will team up and build the next Google.</p> <p>The investors are venture capitalists (VCs), willing to bet on early-stage companies that comprise little more than a pair of founders with a big idea.</p> <p>Dr Hira Singh Virdee, for one such firm, takes to the stage and explains how his company will solve the problem of satellites running out of power by shooting lasers at them. </p> <p>Betting on these companies is a high-risk strategy. Matt Clifford, co-founder of EF, says: \u201cYou probably lose money on seven in 10, you do a little bit better than breakeven on two, and the last one you need to knock out of the park.\u201d</p> <p>A decade ago, most investors steered well clear of the VC market, leaving it to the professionals. Then central banks around the world slashed interest rates to drive a recovery following the financial crash. That made it harder for investors to get returns, pushing them into areas previously seen as far too risky.</p> <p>Funds flowed into VC, where assets under management almost <a href=\"https://docs.preqin.com/press/VC-AUM-May-17.pdf\">doubled between 2008 and 2016 to $524</a><a href=\"https://docs.preqin.com/press/VC-AUM-May-17.pdf\">b</a><a href=\"https://docs.preqin.com/press/VC-AUM-May-17.pdf\">n</a> (\u00a3414bn), according to data provider Preqin. With billions in their pockets, investors went on the hunt for startups hungry for capital.</p> <p>With so much money sloshing around the system, funding rounds got bigger and bigger. Critics say that has left startups with money to burn and no need to show how they will ever turn a profit.</p> <p>Martin Kenney and John Zysman of the University of California say this has fundamentally changed the rules of the game. In a <a href=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/94p5v91r\">paper on entrepreneurial finance</a>, they argue that investors with deep pockets can now take huge bets on loss-making companies and continue to fund them until they crush the competition.</p> <p>Kenney and Zysman say the current system does not just encourage but demands a drive for breakneck expansion. \u201cIn fact, a startup that does not grow as quickly as possible is soon overwhelmed by the startup with more capital and more reckless investment.\u201d</p> <p>They argue that many of the companies hailed for disrupting entire industries have done so by raising huge amounts of VC, which allows them to undercut their rivals.</p> <p>Uber, for example, can charge less for rides and pay its drivers more because it raised more than $22bn in VC.</p> <p>Prof John Colley, associate dean of Warwick Business School, says: \u201cThe minute you have to charge market rates and pay drivers the normal rate, you\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d Although plenty of taxi firms have folded, he says barriers to entry are so low that competitors will quickly re-emerge when the funding runs out and prices return to normal.</p> <p>For their part, consumers will either have to pay up or cut down on taxis, takeaways, and any other services made artificially cheap with VC money. Colley expects more of the latter. \u201cIf you have to pay the full amount to get your Subway sandwich delivered to your home, you wouldn\u2019t do it. That\u2019s the reality.\u201d</p> <p>That, he says, will have an impact on jobs. \u201cThose industries of home delivery and very cheap taxis will probably reduce in size quite significantly. They\u2019re both incredibly big employers.\u201d</p> <p>So when will the bubble burst?

      "bodyText": "In a wood-panelled auditorium in central London, a procession of entrepreneurs are explaining to more than 100 investors how they will change the world. They just need a few million pounds first. One promises to solve hair loss with a gadget in a cap; another will make fabric out of CO2: all come armed with PhDs, slick presentations and rictus grins. Depending on your viewpoint, this is either a sign of Europe\u2019s flourishing tech scene or further evidence of the investment bubble that fuelled bloated valuations of Uber and WeWork and looks set to burst \u2013 with potentially disastrous consequences for the economy. The founders gathering in King\u2019s Cross recently have all come through the six-month Entrepreneur First (EF) programme, which brings together ambitious individuals in the hope that they will team up and build the next Google. The investors are venture capitalists (VCs), willing to bet on early-stage companies that comprise little more than a pair of founders with a big idea. Dr Hira Singh Virdee, for one such firm, takes to the stage and explains how his company will solve the problem of satellites running out of power by shooting lasers at them. Betting on these companies is a high-risk strategy. Matt Clifford, co-founder of EF, says: \u201cYou probably lose money on seven in 10, you do a little bit better than breakeven on two, and the last one you need to knock out of the park.\u201d A decade ago, most investors steered well clear of the VC market, leaving it to the professionals. Then central banks around the world slashed interest rates to drive a recovery following the financial crash. That made it harder for investors to get returns, pushing them into areas previously seen as far too risky. Funds flowed into VC, where assets under management almost doubled between 2008 and 2016 to $524bn (\u00a3414bn), according to data provider Preqin. With billions in their pockets, investors went on the hunt for startups hungry for capital. With so much money sloshing around the system, funding rounds got bigger and bigger. Critics say that has left startups with money to burn and no need to show how they will ever turn a profit. Martin Kenney and John Zysman of the University of California say this has fundamentally changed the rules of the game. In a paper on entrepreneurial finance, they argue that investors with deep pockets can now take huge bets on loss-making companies and continue to fund them until they crush the competition. Kenney and Zysman say the current system does not just encourage but demands a drive for breakneck expansion. \u201cIn fact, a startup that does not grow as quickly as possible is soon overwhelmed by the startup with more capital and more reckless investment.\u201d They argue that many of the companies hailed for disrupting entire industries have done so by raising huge amounts of VC, which allows them to undercut their rivals. Uber, for example, can charge less for rides and pay its drivers more because it raised more than $22bn in VC. Prof John Colley, associate dean of Warwick Business School, says: \u201cThe minute you have to charge market rates and pay drivers the normal rate, you\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d Although plenty of taxi firms have folded, he says barriers to entry are so low that competitors will quickly re-emerge when the funding runs out and prices return to normal. For their part, consumers will either have to pay up or cut down on taxis, takeaways, and any other services made artificially cheap with VC money. Colley expects more of the latter. \u201cIf you have to pay the full amount to get your Subway sandwich delivered to your home, you wouldn\u2019t do it. That\u2019s the reality.\u201d That, he says, will have an impact on jobs. \u201cThose industries of home delivery and very cheap taxis will probably reduce in size quite significantly. They\u2019re both incredibly big employers.\u201d So when will the bubble burst? Many point to the implosion of WeWork \u2013 once a poster child for the VC investment boom \u2013 as the beginning of the end. Deals are already shrinking in size and number. Since January, the amount invested by VCs has dropped 23%, compared with the same period last year. In the UK \u2013 although amounts invested remain high \u2013 the number of deals fell by 15%, according to Preqin. Alice Bentinck, co-founder of Entrepreneur First, says: \u201cIt\u2019s reasonably recent that the WeWork and Uber stories are coming through, and maybe we will see a correction at some point in the nearish future.\u201d For now, she says, the money is flowing freely. \u201cWe\u2019re still seeing valuations go up and up and up, even for these very, very young companies.\u201d",

The wounds are too painful to leave it at that. Prison was horrible. At first we were full of hope that we would be released but everything seemed to drag on \u2026 I shall try to get some redress for my bitter experience.\u201d He could hardly have imagined that it would be another 46 years before that redress finally arrived. Born in Jamaica in 1950, Trew was the son of a police officer in what was still a colonial force. His parents came to England in the early 1950s as part of the Windrush generation. Winston, his older sister and two younger brothers joined them in London shortly afterwards. After leaving school and having embarked on a government training course in electrical engineering, he became involved in politics. In 1970, he joined the Fasimbas (Young Lions), the youth wing of an organisation called the South East London Parents\u2019 Organisation. One of their roles was educating youngsters of Caribbean origin about their backgrounds and history and helping those with reading problems as part of their education at a supplementary school. On the night of his arrest, Trew had been at a meeting in north London and was on his way home. The effect of his arrest and imprisonment was enormous. \u201cIt shattered me,\u201d he said this week. \u201cMy marriage broke up. I lost confidence and I felt incredibly lonely.\u201d His father had died in 1959 and the trial and sentence caused great distress to his mother.

He believes Labour will still be able to squeeze the Conservatives when voters ask themselves who they want to run the country for the next five years. \u201cAt a general election, people are going to have to decide. Because he is a Tory: he\u2019s not standing above party,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI think it will focus back on the old divisions between a centre-left route for the country or a centre-right route for the party. That\u2019s what it\u2019s going to boil down to in the end.\u201d",

No one was even sure exactly who, or how many, the silence was for. They were still counting the victims, and had been all day. At dawn the tally was four, then it climbed to nine. By the time they started the game it was 24, by half time it was 26, and it reached 28 soon after it was over.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/14/japan-rugby-world-cup-typhoon-hagibis-scotland\">Japan marks shining moment at Rugby World Cup in wake of Typhoon Hagibis</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>You\u2019d ask, then, whether they should have even been playing. And World Rugby had exactly that conversation early on Sunday morning. They decided they had to defer to the Japanese members of the local organising committee. Why play sport, why watch it, while there were still so many people missing, when the levees are broken and the rivers are overflowing, when, in Kawasaki, 16 miles to the east of Yokohama, almost a million people had been evacuated in the night, and in Sagamihara, 30 miles to the north, they were still counting how many had died in a mudslide that wiped out a street of houses.</p> \n<p>For distraction, perhaps, and as a way of reclaiming some normality, as an act of defiance, even, a vital sign that we, at least, are alive and determined to enjoy what we\u2019ve got.</p> \n<p>The hosts were driven by their sense of pride, too, but, according to an executive who was in on the meeting, the main reason, the one the Japanese officials kept coming back to, was that they wanted to prove to the world that they could do it.</p> \n<p>One of the reasons that the damage wasn\u2019t worse here in Yokohama was that the stadium has been built in the middle of the flood basin that takes the overflow from the Tsurumi river. It\u2019s built on stilts, to let the water run underneath. So the stadium is physically part of the city\u2019s flood defences. And now it is spiritually part of them, too.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Officials slept in the stadium on Saturday night, while the typhoon blew outside, so they could start assessing the damage the minute it stopped. At dawn the repair crews came in, and started pumping the floodwater out of the dressing room, where it was an inch deep, while the fire-service triple-checked all the electrics. Later they hosed down the pitch, to clear off the mud and debris. Meanwhile the organising committee were coordinating with the government and regional authorities, with all three emergency services, the water authorities, the road authorities, the train and bus companies, trying to untangle a cat\u2019s cradle of complications.</p> \n<p>In Japan all the talk has been about how this World Cup is about <em>omotenashi</em>, Japanese hospitality. The word doesn\u2019t exactly translate, but, in the sketchy understanding I have of it after four weeks here, it\u2019s about doing more than your very best to please your guest.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3ae4d1d087bb12afc190c9cb8603ba23ef3963c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3ae4d1d087bb12afc190c9cb8603ba23ef3963c/0_85_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Isileli Nakajima celebrates with Yu Tamura after the final whistle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isileli Nakajima, left, celebrates with Yu Tamura after the final whistle.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jae Hong/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But this was several steps further again, well beyond what anyone could have expected. Which might be why so many people got it all so wrong in the days before the match. Why they imagined that Japan wanted to have this match cancelled, that they would rather have been awarded the draw than face the Scots, a team against whom they had only ever lost. They even suggested it was all part of some grand conspiracy to hobble the Scots.</p> \n<p>The chief executive of the Scottish Rugby Union, Mark Dodson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/11/scotland-japan-pressure-rescheduled-rugby-world-cup\" title=\"\">got it all wrong too</a>. Dodson let fly about how the SRU had taken legal advice, raged how he wasn\u2019t going to let his team be \u201ccollateral damage\u201d. It was an embarrassingly wild misreading of what\u2019s been going on here, of the mood among the Japanese, and how determined they were to play, and to win, this game.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d7c3b6e03d4e17908168976c45a47bee4b3b3bf5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7c3b6e03d4e17908168976c45a47bee4b3b3bf5/0_139_4167_2500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans enjoy Japan\u2019s victory over Scotland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans enjoy Japan\u2019s victory over Scotland.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That silence gave way to the Japanese national anthem, Kimigayo. They have a complicated relationship with the song in Japan. There are a lot of people who prefer not to sing it. Which is why, during this tournament, they have been running a campaign encouraging the fans to join in with it. Tens of thousands did here, a stirring, solemn rendition that seemed to swell louder and louder until it echoed all around the city. And you knew then that Scotland were done for, that they were up against a team who were being driven by powerful forces, far beyond anything they had to muster themselves, a team who, like their country, were determined to prove to everyone that they could.</p> \n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/13/japan-scotland-rugby-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">that first half</a> Japan unleashed a 30-minute spell of rugby of such ferocity, such focus, and intent, it would have cut apart any team in the tournament, including South Africa, who they will play on Sunday. Scotland play a fast game themselves, but they were out-matched here, and utterly overwhelmed, by a team who were fitter, sharper, quicker. Scotland were in tatters after that, and it was to their credit that they fought back the way they did.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6fef03be-90e4-4479-a966-6b06ac24f770\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/18/rugby-world-cup-2019-fixtures-tables-and-results\">Fixtures, tables and results</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/20/top-try-and-points-scorers-for-the-2019-rugby-world-cup-japan\">Top try and points scorers</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/19/rugby-world-cup-2019-stadium-guide\">Stadium guide</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/19/rugby-world-cup-2019-guide-to-the-referees\">Referee guide</a><br></p>\n    <p>\u2022 Our latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/minutebyminute+sport/rugby-union\">minute-by-minute live reports</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/sign-up-to-the-breakdown\">Sign up to The Breakdown</a>, our free rugby union email newsletter</p>\n    <p><b>Team guides</b><br>Pool A: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/09/rugby-world-cup-2019-ireland-team-guide\">Ireland</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/09/rugby-world-cup-2019-japan-team-guide\">Japan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/10/rugby-world-cup-2019-russia-team-guide\">Russia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/10/rugby-world-cup-2019-samoa-team-guide\">Samoa</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/11/rugby-world-cup-2019-scotland-team-guide\">Scotland</a><br>Pool B: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/11/rugby-world-cup-2019-canada-team-guide\">Canada</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/12/rugby-world-cup-2019-italy-team-guide\">Italy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/12/rugby-world-cup-2019-namibia-team-guide\">Namibia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/13/rugby-world-cup-2019-new-zealand-team-guide\">New Zealand</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/13/rugby-world-cup-2019-south-africa-team-guide\">South Africa</a><br>Pool C: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/14/rugby-world-cup-2019-argentina-team-guide\">Argentina</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/14/rugby-world-cup-2019-england-team-guide\">England</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/15/rugby-world-cup-2019-france-team-guide\">France</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/16/rugby-world-cup-2019-tonga-team-guide\">Tonga</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/15/rugby-world-cup-2019-usa-team-guide\">USA</a><br>Pool D: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/17/rugby-world-cup-2019-australia-team-guide\">Australia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/18/rugby-world-cup-2019-fiji-team-guide\">Fiji</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/17/rugby-world-cup-2019-georgia-team-guide\">Georgia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/18/rugby-world-cup-2019-uruguay-team-guide\">Uruguay</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/16/rugby-world-cup-2019-wales-team-guide\">Wales</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As for the Japanese fans, they all seem to believe that anything is possible now, and after what happened this Sunday evening, who would ever say otherwise.</p>",

No one was even sure exactly who, or how many, the silence was for. They were still counting the victims, and had been all day. At dawn the tally was four, then it climbed to nine. By the time they started the game it was 24, by half time it was 26, and it reached 28 soon after it was over. You\u2019d ask, then, whether they should have even been playing. And World Rugby had exactly that conversation early on Sunday morning. They decided they had to defer to the Japanese members of the local organising committee. Why play sport, why watch it, while there were still so many people missing, when the levees are broken and the rivers are overflowing, when, in Kawasaki, 16 miles to the east of Yokohama, almost a million people had been evacuated in the night, and in Sagamihara, 30 miles to the north, they were still counting how many had died in a mudslide that wiped out a street of houses. For distraction, perhaps, and as a way of reclaiming some normality, as an act of defiance, even, a vital sign that we, at least, are alive and determined to enjoy what we\u2019ve got. The hosts were driven by their sense of pride, too, but, according to an executive who was in on the meeting, the main reason, the one the Japanese officials kept coming back to, was that they wanted to prove to the world that they could do it. One of the reasons that the damage wasn\u2019t worse here in Yokohama was that the stadium has been built in the middle of the flood basin that takes the overflow from the Tsurumi river. It\u2019s built on stilts, to let the water run underneath. So the stadium is physically part of the city\u2019s flood defences. And now it is spiritually part of them, too. Officials slept in the stadium on Saturday night, while the typhoon blew outside, so they could start assessing the damage the minute it stopped. At dawn the repair crews came in, and started pumping the floodwater out of the dressing room, where it was an inch deep, while the fire-service triple-checked all the electrics. Later they hosed down the pitch, to clear off the mud and debris. Meanwhile the organising committee were coordinating with the government and regional authorities, with all three emergency services, the water authorities, the road authorities, the train and bus companies, trying to untangle a cat\u2019s cradle of complications. In Japan all the talk has been about how this World Cup is about omotenashi, Japanese hospitality. The word doesn\u2019t exactly translate, but, in the sketchy understanding I have of it after four weeks here, it\u2019s about doing more than your very best to please your guest. But this was several steps further again, well beyond what anyone could have expected. Which might be why so many people got it all so wrong in the days before the match. Why they imagined that Japan wanted to have this match cancelled, that they would rather have been awarded the draw than face the Scots, a team against whom they had only ever lost. They even suggested it was all part of some grand conspiracy to hobble the Scots. The chief executive of the Scottish Rugby Union, Mark Dodson, got it all wrong too. Dodson let fly about how the SRU had taken legal advice, raged how he wasn\u2019t going to let his team be \u201ccollateral damage\u201d. It was an embarrassingly wild misreading of what\u2019s been going on here, of the mood among the Japanese, and how determined they were to play, and to win, this game. That silence gave way to the Japanese national anthem, Kimigayo. They have a complicated relationship with the song in Japan. There are a lot of people who prefer not to sing it. Which is why, during this tournament, they have been running a campaign encouraging the fans to join in with it. Tens of thousands did here, a stirring, solemn rendition that seemed to swell louder and louder until it echoed all around the city. And you knew then that Scotland were done for, that they were up against a team who were being driven by powerful forces, far beyond anything they had to muster themselves, a team who, like their country, were determined to prove to everyone that they could. In that first half Japan unleashed a 30-minute spell of rugby of such ferocity, such focus, and intent, it would have cut apart any team in the tournament, including South Africa, who they will play on Sunday. Scotland play a fast game themselves, but they were out-matched here, and utterly overwhelmed, by a team who were fitter, sharper, quicker. Scotland were in tatters after that, and it was to their credit that they fought back the way they did. As for the Japanese fans, they all seem to believe that anything is possible now, and after what happened this Sunday evening, who would ever say otherwise.",

Frost is now a fully fledged professional, so O\u2019Neill\u2019s main rival is Connor Brace, based just a few miles away at Fergal O\u2019Brien\u2019s stable. Whatever happens, the two young men have promised not to fall out over it. \u201cHe\u2019s one of my best friends. I had dinner with him last night. We never really talk about it.\u201d",

There were claims on social media that female inmates at the prison had been locked in their cells after the young woman\u2019s death.

One hundred and nine women have now died in prison since the 2007 publication of the Corston report, which called for major changes in the way women in prison are looked after.. Foston Hall prison has faced previous criticisms over deaths of inmates. An inquest into the death of Caroline Ann Hunt there in 2017 found serious failings in the way she was managed and cared for.

The report highlights that in 2018-2019 the PPO opened fatal incident investigations after 334 deaths, 6% more than in the previous year and the second highest annual figure since the PPO started investigating deaths in 2004. There were 11 deaths in women\u2019s prisons, an increase from eight the previous year.

Despite blocking the balloon plan, parliament\u2019s presiding officers have approved an Extinction Rebellion protest at the authorised assembly area in front of parliament from 14 to 18 October, the Senate president, Scott Ryan, has revealed. Last week the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, wrote to members hoping to raise $10,000 for a hot air balloon to provide extra lift to the party\u2019s efforts to get parliament to declare a climate emergency when it returns on Monday. The Greens had obtained approval from the National Capital Authority to use the East Lawn at Parkes and Federation Mall for use in climate emergency protests and also claim to have consulted the Australian Federal Police about use of the balloon. On Saturday Airservices Australia issued a notice to airmen after a decision by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority restricting all flights within a 0.25 nautical mile radius of parliament between Saturday 12 October and Monday 28 October, covering the entire sitting fortnight. Di Natale questioned whether the government had pressured Casa to shut down the airspace over parliament to thwart the Greens\u2019 climate protest, suggesting that would represent a \u201cserious abuse of power\u201d. Ryan told Guardian Australia as a \u201cgeneral rule\u201d hot air balloons do not fly over parliament, but the Department of Parliamentary Services needed to consider the question after the Greens floated the idea as a novel form of protest. \u201cFlying of hot air balloons over Parliament House presents a safety and security risk to people and the Parliament House building,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cFollowing consultation with the AFP, on behalf of the Presiding Officers, made an application for a temporary restriction of airspace which prevents aircraft flying over and immediately around Parliament House without prior approval.\u201d A spokesman for Casa told Guardian Australia: \u201cCasa responded to a request by security agencies for temporary restricted airspace at Parliament House, Canberra. \u201cThe request was assessed under normal processes. CASA does not comment on security matters.\u201d A Greens spokesman said balloon flights over Canberra this week will go ahead despite the \u201cunprecedented decision to block air traffic over Parliament House to coincide with our protest action\u201d. The Greens dispute that hot air balloons are not usually allowed over parliament. The lower house Greens MP Adam Bandt has written to all parliamentarians in the House urging them to support the climate emergency motion, which would be seconded by the independent Zali Steggall, and has the support of most of the crossbench. Labor has discussed the proposal with the Greens but is yet to decide whether or not to back the motion. Although the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, has previously said it is abundantly clear there is a climate emergency, he has also warned there is little to no prospect of the Greens-led motion getting up in the current parliament, because Liberals will not break ranks.

      "bodyText": "When Charlotte Wood finished writing her furious tour de force, The Natural Way of Things, she declared that for her sanity she would next write a lighter, funnier novel. And so she has \u2013 in a way. What could possibly be disturbing in a comedy about a group of ageing female friends? For readers who discovered Wood through The Natural Way of Things, her new novel, The Weekend, may surprise. Those who relished the brilliant dystopia about a disparate group of young women imprisoned in the Australian desert to protect their sexual abusers might expect another diatribe against misogyny. Those who shied away from the bleak fable will wonder if they can open their eyes. Both, if they put aside preconceptions, will enjoy this playful and moving feminist fairytale. The Natural Way of Things brought Wood sensational success: an Australian bestseller, published internationally, winner of the 2016 Stella prize, a Prime Minister\u2019s Literary award, Indie Book of the Year, and shortlistings for the Miles Franklin award, among others. The novel was both sharply contemporary and timeless in its portrayal of women under duress. Wood perfectly captured the zeitgeist, anticipating not only the TV adaptation of Margaret Atwood\u2019s 1985 novel, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, but the entire #MeToo movement. Many writers stall at the challenge of how to proceed from such acclaim. Wood has wisely not tried to outdo her own shock tactics. The Weekend, her sixth novel, returns to the qualities that had already built an admiring readership for her earlier books while being a more domesticated sister to its wild predecessor. Families, in a broad sense, have always driven her tightly focused dramas. The dynamics of The Children and Animal People, a loosely linked pair of novels about sibling tensions, evolved into the unwilling sisterhood of The Natural Way of Things and the fractured friendships of The Weekend. The Weekend is more Big Chill than Handmaid\u2019s Tale, with a dash of Big Little Lies and an echo of Atwood\u2019s The Robber Bride. Wood uses the classic theatrical set-up of a house party to concentrate tension in a tight space. If she were Agatha Christie this would lead to murder, but her characters\u2019 emotional blow-ups are closer to those in David Williamson\u2019s Don\u2019s Party or Rachel Ward\u2019s recent film Palm Beach (co-written with Joanna Murray-Smith).

Its large window, on the narrow front side, stares patiently west, waiting for the sunset over the small field of ferns which lay before more gumtrees and the escarpment on the horizon. There is nothing else and no one else within sight. It <em>would</em> be so nice without kids.</p> <p>Cheers from the back seat and the unmistakable sound of a small person trying to override a child lock indicate the five-year-old had been successful. We let the children out of the car and they bolt towards the house with open arms, the toddler crying out: \u201cMy cubby house!\u201d</p> <p>Tiny houses have been around since the turn of the century, starting initially as a means of radical downsizing and rejection of burdensome traditional house ownership. Helped along by the #cabinporn movement, tiny houses have begun to crop up in the travel world; a grown-up, highly Instagrammable evolution of glamping, without the bunting and fairy lights.</p> <p>This vision of a tiny house rarely involves more than two people. But In2TheWild, an Australian company with tiny houses scattered on semi-remote properties around the country, says you can fit four (two adult sized, and two small adults or children) in their 15 square metre off-grid eco-cabins. So here we are, a live experiment of a marketing hypothesis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"417ac530cea35eb9b288fe1aafc141d49e5ccfc0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/417ac530cea35eb9b288fe1aafc141d49e5ccfc0/0_0_4288_2848/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Maybe we should go outside\u2019: the view from the tiny house\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Maybe we should go outside\u2019: the view from the tiny house.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Celina Rebeiro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Four people fit in a tiny house thus: a small bathroom at the back flows off a kitchen with a fridge, sink and cupboards. Cushioned benches moonlight as beds for the small people and the double bed is in a loft. And therein, for the young traveller family, lies the challenge. As we endeavour to unpack our things (packing away being a critical component of sanity in a tiny house), like lemmings in reverse the children attempt to scale the ladder to the loft. My partner and I take turns to pry their tiny, chubby, vice-like hands from the fifth rung. Meanwhile, as if by some cosmic force, cards, books, pencils and colouring-in pads consume the table and all available floor space and someone tries to find a spot for all the shoes.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe we should go outside.\u201d</p> <p>The outside is expansive and there we do all the things one does in the bush: walk, play, try not to be killed by something venomous. Inside we eat, watch the day turn to a night filled with more stars than our city-dweller kids have ever seen. Kids asleep, with nowhere else to go, I climb the ladder to the loft. My partner passes up a bottle of shiraz and two glasses, and we drink it in near silence. This counts as serenity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/jul/23/goats-bonfires-and-eggs-four-city-slickers-head-for-the-farm\">Goats, bonfires and eggs: four city slickers head for the farm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A shout of \u201cWake up!\u201d pierces the morning sunrise with an enthusiasm and proximity that is impossible to ignore.

Plus we can reach the tissue box on the kitchen counter without leaving our chairs.</p> <p>As the day marches on, we visit the river, build a campfire, run around, but we keep returning inside.

      "bodyText": "\u201cOh,\u201d I say as we pull into a clearing off a dirt track. \u201cIt\u2019s really small.\u201d Which should not have come as a surprise, really \u2013 \u201cit\u201d being a tiny house and smallness being rather the point of it. But, as I checked my rear-view mirror to see my five-year-old unbuckled and silently trying to release her two-year-old sister from her car seat, I thought again: \u201cThat house is very small.\u201d \u201cThis would be so nice without kids,\u201d my partner says, quietly. The house sits dwarfed by eucalyptus trees on a rural property in Kangaroo Valley, two hours south of Sydney. Its large window, on the narrow front side, stares patiently west, waiting for the sunset over the small field of ferns which lay before more gumtrees and the escarpment on the horizon. There is nothing else and no one else within sight. It would be so nice without kids. Cheers from the back seat and the unmistakable sound of a small person trying to override a child lock indicate the five-year-old had been successful. We let the children out of the car and they bolt towards the house with open arms, the toddler crying out: \u201cMy cubby house!\u201d Tiny houses have been around since the turn of the century, starting initially as a means of radical downsizing and rejection of burdensome traditional house ownership. Helped along by the #cabinporn movement, tiny houses have begun to crop up in the travel world; a grown-up, highly Instagrammable evolution of glamping, without the bunting and fairy lights. This vision of a tiny house rarely involves more than two people. But In2TheWild, an Australian company with tiny houses scattered on semi-remote properties around the country, says you can fit four (two adult sized, and two small adults or children) in their 15 square metre off-grid eco-cabins. So here we are, a live experiment of a marketing hypothesis. Four people fit in a tiny house thus: a small bathroom at the back flows off a kitchen with a fridge, sink and cupboards. Cushioned benches moonlight as beds for the small people and the double bed is in a loft. And therein, for the young traveller family, lies the challenge. As we endeavour to unpack our things (packing away being a critical component of sanity in a tiny house), like lemmings in reverse the children attempt to scale the ladder to the loft. My partner and I take turns to pry their tiny, chubby, vice-like hands from the fifth rung. Meanwhile, as if by some cosmic force, cards, books, pencils and colouring-in pads consume the table and all available floor space and someone tries to find a spot for all the shoes. \u201cMaybe we should go outside.\u201d The outside is expansive and there we do all the things one does in the bush: walk, play, try not to be killed by something venomous. Inside we eat, watch the day turn to a night filled with more stars than our city-dweller kids have ever seen. Kids asleep, with nowhere else to go, I climb the ladder to the loft. My partner passes up a bottle of shiraz and two glasses, and we drink it in near silence. This counts as serenity. A shout of \u201cWake up!\u201d pierces the morning sunrise with an enthusiasm and proximity that is impossible to ignore. There is a continuous jostling, clambering, near-ness, however it feels not claustrophobic but, frankly, nice as we lazily drink coffee and read books and have nowhere else to be. Plus we can reach the tissue box on the kitchen counter without leaving our chairs. As the day marches on, we visit the river, build a campfire, run around, but we keep returning inside. The irony of having more space to ourselves was that we didn\u2019t so much use it as watch it \u2013 drawn ever inwards to the tiny house, whether by novelty or the sheer force of comfort in the wild. We stayed in the tiny house for two nights in total and, during that time, my partner, predominantly good-naturedly, swept the floor approximately infinity times. Even by tiny house standards, 15 sq metres is at the very, very small end of the spectrum. For a holiday, and for those tiny house temperament inclined, tiny houses should not be ruled out. But they\u2019re much like toasted marshmallows \u2013 great for holidays, however, if adopted as a centrepiece of daily life, they would quite likely lead to premature death. Tiny houses are supposed to offer simplicity. The wild, a chance to breathe and freedom from being \u201con\u201d. It would be amazing without children. But, as I watched my big girl read to my little girl, backlit by the Australian wilderness, I was reminded of a phrase from my wilder south-east Asian backpacker days: \u201cSame, same \u2013 but different.\u201d Accomodation for this trip was provided by In2theWild. Midweek accomodation starts from $199 per night. Looking for a holiday with a difference? Browse Guardian Holidays to see a range of fantastic trips",

In a speech to the Australian Institute of International Affairs on Monday Labor\u2019s shadow foreign affairs minister will argue that Morrison makes decisions against the national interest for \u201cshort-term political gain\u201d. In a draft of the speech, seen by Guardian Australian, Wong also takes aim at Morrison for echoing Chinese propaganda by suggesting legitimate questions about the Liberal MP Gladys Liu\u2019s links with China were racist. Earlier in October in a major speech to the Lowy Institute after his visit to the US, Morrison declared sovereign nations need to eschew an \u201cunaccountable internationalist bureaucracy\u201d and the world needs to avoid \u201cnegative globalism\u201d, an echo of Donald Trump\u2019s speech to the United Nations declaring the future belonged to patriots, not globalists. On Monday Wong will accuse Morrison of using rhetoric \u201creminiscent of the right-wing nationalism\u201d in the US to \u201cdistract and divert\u201d from a poor record on foreign policy. Wong will question what Morrison \u201cactually means\u201d given that Australia\u2019s international commitments \u201chave been voluntarily entered into\u201d and assessed as in the national interest. \u201cScott Morrison knows the nationalist agenda in the US is an anti-immigration agenda \u2013 but it is equally an anti-trade agenda,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can\u2019t be pro-free trade and anti-globalist \u2013 and we all need to call Scott Morrison\u2019s bluff on this. \u201cEven if Scott Morrison seeks to follow President Trump in closing Australia to immigration, he can never close Australia to trade.\u201d Wong describes Morrison as \u201cthe best political tactician in Australia right now\u201d but argues he \u201chasn\u2019t delivered anything of substance, because that\u2019s not who he is\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning When Labor pursued Liu in parliament questioning whether she had inappropriate links with the Chinese Communist party, Morrison dismissed the questions as \u201cgrubby smear\u201d. Wong quotes a number of commentators who suggested Morrison had \u201cdone Beijing\u2019s work for it\u201d because the Chinese government often deflects criticism or scrutiny of alleged foreign interference with claims of racism. Wong accuses Morrison of having being similarly reckless in the handling of the relationship with China when he declared China was a developed country while in the US after attending a Trump rally. \u201cThis gave unnecessary fuel to the Chinese government\u2019s narrative that Australia just follows the United States; that when we make decisions that China doesn\u2019t like \u2013 on 5G or the South China Sea for example \u2013 we do so only because we have been asked to by the US.\u201d Wong argues that Australia must deal with strategic competition between the US and China and major global disruption but the Morrison government has \u201cno plan\u201d. The Lowy speech was \u201ca disturbingly lightweight speech for the prime minister of a third term government\u201d which \u201claid out no pathway on strategic competition \u2013 not one new idea, not one solution\u201d, Wong argues. Wong will say Labor is committed to engage on China in a bipartisan way but notes the government is yet to respond to Labor\u2019s proposal for better parliamentary briefings on the relationship.

On Friday the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, launched a wide-ranging attack on the Chinese Communist party, accusing it of engineering a series of cyber-attacks on Australian targets, stealing intellectual property and muzzling free speech. China\u2019s government rejected the \u201cirrational accusations\u201d, labelling them \u201cshocking and baseless\u201d. On Sunday the resources and northern Australia minister, Matt Canavan, defended Dutton\u2019s intervention, telling Sky News he was speaking \u201cthe facts of the matter \u2026 that our system of government, our philosophy, is inconsistent with communist regimes\u201d.

A sparkling return for Andrew Nabbout and Adama Traor\u00e9, league debuts for quality imports like Craig Noone, Javier Cabrera and Jakob Poulsen \u2013 perhaps even the best \u201cnon-goal celebration\u201d the league has seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/picture/2016/nov/23/david-squires-on-kerem-bulut-and-the-goal-that-never-was\">since Kerem Bulut\u2019s </a>\u2013 plenty to excite the 33,523 fans in attendance.</p> <p>And yet the immediate rearing of world football\u2019s b\u00eate noire, VAR, which made its presence felt keenly across the first three games of the round, again threatened to steal headlines. Kosta Barbarouses was denied an excellent goal on his Sydney debut by the width of a bee\u2019s proboscis. The new league owners may have shelled out $150,000 to bring in Hawkeye technology but when a goal that every real-speed replay suggests is onside is adjudged off, surely the next step is to install an agreed margin of error that maintains some semblance of a benefit to the attacking side.</p> <p>VAR also earned the ire of Central Coast Mariners coach Alen Stajcic, who saw his side denied a worthy point, courtesy of an 82nd minute VAR-adjudged penalty for handball. \u201cI don\u2019t know how that can be intentional when it deflects off a guy one yard away, at that speed,\u201d the former Matildas coach fumed at the post-match press conference.</p> <p>But lost in any VAR-related controversy was the actual story of the weekend: Toure, Joel King, Daniel Wilmering, Sam Silvera, Connor Metcalfe, and Louis D\u2019Arrigo. Have we ever seen so many teenagers appear during the opening round of an A-League season?</p> <p>\u201cAll the noise coming out of the clubs recently has been that they\u2019re going to tone down the investment in overseas players and focus on young locals,\u201d former A-League coach John Kosmina observed on Sunday, a point underlined by the long-overdue move to expand A-League benches, with spots now specifically earmarked for under-23 players.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/08/a-league-2019-20-season-preview-team-by-team-guide\">A-League 2019-20 season preview: team-by-team guide</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over the first three games of the opening round of the A-League 11 Australian teenagers were handed 546 minutes of competitive football.

      "bodyText": "The A-League has returned - and for all the criticism surrounding a lack of promotion ahead of the season\u2019s launch, it appears the best marketing remains the on-pitch product. Adelaide witnessed a pulsating five-goal feast on Friday night \u2013 a match illuminated by Nikola Mileusnic\u2019s superb free-kick, a goal on debut for youngster Al Hassan Toure, and Ryan McGowan\u2019s dramatic late winner to sink the hopes of his hometown fans. After three years in the wilderness Western Sydney Wanderers returned to Parramatta Stadium like heroes from the Odyssey \u2013 the introduction of safe-standing for active supporters was well-received, even if not all have returned yet to embrace Markus Babbel\u2019s work in progress. The Melbourne derby was a pageant of light and sound pre-game, and while there were some high-quality passages of play the caution of two newly-installed coaches slightly dulled a fixture that\u2019s positively bristled in recent years. A sparkling return for Andrew Nabbout and Adama Traor\u00e9, league debuts for quality imports like Craig Noone, Javier Cabrera and Jakob Poulsen \u2013 perhaps even the best \u201cnon-goal celebration\u201d the league has seen since Kerem Bulut\u2019s \u2013 plenty to excite the 33,523 fans in attendance. And yet the immediate rearing of world football\u2019s b\u00eate noire, VAR, which made its presence felt keenly across the first three games of the round, again threatened to steal headlines. Kosta Barbarouses was denied an excellent goal on his Sydney debut by the width of a bee\u2019s proboscis. The new league owners may have shelled out $150,000 to bring in Hawkeye technology but when a goal that every real-speed replay suggests is onside is adjudged off, surely the next step is to install an agreed margin of error that maintains some semblance of a benefit to the attacking side. VAR also earned the ire of Central Coast Mariners coach Alen Stajcic, who saw his side denied a worthy point, courtesy of an 82nd minute VAR-adjudged penalty for handball. \u201cI don\u2019t know how that can be intentional when it deflects off a guy one yard away, at that speed,\u201d the former Matildas coach fumed at the post-match press conference. But lost in any VAR-related controversy was the actual story of the weekend: Toure, Joel King, Daniel Wilmering, Sam Silvera, Connor Metcalfe, and Louis D\u2019Arrigo. Have we ever seen so many teenagers appear during the opening round of an A-League season? \u201cAll the noise coming out of the clubs recently has been that they\u2019re going to tone down the investment in overseas players and focus on young locals,\u201d former A-League coach John Kosmina observed on Sunday, a point underlined by the long-overdue move to expand A-League benches, with spots now specifically earmarked for under-23 players. Over the first three games of the opening round of the A-League 11 Australian teenagers were handed 546 minutes of competitive football. Last season, excluding the Kiwi duo of Sarpreet Singh and Liberato Cacace, the corresponding number was five minutes, with only Anthony Lesiotis coming on as a time-wasting substitute. As Australia contemplates 12 years without Olympics qualification for its men\u2019s Under-23 team, it\u2019s a critically important issue \u2013 and one that\u2019s been long deprioritised by Football Federation Australia. From a fan\u2019s perspective it\u2019s a no-brainer: short of watching a top-tier foreigner, an Ola Toivonen, Milo\u0161 Ninkovi\u0107 or Diego Castro tearing up the league, the thing that makes a season that\u2019s slipping away bearable is watching a local kid come good on the big stage. In 2012, just 91 minutes into his fledgling A-League career, a teenage Nabbout lit up the Big Blue with a match-winning brace off the bench against Alessandro Del Piero\u2019s Sydney FC. Despite his obvious potential, the flying winger saw just 686 minutes the rest of that season; the next year that decreased to 334; the next just 35 minutes. But for a lifeline three seasons ago from the bottom-of-the-table Newcastle Jets, the now Socceroo could have followed the path of Hagi Gligor, Anthony Kalik, Joe Caletti, Lachlan Scott or countless more talented youngsters lost to the A-League. In earlier years clubs like Central Coast made a reputation from blooding talented youth \u2013 Mat Ryan, Tom Rogic, Trent Sainsbury \u2013 the who\u2019s who of the present national team.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter?\u201d Donald Trump asked on Sunday, referring to the son of former vice-president Joe Biden. Hunter Biden\u2019s business interests overseas sit at the center of the House impeachment inquiry into Trump, who has admitted asking foreign powers to investigate. \u201cHe has totally disappeared!\u201d Trump tweeted on Sunday, adding without evidence the claim it \u201cnow looks like [Biden] has raided and scammed even more countries! Media is AWOL.\u201d In fact, the media swarmed to an internet post written by Hunter Biden\u2019s attorney, which said the 49-year-old would step down from the board of a Chinese-backed private equity firm at the end of the month, as part of a pledge not to work on behalf of any foreign-owned companies should his father win the White House. The post written by attorney George Mesires outlined a defence of the younger Biden\u2019s work with companies in Ukraine and China, which have emerged as one of Trump\u2019s chief lines of attack against his father despite no proof of impropriety in either case. \u201cHunter makes the following commitment,\u201d Mesires wrote. \u201cUnder a Biden administration, Hunter will readily comply with any and all guidelines or standards a President Biden may issue to address purported conflicts of interest, or the appearance of such conflicts, including any restrictions related to overseas business interests. \u201cIn any event, Hunter will agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign owned companies. He continued: \u201cHe will continue to keep his father personally uninvolved in his business affairs, while availing himself as necessary and appropriate to the Office of the White House Counsel to help inform his application of the Biden administration\u2019s guidelines or standards to his business decision-making.\u201d Last month, the White House released a transcript of a 25 July call in which Trump asks Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate Biden\u2019s family and Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 US election. The question of whether the call involved a quid pro quo for frozen US military aid weighs heavily on impeachment proceedings. Trump has also asked China to dig into Hunter Biden\u2019s work in that country, asserting without evidence that he earned $1.5bn from a \u201csweetheart\u201d business deal there. The president\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, is also under increasing scrutiny for his efforts to dig into Hunter Biden\u2019s background. Late last week, two businessmen who played key roles in Giuliani\u2019s efforts in Ukraine were charged with federal campaign finance violations. Joe Biden is a frontrunner for the Democratic nomination to face Trump next year, although he has lost considerable ground to the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren. Republicans reacted to news of Hunter Biden\u2019s decision to step away from the Chinese-backed company with deep skepticism. \u201cI think this is just another way to save a flailing campaign that\u2019s going down,\u201d Georgia representative Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House judiciary committee, told Sunday Morning Futures, on Fox News. \u201cHe knows he\u2019s in trouble and this is just another way to try and detract attention.\u201d White House counsellor Kellyanne Conway told the same show Hunter Biden \u201cshould have done this quite a while ago\u201d. \u201cThis is a part of how Donald Trump won in the first place saying that we\u2019re going to get rid of these sweetheart deals, we\u2019re going to make sure that we clean up the axis of power in a place like Washington DC where someone like Hunter Biden get a $50,000 a month retainer for Ukrainian energy company when everybody knows that he doesn\u2019t have that skill set.\u201d One of Joe Biden\u2019s Democratic presidential rivals noted, however, that Trump\u2019s children are openly trading on his name in business deals around the world. \u201cI think [Hunter Biden\u2019s move] demonstrates the difference in standards relative to the White House,\u201d Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cI mean, here you have Hunter Biden stepping down from a position in order to make sure, even though there\u2019s been no accusation of wrongdoing, doing something just to make sure there\u2019s not even the appearance of a conflict of interests, while, in the White House, the president of the United States is a walking conflict of interests.\u201d Mesires noted repeatedly that there is no evidence of wrongdoing against his client. \u201cDespite extensive scrutiny, at no time has any law enforcement agency, either domestic or foreign, alleged that Hunter engaged in wrongdoing at any point during his five-year term [in business in Ukraine],\u201d Mesires wrote. Of Biden\u2019s work related to China, the attorney said: \u201cTo date, Hunter has not received any compensation for being on BHR\u2019s board of directors. He has not received any return on his investment; there have been no distributions to BHR shareholders since Hunter obtained his equity interest.\u201d",

Manchester City might have come within a whisker of going the season undefeated but it was the Gunners who were the WSL\u2019s real team to beat and, powered by the goals of Vivianne Miedema \u2013 22 in all \u2013 they duly wrapped up the title with a game to spare.</p> <p><strong>This time it\u2019s City who have come bolting out of the traps</strong> (picking up their fourth win from four yesterday and yet to concede a goal), and ensuring that Joe Montemurro\u2019s side will have to strain every sinew if they\u2019re to retain their title. But with a flawless start of their own, the early signs are that it\u2019s a challenge Arsenal look up to.</p> <p><strong>Chelsea meanwhile have motivations of their own</strong>, not only looking to build on last season\u2019s third-place finish but also to get revenge over the team that did the double over them last term, most chasteningly with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/14/chelsea-arsenal-womens-super-league-match-report\">a 5-0 drubbing</a> at this very ground \u2013 their home turf \u2013 in October. A win today would not just help banish those memories, it would also see them leapfrog their fellow title-hopefuls into second. What more incentive do you need?

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s our report from Kingsmeadow: Here\u2019s Emma Hayes: \u201cI\u2019m sick to death of hearing about our slow start to last season. Thank god that\u2019s been put to bed. I had a great chat with Ramona [Bachmann] about how she could make a difference today. For her to come on and contribute the way she did \u2013 it\u2019s a coach\u2019s dream when that happens. I\u2019m so pleased for the squad today. \u201cAt half-time I told the players that we have to bee aggressive. We were too respectful. I said: \u2018You have to step up and produce performances like Ji\u2019s doing\u2019, because she was unreal in the first half. But I had no doubt we\u2019d win the game \u2013 and we did.\u201d A downbeat Joe Montemurro: \u201cWe played bad in the second half and got punished for it. We tired a bit, they pressed a little bit higher. But we made some fundamental errors in crucial areas and got punished.\u201d Elsewhere in the WSL, Reading have beaten Everton 3-2 and West Ham have won 3-1 at Brighton Beth England speaks: \u201cI\u2019m ecstatic. We went 1-0 down quite early, and we were a bit disappointed, but in the last 25 minutes of the half we controlled the game better. In the second half I though we came out and played brilliantly. And bloody hell, am I happy now! We\u2019ve beaten the champions \u2013 and fair play, that was a bloody tough game \u2013 so onwards and upwards.\u201d And there we have it. Chelsea deserve that win: they played with the greater purpose throughout and showed more invention in their play. The also pressed brilliantly, with an intensity Arsenal couldn\u2019t handle and it was that ploy which got them both their goals. Arsenal were outplayed, outfought \u2013 and out-tacticked. 92 mins: More defensive heroics from the hosts, the winger Cuthbert tracking back to meet a Little cross and make a last-ditch clearance. 90 mins: A close call for Chelsea as Berger gets down brilliantly to keep out a Mead toe-poke before Bright scrambles the rebound desperately to safety. 86 mins: Chelsea look to have won it! And \u2013 AGAIN \u2013 it comes from Arsenal getting dispossessed in a dangerous position, Bachmann latching on to the ball and, finding no way past McCabe, squaring simply to Thorisd\u00f3ttir who batters a 25-yarder that zooms though Zinsberger\u2019s fingertips and into the far corner. 83 mins: The stocky Bachmann rummages forward and rifles a shot at goal from distance, forcing Zinsberger to parry. Then Arsenal surge the length of the pitch to win a corner, but Berger claims it confidently. 81 mins: And she\u2019s injured herself taking that shot. Off she hobbles. 79 mins: Chelsea swarm again to reclaim possession in the Arsenal half, Ingle lays off to Ji whose snatched effort bobbles wide. Ji\u2019s been magnificent today \u2013 right up until she\u2019s got a sight of goal. 76 mins: Bachmann\u2019s first touch is to feed Mielde down the right, who picks out Ji at the far post, but the South Korean can\u2019t direct her header on target. 74 mins: That\u2019s Kirby\u2019s last action as she\u2019s replaced by Bachmann. 72 mins: Chelsea continue to press high with violent intent, but this time Arsenal play through it expertly and chart a path to the opposition box, but can\u2019t quite force the chance. Then Kirby sprints free, one-on-one with Williamson, who shepherds her wide and dispossesses \u2013 wonderful defending. The game is opening up. 70 mins: Ji picks out Kirby, who plays it cheekily against Evans for a corner. Williamson rises to head clear. 67 mins: Chelsea aren\u2019t settling for a draw. Cuthbert storms down the right and plants a ball straight down the Corridor of Uncertainty \u2013 but none of her attackers have gambled. 63 mins: Chelsea could be ahead. Reiten steals into space on the left and whips a first-time cross into England, who is in all sorts of space on the penalty spot. But her effort is horribly misjudged and she slices wide. Nobbs replaces Walti for Arsenal. 60 mins: The goal has woken Arsenal up. Their second attack in as many minutes sees the ball in the net, although the whistle has long gone before Miedema batters a loose ball underneath Berger \u2013 Mead, whose weaving run had made the chance, was just offside. And there it is. Chelsea get their equaliser, and the warning signs were there for Arsenal, whose dallying has finally cost them. It starts when Beattie strides forward to cut out a long ball on halfway but no sooner has she done so than Kirby has pounced to dispossess her, and she steams forward in behind the Arsenal defence, waiting until just the right moment to square for the onrushing England, who takes one touch to control and another to belt home from close range. 54 mins: Arsenal haven\u2019t got out of their half yet. This time it\u2019s Cuthbert who forages forward down the right; she\u2019s tackled but the ball breaks to Ji who strikes first time \u2013 but she snatches at it and the ball flies miles over the bar. 51 mins: Chelsea have picked up where they left off, pressing aggressively forward, and snapping into a nervy Arsenal backline whenever they try to play it out. The goal is coming, surely. 48 mins: England latches on to a long clearance down the right, making something from nothing, and drills in a low cross that Zinsberger spills. Reiten pounces, but is eased away by some smart defending from Evans. And we\u2019re back under way. Reiten gets things going with a backheeled volley to flick the ball down the line. Very nice. England takes the first shot of the half, belting over after having failed to connect with a laser-guided Ji cross. Good fun, that. Chelsea are moving the ball quicker, attacking with no little wit and have the game\u2019s two most dangerous players in Kirby and \u2013 especially \u2013 Ji. But Arsenal only need one more to kill the game off, and they have the division\u2019s deadliest finisher in Miedema. Or to put it another way: this game is very nicely poised indeed. And that\u2019s the last kick of the half. Arsenal, who lead, have looked decidedly shaky; Chelsea have played with drive and purpose but go in behind. Football! 47 mins: Cuthbert wriggles into space in the Arsenal half, and is about to fire at goal when Mead lunges in to commit a reckless foul. Reiten\u2019s free-kick is equally wild, sailing harmlessly over over. 45 mins: Chelsea don\u2019t want half-time to come here. They\u2019re turning the screw with real purpose, Arsenal camped in their own half. England has another headed chance, meeting a deep cross swung in from Ingle, but can\u2019t do enough with it to trouble Zinsberger. 42 mins: Ji collects the ball from Andersson\u2019s throw and drives towards Arsenal\u2019s defence. She tonks a long-ranger straight into the nearest defender. The corner is cleared. 38 mins: Eriksson hoofs aimlessly long, and it turns out to be a dangerous pass. Zindsberger is forced off her line to cut it out at the last. Then Arsenal pile forward and find themselves with a player over, but Miedema doesn\u2019t make the pass and instead sees her shot blocked. Frustrated, she hangs out a leg to block Berger\u2019s drop kick, and picks up a booking. 35 mins: Another Arsenal goal-kick, another Chelsea chance. This time they get as far as the halfway line before losing the ball, which find its way to Reiter who wastes no time in unleashing on goal. Her rasping left-foot drive rattles the bar. 31 mins: Walti and Van de Donk dance into the Chelsea box, exchanging passes to create an opening for the latter, but her low shot is blocked. Chelsea respond with a terrific spell of sustained possession that doesn\u2019t quite turn into a chance \u2013 Ji\u2019s final ball too heavy for England. 27 mins: Ji is a terrifically alert player: she has won the ball back numerous times in dangerous positions and does so again to spark an attack that comes to nothing before getting on the ball again, feeding Kirby whose strike whistles wide. It\u2019s hard to see Chelsea failing to score while those two are on the pitch. 25 mins: Arsenal mount an attack through Little, who looks for Miedema\u2019s goalward run with a precise lofted pass, but Eriksson watches it closely and heads clear. 21 mins: Ji snatches possession in midfield, drives forward and offloads to Reiten. She swings in a looping cross towards England, who puts a tricky header wide. Then, from the resulting goal-kick, Arsenal pass themselves into trouble again \u2013 Ji spots the dithering, pounces and curls a 20-yard strike inches wide. 18 mins: England scampers into space on the right and latches onto a nice long ball from Bright, though McCabe has her on a tight leash. Ji takes over but is crowded out as she enters the box and hits the deck. Chelsea are attacking purposefully but can\u2019t quite engineer a chance. 15 mins: Chelsea threaten again with the impish Kirby pouncing on a loose ball in the Arsenal half and feeding Reiten, who can\u2019t quite get it under control. 12 mins: Chelsea have responded well, Kirby beginning to dictate things in the middle and almost finishing off a move she started by getting on the end of Andersson\u2019s cross from the left. Bright takes leave from centre-back duties to maraud forward into the box as Chelsea attack \u2013 they mean business. Arsenal score with their first attack of note, and it\u2019s a lovely, neat goal. Miedema drops into space and collects the ball on the right, snaking forward before picking out Van de Donk, who has beaten the offside trap and rifles a cool finish low across the keeper. Game on! 6 mins: Arsenal get themselves in trouble, insisting on passing it intricately out from a goal-kick. Evans is soon dispossessed in the right-back spot and Kirky is played clean through, albeit at an acute angle. Zinsberger comes out and smothers. The resulting corner is scrambled desperately clear. 4 mins: An early sighter for Miedema, who jinks into space on the D and curls a shot off the underside of the bar, though the whistle had already gone \u2013 offside. 2 mins: Some dainty playing-it-out-from-the-back stuff from Arsenal comes to an abrupt end when McCabe hoofs the ball semi-aimlessly down the left. Chelsea gather and duly hoof it back. Look away now, Pep. And we\u2019re off. Chelsea take kickoff and make early inroads towards the Arsenal box, but the attack fizzles out. The teams are out. Handshakes are exchanged and game faces are on. Kickoff imminent. A run-through of the day\u2019s other WSL action: Liverpool and Bristol City played out a 1-1 draw, Mel Lawley salvaging a point for the Merseysiders from the spot late on, while WSL newcomers Manchester United travelled to Spurs and gave their hosts a tonking, 3-0. Those two are final scores, and right now West Ham lead Brighton 1-0 while Reading and Everton are locked at 2-2 \u2013 both of those games at half-time. Chelsea: Berger; Mjelde, Bright, Eriksson, Andersson; Cuthbert, Ingle; Ji, Reiten, Kirby; England. Subs: Thorisdottir, Asante, Carter, Cooper, Bachmann, Spence, Telford. Arsenal: Zinsberger; Evans, Williamson, Beattie, McCabe; W\u00e4lti, Little, Roord, Van de Donk; Miedema, Mead. Subs: Peyraud-Magnin, Mitchell, Quinn, Veje, Nobbs, Grant, Filis. Last season Arsenal set the standard. Manchester City might have come within a whisker of going the season undefeated but it was the Gunners who were the WSL\u2019s real team to beat and, powered by the goals of Vivianne Miedema \u2013 22 in all \u2013 they duly wrapped up the title with a game to spare. This time it\u2019s City who have come bolting out of the traps (picking up their fourth win from four yesterday and yet to concede a goal), and ensuring that Joe Montemurro\u2019s side will have to strain every sinew if they\u2019re to retain their title. But with a flawless start of their own, the early signs are that it\u2019s a challenge Arsenal look up to. Chelsea meanwhile have motivations of their own, not only looking to build on last season\u2019s third-place finish but also to get revenge over the team that did the double over them last term, most chasteningly with a 5-0 drubbing at this very ground \u2013 their home turf \u2013 in October. A win today would not just help banish those memories, it would also see them leapfrog their fellow title-hopefuls into second. What more incentive do you need? Strap in.",

Pope Francis then credited Newman with curing Villalobos, who went on to have two more children. \u201cIt\u2019s such a joyous day for me to see Newman become a saint,\u201d Villalobos said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been waiting for this since the minute I was created and here it is.

By conceding that any customs border will have to be in the Irish Sea, Boris Johnson appears to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/13/labour-destroyed-if-leave-mps-help-boris-johnson-win-brexit-majority\" title=\"\">revived the possibility</a> of a Brexit deal. But the focus on the politics of the Irish border risks missing the implications of his proposals for the economy of the UK as a whole. And, as we reveal in our <a href=\"https://ukandeu.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-economic-impact-of-Boris-Johnsons-Brexit-proposals.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a> for The UK in a Changing Europe, these are significantly worse than was the case for Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan.</p> <p>Indeed, Johnson\u2019s motivations for ditching May\u2019s withdrawal agreement have little if anything to do with Northern Ireland. Rather, it is because the new prime minister sees the ultimate relationship the UK should have with the EU very differently to his predecessor. Gone is the notion that a shared customs territory and close regulatory alignment on goods should form a \u201cbridge\u201d to the long-term relationship. As Johnson put it himself in his letter to Jean-Claude Juncker: \u201cThe backstop acted as a bridge to a proposed future relationship with the EU in which the UK could be closely integrated with the EU customs arrangements and would align with EU law in many areas. That proposed future relationship is not the goal of the current UK government. The government intends that the future relationship should be based on a free trade agreement in which the UK takes control of its own regulatory affairs and trade policy.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Relative to the status quo and May\u2019s proposals, the economic impact of these proposals would be significant and negative</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So this isn\u2019t about Ireland. It\u2019s about our long-term relationship with the EU. And the bottom line is that the prime minister envisages a far looser relationship than his predecessor.</p> <p>From what we can ascertain (and remember, we cannot be certain what the government will want in the way of a future relationship until negotiations start) the present government is seeking a goods-only or \u201cCanada minus\u201d deal. This will involve only minimal coverage of services. It will also involve significant non-tariff barriers on trade, given that the UK will be in its own customs territory while only Northern Ireland will be bound by EU rules on agriculture and goods.</p> <p>Even if Johnson were to change his mind and decide he wanted a closer relationship, it is entirely possible it would not be on offer. The current government has refused to sign up to EU level playing field provisions on labour and environmental standards. The proximity of the UK mean that it would insist on such provisions in return for access to the EU market. Without them it will be difficult for the UK to reach a comprehensive free trade agreement with the bloc.</p> <p>So what would this mean for the economy? Based on the reduction in trade alone, under May\u2019s deal (assuming no productivity effect, on which more in a moment) income per capita would have been 1.7% lower than under membership. The equivalent figure for the Johnson deal is 2.5%, while that for a World Trade Organization Brexit (no trade deal at all) is 3.3%.</p> <p>However, economists are convinced that reductions in trade also affect productivity. The literature suggests that a 1% decline in trade reduces income per capita by about 0.5%. If, then, we combine this productivity effect with the trade impacts summarised above, we arrive at per capita GDP figures of -4.9%, -6.4% and -8.1% for May\u2019s deal, Johnson\u2019s proposals and a WTO Brexit respectively, as compared with membership.</p> <p>Our findings, in other words, suggest that, relative both to the status quo of EU membership and to May\u2019s proposals, the economic impact of Johnson\u2019s proposals would be significant and negative.</p> <p>This being said, there are steps the government can take to mitigate this impact.

But Esper warned on Fox News Sunday that Trump and other officials may yet create complications for the compliance before Tuesday\u2019s deadline for him to respond. \u201cI don\u2019t know what restrictions we may have internally in regard to releasing them,\u201d Esper said. \u201cThe White House has a say on the release of documents as well.\u201d Democrats are investigating whether Trump withheld military aid worth $250m for Ukraine as leverage while urging its leader to investigate unfounded allegations of corruption against the son of former vice-president Joe Biden, the Democratic frontrunner to face Trump in next year\u2019s election. The Democratic chairmen of three House committees sent a subpoena to Esper on 7 October, giving him until 15 October to respond and warning that failing to do so would constitute evidence of obstruction. The day after the subpoena was sent to the Pentagon, Trump\u2019s White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, sent senior Democrats an extraordinary eight-page letter that made several sweeping and false claims about the impeachment inquiry\u2019s legal basis. Declaring the inquiry to be illegitimate, Cipollone wrote that Trump \u201ccannot permit\u201d his administration to comply with the inquiry and \u201cthe executive branch cannot be expected to participate in it\u201d. The impeachment inquiry began after a CIA whistleblower told the watchdog for the US intelligence agencies Trump withheld the delivery of military equipment to pressure Ukraine\u2019s government to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter. The White House then released a partial transcript of a 25 July telephone call between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, which confirmed that Trump urged Zelenskiy to look into the Bidens and a conspiracy theory related to Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. Trump denies there was a quid pro quo, despite his own White House transcript showing that when Zelenskiy raised the US military assistance, Trump said: \u201cI would like you to do us a favour though\u201d. The impeachment inquiry has also obtained text messages sent between top US officials in the region. In one message, a senior US diplomat in Ukraine, William Taylor, told US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland: \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d In a potential blow to Trump, Sondland \u2013 previously considered a loyalist \u2013 is reportedly preparing to testify that Trump possibly did consider the Biden investigation and delivery of the aid to be a quid pro quo. The Washington Post reported that the ambassador will tell Congress this week that he worked to persuade Ukraine to announce an inquiry into an energy company where Hunter Biden worked, and dangled a meeting at the White House for Zelenskiy as an incentive. Sondland reportedly intends to claim he did not realise the company was linked to the Bidens. \u201cIt was a quid pro quo, but not a corrupt one,\u201d the Post reported a person familiar with Sondland\u2019s testimony had said in summarising Sondland\u2019s position. Esper did not answer on Sunday when asked if Trump had ever explained to him why the president had reportedly gone against the views of Pentagon officials and withheld the aid to Ukraine, which is fighting Russian-backed separatists in the east. \u201cI have nothing to share with you on this,\u201d Esper said on Fox News Sunday. Representative Adam Schiff, the California Democrat effectively leading the impeachment inquiry as chair of the House intelligence committee, said the whistleblower may now not be called to testify, amid concerns for his safety after Trump labelled him a traitor. \u201cYes we were interested in having the whistleblower come forward,\u201d Schiff told Face the Nation. \u201cOur primary interest right now is to make sure that person is protected.\u201d A lawyer for Hunter Biden said his client would resign from his job at a Chinese company, a position that has attracted further attacks from Trump and his allies. Biden would also not serve on the boards of foreign companies if his father is elected president, the lawyer said.",

A freedom of information request by the Independent showed a similar rise in the number of religiously motivated hate crimes at universities. Antisemitic or Islamophobic incidents were reported in 26 UK universities. The situation became so dire that the Equality and Human Rights Commission, a public body in England and Wales that promotes and enforces equality and non-discrimination laws in the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/04/equality-watchdog-launches-inquiry-into-racial-harassment-at-universities\" title=\"\">launched an official inquiry</a> into what seemed to be an epidemic of racism.

University campuses have always made the establishment nervous, with student bodies easily able to organise around progressive causes. The targeting of these spaces is an old weapon in the culture wars, one that aims to discredit and discourage challenges to the status quo from the left, and from marginalised groups whose entry into the mainstream happens via higher education. But students have somehow been vandalising academic freedom since at least the 1960s without bringing about a political coup run by ethnic minorities and queer people. The reality is that universities in the UK remain deeply conservative organisations that not only do not coddle students\u2019 minds, but also fail to protect them against the most basic violations. So I ask you again, have you heard about the real crisis on British campuses? \u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist",

Yes, executives pocketed \u00a320m in bonuses alone in the past five years. However in practice, not all of that money is going to be returned.

MPs will want successive chief executives to explain how it was allowed to borrow so much. Much of the debt accumulated under acquisition-happy former boss Manny Fontenla-Novoa, while Green, his successor, took over a company that borrowed even more to survive. The committee will also want to know why auditors, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/18/big-four-auditors-failing-watchdog-not-fit\">already under intense scrutiny</a> in the wake of a series of high profile business failures, such as Carillion and BHS, signed off the accounts as the debt piled up.</p> <p><strong>Who knew what \u2013 and for how long \u2013 about the company\u2019s problems?<br></strong>Details of meetings with ministers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/29/andrea-leadsom-under-fire-over-lack-of-talks-thomas-cook-collapse\">revealed by the Guardian</a>, show that Thomas Cook executives held increasingly frequent summits with ministers in the months leading up to its failure. In fact, the Civil Aviation Authority had earmarked the company for enhanced monitoring in November 2018, having become alarmed by successive profit warnings. The department for transport was the main point of contact with Thomas Cook but directors also met ministers from multiple government departments as its woes mounted. Strangely, the department for business was not one of them. The select committee that holds that department to account will likely want to know why.

The transport minister, Grant Shapps, has since said that to invest taxpayers\u2019 cash into a failing business would have been throwing good money after bad. But company sources have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/23/squadrons-start-flying-150000-thomas-cook-customers-back-to-uk\">previously told the Guardian</a> that a last-ditch rescue, backed by the Spanish and Turkish governments, was in place but melted away once Westminster made clear it didn\u2019t believe Thomas Cook was salvageable. The committee has yet to summon ministers to give evidence but may yet do so, depending on what executives reveal about their discussions with the government.</p> <p><strong>Is the package holiday doomed?<br></strong>According to Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2019/oct/01/its-screwed-michael-olearys-bleak-forecast-for-the-package-holiday-market\">package holiday is \u201cscrewed\u201d</a>. MPs will be wondering whether a reckoning is coming in the wider tourism industry as the internet becomes even more embedded in the way British people buy holidays. There remain more than 3,000 bricks-and-mortar travel agents, so a wider industry issue could accelerate the problems already facing the high street, risking more redundancies. That being said, figures from the Office for National Statistics and tour operator industry body Abta indicate that packages are still in demand, with people buying them in their millions.</p>",

Ultimately no rescue deal for the whole business materialised. But events since the tour operator\u2019s failure raise doubts about the notion that the business was a total disaster area. The airline was profitable and family-run Hays Travel had to beat off competition to buy the high street shop network, expressing confidence that it was a viable business. Overseas divisions such as the Condor airline in Germany have been kept going with money from their governments. Should the UK government have bailed it out? As the end neared, Thomas Cook directors wanted the government to step in with some sort of financial support but were met with a flat refusal. The transport minister, Grant Shapps, has since said that to invest taxpayers\u2019 cash into a failing business would have been throwing good money after bad. But company sources have previously told the Guardian that a last-ditch rescue, backed by the Spanish and Turkish governments, was in place but melted away once Westminster made clear it didn\u2019t believe Thomas Cook was salvageable. The committee has yet to summon ministers to give evidence but may yet do so, depending on what executives reveal about their discussions with the government. Is the package holiday doomed? According to Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary, the package holiday is \u201cscrewed\u201d. MPs will be wondering whether a reckoning is coming in the wider tourism industry as the internet becomes even more embedded in the way British people buy holidays. There remain more than 3,000 bricks-and-mortar travel agents, so a wider industry issue could accelerate the problems already facing the high street, risking more redundancies. That being said, figures from the Office for National Statistics and tour operator industry body Abta indicate that packages are still in demand, with people buying them in their millions.",

      "bodyText": "It is perhaps ironic that the vastly experienced, smooth as silk, inherently funny stage actor Stephen Moore, who has died aged 81, should be remembered mostly for voicing a robot, the paranoid android Marvin in the original radio series of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. Douglas Adams\u2019s hilarious science-fiction adventure began in 1978 and Moore stayed with it through four more series, the television show (still just the voice), the records and the audio books. In a general sense, he was the voice of the show, as he picked off other roles when something different was needed \u2013 these included a mouse, a whale, and the ruler of the universe \u2013 and recorded the entire run of Hitchhiker books, on his own, for EMI. But even just vocally his range was considerable, as demonstrated in his regular appearances on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Poetry Please, or his leading roles in radio versions of Madame Bovary (with Nicola Pagett and Roger Allam), Dostoevsky\u2019s The Idiot and Marlowe\u2019s Dr Faustus. Then again, on television, where he was first noted in a 1962 version of Jean Anouilh\u2019s Dinner With the Family \u2013 \u201cand introducing Stephen Moore\u201d read the cast list headed by Jeremy Brett and Ren\u00e9e Houston \u2013 he was as adept in comedy as he was in classic serials. In the 1980s, he was Felicity Kendal\u2019s live-in boyfriend in the first series of Solo written by Carla Lane (his character was thrown out for sleeping with Kendal\u2019s best friend), Adrian Mole\u2019s dad in two series of Sue Townsend\u2019s saga and David Lodge\u2019s flustered academic Philip Swallow in Small World. Later, he appealed to wider audiences as Kevin\u2019s dad in Harry Enfield and Chums (1997-98) and as Eldane, the scaly-skinned leader of the Silurians in Doctor Who (2010). To many of these roles he brought the same brand of casual insouciance that became his trademark over three decades at both the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company. For Moore, the quietest and least lauded of all leading actors, was a star by stealth, an actor\u2019s actor admired equally by peers and critics. He was tall, rangy, and curiously similar to a walking question mark. His remarkable career embraced the last efflorescence of the Old Vic (1959-61) before the Olivier National supplanted it, the RSC and Royal Court heydays in the 1970s and then the reviving influx of the fringe; he was as much at home, and as charmingly revelatory, in the plays of Alan Ayckbourn as he was in those of Sam Shepard, David Hare and Howard Brenton. At the National he featured significantly in Hare\u2019s brilliant Plenty (1978) and Brenton\u2019s controversial The Romans in Britain (1980), as well as in Ayckbourn\u2019s epic comedies Bedroom Farce (1977) and A Small Family Business (1987). Moore\u2019s grounding was at the Bristol Old Vic and the Central School of Speech and Drama, where he trained and won the Laurence Olivier medal. He was born in Brixton, south London, to the solicitor Stanley Moore and his wife, Mary (nee Bruce-Anderson), and was educated at the Archbishop Tenison\u2019s grammar school in Kennington. After Central (1956-59), he went straight into the Old Vic, where he played William in As You Like It, Slender in The Merry Wives of Windsor, Flute in A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream and Andrew Aguecheek in Twelfth Night. His comic, slightly gauche and tender stage personality was thus established, and he developed further in Jacobean comedy, Dostoevsky\u2019s The Possessed and The Trojan Wars (as Achilles and Polymestor) at Bernard Miles\u2019s Mermaid in Puddle Dock. He then went into regional rep at Windsor and Colchester before returning to Bristol where, under the directorship of Val May, he achieved prominence in The Iceman Cometh and Hedda Gabler, and as Petruchio in The Taming of the Shrew. He appeared with Ralph Richardson and Jill Bennett in John Osborne\u2019s West of Suez at the Royal Court in 1971 and formed a tingling love triangle with Jane Asher and James Bolam in Christopher Hampton\u2019s underrated Treats, which transferred from the Court to the Mayfair in 1976. His television profile sharpened, too, in this decade, with stand-out performances in Tom Stoppard\u2019s 1975 adaptation of Three Men in a Boat (alongside Tim Curry and Michael Palin in Stephen Frears\u2019s film) and as the morose leftwing teacher married to Julie Covington in the first 1976 series of Rock Follies. At the National in the 1980s he was a notable Cassio to Paul Scofield\u2019s magisterial Othello; an insinuating Grand Inquisitor to Michael Gambon\u2019s breakthrough triumph as Brecht\u2019s Galileo; a villainous lank-haired magistrate in Howard Davies\u2019s glorious revival of Dion Boucicault\u2019s The Shaughraun (in which the theatre\u2019s great revolve was properly used for the first time, conjuring the landscapes of County Sligo); and a grinning booby in Richard Eyre\u2019s large-hearted version of Ben Jonson\u2019s Bartholomew Fair, enunciated with relish. In the same period he did not forget the RSC, supporting Judi Dench\u2019s shock-haired Mother Courage as the sardonic chaplain, winning an Olivier best actor award as Torvald in Adrian Noble\u2019s staging of A Doll\u2019s House, succeeding John Thaw as Cardinal Wolsey in Henry VIII (with the title role played by Richard Griffiths) when Davies\u2019s production moved from Stratford-upon-Avon to the Barbican and playing to stylish perfection the worldly-wise cynic Hallam Matthews in a brave revival of John Whiting\u2019s A Penny for a Song. One of Moore\u2019s great abilities was to create a performance of subtlety and nuance and expand into a large arena like the Olivier at the NT without any sign of strain or loss of ease; and this he did as the older Peer Gynt in 1990, though on reflection he felt that he could equally have been entrusted with the younger Peer, whom David Morrissey projected as a Scouse tearaway in Declan Donnellan\u2019s production. In between his last NT appearances \u2013 as the Mayor in Ibsen\u2019s An Enemy of the People (with Ian McKellen and Penny Downie) in 1998 and the savagely exasperated Roote in Harold Pinter\u2019s The Hothouse in 2007 \u2013 he toured as Colonel Pickering in My Fair Lady and as the inspirational teacher Hector in Alan Bennett\u2019s The History Boys. He was always a reassuring presence on film, even as a military bigwig in Richard Attenborough\u2019s blockbuster war movie A Bridge Too Far (1977) with Dirk Bogarde and Michael Caine, but he was a better fit in a handful of quirky, even eccentric British movies ranging from Lindsay Anderson\u2019s The White Bus (1967) to Christopher Morahan\u2019s Clockwise (1986) and Richard Curtis\u2019s The Boat That Rocked (2009), in which he led a right-wing government trying to close down a pirate radio station run by Bill Nighy and his tempestuous, mid-Atlantic deejay, Philip Seymour Hoffman, channelling Emperor Rosko.

      "bodyText": "Hong Kong protesters have deployed a new strategy of popping up in small groups in multiple locations across the city in an effort to avoid arrest, during their ongoing campaign against police and the local government. Small flashmobs of protesters demonstrated across a dozen districts after a call for protesters to \u201cblossom everywhere\u201d on Sunday, with many staying closer to home where they could evade police on foot or by bus. As teargas was fired against protesters in Shatin and Tsuen Wan districts, 11km (7 miles) apart, demonstrators elsewhere could be seen chanting together inside local malls or vandalising stores with links to pro-government tycoons. The fragmented strategy is in part a response to the politicisation of the city\u2019s MTR subway system, which has remained only semi-functioning since 4 October when chief executive Carrie Lam invoked emergency powers to ban masks at demonstrations. As thousands of residents took to the streets on the night of 4 October, the MTR corporation closed the city\u2019s entire subway line with services suspended for much of the subsequent weekend in an unofficial curfew. Dozens of stations remained closed on the following days because of vandalism while city-wide service has remained limited for the past week, closing hours earlier than normal, with unscheduled station closures in response to demonstrations. The subway once played a vital link allowing protesters to quickly avoid police and cross Hong Kong harbour in their protest strategy known as \u201cbe water\u201d \u2013 a play on a saying by Hong Kong-American actor Bruce Lee on how to evade one\u2019s enemies. The tactic has become a liability for protesters as riot police have been stationed near the main subway exits on protest days as well as at ferry terminals and other transit points. \u201cSince October, the police are stopping all kinds of people [at the subway],\u201d said Anna, 21, a masked protester who was part of a small unit of demonstrators in Mong Kok shopping district playing cat-and-mouse with half a dozen riot police vehicles. \u201cWe are Pien Dei Hoi Fa [blossoming everywhere],\u201d she said, while behind her a group of fellow protesters smashed up a traffic light.

      "bodyText": "The authority responsible for the Lake District has become the focus of angry protest from residents and campaigners over accusations that it has turned the region into a theme park. Keswick town council passed a historic and unanimous vote of no confidence against the Lake District National Park Authority (LDNPA) over its decision to resurface a path to make it more accessible to cyclists. Keswick represents almost 20% of the population of the Lake District. The unprecedented vote in Keswick follows a series of disagreements between the park authority and local councillors, residents and campaigners, with the latter claiming that commercial interests are being put ahead of the needs of people who live and work in the community. Five days ago senior leaders at the park authority voted against a ban on recreational off-road vehicles which devastate farm tracks, churning up soil and exposing the bedrock beneath, leaving them impassable to farm traffic. The park\u2019s rights of way committee voted to continue to allow 4x4s and trail motorbikes to use two lanes across farmland left to the trust by the author Beatrix Potter. The latest dispute focuses on the reinstatement of a foot and cycle path from Keswick to Threlkeld which was destroyed by Storm Desmond in 2015. Friends of the Lake District claims that using tarmac along the former railway line will compromise the historic and rural character of the route and make it more dangerous to use in icy weather. Lorayne Wall, the planning officer for Friends of the Lake District, said the LDNPA had granted planning permission to the project, for which it is also the developer, despite clear opposition from local residents and politicians over the choice of surface. \u201cWe are asking for a more natural or natural-looking surfacing, similar in nature to the type of surfacing already used along much of the route and visually more in-keeping with the surroundings,\u201d she added. The decision to oppose a ban on off-road vehicles on farm trails was made despite an online petition of 300,000 signatures and pleas from the local community, the trust and the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), which advises Unesco on protecting world heritage sites such as the Lake District. Councillor Tony Lywood, who is also a board member of the park authority, said it was pursuing policies that are damaging to the beauty of the area. \u201cThe fact that this largely unelected and unaccountable body can now even consider zip wires over Thirlmere [a plan that was abandoned last year], 4x4s in Little Langdale, gondolas [cable cars] up to Whinlatter and now a scarring four-mile-long strip of tarmac beneath Blencathra is deeply concerning. \u201cAs someone said at the Keswick town council meeting, \u2018This is the Lake District National Park not the Lake District Theme Park,\u2019\u201d he added. Lywood called for the authority to be democratised with elected members, allowing those with senior positions to be held accountable for their actions. The vote has no official implications for the authority, but Richard Leafe, the chief executive, said he was deeply disappointed, and insisted the decision on how to rebuild the former railway line had been taken after full consultation. In a blogpost on the park authority\u2019s website, Leafe wrote: \u201cWe have listened to users from the start of this project and will continue to do so.

For almost a decade now, observers have understood that restricting the flow of money to the fossil fuel industry is a key part of the climate fight.

Undaunted, she joins a travelling horseback library, through which she meets a remarkable group of women and learns that independence is born of friendship and self-fulfilment. Based on a true story \u2013 the library was an initiative of Eleanor Roosevelt\u2019s \u2013 Moyes\u2019s book delivers evocative descriptions of the Kentucky landscape and rich historical detail, as well as thoughtfully probing themes of class, race, poverty and violence. But it is in her compassionate portrayal of well-drawn characters that the novel\u2019s greatest strength lies.</p> <h2>Letters from an Astrophysicist</h2> <p>Neil deGrasse Tyson<br><em>Penguin, \u00a314.99, pp272</em></p> <p>This selection of candid correspondence compiled by the celebrity scientist covers everything from life and death to hope, hate and race. In one, Tyson is replying to his friend Henry Louis Gates, declining an invitation to take part in Gates\u2019s genealogy series: \u201cI don\u2019t look to relatives. I look to all human beings. That is the genetic relationship that matters to me.\u201d When fans write to share their personal fears, Tyson is equally forthright: \u201cDon\u2019t fear change or failure. The only thing to fear is loss of ambition.\u201d</p> <h2>The Pianist of Yarmouk</h2> <p>Aeham Ahmad<br><em>Penguin, \u00a39.99, pp288</em></p> <p>In 2014, a photograph appeared in newspapers around the world, of a young man playing the piano amid the rubble in Damascus. The man was Aeham Ahmad, a second-generation Palestinian refugee.

      "bodyText": "The Giver of Stars Jojo Moyes Penguin, \u00a320, pp400 In 1930s Kentucky, Alice Wright marries an American to escape her claustrophobic English family, only to find herself stuck with an inattentive husband and an overbearing father-in-law. Undaunted, she joins a travelling horseback library, through which she meets a remarkable group of women and learns that independence is born of friendship and self-fulfilment. Based on a true story \u2013 the library was an initiative of Eleanor Roosevelt\u2019s \u2013 Moyes\u2019s book delivers evocative descriptions of the Kentucky landscape and rich historical detail, as well as thoughtfully probing themes of class, race, poverty and violence. But it is in her compassionate portrayal of well-drawn characters that the novel\u2019s greatest strength lies. Letters from an Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson Penguin, \u00a314.99, pp272 This selection of candid correspondence compiled by the celebrity scientist covers everything from life and death to hope, hate and race. In one, Tyson is replying to his friend Henry Louis Gates, declining an invitation to take part in Gates\u2019s genealogy series: \u201cI don\u2019t look to relatives. I look to all human beings. That is the genetic relationship that matters to me.\u201d When fans write to share their personal fears, Tyson is equally forthright: \u201cDon\u2019t fear change or failure. The only thing to fear is loss of ambition.\u201d The Pianist of Yarmouk Aeham Ahmad Penguin, \u00a39.99, pp288 In 2014, a photograph appeared in newspapers around the world, of a young man playing the piano amid the rubble in Damascus. The man was Aeham Ahmad, a second-generation Palestinian refugee. His memoir tells of the difficulties growing up in Syria, life in a refugee camp in Yarmouk and about facing the daily threat of bombs and snipers. His piano was eventually burned, and the family\u2019s music shop bombed. Now living in Germany, having escaped the Syrian conflict with his wife and children in 2015, Ahmad has created a moving and visceral account of conflict, hope and the power of music. \u2022 To order The Giver of Stars, Letters from an Astrophysicist or The Pianist of Yarmouk go to guardianbookshop.com or call 020-3176 3837.

Yet, underneath it all, he struggled with the dog version of impostor syndrome. Biff was a bag of masked insecurity. He was like the kid in school who says he has seen all the scary movies, but refuses to go to any sleepovers where scary movies are played; the kid who has \u201ca girlfriend at another school\u201d. It was that fragile side I especially loved about Biff during my teenage years. We shared an insecurity that neither of us had the cognitive skills to put into words. This was a friendship \u2013 one that lasted as he grew older, grumpier and more infirm.</p> <p>He was an exceptionally licky dog, and loved nothing more than slurping his tongue over our jeans, shoes, socks and coats. Officially, this behaviour was something we attempted to quash \u2013 but, every few nights, I would tiptoe into the kitchen and allow him to lick my naked hands and wrists to his heart\u2019s content. For me, the sensation was tickly and calming, and never once disgusting, even though those around me told me it was not a good idea, mainly because it was highly likely that, on any given day, Biff had stuck his snout into some poor fox\u2019s rotting cadaver. I didn\u2019t care. I washed my hands like a surgeon afterwards, obviously. But it was what Biff wanted.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t had a dog since Biff (I\u2019m nearly 40), and my family and I are deciding whether it\u2019s time to get our own dog. This feels like a very big decision. Part of the reason we want a dog is that we want to walk more. We want to be healthier. We want to be happier.

But amid continuing questions over her right to diplomatic immunity, it is not clear if she will return to the UK to fulfil a promise to answer police questions about her role in the car crash.

Mark Stephens, one of the legal specialists advising the parents, told the Guardian: \u201cThe family\u2019s preference now is for a private meeting with Sacoolas to discover what happened and to secure some kind of emotional closure.

      "body": "<p>Martin Scorsese returns with his best picture since GoodFellas and one of his best films ever. It\u2019s a superbly acted, thrillingly shot epic mob procedural about violence, betrayal, dishonesty and emotional bankruptcy starring Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Al Pacino, set in a time before \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d had been formally diagnosed but when everyone lived with the symptoms. The film has been talked about for the hi-tech \u201cyouthification\u201d technology which allows De Niro to appear as a younger man: it\u2019s no more artificial than the traditional wigs, latex etc and it\u2019s amazing how quickly you get used to it. De Niro\u2019s eyes achieve an eerie, gluey gleam in this manifestation as a digital ghost from his past.</p> <p>These are men conducting their business with sorrowful hints and shrugs and mutterings about who has gone too far, who has not shown respect, who will need to be persuaded to attend a sit-down to straighten this whole thing out. These solemnly or cordially euphemistic encounters in a subdued steakhouse light periodically explode into violence or dreamlike scenes of choreographed catastrophe, punctuated by gunshots or visceral jukebox slams on the soundtrack. And all given a queasy new resonance of political conspiracy and bad faith.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHXxVmeGQUc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WHXxVmeGQUc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This is the story of Philadelphia mob murderer Frank \u201cThe Irishman\u201d Sheeran and his part in the mysterious disappearance of Teamsters union boss Jimmy Hoffa in 1975. Screenwriter Steven Zaillian has adapted the 2004 true-crime bestseller I Heard You Paint Houses by Charles Brandt which sensationally established the importance of Sheeran to Hoffa (Sheeran is absent from Danny DeVito\u2019s 1992 movie about Hoffa.) \u201cPaint houses\u201d is code for carry out mob hits, that is: paint them with blood - a phrase which is finally to have a horrible final significance for Hoffa himself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/13/the-irishman-martin-scorsese-defends-decision-to-go-with-netflix\">Martin Scorsese defends decision to make deal with Netflix for The Irishman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For his cast, Scorsese has assembled a trio of galacticos, a superstar repertory of players giving him (and us) performances of wintry brilliance, ebullience and regret. Robert De Niro\u2019s stolid unemotionalism makes the purest sense here in the role of Sheeran, the second world war veteran whose military experience densensitised him to killing and more importantly schooled him in the Nuremberg ethic of following orders; he is someone who executed enemy prisoners in cold blood.</p> <p>After the war, he gets a job driving trucks and doing odd jobs, and falls under the influence of two competing father figures. The first is Russell Bufalino, the senior mob guy who likes Frank\u2019s style and taciturn efficiency. For this role, Scorsese has got Joe Pesci out of retirement and Pesci is a marvel in the role: not scary or bad-tempered as he has famously been in the past, but a quietly spoken grandfather figure, a fixer, a haver-of-quiet-words, as lined and leathery as a tortoise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d13e935596e627b6ea68b192cccc022f3e36008b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d13e935596e627b6ea68b192cccc022f3e36008b/254_0_3507_2105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Pesci in The Irishman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Pesci in The Irishman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is Bufalino who introduces Frank to his great mentor, Teamsters chief Jimmy Hoffa \u2013 a glorious performance from Al Pacino, the preening politician and local chieftain of brutal ersatz charm, in love with the sound of own husky voice. It is Hoffa who has cultivated the Teamsters\u2019 gangster links \u2013 loaning the wiseguys cash from the union pension fund, and in return taking a slice of the interest rate, and getting mob \u201cmuscle\u201d for when people need to be intimidated.</p> <p>This is how he comes into contact with Frank, and so a great friendship is born. Frank becomes Jimmy\u2019s factotum, bodyguard, consigliere and pal, often sharing a hotel suite with him; they get into their pyjamas together like a poignant old married couple. Jimmy is very keen on Frank\u2019s \u201cIrishman\u201d nickname, wishing to distinguish him from the Italians like Bufalino and to establish his ownership of Frank\u2019s loyalties.</p> <p>But there is trouble ahead: mobsters like Russell are furious that President Kennedy (whose election they claim to have fixed) has failed to evict Castro from Cuba and restore them to their lucrative playground and that he has compounded the ingratitude by installing his brother Bobby as Attorney General in which role he is pursuing mafiosi and the corrupt Hoffa. But when Hoffa is sent away to prison for fraud and emerges furious that his Teamster empire has been taken away from him, he starts making noises that his mafiosi debtors are themselves ungrateful and he could blow the whistle on them. It is made chillingly clear to Frank where his loyalties will have to lie.</p> <p>The Irishman is operatic and disturbing in the classic style, which is to say the style that Scorsese invented with the language partly provided by De Niro and Pesci. Interestingly they are both less loquacious than Pacino, but the scene is never stolen from them. There are other great performances from Ray Romano, Stephen Graham, Harvey Keitel and others. It is of course very similar to GoodFellas, but with a dourer note: these gangsters all seem older, more careworn: quite simply, they don\u2019t seem to be having a good time they way they did in GoodFellas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4396b6ee01bd4281da837edefe0c8fdcea5011b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4396b6ee01bd4281da837edefe0c8fdcea5011b/204_0_3494_2098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Paquin in The Irishman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Paquin in The Irishman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But their concerns are the same. When Frank comes home to hear that the local grocer has \u201cshoved\u201d his favourite daughter Peggy (played as an adult by Anna Paquin) he shows up to exact a terrible vengeance on the man. Peggy is to grow up scared and resentful of her dad and his ghastly friend Russell but affectionate towards the avuncular Jimmy. (Perhaps Zaillian and Scorsese wish to allude the traditional Sicilian explanation for the term \u201cMafia\u201d \u2013 that it derives from the phrase \u201cnon toccare ma figlia\u201d, or, \u201cdon\u2019t touch my daughter\u201d.)</p> <p>No-one but Scorsese and this glorious cast could have made this movie live as richly and compellingly as it does, and persuade us that its tropes and images are still vital. We have had ample opportunity to tire of the mob, the politicians, Florida, Cuba and so on. But Scorsese brings it back into a scalpel-sharp focus, especially with a new emphasis on Frank\u2019s spiritual devastation and guilt: a man who had long ago amputated his ability to feel remorse and now is unable to come to terms with his feelings. It is another massive achievement for Scorsese.</p> <p>\u2022 The Irishman opens in cinemas on 8 November and is released on Netflix on 27 November</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Martin Scorsese returns with his best picture since GoodFellas and one of his best films ever. It\u2019s a superbly acted, thrillingly shot epic mob procedural about violence, betrayal, dishonesty and emotional bankruptcy starring Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Al Pacino, set in a time before \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d had been formally diagnosed but when everyone lived with the symptoms. The film has been talked about for the hi-tech \u201cyouthification\u201d technology which allows De Niro to appear as a younger man: it\u2019s no more artificial than the traditional wigs, latex etc and it\u2019s amazing how quickly you get used to it. De Niro\u2019s eyes achieve an eerie, gluey gleam in this manifestation as a digital ghost from his past. These are men conducting their business with sorrowful hints and shrugs and mutterings about who has gone too far, who has not shown respect, who will need to be persuaded to attend a sit-down to straighten this whole thing out. These solemnly or cordially euphemistic encounters in a subdued steakhouse light periodically explode into violence or dreamlike scenes of choreographed catastrophe, punctuated by gunshots or visceral jukebox slams on the soundtrack. And all given a queasy new resonance of political conspiracy and bad faith. This is the story of Philadelphia mob murderer Frank \u201cThe Irishman\u201d Sheeran and his part in the mysterious disappearance of Teamsters union boss Jimmy Hoffa in 1975. Screenwriter Steven Zaillian has adapted the 2004 true-crime bestseller I Heard You Paint Houses by Charles Brandt which sensationally established the importance of Sheeran to Hoffa (Sheeran is absent from Danny DeVito\u2019s 1992 movie about Hoffa.) \u201cPaint houses\u201d is code for carry out mob hits, that is: paint them with blood - a phrase which is finally to have a horrible final significance for Hoffa himself. For his cast, Scorsese has assembled a trio of galacticos, a superstar repertory of players giving him (and us) performances of wintry brilliance, ebullience and regret. Robert De Niro\u2019s stolid unemotionalism makes the purest sense here in the role of Sheeran, the second world war veteran whose military experience densensitised him to killing and more importantly schooled him in the Nuremberg ethic of following orders; he is someone who executed enemy prisoners in cold blood. After the war, he gets a job driving trucks and doing odd jobs, and falls under the influence of two competing father figures. The first is Russell Bufalino, the senior mob guy who likes Frank\u2019s style and taciturn efficiency. For this role, Scorsese has got Joe Pesci out of retirement and Pesci is a marvel in the role: not scary or bad-tempered as he has famously been in the past, but a quietly spoken grandfather figure, a fixer, a haver-of-quiet-words, as lined and leathery as a tortoise. It is Bufalino who introduces Frank to his great mentor, Teamsters chief Jimmy Hoffa \u2013 a glorious performance from Al Pacino, the preening politician and local chieftain of brutal ersatz charm, in love with the sound of own husky voice. It is Hoffa who has cultivated the Teamsters\u2019 gangster links \u2013 loaning the wiseguys cash from the union pension fund, and in return taking a slice of the interest rate, and getting mob \u201cmuscle\u201d for when people need to be intimidated. This is how he comes into contact with Frank, and so a great friendship is born. Frank becomes Jimmy\u2019s factotum, bodyguard, consigliere and pal, often sharing a hotel suite with him; they get into their pyjamas together like a poignant old married couple. Jimmy is very keen on Frank\u2019s \u201cIrishman\u201d nickname, wishing to distinguish him from the Italians like Bufalino and to establish his ownership of Frank\u2019s loyalties. But there is trouble ahead: mobsters like Russell are furious that President Kennedy (whose election they claim to have fixed) has failed to evict Castro from Cuba and restore them to their lucrative playground and that he has compounded the ingratitude by installing his brother Bobby as Attorney General in which role he is pursuing mafiosi and the corrupt Hoffa. But when Hoffa is sent away to prison for fraud and emerges furious that his Teamster empire has been taken away from him, he starts making noises that his mafiosi debtors are themselves ungrateful and he could blow the whistle on them. It is made chillingly clear to Frank where his loyalties will have to lie. The Irishman is operatic and disturbing in the classic style, which is to say the style that Scorsese invented with the language partly provided by De Niro and Pesci. Interestingly they are both less loquacious than Pacino, but the scene is never stolen from them. There are other great performances from Ray Romano, Stephen Graham, Harvey Keitel and others. It is of course very similar to GoodFellas, but with a dourer note: these gangsters all seem older, more careworn: quite simply, they don\u2019t seem to be having a good time they way they did in GoodFellas. But their concerns are the same. When Frank comes home to hear that the local grocer has \u201cshoved\u201d his favourite daughter Peggy (played as an adult by Anna Paquin) he shows up to exact a terrible vengeance on the man. Peggy is to grow up scared and resentful of her dad and his ghastly friend Russell but affectionate towards the avuncular Jimmy. (Perhaps Zaillian and Scorsese wish to allude the traditional Sicilian explanation for the term \u201cMafia\u201d \u2013 that it derives from the phrase \u201cnon toccare ma figlia\u201d, or, \u201cdon\u2019t touch my daughter\u201d.) No-one but Scorsese and this glorious cast could have made this movie live as richly and compellingly as it does, and persuade us that its tropes and images are still vital. We have had ample opportunity to tire of the mob, the politicians, Florida, Cuba and so on. But Scorsese brings it back into a scalpel-sharp focus, especially with a new emphasis on Frank\u2019s spiritual devastation and guilt: a man who had long ago amputated his ability to feel remorse and now is unable to come to terms with his feelings. It is another massive achievement for Scorsese. \u2022 The Irishman opens in cinemas on 8 November and is released on Netflix on 27 November",

Cummings wrote of \u201clegal advice\u201d that means \u201cwe can do all sorts of things to scupper delay which for obvious reasons we aren\u2019t going into details about\u201d.</p> <p>We must presume Cummings\u2019s \u201cleak\u201d was intended as a message to MPs from all parties and, possibly, Ireland\u2019s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, along with EU leaders in Brussels. But what was striking was his flagrancy. It was as if he wanted to be recognised as the author. Here was a man, blandly described in time-honoured fashion by Forsyth as \u201ca contact in No 10\u201d, virtually outing himself as the source.</p> <p>This was so unusual that, in spite of political journalists knowing his identity, several felt constrained from saying so. Instead, their reports referred to him with the usual range of indirect terms: \u201ca No 10 source\u201d (the Times and Daily Express); \u201ca senior government source\u201d (Daily Mail); and \u201caides\u201d (the Sun, pluralising an individual).</p> <p>Others were less inhibited. The Daily Telegraph referred to \u201ca memo widely believed to be a text sent by Dominic Cummings\u201d. The Guardian was a little more guarded. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/08/boris-johnsons-brexit-deal-appears-doomed-as-deadline-looms\" title=\"\">It reported that Julian Smith</a>, the Northern Ireland secretary, had \u201cissued a rebuke to the person who briefed anonymously to the Spectator, believed to be the prime minister\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/08/memo-from-no-10-contact-seen-as-fresh-play-in-blame-game-dominic-cummings\">Memo from 'No 10 contact' seen as fresh play in blame game</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Simon Walters, in the Mail, did not hold back. He wrote: \u201cThe Downing Street \u2018source\u2019 quoted by the Spectator bore the unmistakably contemptuous and crude tone of Johnson\u2019s de facto chief of staff Dominic Cummings.\u201d While that sentence could be said to reflect Walters\u2019s personal animosity towards Cummings, I tend to think it speaks volumes about the changing political viewpoint of the Mail itself. There\u2019s a story in the making.</p> <p>Back to Cummings. Whatever one thinks of him, there is something wonderfully refreshing about his way of going about his business. His memo to Forsyth is part of a pattern. He has not concealed his fingerprints on a number of previous leaks from No 10, especially in the lead-up to the supreme court ruling against the prorogation of parliament.</p> <p>Not for Cummings the usual backroom role of an adviser. No smoke and mirrors for him. He is a very public eminence grise who enjoys the limelight and, apparently, revels in the consequent notoriety. He appears determined to be his own man rather than be part of someone else\u2019s story.</p> <p>Whether or not this is bad for the country \u2013 we shall see \u2013 it cannot be denied it\u2019s rather good for our trade. We thrive on colourful characters courting controversy. Journalism is often the beneficiary of big egos in the sense that, in promoting themselves, they inevitably provide stories. One problem for Cummings is how he deals with journalists in the coming weeks. Can he hope to brief on an entirely confidential basis? With this and other lengthy examples of his writing style in the public domain, it\u2019s impossible to conceal his authorship. Then again, he obviously doesn\u2019t want to be anonymous.</p> <p>It is unlikely that the Cummings way will lead to a change in how political journalists obtain their information. Down the years there has often been criticism about the cosiness of the lobby system and the opacity of Westminster and Whitehall sources. But it\u2019s a necessity. Off-the-record conversations allow information to reach the public domain that would otherwise remain secret.</p> <p>Nor, as some critics believe, is it a system widely open to abuse. Reporters working in a competitive media environment police each other by checking on the truth of an opponent\u2019s story. Indeed, when scoops occur, one of the more unedifying practices is the hunt for the source by rivals. Although one\u2019s own confidential sources must be respected, other people\u2019s are not.</p> <p>Most of the time, the system of unattributable briefings is uncontroversial and, in such circumstances, single sourcing is also accepted as the norm. No one can conceive of doing it differently. Even in the US, where a culture of openness contrasts with Britain\u2019s more secretive climate, journalists rely on \u201cdeep background\u201d to flesh out their stories. Politics thrives on concealment of some kind.</p> <p>So, in spite of the darkness of his message, let me applaud Cummings, the messenger who has stepped out of the shadows. We may not have him for long, of course, but let\u2019s enjoy him while we can. </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 14 October 2019.

Then came the pushback, the threat of a drama to come. Cummings wrote of \u201clegal advice\u201d that means \u201cwe can do all sorts of things to scupper delay which for obvious reasons we aren\u2019t going into details about\u201d. We must presume Cummings\u2019s \u201cleak\u201d was intended as a message to MPs from all parties and, possibly, Ireland\u2019s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, along with EU leaders in Brussels. But what was striking was his flagrancy. It was as if he wanted to be recognised as the author. Here was a man, blandly described in time-honoured fashion by Forsyth as \u201ca contact in No 10\u201d, virtually outing himself as the source. This was so unusual that, in spite of political journalists knowing his identity, several felt constrained from saying so. Instead, their reports referred to him with the usual range of indirect terms: \u201ca No 10 source\u201d (the Times and Daily Express); \u201ca senior government source\u201d (Daily Mail); and \u201caides\u201d (the Sun, pluralising an individual). Others were less inhibited. The Daily Telegraph referred to \u201ca memo widely believed to be a text sent by Dominic Cummings\u201d. The Guardian was a little more guarded. It reported that Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, had \u201cissued a rebuke to the person who briefed anonymously to the Spectator, believed to be the prime minister\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings\u201d. Simon Walters, in the Mail, did not hold back. He wrote: \u201cThe Downing Street \u2018source\u2019 quoted by the Spectator bore the unmistakably contemptuous and crude tone of Johnson\u2019s de facto chief of staff Dominic Cummings.\u201d While that sentence could be said to reflect Walters\u2019s personal animosity towards Cummings, I tend to think it speaks volumes about the changing political viewpoint of the Mail itself. There\u2019s a story in the making. Back to Cummings. Whatever one thinks of him, there is something wonderfully refreshing about his way of going about his business. His memo to Forsyth is part of a pattern. He has not concealed his fingerprints on a number of previous leaks from No 10, especially in the lead-up to the supreme court ruling against the prorogation of parliament. Not for Cummings the usual backroom role of an adviser. No smoke and mirrors for him. He is a very public eminence grise who enjoys the limelight and, apparently, revels in the consequent notoriety. He appears determined to be his own man rather than be part of someone else\u2019s story. Whether or not this is bad for the country \u2013 we shall see \u2013 it cannot be denied it\u2019s rather good for our trade. We thrive on colourful characters courting controversy. Journalism is often the beneficiary of big egos in the sense that, in promoting themselves, they inevitably provide stories. One problem for Cummings is how he deals with journalists in the coming weeks. Can he hope to brief on an entirely confidential basis? With this and other lengthy examples of his writing style in the public domain, it\u2019s impossible to conceal his authorship. Then again, he obviously doesn\u2019t want to be anonymous. It is unlikely that the Cummings way will lead to a change in how political journalists obtain their information. Down the years there has often been criticism about the cosiness of the lobby system and the opacity of Westminster and Whitehall sources. But it\u2019s a necessity. Off-the-record conversations allow information to reach the public domain that would otherwise remain secret. Nor, as some critics believe, is it a system widely open to abuse. Reporters working in a competitive media environment police each other by checking on the truth of an opponent\u2019s story. Indeed, when scoops occur, one of the more unedifying practices is the hunt for the source by rivals. Although one\u2019s own confidential sources must be respected, other people\u2019s are not. Most of the time, the system of unattributable briefings is uncontroversial and, in such circumstances, single sourcing is also accepted as the norm. No one can conceive of doing it differently. Even in the US, where a culture of openness contrasts with Britain\u2019s more secretive climate, journalists rely on \u201cdeep background\u201d to flesh out their stories. Politics thrives on concealment of some kind. So, in spite of the darkness of his message, let me applaud Cummings, the messenger who has stepped out of the shadows. We may not have him for long, of course, but let\u2019s enjoy him while we can. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 October 2019. An earlier version misattributed the quote from Robert Peston used in the introduction to James Forsyth. This has been corrected.",

      "body": "<p>Some results deserve to be lit up in neon and this historic victory for Japan was one of them. Never before has any team from Asia reached the quarter-finals of a Rugby World Cup, let alone played such an inspirational brand of rugby. This was not just an emotional occasion for the host nation but an electrifying moment for the global game as a whole.</p> \n<p>Because this was finally the day when the patronising tier two label still used by some to denote Japan\u2019s status in the sport officially ceased to exist. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/28/japan-ireland-rugby-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">As was the case against Ireland</a>, the Brave Blossoms were irresistible at times and were more than good value for their four-try success against a Scotland team who, for only the second time, are going home before the knockout stages commence.</p> \n<p>Japan now face South Africa in the last eight on Sunday, four years on from their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/19/south-africa-japan-rugby-world-cup-2015-match-report\" title=\"\">famous 2015 win against the Springboks</a> in Brighton.</p> \n<p>The backdrop to the whole occasion made this arguably even more special. Less than 12 hours earlier the fixture had still been in serious doubt, with Japan still reeling from the aftermath of Typhoon Hagibis that had left both death and destruction in its wake. Rugby, at such times, is usually an afterthought but Jamie Joseph\u2019s inspiring team are providing their nation with at least a measure of solace.</p> \n<p>And it was Scotland who were on the receiving end. It was less a case of them playing or defending poorly and more another object lesson in Japanese excellence.</p> \n<p>The wing Kenki Fukuoka, scorer of the try that skewered the Irish, added two more big-occasion tries to his collection and he and his teammates led 28-7 at one stage before Gregor Townsend\u2019s side mounted a valiant second-half fightback.</p> \n<p>Any team in the world would have loved to play as Japan did in the first half. Quick, smart, precise and innovative they were a credit to Joseph and his long-time coaching partner Tony Brown and rapidly forced Scotland into damage limitation mode. Despite an encouraging early score by Finn Russell, who had almost set up Darcy Graham for a try a few moments previously, the hosts were a red and white blur of constant motion and their three first-half tries were all out of the top drawer.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce23726fbe248bbb01adb686d035e6d156cf86aa\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce23726fbe248bbb01adb686d035e6d156cf86aa/0_163_5009_3005/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Japan v Scotland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zander Fagerson runs in to score Scotland\u2019s third try against Japan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eugene Hoshiko/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As if Fukuoka\u2019s offload for the first try by the increasingly prolific Kotaro Matsushima was not special enough, Japan were soon barrelling through the middle and Luke Thompson put his loosehead prop Keita Inagaki over by the posts.

      "bodyText": "Some results deserve to be lit up in neon and this historic victory for Japan was one of them. Never before has any team from Asia reached the quarter-finals of a Rugby World Cup, let alone played such an inspirational brand of rugby. This was not just an emotional occasion for the host nation but an electrifying moment for the global game as a whole. Because this was finally the day when the patronising tier two label still used by some to denote Japan\u2019s status in the sport officially ceased to exist. As was the case against Ireland, the Brave Blossoms were irresistible at times and were more than good value for their four-try success against a Scotland team who, for only the second time, are going home before the knockout stages commence. Japan now face South Africa in the last eight on Sunday, four years on from their famous 2015 win against the Springboks in Brighton. The backdrop to the whole occasion made this arguably even more special. Less than 12 hours earlier the fixture had still been in serious doubt, with Japan still reeling from the aftermath of Typhoon Hagibis that had left both death and destruction in its wake. Rugby, at such times, is usually an afterthought but Jamie Joseph\u2019s inspiring team are providing their nation with at least a measure of solace. And it was Scotland who were on the receiving end. It was less a case of them playing or defending poorly and more another object lesson in Japanese excellence. The wing Kenki Fukuoka, scorer of the try that skewered the Irish, added two more big-occasion tries to his collection and he and his teammates led 28-7 at one stage before Gregor Townsend\u2019s side mounted a valiant second-half fightback. Any team in the world would have loved to play as Japan did in the first half. Quick, smart, precise and innovative they were a credit to Joseph and his long-time coaching partner Tony Brown and rapidly forced Scotland into damage limitation mode. Despite an encouraging early score by Finn Russell, who had almost set up Darcy Graham for a try a few moments previously, the hosts were a red and white blur of constant motion and their three first-half tries were all out of the top drawer. As if Fukuoka\u2019s offload for the first try by the increasingly prolific Kotaro Matsushima was not special enough, Japan were soon barrelling through the middle and Luke Thompson put his loosehead prop Keita Inagaki over by the posts. They would have been further ahead had Yu Tamura not missed a couple of penalty attempts but Scotland were not spared for long. With half-time approaching Japan poured forward down the left once more and the excellent Timothy Lafaele put in a neat grubber behind the Scottish defensive line. The ball bounced a little higher than Fukuoka might have liked but the buzzing winger still gathered it one-handed and surged past Stuart Hogg to score his side\u2019s third try. Scotland could hardly complain about the 21-7 half-time margin, with Japan having enjoyed three-quarters of territory and possession and carried for 339 metres compared to 54. If they were relieved to see Jonny Gray avoid a card of any colour after a clash of heads with Shota Horie, they had increasingly little answer as Japan, with their skipper Michael Leitch again prominent, simply raised the tempo by another notch. Within three minutes of the restart the Scottish centre Chris Harris was collared in his own half, had the ball ripped from his horrified grasp and Fukuoka tore unstoppably away for the try bonus point that effectively sealed Scotland\u2019s fate. With the Scots also needing to win by more than seven points to make the qualification equation work, they basically required another Twickenham-style second-half resurrection. For a second or two, they hinted at a similar miracle. First the prop WP Nel crashed unstoppably over and then Russell, having taken a quick throw himself, sparked a glorious counterattack which ended with replacement Zander Fagerson scoring his side\u2019s third try. The two blue-shirted flankers Jamie Ritchie and Magnus Bradbury could scarcely have given more but, ultimately, a couple of costly final-quarter errors killed both their momentum and their whole campaign. At least they were involved in one of the great World Cup occasions. From the pre-match silence in remembrance of the typhoon\u2019s victims to the hair-on-the-neck emotion of the Japanese anthem and the vivid nature of the rugby, this was as good as anything at this tournament to date and up there among the most evocative spectacles the game has known. Maybe France\u2019s comeback at Twickenham against New Zealand 20 years ago was more stunningly executed but not since South Africa won on home soil in 1995 has a host nation raised their game to such thrilling effect.

      "bodyText": "The battle to reduce Europe\u2019s plastic waste could become a quarter of a billion dollars more expensive every year as the cost of recycled plastic soars. In recent months, the price of recycled plastic flakes, used to make goods from soft drink bottles to glitter, has become more expensive than virgin plastic for the first time. For years the cost of making plastic products from recycled flakes was cheaper than relying on virgin plastics made using fossil fuels, meaning the sustainable option was an economic option too. But according to experts it is now cheaper for major manufacturers to use new plastic. A report from S&amp;P Global Platts, a commodity market specialist, revealed that recycled plastic now costs an extra $72 (\u00a357) a tonne compared with newly made plastic. According to the analysts this trend is driven in part by the growing demand to include recycled plastics in new products. Meanwhile, new plastic is becoming cheaper to make due to a flood of petrochemicals production from the US driven by the shale gas boom. They have warned that this could cost sustainable manufacturers across Europe an extra $250m a year. Although many larger manufacturers would struggle to switch their machinery back to virgin plastics, smaller manufacturers may be forced to turn their backs on recycled plastic to keep costs down. In a blow to the war on plastic this could mean the makers of clear plastic bottles and fruit punnets stoke demand for new fossil-fuel based plastic rather than reusing old recycled bottles. Makers of plastic packaging are under pressure to use more recycled plastic to reduce the scourge of plastic pollution in the oceans. Coca-Cola\u2019s European business plans to cut the amount of virgin plastic used in its soft drink bottles to 50% within the next two years, and will change the colour of its Sprite bottles from green to clear to make sure 100% of its bottles can be reused. The UK is planning to tax companies which don\u2019t use at least 30% recycled plastic in their products, but until then it may be cheaper for companies to demand more new plastic to make their packaging. Alongside a tax on virgin plastic use, experts are calling for the UK government to support plans to increase the amount of recycled plastic in the market. This could mean incentives for new recycling plants, improving recycling facilities at a local council level, or importing recycled plastic flakes from Latin America.",

      "body": "<p>In a Victorian Gothic church behind Harrods in west London, a group of young people from troubled backgrounds have gathered to rehearse a play about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/schools\">school</a>.</p> <p>Excluded is a new production, set in a turbulent GCSE class in a London secondary school in 2019, that attempts to shine a light on the problems faced by vulnerable young people within the education system.</p> <p>The content of the play is close to home. At an early workshop exploring the issues, it emerged that all but two of the young performers had been excluded from school. Some are care leavers, some have mental health problems, others have been young offenders. Many have been affected by the consequences of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/knifecrime\">knife crime</a>, which they link to the increasing number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/exclusions\">exclusions</a>.</p> <p>\u201cAll the people who got locked out of education either got into drugs or into knife crime,\u201d said 18-year-old Ilani Marriott-Lodge, who was herself excluded from classes in year 11 and put in isolation after she dyed her hair blonde.</p> <p>\u201cThe rules were so insane.\u201d She was forced to sit her exams on her own, and was then kicked out of college. \u201cI felt like I had let my mum down,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Some said they felt let down by the education system, which failed to listen or understand their needs. \u201cI used to get myself in trouble a lot,\u201d said 19-year-old Rakiya Hasan, who was excluded but fought her way back into education and is now at university. Others she knows have not been so lucky.</p> <p>\u201cOnce the system gives up on the student, that student is very, very vulnerable. Seeing it first-hand, people being stabbed and killed, people turning to drugs, it really breaks my heart when I hear some young person has been permanently excluded. It\u2019s a very slim chance someone can come back from exclusion.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/820773/Permanent_and_fixed_period_exclusions_2017_to_2018_-_main_text.pdf\">Permanent exclusion rates</a> in schools in England are at their highest for nearly a decade at 7,900 in 2017\u20138, equivalent to around 42 pupils permanently excluded per day. Almost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/may/07/education-secretary-calls-on-schools-to-expel-fewer-pupils\">eight out of 10 children who are permanently excluded come from vulnerable backgrounds</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/16/excluded-children-hope-knife-crime-school\">Excluded children can still have hope: here\u2019s the proof | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The play is being put on by <a href=\"http://www.intermissionyouththeatre.co.uk/\">Intermission Youth Theatre </a>(IYT), which uses drama to engage disadvantaged and alienated young people and is supported by patrons Naomie Harris and Mark Rylance. A 10-month drama programme culminates in a four-week run of Excluded, starting on 6 November, at the company\u2019s base at St Saviour\u2019s church in Walton Place.</p> <p>\u201cThe cruelty of exclusion happens for many reasons,\u201d said Rylance. \u201cWe have young people who are excluded from school, from family, from community, from themselves. Youth who need a mission to integrate themselves in a community by developing trust, expression and creative imagination and hopefully friendship through theatre-making.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a transformative experience for the young people involved.

      "bodyText": "In a Victorian Gothic church behind Harrods in west London, a group of young people from troubled backgrounds have gathered to rehearse a play about school. Excluded is a new production, set in a turbulent GCSE class in a London secondary school in 2019, that attempts to shine a light on the problems faced by vulnerable young people within the education system. The content of the play is close to home. At an early workshop exploring the issues, it emerged that all but two of the young performers had been excluded from school. Some are care leavers, some have mental health problems, others have been young offenders. Many have been affected by the consequences of knife crime, which they link to the increasing number of exclusions. \u201cAll the people who got locked out of education either got into drugs or into knife crime,\u201d said 18-year-old Ilani Marriott-Lodge, who was herself excluded from classes in year 11 and put in isolation after she dyed her hair blonde. \u201cThe rules were so insane.\u201d She was forced to sit her exams on her own, and was then kicked out of college. \u201cI felt like I had let my mum down,\u201d she said. Some said they felt let down by the education system, which failed to listen or understand their needs. \u201cI used to get myself in trouble a lot,\u201d said 19-year-old Rakiya Hasan, who was excluded but fought her way back into education and is now at university. Others she knows have not been so lucky. \u201cOnce the system gives up on the student, that student is very, very vulnerable. Seeing it first-hand, people being stabbed and killed, people turning to drugs, it really breaks my heart when I hear some young person has been permanently excluded. It\u2019s a very slim chance someone can come back from exclusion.\u201d Permanent exclusion rates in schools in England are at their highest for nearly a decade at 7,900 in 2017\u20138, equivalent to around 42 pupils permanently excluded per day. Almost eight out of 10 children who are permanently excluded come from vulnerable backgrounds. The play is being put on by Intermission Youth Theatre (IYT), which uses drama to engage disadvantaged and alienated young people and is supported by patrons Naomie Harris and Mark Rylance. A 10-month drama programme culminates in a four-week run of Excluded, starting on 6 November, at the company\u2019s base at St Saviour\u2019s church in Walton Place. \u201cThe cruelty of exclusion happens for many reasons,\u201d said Rylance. \u201cWe have young people who are excluded from school, from family, from community, from themselves. Youth who need a mission to integrate themselves in a community by developing trust, expression and creative imagination and hopefully friendship through theatre-making.\u201d It\u2019s a transformative experience for the young people involved. At a Monday night rehearsal, the mood is warm and good-humoured. Everyone is greeted with a hug; the performers throw themselves into their roles and enjoy making each other laugh. It feels like a really fun English lesson. The play was written by Intermission\u2019s artistic director Darren Raymond, who fell in love with drama \u2013 and Shakespeare in particular \u2013 while serving a three-year prison sentence. His previous works include an updated version of Othello set against a backdrop of urban violence. Like his proteges, he felt excluded by school and ended up bunking off to sell drugs. \u201cSchool is an important chapter that shapes all of our lives,\u201d said Raymond. \u201cWith a record number of teachers leaving the profession, the exclusion of the arts in the curriculum and high levels of student exclusions, some would argue that education is in a state of crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous. The consequences are the things we are seeing now \u2013 young people out of control on the streets, and prepared to do anything without thinking of the consequences of their actions.\u201d Raymond\u2019s play transports some of Shakespeare\u2019s best known characters into the contemporary classroom. Hamlet\u2019s father has died and his mental health is fragile, which leads to outbursts in class; Macbeth meanwhile has been permanently excluded for fighting and gets involved in county lines. \u201cI know people who have been permanently excluded from school and they found themselves down that path,\u201d said 21-year-old Kai Mason. \u201cIn 2016 my friend was murdered.

As talks on Johnson\u2019s latest Brexit proposals continued in Brussels, the European commission president said he would back a prolongation of the UK\u2019s membership if it was sought. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the Brits to decide if they will ask for an extension,\u201d Juncker told the Austrian newspaper the Kurier on Sunday. \u201cBut if Boris Johnson were to ask for extra time \u2013 which probably he won\u2019t \u2013 I would consider it unhistoric to refuse such a request.\u201d Johnson updated his cabinet on Sunday lunchtime about the state of play in negotiations with Brussels before a make-or-break week for his premiership. The prime minister is still hoping to make enough progress at a European council meeting on Thursday to be able to hold a Commons vote on his Brexit plans in a rare Saturday sitting next weekend. After presenting what aides called a \u201cfinal offer\u201d to the EU27 in his party conference speech less than a fortnight ago, Johnson signalled to Dublin that he was ready to make significant concessions on the future status of Northern Ireland. Since Johnson and the Irish taoiseach met on the Wirral last Thursday, officials have been working on an agreement that would in effect keep Northern Ireland in the UK\u2019s customs territory but apply EU tariff rates at its external border. The proposal appears similar to Theresa May\u2019s \u201cnew customs partnership\u201d, but for Northern Ireland alone rather than the whole UK. A dozen British officials led by Johnson\u2019s chief negotiator, David Frost, were in talks with the European commission\u2019s Brexit taskforce on Sunday but sources in Brussels downplayed the possibility of a major breakthrough. \u201cA Northern Ireland-only backstop as proposed by the EU in February 2018 could be landed by the European council on Thursday \u2013 anything else will not,\u201d said one diplomatic source. EU officials have privately warned that at best a \u201ctechnical extension\u201d taking the UK\u2019s membership of the bloc beyond 31 October will be necessary to work through the details of Johnson\u2019s new approach to the issue of customs. Speaking on Sunday, Ireland's agriculture minister Michael Creed, a senior member of Varadkar\u2019s cabinet, said: There are very significant issues to be addressed here. We are not there yet.\u201d Brexit is expected to be high on the agenda when the French president, Emmanuel Macron, hosts the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, at a dinner at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace on Sunday evening. May\u2019s customs plan was vehemently rejected by Brexiters as impractical. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the then chair of the hardline European Research Group of Tory MPs, described it as \u201ccompletely cretinous, impractical, bureaucratic and a betrayal of common sense\u201d. But Rees-Mogg, who is now leader of the House of Commons, made clear on Sunday he and other leavers were prepared to compromise. \u201cBoris Johnson is \u2026 somebody who even the most arch-Eurosceptic, even a member of the Brexit party, can trust and have confidence in,\u201d he said. Asked by Sophy Ridge on Sky News if he might have to eat his words on the idea of a customs partnership, Rees-Mogg added: \u201cI don\u2019t know but there\u2019s a line from Churchill saying he\u2019d often had to eat his own words and he found it a very nourishing diet.

One pointed out that Theresa May\u2019s government believed it would win MPs\u2019 support for her deal, when it was put to the Commons for a third time in March \u2013 but it was rejected, by a majority of 58.",

It\u2019s remarkable, given the psychological acuity that gave <em>Room</em> its spark, that Joan, who\u2019s dead, is the only character Donoghue manages to bring to life on the page. Noah is a cipher, Michael simply not credible. <em>The Wonder</em> was excellent on food; here there seems to be an argument about whether Noah will allow Michael a Coke on every other page.</p> <p>Noah\u2019s grandfather was a famous photographer, a kind of Cartier-Bresson figure. It is, though, a set of enigmatic photographs left by his mother that provide the mystery that the pair set out to solve once in Nice. Was Noah\u2019s mother a collaborator? Did she father a child with a Nazi? Why are there swifts in the south of France in February? The answers to these questions (save the last, which we presume is mere sloppiness) are obvious to the reader long before the novel stumbles to its predictable end. There\u2019s another mystery \u2013 about the death of Victor \u2013 that is left half-resolved, but by this point we have stopped caring.</p> <p>I feel bad slating an author whose work I have long read and admired, but I started this novel expecting to love it and was left positively bilious.

Relying on history to give the novel emotional heft is not enough, particularly for a writer usually so brilliant at summoning the past. <em>Room</em> became a Hollywood blockbuster.

Noah is a cipher, Michael simply not credible. The Wonder was excellent on food; here there seems to be an argument about whether Noah will allow Michael a Coke on every other page. Noah\u2019s grandfather was a famous photographer, a kind of Cartier-Bresson figure. It is, though, a set of enigmatic photographs left by his mother that provide the mystery that the pair set out to solve once in Nice. Was Noah\u2019s mother a collaborator? Did she father a child with a Nazi? Why are there swifts in the south of France in February? The answers to these questions (save the last, which we presume is mere sloppiness) are obvious to the reader long before the novel stumbles to its predictable end. There\u2019s another mystery \u2013 about the death of Victor \u2013 that is left half-resolved, but by this point we have stopped caring. I feel bad slating an author whose work I have long read and admired, but I started this novel expecting to love it and was left positively bilious. Donoghue says in her acknowledgements that she was inspired by stories of the Marcel network \u2013 the underground movement that saved many Jewish children on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur. Relying on history to give the novel emotional heft is not enough, particularly for a writer usually so brilliant at summoning the past. Room became a Hollywood blockbuster. It\u2019s hard to imagine anything like such an outcome for this dispiriting novel. \u2022 Akin by Emma Donoghue is published by Picador (\u00a316.99).

The first guest is teen movie critic Bailey Gismert (Heidi Gardner), who covers It: Chapter 2, Judy and Joker. She admits to having a crush on Joker (or Arthur, as she insists he be called), which leads to the inevitable mini-breakdown over her teenage woes. She signs off with a shout out to Todd Phillips: \u201cThe Joker director was right! Comedy is too woke!\u201d Davidson joins to discuss the recent spike in sexually transmitted diseases: \u201cI get tested all the time because, you know, I look like I have all of them.\u201d He takes the glass-half-full view, suggesting an upsurge in curable STDs is a fair trade for the desegregating effects of modern dating, although he does lament the return of forgotten diseases, asking: \u201cDoes everything in my generation have to be a reboot? Like, the clap and Rambo came back in the same year, and neither of them were wanted.\u201d Folk of the Past is a 60s TV performance from trio Peter, Paula and Murray. Their song Five Long Years recounts the time and money spent on various failures and humiliations: \u201cThree years thinking Maine was a town in Vermont\u201d, \u201cFour years holding in farts in public\u201d, \u201cOne, two, three years trying to impress my therapist\u201d, \u201cThree-thou on a fine for exposing my junk at a little league game\u201d, \u201c12 hours standing over a bridge saying, \u2018Do it, you coward!\u2019\u201d It\u2019s legitimately impressive \u2013 catchy, twisted and filled with surprising pathos. It\u2019s the best sketch of the season. Later, Harbour and McKinnon play horny Italian grandparents (Harbour the grandmother, McKinnon the grandfather) whose open, shameless sensuality deeply disturbs their grandkids. The sketch is simple and juvenile and very funny. Harbour is particularly charming in his willingness to go broad. Cabello returns and performs Easy. Dog Court is a reality TV show centering around canine cases. In a dog park, Judge Connie Schaumberg (Cecily Strong) presides over a dispute between two dirtbag dog owners (Harbour and McKinnon, continuing to show off their chemistry). The pups are real, which causes things to go adorably off the rails as a squirrelly pug wriggles all over Strong\u2019s face. It\u2019s the perfect cap to a surprisingly strong episode. Harbour\u2019s charisma makes him an ace at live comedy and thankfully, the writing was there to meet him.",

He did not want the character to wallow in self-pity, so planned positive storylines that would see Sandy in a wheelchair helping to run the motel, with his mother caring for him. The fictional events highlighted some of the issues faced by people with disabilities and, as a result of the interest generated, Watson persuaded ATV to donate \u00a310,000 to set up a service to give carers a break. Crossroads Care (now Carers Trust) was launched and now operates nationally. </p> <p>The desire to present viewers with heart-warming storylines continued when, in Australia, Watson devised for Grundy Television his most successful soap, Neighbours.

Another Watson creation, Richmond Hill (1988-89), was axed after a year, although it received some screenings in Britain. Similarly, Dangerous Women (1991-93), Watson\u2019s adaptation of Prisoner for the American market, flopped.

Reg was born in Maryborough, Queensland, grew up on a sugar farm and attended Flying Fish Point state school. On leaving, he worked in a jewellery shop in Innisfail and, aged 13, acted with the Unity theatre, Queensland. A year later, he became an actor, writer and announcer on local radio in Brisbane and Charleville. He also acted in, wrote and directed plays for Brisbane repertory theatre (1948-53). In 1955, Watson moved to Britain and briefly acted on BBC radio before joining ATV\u2019s London ITV service as a producer. He was made head of light entertainment when ATV Midlands began in 1956 and, until taking charge of Crossroads, produced everything from game shows to music, as well as creating the children\u2019s programme Tingha and Tucker Club in 1962. The TV entrepreneur Reg Grundy persuaded Watson to return to Australia in 1974 to become head of the newly established drama department at Grundy Television, previously known mainly for game shows. Taking with him Alan Coleman, a director on Crossroads, Watson turned Grundy into a leading producer of soaps. Their earliest success was Coleman\u2019s creation The Young Doctors (1976-83), about romances among staff at the fictional Albert Memorial hospital, and the first Australian serial to be sold abroad. Other international successes were Prisoner (1979-86, titled Prisoner: Cell Block H outside Australia), which gained a cult following with its stories of the female inmates of Wentworth Detention Centre, and Sons and Daughters (1982-87), featuring the wealthy Hamiltons of Sydney and the working-class Palmers of Melbourne. Watson created both and, as executive producer, contributed scripts to all of these soaps. Also popular in Australia was the school-leavers soap The Restless Years (1977-82). Another Watson creation, Richmond Hill (1988-89), was axed after a year, although it received some screenings in Britain. Similarly, Dangerous Women (1991-93), Watson\u2019s adaptation of Prisoner for the American market, flopped. He also resurrected The Restless Years as Goede Tijden, Slechte Tijden (Good Times, Bad Times) in the Netherlands in 1990 and as Gute Zeiten, Schlechte Zeiten in Germany in 1992. Both are still running. In 2013, Prisoner was revived as a contemporary drama, Wentworth (called Wentworth Prison in Britain), based on Watson\u2019s original concept. Watson retired in 1992. He was appointed a member of the Order of Australia in 2010. \u2022 Reginald James Watson, television producer and writer, born 27 August 1926; died 8 October 2019",

      "body": "<p>While the world applauds the child protesters taking to the streets, fewer eyes are on their mums and grandmothers, whose activism is altogether quieter. In August 2014, gangs of older women in yellow tabards and headscarves started to become a common sight on Preston New Road in Lancashire. They call themselves the \u201cNanas\u201d, though not all are grandmas. They took the name as a nod to trust, family and tea, leaning into stereotypes of northern matriarchy. Their first project was to capture a field under planning application by Cuadrilla, a UK fossil fuels company seeking exploratory drilling rights for shale gas. They hopped over the fence, set up tents and claimed squatters\u2019 rights, staying for three weeks. By the time they left, the Nanas had earned the support of 14,000 local residents and appointments at Manchester\u2019s High Court, and their action, along with that of other campaigners, led to Lancashire County Council rejecting Cuadrilla\u2019s fracking application, a decision later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/uk-fracking-given-go-ahead-as-lancashire-council-rejection-is-overturned\" title=\"\">overturned</a> by the then secretary of state, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/uk-fracking-given-go-ahead-as-lancashire-council-rejection-is-overturned\" title=\"\">Sajid Javid</a>.</p> <p>In the years since, the Nanas have mounted an often good-humoured war of attrition against Cuadrilla, whose drilling has caused tremors in the area. At the Bell Mouth, the entrance to the Preston New Road site, they sing, dance, knit, pray, read poems and monologues, and obstruct fracking activity wherever possible. They even have their own stage show and samba band. And every Wednesday, dressed in white, they stage a call for calm at a site where tensions between protesters and police often erupt into violence.</p> <p>In November 2018, Cuadrilla stopped drilling after multiple earth tremors, two of which breached the government\u2019s traffic light system that requires fracking to be paused in the event of seismic activity that exceeds a magnitude of 0.5. Fracking resumed on 15 August 2019, but activity was suspended 11 days later, after the UK\u2019s largest fracking-induced seismic event.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, just a couple of days before the Nanas celebrated 1,000 days of activism at Preston New Road, Cuadrilla announced that it would engage in no further fracking activity on the site before its licence expires at the end of November. The Nanas are now free to enjoy a frack-free Christmas, though they remain on site to make sure.</p> <h2>\u2018If you don\u2019t stand up and do something, then who else will?\u2019: Anjie Mosher, 49, Nana Inappropriate</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"98b00e4704cd74ab2e715a84498b793892b0f260\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98b00e4704cd74ab2e715a84498b793892b0f260/1777_1981_2804_2804/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anjie Mosher\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve been an armchair activist for years. I\u2019m a lesbian, and in the early 80s I\u2019d done a bit of Section 28 business and got chased down my own street. But as the years went on I stopped being as active. I\u2019d see things and think, \u201cHuh, isn\u2019t that dreadful?\u201d and hope someone else would do something about it. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/02/fracking-cause-lancashire-quakes\" title=\"\">The earthquakes</a> were the first time I heard about the Preston New Road site, and I lost a lot of sleep. I\u2019d just adopted two small boys and this was happening on my doorstep. Had I not become a mother I probably wouldn\u2019t have looked into it any further. But I wanted to know exactly what was going on. It\u2019s about my kids and their future. I\u2019ve got to protect them.</p> <p>At first I researched both sides, the pros and cons, because you do tend to think that people who are protesting something might be a little extreme, a little bit nuts. And some are. But that\u2019s life. You look at any group of people and there are always a couple of nutters. That\u2019s how the idea of the Nanas came about. A few of us wanted to engage the public without being threatening or aggressive. There\u2019s nothing more gentle and unthreatening than your nana, and if your nana tells you something you listen, because nanas know best. We took the old matriarchal image of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/15/jean-alexander-hilda-ogden-corrie-coronation-street\" title=\"\">Hilda Ogden</a>, put on our yellow tabards and headscarves, armed ourselves with feather dusters and little teapots and went to capture that field at daft o\u2019clock in the morning.</p> <p>There are some moments in your life that stand out, and that\u2019s up there with one of the best of mine. Watching the sun rise after we\u2019d done, I felt as though I was on the right side of history. I no longer cared if the police came and picked me up because I knew I was doing the right thing.</p> <h2>\u2018There\u2019s a ball of rage inside me\u2019: Tina Rothery, 57, Nana Queenie</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b08d9978a1de5a0ad50aa46363f09bfaa89c3640\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b08d9978a1de5a0ad50aa46363f09bfaa89c3640/769_1587_1137_1137/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tina and Julie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve lived in all sorts of countries and at all sorts of income levels. I worked as a journalist in Hong Kong and managed pubs in London. I\u2019ve lived the good life with a maid and membership of the yacht club, and I\u2019ve lived the harder life as a single parent rummaging for change down the back of a sofa. I\u2019d always assumed I was fairly broad-minded, and then I came to activism and realised I wasn\u2019t at all. Finding an army of women of a certain age was the biggest surprise \u2013 the realisation that there was this untapped resource. We\u2019re cute, we\u2019re a bit broken, we\u2019re easily damaged \u2013 if the cops manhandle us, they\u2019re going to look awful for it.</p> <p>In the early days we made such a difference so quickly. Within months the campaign here grew and we\u2019d built towers at the site and were sleeping in the entrance way, blocking lorries and getting moved at least 10 times a day by the police. That was great, we knew we were having an impact.</p> <p>We\u2019ve been here for more than 960 days now, and everything we\u2019ve done has included humour, but there\u2019s a ball of rage inside me. Every Wednesday, when we do the call for calm, I generally put down the anger and think of it as a fresh start. We started Nana Samba as a kind of anger management for the Nanas. I took a drum and two sticks and I beat the hell out of it and I thought, \u201cI <em>like</em> this!\u201d Then I realised that when I\u2019m drumming I\u2019m harder to arrest. If I\u2019m walking in front of a truck with a drum, you can\u2019t really get a grip on me. I\u2019m getting quite good with the rhythms, too.</p> <p>We get asked what we\u2019d do if it was all over \u2013 wouldn\u2019t we miss the comradeship? I don\u2019t have to worry now that we\u2019ve got a samba band. We\u2019re booked through to 2020. We had a gig last week, we\u2019ve got a gig next month. We\u2019ll just pursue our art and keep campaigning to protect our young.</p> <h2>\u2018I can\u2019t have the future I imagined\u2019: Kai Sinclair, 21, Nana Jigglypuff</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d2abfb5e5950dddf3069179c09410e3b4d144c45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2abfb5e5950dddf3069179c09410e3b4d144c45/1136_1318_3074_3074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kai\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My mum\u2019s quite ill and needs help walking. She wanted to come down here to look around and asked me to come with her. At the end of the day she went home and I didn\u2019t. I moved into camp a week later. I\u2019ve been here 14 months now.</p> <p>I\u2019m a photographer, so when I first came down I thought it would be a good project, but very quickly I started leaving my camera at home and taking part in the protest myself. Since then I\u2019ve explored a lot of different areas of activism. I went straight from being an observer to jumping in at the deep end. It\u2019s only recently that I\u2019ve started to explore the gentler side of protest, and that\u2019s why I joined the Nanas.</p> <p>I\u2019ve got two baby sisters and I want to protect the world for them. But I\u2019ve also just worked my arse off for three years finishing my degree. I\u2019d go to college and then come straight here to do a night shift then go back to college the next day. In 12 years, none of that hard work will matter if the world doesn\u2019t exist. I can\u2019t have the future I imagined for myself if all this continues \u2013 I can\u2019t think about having a family. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d want to bring more humans into a world that\u2019s about to end.</p> <p>I\u2019ve had talks with some of the security guards at the site and a few of them are against fracking themselves, but they need to feed their families. They don\u2019t want to be there, but they have to do it. We\u2019ve created a system where people can\u2019t risk talking about injustice because they might restrict their freedoms. It\u2019s a real risk.</p> <p>Sometimes it seems like it\u2019s you against the world, but the past few months have felt a lot more hopeful. The youth strikes have been amazing. Everyone\u2019s finding their place with different protests.</p> <h2>\u2018I used to be in the police\u2019: Tracey Booker, 58, Nana Dancing Queen</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e76709bb434d84f24e9e41db2ae36ed6ff39b421\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e76709bb434d84f24e9e41db2ae36ed6ff39b421/371_2231_606_607/500.jpg\" alt=\"Nana\u2019s fracking - Tracey, Becky, Tina front and centre, Kai, Tina\u2019s sister Julie and Jo\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I found out about fracking in the summer of 2017. I retired from the civil service in January 2018, so I\u2019ve been able to spend a lot of time up here. I was a senior executive officer investigating suicides in prisons. Before that I was a probation officer, and before that I was a police officer. When I was in that job I had to work at the miners\u2019 strikes, so I understand that the police here can\u2019t choose the beat they\u2019re on.</p> <p>But I\u2019ve watched the way they behave and I hate it. I\u2019ve been subject to assault by the police myself. It astounds me that just because I\u2019m standing at the gate protesting a police officer feels they have the right to punch me in the breast. I would never have got away with anything like it while I was in the job.</p> <p>At first I wasn\u2019t sure if I should tell people that I used to be police, but everyone knows now and it has its benefits to some degree. I\u2019m good at helping people out if they get arrested, putting their cases together and getting Freedom of Information Act requests done. I feel like I\u2019m a useful person to have around.</p> <p>Having a Nana name makes you part of the community. Everyone has to agree to their own and it says something particular about you. I got mine when <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-lancashire-45879259/dancing-queen-vivienne-westwood-supports-fracking-protesters\" title=\"\">Vivienne Westwood</a> came to visit. She came up specifically to dance to Abba\u2019s Dancing Queen in the Bell Mouth. When she arrived there wasn\u2019t much room for her to dance and she looked a bit lost, so I just put my arm around her and she gave me a kiss.</p> <p>Since I\u2019ve become an activist I\u2019ve done things that I\u2019d never have dreamed of doing before. I\u2019ve joined the samba band, performed in a play and been to protest rallies in London and at the Conservative conference. Activism has given me a different outlook on life, and made me feel much more whole in myself.</p> <h2>\u2018We aren\u2019t typical activists\u2019: Jo Catlow-Morris, 57, Nana Dahling</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2c628f097d418306edc15ca3cdd24c58c9bba2f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c628f097d418306edc15ca3cdd24c58c9bba2f7/1951_2548_1680_1680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>To be honest, it wasn\u2019t the fracking that initially drew me to this place, it was the community \u2013 their honesty and their truthfulness and their resolve. I\u2019ve sympathised with the cause for a long time, and because I\u2019m in the performing arts people would always ask me to come down and choreograph a performance or a song at the gates. It was only when I gave up my job as a programme leader at a local uni that I was able to get more involved.</p> <p>I started to come to the call for calm on Wednesdays and spoke a lot to Becky, Tina\u2019s niece. She was telling me about taking the field in 2014 and I just said, \u201cStop, can I record you?\u201d We spoke for about 45 minutes, and when I listened back to it I knew I had to do something with it.</p> <p>Now I\u2019ve done 11 interviews and created a piece of theatre called <em>Nanas </em><em>with Banners</em>. It\u2019s a mix of spoken word, music and dancing. Our next gig is in Sheffield later this month.</p> <p>The main motivation is to communicate that we aren\u2019t typical activists, we\u2019re just mothers and sisters and hairdressers and nurses and whatever else. It\u2019s about normalising us and showing our extraordinary nature. When I first did the readings all the women were in floods of tears.</p> <p>I have a very conservative friend who has no sympathy with what\u2019s going on here, but he came to see the play and afterwards said: \u201cYou\u2019ve almost turned me. One day I\u2019ll come down there with you and meet the Nanas.\u201d He hasn\u2019t come yet, but if I\u2019ve done nothing else with these performances then I have at least changed one person\u2019s perspective.</p>",

We\u2019re cute, we\u2019re a bit broken, we\u2019re easily damaged \u2013 if the cops manhandle us, they\u2019re going to look awful for it. In the early days we made such a difference so quickly. Within months the campaign here grew and we\u2019d built towers at the site and were sleeping in the entrance way, blocking lorries and getting moved at least 10 times a day by the police. That was great, we knew we were having an impact. We\u2019ve been here for more than 960 days now, and everything we\u2019ve done has included humour, but there\u2019s a ball of rage inside me. Every Wednesday, when we do the call for calm, I generally put down the anger and think of it as a fresh start. We started Nana Samba as a kind of anger management for the Nanas. I took a drum and two sticks and I beat the hell out of it and I thought, \u201cI like this!\u201d Then I realised that when I\u2019m drumming I\u2019m harder to arrest. If I\u2019m walking in front of a truck with a drum, you can\u2019t really get a grip on me. I\u2019m getting quite good with the rhythms, too. We get asked what we\u2019d do if it was all over \u2013 wouldn\u2019t we miss the comradeship? I don\u2019t have to worry now that we\u2019ve got a samba band. We\u2019re booked through to 2020. We had a gig last week, we\u2019ve got a gig next month. We\u2019ll just pursue our art and keep campaigning to protect our young. \u2018I can\u2019t have the future I imagined\u2019: Kai Sinclair, 21, Nana Jigglypuff My mum\u2019s quite ill and needs help walking. She wanted to come down here to look around and asked me to come with her. At the end of the day she went home and I didn\u2019t. I moved into camp a week later. I\u2019ve been here 14 months now. I\u2019m a photographer, so when I first came down I thought it would be a good project, but very quickly I started leaving my camera at home and taking part in the protest myself. Since then I\u2019ve explored a lot of different areas of activism. I went straight from being an observer to jumping in at the deep end. It\u2019s only recently that I\u2019ve started to explore the gentler side of protest, and that\u2019s why I joined the Nanas. I\u2019ve got two baby sisters and I want to protect the world for them. But I\u2019ve also just worked my arse off for three years finishing my degree. I\u2019d go to college and then come straight here to do a night shift then go back to college the next day. In 12 years, none of that hard work will matter if the world doesn\u2019t exist. I can\u2019t have the future I imagined for myself if all this continues \u2013 I can\u2019t think about having a family. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d want to bring more humans into a world that\u2019s about to end. I\u2019ve had talks with some of the security guards at the site and a few of them are against fracking themselves, but they need to feed their families. They don\u2019t want to be there, but they have to do it. We\u2019ve created a system where people can\u2019t risk talking about injustice because they might restrict their freedoms. It\u2019s a real risk. Sometimes it seems like it\u2019s you against the world, but the past few months have felt a lot more hopeful. The youth strikes have been amazing. Everyone\u2019s finding their place with different protests. \u2018I used to be in the police\u2019: Tracey Booker, 58, Nana Dancing Queen I found out about fracking in the summer of 2017. I retired from the civil service in January 2018, so I\u2019ve been able to spend a lot of time up here. I was a senior executive officer investigating suicides in prisons. Before that I was a probation officer, and before that I was a police officer. When I was in that job I had to work at the miners\u2019 strikes, so I understand that the police here can\u2019t choose the beat they\u2019re on. But I\u2019ve watched the way they behave and I hate it. I\u2019ve been subject to assault by the police myself. It astounds me that just because I\u2019m standing at the gate protesting a police officer feels they have the right to punch me in the breast. I would never have got away with anything like it while I was in the job. At first I wasn\u2019t sure if I should tell people that I used to be police, but everyone knows now and it has its benefits to some degree. I\u2019m good at helping people out if they get arrested, putting their cases together and getting Freedom of Information Act requests done. I feel like I\u2019m a useful person to have around. Having a Nana name makes you part of the community. Everyone has to agree to their own and it says something particular about you. I got mine when Vivienne Westwood came to visit. She came up specifically to dance to Abba\u2019s Dancing Queen in the Bell Mouth. When she arrived there wasn\u2019t much room for her to dance and she looked a bit lost, so I just put my arm around her and she gave me a kiss. Since I\u2019ve become an activist I\u2019ve done things that I\u2019d never have dreamed of doing before. I\u2019ve joined the samba band, performed in a play and been to protest rallies in London and at the Conservative conference. Activism has given me a different outlook on life, and made me feel much more whole in myself. \u2018We aren\u2019t typical activists\u2019: Jo Catlow-Morris, 57, Nana Dahling To be honest, it wasn\u2019t the fracking that initially drew me to this place, it was the community \u2013 their honesty and their truthfulness and their resolve. I\u2019ve sympathised with the cause for a long time, and because I\u2019m in the performing arts people would always ask me to come down and choreograph a performance or a song at the gates. It was only when I gave up my job as a programme leader at a local uni that I was able to get more involved. I started to come to the call for calm on Wednesdays and spoke a lot to Becky, Tina\u2019s niece. She was telling me about taking the field in 2014 and I just said, \u201cStop, can I record you?\u201d We spoke for about 45 minutes, and when I listened back to it I knew I had to do something with it. Now I\u2019ve done 11 interviews and created a piece of theatre called Nanas with Banners. It\u2019s a mix of spoken word, music and dancing. Our next gig is in Sheffield later this month. The main motivation is to communicate that we aren\u2019t typical activists, we\u2019re just mothers and sisters and hairdressers and nurses and whatever else. It\u2019s about normalising us and showing our extraordinary nature. When I first did the readings all the women were in floods of tears. I have a very conservative friend who has no sympathy with what\u2019s going on here, but he came to see the play and afterwards said: \u201cYou\u2019ve almost turned me. One day I\u2019ll come down there with you and meet the Nanas.\u201d He hasn\u2019t come yet, but if I\u2019ve done nothing else with these performances then I have at least changed one person\u2019s perspective.",

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s largest investment banks have provided more than $700bn of financing for the fossil fuel companies most aggressively expanding in new coal, oil and gas projects since the Paris climate change agreement, figures show. The financing has been led by the Wall Street giant JPMorgan Chase, which has provided $75bn (\u00a361bn) to companies expanding in sectors such as fracking and Arctic oil and gas exploration, according to the analysis. The New York bank is one of 33 powerful financial institutions to have provided an estimated total of $1.9tn to the fossil fuel sector between 2016 and 2018. The data shows the most aggressively expanding coal-mining operations, oil and gas companies, fracking firms and pipeline companies have received $713.3bn in loans, equity issuances and debt underwriting services from 2016 to mid-2019. Other top financiers of fossil fuel companies include Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. Using Bloomberg financial data and publicly available company disclosures, the analysis was compiled exclusively for the Guardian by Rainforest Action Network, a US-based environmental organisation. The figures update the group\u2019s Banking on Climate Change 2019 report from April, which showed the practices of key investment banks were aligned with a climate disaster. Figures show fracking has been the focus of intense financing, with Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America providing about $80bn over three years, much of it linked to the Permian basin in Texas. The financing of the tar sands crude oil projects in Alberta, Canada, is dominated by the Canadian banks, led by the Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto Dominion. The tar sands fields in north-west Canada are the third-largest known reserves of crude oil in the world, but extraction has caused widespread damage to ecosystems and forced indigenous communities from their homes. Although financing levels are on a smaller scale than other parts of the fossil fuel industry, in the years since the Paris climate agreement there has been increased financing for oil and gas projects in the Arctic, led by JPMorgan Chase, which provided $1.7bn in 2016-18. Extraction in the region is typically dominated by Russian firms such as Gazprom and Rosneft, about which there is less transparency in business data. The largest American banks \u2013 JPMorgan Chase, Citi and Bank of America \u2013 lead financing for ultra-deepwater oil and gas projects that extract fossil fuels from 1,500 metres and below. Deepwater projects have been the site of several disasters, including the BP Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010, in which 11 people died and billions of dollars\u2019 worth of damage was done to local communities and businesses. Barclays is one bank showing signs of change. While it remains a significant banker for the fossil fuel industry, its business with the companies most aggressively expanding in the sector has fallen sharply, from $13.1bn in 2016 to $5.2bn in 2018. The first-half figure for 2019 shows the bank is on track to record another annual decrease. In response to the figures, JPMorgan, which has faced growing protests over its fossil fuel banking activities, said it recognised the complexity of climate change and actively engaged with stakeholders on the issue. Wells Fargo said it carried out enhanced checks on its energy clients, which represented a small part of its overall business. Several investment banks contacted by the Guardian said they were expanding quickly in renewable industries and had tightened lending policies on financing for Arctic oil and gas, coal and tar sands fossil fuel projects. Elsa Palanza, Barclays\u2019 global head of sustainability and citizenship, said: \u201cWe can all sit around pointing fingers at each other, but that doesn\u2019t help solve what is a really complex and multifaceted problem.

The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the <a href=\"http://climateaccountability.org/\">Climate Accountability Institute</a>,&nbsp;calculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers. Heede said: \"The fact that consumers combust the fuels to carbon dioxide, water, heat and pollutants does not absolve the fossil fuel companies from responsibility for knowingly perpetuating the carbon era and accelerating the climate crisis toward the existential threat it has now become.\"</p>\n    <p>One aim of the project is to move the focus of debate from individual responsibilities to power structures \u2013 so our reporters also examined the financial and lobbying structures that let fossil fuel firms keep growing, and discovered which elected politicians were voting for change.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Another aim of the project is to press governments and corporations to close the gap between ambitious long-term promises and lacklustre short-term action. The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating.

Nicky Smith scored in the first half with Josh Adams and the replacements Tomos Williams and Gareth Davies going over in the second. Wales were also awarded a penalty try as they won all their pool stage matches \u2013 the first time they have done so since 1987.</p> \n<p>Before the match, Warren Gatland had insisted that the door was still open for his fringe players to force their way into his starting XV to face France but in truth few took their chance to go through it \u2013 \u201cnot the prettiest\u201d was the head coach\u2019s honest assessment. Of the side who started against Uruguay, only Hadleigh Parkes, who did not have the best of games, Adams, Justin Tipuric and perhaps Aaron Wainwright are in line to feature against France but Gatland issued a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/11/wales-13-changes-uruguay-dan-biggar-hopeful-rugby-world-cup\" title=\"\">positive injury update on Dan Biggar</a> (head), Jonathan Davies (knee) and George North (ankle).</p> \n<p>Four years ago at this stage of the tournament Wales were ravaged by injury but now Gatland believes he will have a full-strength squad to choose from. Add in the fact that Wales have won seven of their last eight matches against France and it is easy to see why Jones \u2013 who was among those rested on Sunday \u2013 challenged his side to make history.</p> \n<p>\u201cAlun Wyn Jones probably said the best thing when he told the players: \u2018We\u2019ve got 240 minutes left to achieve something special\u2019,\u201d said Gatland. \u201cThat\u2019s something to focus on. We\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019ve achieved in the last couple of years especially in games that have mattered, and competition games. There is a lot of confidence in the team. We have belief that if we play well enough against any side we can beat them. We are in good shape physically, we know how fit we are and how hard we\u2019ve worked.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a good record against France but they\u2019re traditionally a tournament team. In World Cups, when everyone writes them off, they seem to produce performances nobody expects. We know how hard next week is going to be against France. They have some quality individuals and they seem to thrive in the quarter-final and semi-final stage. It is going to be a tough, physical game and we\u2019re looking forward to that challenge. They probably have a little advantage, not having that game against England, so they may be a little bit fresher than we will be. But from our point of view we feel battle-hardened.\u201d</p> \n<p>That Parkes chose to kick the ball out with time up in the first half with Wales in a relatively promising position said everything about their performance in the first 40 minutes. What followed \u2013 a bit of handbags in the tunnel \u2013 also demonstrated that Uruguay had succeeded in getting underneath the skin of their opponents with Rhys Patchell coming in for some particularly rough treatment.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"263590863a62704b1b40122ce3d7c9deefd6175c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/263590863a62704b1b40122ce3d7c9deefd6175c/0_184_4079_2447/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Uruguay and Wales players unite to bow to the crowd after the match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uruguay and Wales players unite to bow to the crowd after the match.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabriel Bouys/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Wales had started brightly but the handling errors were evident from the start with Hallam Amos, Bradley Davies and Aaron Shingler all culpable in promising positions. They were finally on the board after 17 minutes with Smith driving over from close range after concerted pressure. Leigh Halfpenny was on target with the straightforward conversion but two penalties from the Uruguay fly-half Felipe Berchesi brought the side currently ranked 18th in the world to within a point at the interval.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/oct/13/wales-v-uruguay-rugby-world-cup-2019-live\">Wales v Uruguay: Rugby World Cup 2019 \u2013 live!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Any hopes of a remarkable upset seemed more distant when Adams went over for his fifth try of the tournament, finishing off a big overlap on the left before Amos, for the second time in the match, had a try ruled out for a forward pass. A penalty try, soon after Santiago Civetta was shown a yellow card, gave Wales more breathing space but Uruguay scored the try their efforts deserved through their hooker Germ\u00e1n Kessler from close range.</p> \n<p>That brought the gap to eight points but Wales responded almost immediately \u2013 Williams sniping over for the bonus-point try. There might have been another soon after had Amos not dropped the ball when diving for the line, though there was a possible forward pass in the buildup. It summed up Wales\u2019s night, even if Gareth Davies turned on the afterburners to add a fifth in the dying throes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6fef03be-90e4-4479-a966-6b06ac24f770\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/18/rugby-world-cup-2019-fixtures-tables-and-results\">Fixtures, tables and results</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/20/top-try-and-points-scorers-for-the-2019-rugby-world-cup-japan\">Top try and points scorers</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/19/rugby-world-cup-2019-stadium-guide\">Stadium guide</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/19/rugby-world-cup-2019-guide-to-the-referees\">Referee guide</a><br></p>\n    <p>\u2022 Our latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/minutebyminute+sport/rugby-union\">minute-by-minute live reports</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/sign-up-to-the-breakdown\">Sign up to The Breakdown</a>, our free rugby union email newsletter</p>\n    <p><b>Team guides</b><br>Pool A: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/09/rugby-world-cup-2019-ireland-team-guide\">Ireland</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/09/rugby-world-cup-2019-japan-team-guide\">Japan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/10/rugby-world-cup-2019-russia-team-guide\">Russia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/10/rugby-world-cup-2019-samoa-team-guide\">Samoa</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/11/rugby-world-cup-2019-scotland-team-guide\">Scotland</a><br>Pool B: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/11/rugby-world-cup-2019-canada-team-guide\">Canada</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/12/rugby-world-cup-2019-italy-team-guide\">Italy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/12/rugby-world-cup-2019-namibia-team-guide\">Namibia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/13/rugby-world-cup-2019-new-zealand-team-guide\">New Zealand</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/13/rugby-world-cup-2019-south-africa-team-guide\">South Africa</a><br>Pool C: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/14/rugby-world-cup-2019-argentina-team-guide\">Argentina</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/14/rugby-world-cup-2019-england-team-guide\">England</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/15/rugby-world-cup-2019-france-team-guide\">France</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/16/rugby-world-cup-2019-tonga-team-guide\">Tonga</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/15/rugby-world-cup-2019-usa-team-guide\">USA</a><br>Pool D: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/17/rugby-world-cup-2019-australia-team-guide\">Australia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/18/rugby-world-cup-2019-fiji-team-guide\">Fiji</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/17/rugby-world-cup-2019-georgia-team-guide\">Georgia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/18/rugby-world-cup-2019-uruguay-team-guide\">Uruguay</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/16/rugby-world-cup-2019-wales-team-guide\">Wales</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "Wales have been urged to seize their World Cup opportunity with the captain, Alun Wyn Jones, reminding his side they are three wins from glory after a scrappy win against Uruguay sent them into a quarter-final with France on Saturday. A much-changed Wales laboured against the spirited South Americans but eventually finished with five tries, having led by only a point at half-time. Nicky Smith scored in the first half with Josh Adams and the replacements Tomos Williams and Gareth Davies going over in the second. Wales were also awarded a penalty try as they won all their pool stage matches \u2013 the first time they have done so since 1987. Before the match, Warren Gatland had insisted that the door was still open for his fringe players to force their way into his starting XV to face France but in truth few took their chance to go through it \u2013 \u201cnot the prettiest\u201d was the head coach\u2019s honest assessment. Of the side who started against Uruguay, only Hadleigh Parkes, who did not have the best of games, Adams, Justin Tipuric and perhaps Aaron Wainwright are in line to feature against France but Gatland issued a positive injury update on Dan Biggar (head), Jonathan Davies (knee) and George North (ankle). Four years ago at this stage of the tournament Wales were ravaged by injury but now Gatland believes he will have a full-strength squad to choose from. Add in the fact that Wales have won seven of their last eight matches against France and it is easy to see why Jones \u2013 who was among those rested on Sunday \u2013 challenged his side to make history. \u201cAlun Wyn Jones probably said the best thing when he told the players: \u2018We\u2019ve got 240 minutes left to achieve something special\u2019,\u201d said Gatland. \u201cThat\u2019s something to focus on. We\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019ve achieved in the last couple of years especially in games that have mattered, and competition games. There is a lot of confidence in the team. We have belief that if we play well enough against any side we can beat them. We are in good shape physically, we know how fit we are and how hard we\u2019ve worked. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a good record against France but they\u2019re traditionally a tournament team. In World Cups, when everyone writes them off, they seem to produce performances nobody expects. We know how hard next week is going to be against France. They have some quality individuals and they seem to thrive in the quarter-final and semi-final stage. It is going to be a tough, physical game and we\u2019re looking forward to that challenge. They probably have a little advantage, not having that game against England, so they may be a little bit fresher than we will be. But from our point of view we feel battle-hardened.\u201d That Parkes chose to kick the ball out with time up in the first half with Wales in a relatively promising position said everything about their performance in the first 40 minutes. What followed \u2013 a bit of handbags in the tunnel \u2013 also demonstrated that Uruguay had succeeded in getting underneath the skin of their opponents with Rhys Patchell coming in for some particularly rough treatment. Wales had started brightly but the handling errors were evident from the start with Hallam Amos, Bradley Davies and Aaron Shingler all culpable in promising positions. They were finally on the board after 17 minutes with Smith driving over from close range after concerted pressure. Leigh Halfpenny was on target with the straightforward conversion but two penalties from the Uruguay fly-half Felipe Berchesi brought the side currently ranked 18th in the world to within a point at the interval. Any hopes of a remarkable upset seemed more distant when Adams went over for his fifth try of the tournament, finishing off a big overlap on the left before Amos, for the second time in the match, had a try ruled out for a forward pass. A penalty try, soon after Santiago Civetta was shown a yellow card, gave Wales more breathing space but Uruguay scored the try their efforts deserved through their hooker Germ\u00e1n Kessler from close range. That brought the gap to eight points but Wales responded almost immediately \u2013 Williams sniping over for the bonus-point try. There might have been another soon after had Amos not dropped the ball when diving for the line, though there was a possible forward pass in the buildup. It summed up Wales\u2019s night, even if Gareth Davies turned on the afterburners to add a fifth in the dying throes.",

      "bodyText": "Spain\u2019s supreme court is expected to announce its verdict on Monday in the trial of 12 Catalan separatist leaders over their alleged roles in the region\u2019s failed attempt for independence two years ago. Nine of the defendants \u2013 who include the former Catalan vice-president Oriol Junqueras, the former speaker of the Catalan parliament Carme Forcadell, and two influential grassroots activists, Jordi Cuixart and Jordi S\u00e0nchez \u2013 are accused of rebellion, which carries a prison sentence of up to 25 years. Other charges include sedition and the misuse of public funds. The unilateral independence referendum, held in defiance of the Spanish constitution on 1 October 2017, provoked Spain\u2019s biggest political crisis since its return to democracy after the end of the Franco dictatorship. Less than a month after the poll, which was met with a heavy-handed police response, the Catalan parliament made a unilateral declaration of independence. The Spanish government reacted to the move by using the constitution to assume direct control of the region and sack the pro-independence regional president Carles Puigdemont and his administration. The trial, which has been held at the supreme court in Madrid, lasted four months and heard from more than 400 witnesses, including Spain\u2019s prime minister at the time of the referendum, Mariano Rajoy. The proceedings also examined the events of 20 September 2017, when police raided Catalan regional government offices and arrested 14 senior officials in an attempt to head off the vote. The raids brought thousands of Catalans out to protest. Guardia Civil officers found themselves trapped inside the buildings they were searching and three of their vehicles were vandalised. Javier Zaragoza, prosecuting, argued such behaviour by the protesters constituted \u201cphysical, compulsive and intimidatory violence\u201d, adding: \u201cThe violent nature of an uprising does not mean there has to be either serious or armed violence.\u201d Zaragoza told the court that the push for secession had been a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat designed to \u201coverturn, suspend the constitution completely or partially, and declare the independence of one part of the national territory\u201d. However, defence lawyers rejected such arguments, telling the court that while there may have been \u201cdisobedience\u201d, there had been no rebellion. The supreme court has refused to comment on reports that the trial judges have decided to acquit the defendants of the most serious charge of rebellion, which involves \u201crevolting violently and publicly\u201d. Under the Spanish penal code, the lesser offence of sedition is defined as \u201crising up publicly and tumultuously to prevent, through force or beyond legal means, the application of the law\u201d. It carries a maximum prison sentence of 15 years. Puigdemont is not among those on trial. He fled into self-imposed exile in Belgium to avoid arrest.",

US children\u2019s show host Mister Rogers famously said that when he saw scary incidents on television, his mother would comfort him by saying: \u201cLook for the helpers, you will always find people who are helping.\u201d And so to Thomas Cook and Wrightbus, the two most recent failures to stun the UK business community. Hays Travel, a successful, family-run enterprise rooted in its home town of Sunderland, came to the aid of 555 Thomas Cook high street shops, promising to save the jobs of up to 2,500 people. John and Irene Hays, the affable husband-and-wife team who run the business, have a big job ahead of them but their confidence and enthusiasm is infectious. Another ray of sunshine on the horizon emanates from the direction of Northern Ireland, where there is an agreement in principle to rescue bus manufacturer Wrightbus, the maker of London\u2019s revived Routemaster. Last week a deal was struck to save the historic Harland &amp; Wolff shipyard, which built the Titanic and HMS Belfast. What these dei ex machina prove is that, even in such febrile times, the UK business community is not short on verve, drive and imagination. That should be cause for a degree of optimism, however cautious.",

      "body": "<p>When she was living in New York City, AJ Wolfe would read guidebooks about Walt Disney World on her way to work. Wolfe used the books to \u201cescape from real life\u201d on her commute. Fifteen years later, she makes a living doing a job that didn\u2019t even exist then, and many can hardly believe exists now \u2013 eating sweets at the Most Magical Place on Earth.</p> <p>Since 2009, Wolfe, a mother of one from Texas, has posted pictures and food reviews of Disney food online at her <a href=\"http://www.disneyfoodblog.com/\" title=\"\">Disney Food Blog</a>, which has evolved into a wildly successful website, video channel and Instagram page. She has accumulated more than 82m views on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnpWedLQdHpZqhgTLdB9Yyg\" title=\"\">YouTube</a> and has more than 530,000 followers on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/disneyfoodblog/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Instagram</a>. Like most content creators, Wolfe earns money by selling adverts and taking sponsorships directly from brands. She can hardly believe it. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 <em>incredible</em>,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Wolfe, 41, travels to Disney World once a month. On those days, she gets up at 6am, visits the park, tastes and takes pictures of the food and works until 2am editing content. \u201cIt\u2019s an unsustainable way of living if you\u2019re there every day,\u201d she says, \u201cbut if you\u2019re only there for a few days\u2026\u201d</p> <p>A decade ago, Wolfe relied on credit cards to pay for her frequent Disney trips. Now, she\u2019s essentially paid to go. \u201cI like to say Disney World is the opposite of New York: perfectly manicured, cultivated happiness versus the gritty reality of the city that never sleeps,\u201d she explains. \u201cI think that\u2019s why Disney approaches \u2018obsessive\u2019 levels for some people. It\u2019s such a marked escape from the worries and stresses of their real, day-to-day life.\u201d For years, \u201cDisney was an absolute obsession for me,\u201d she says. Now it\u2019s her career.</p> <p>Wolfe is one<em><strong> </strong></em>of hundreds<em><strong> </strong></em>of people who make a living posting Disney content online, and one of many millions who enjoy consuming it. Though usually not officially affiliated with the brand itself, people who photograph themselves in Disney parks have collectively earned a small fortune by posting about the mouse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca5b414c3370d620522e8c923528150d6c38a5d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca5b414c3370d620522e8c923528150d6c38a5d9/0_0_1242_1549/802.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Disney is an escape from the worries and stresses of our day-to-day lives\u2019: an ice-cream picture from AJ Wolfe, who runs the Disneyfoodblog.com\" width=\"802\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Disney is an escape from the worries and stresses of our day-to-day lives\u2019: an ice-cream picture from AJ Wolfe, who runs the <a href=\"https://www.disneyfoodblog.com/\">Disneyfoodblog.com</a></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @DisneyFoodBlog</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We\u2019re familiar with the concept of Instagram influencers \u2013 people who live polished and perfect lives that we love (and hate) to follow. But in a world oversaturated with #beauty and #bikini shots, niche influencers are on the rise, too. There are influencers who only post about Harry Potter \u2013 dressing up as characters and attempting to cook foods mentioned in the books \u2013 and influencers obsessed with Poundland, who show off their weekly bargains. There are vegan influencers, Christian influencers, dog influencers, kidfluencers. \u201cYou surround yourself with your tribe,\u201d Wolfe theorises of the trend. \u201cDisney is a happy place, a getaway, so it makes sense that you want to dive into it. When I\u2019m not in Disney World, I do the same thing. I think everyone wants to get a little taste of vacation life.\u201d</p> <p>Over the past few years, marketing agencies have begun to understand the benefits of \u201cmicro influencers\u201d. Typically, they have fewer followers than the traditionally internet famous, but small-time influencers are valuable because their followers are often more loyal and thus more likely to purchase recommended products. In an age of increasing distrust towards influencers, marketers feel micro influencers who command the attention of a close-knit group will provide a better return on investment.</p> <p>In the early years of the internet, online spaces were fragmented. You might have logged on to 20 different websites, which might not have overlapped with the 20 sites visited by your neighbour. Today, however, we\u2019re stuck in a cycle of constantly checking Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, then Facebook again. Arguably, we are now trying to recapture more personalised online experiences. Between 2017 and 2018, membership of subject-specific Facebook groups increased by 40%, as more and more people sought to interact with like-minded people online. Niche influencers offer an opportunity for people to reclaim a personalised internet experience. We\u2019re less interested in following the same travel vlogger followed by 4m others. In short: love Disney? Follow the Disney micro influencer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8d4a9acf20ba5d0560afff6a21f04b17da609ed8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d4a9acf20ba5d0560afff6a21f04b17da609ed8/0_231_5632_3379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Working for Walt: InsidEARS Dave and Steph from Eastbourne, who post at @Krispysmore\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Working for Walt: InsidEARS Dave and Steph from Eastbourne, who post at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KrispySmore?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@Krispysmore</a></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @KRISPYsMORE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chelsea Watson is a Disney Instagrammer (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/styledbymagic/?hl=en\" title=\"\">@StyledByMagic</a>; 65,000 followers) whose grid is bursting with bright colours and classic influencer shots. She twirls her skirts, pouts her lips and strikes over-the-shoulder poses. The key difference between Watson, 24, and other famous Instagrammers \u2013 the model <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kyliejenner/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Kylie Jenner</a>, for example, or Britain\u2019s girl-next-door <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ZoeSugg/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Zoella</a> \u2013 is the mouse ears atop Watson\u2019s head. \u201cI know my family don\u2019t always fully understand how it works,\u201d Watson says, of her influencing career.</p> <p>In 2017, she and her husband moved to Florida from New Hampshire so Watson could pursue a Disney career full-time and she now visits the parks \u201cat least twice a week\u201d. Her posts are dedicated to Disney-inspired fashion and accessories. She creates roughly three sponsored posts a month; brands pay her to advertise their products in a picture. Though she won\u2019t talk exact figures, this is now her sole income. \u201cIn a sense, I\u2019m just like any other fashion blogger,\u201d she says. \u201cThe dream is to always do something you love.\u201d</p> <p>Watson has a passion for fashion. But she also has a passion for Disney. When we speak over Skype, her hair is half-up-half-down in a big scrunchie, and she is wearing a Dumbo T-shirt in which the cartoon elephant\u2019s ears are tied into a cute little knot. \u201cDisney was such a formidable part of my generation\u2019s upbringing. We consumed so much as we were growing up that it made a lasting impact.\u201d</p> <p>In a remarkably prescient essay from 1992, NYU professor David Forgacs wrote that anyone born after 1925 is a \u201cDisney baby\u201d, brought up on a diet of films, stories and merchandise dictated by the mouse. \u201cDisney babies grow, ideally, into Disney adults,\u201d he wrote, arguing that Disney adults have Disney babies of their own. Forgacs spoke of the way the parks marketed nostalgia and played with the boundaries between adolescent and child, in order to profit. \u201cChildren are a major source of Disney income, but only indirectly: it is adults who spend money on them,\u201d he reminds us. </p> <p>This summer, a <em>New York Post</em> writer declared: \u201cSorry, childless millennials going to Disney World is weird,\u201d after a mother\u2019s Facebook rant went viral: \u201cPeople without <em>children</em> need to be <em>banned</em>!!!!\u201d But Watson and Wolfe say their audiences are diverse. They are followed by families, elderly couples and childless millennials. \u201cI\u2019m always taken aback by the mix of people,\u201d Watson says. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"00f95cab5766e37e389b26551b7e1f967352ebd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00f95cab5766e37e389b26551b7e1f967352ebd1/0_605_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I don\u2019t ever want to lose our sense of magic\u2019: bloggers Britt and Jared who post at @Disney_atheart\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t ever want to lose our sense of magic\u2019: bloggers Britt and Jared who post at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/disney_atheart/?hl=en\">@Disney_atheart</a></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @DISNEY_ATHEART</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Why does she think people find her content so compelling? \u201cI think it has a lot to do with the climate in general,\u201d she says. \u201cIn today\u2019s world, people want something happy and positive to focus on. Disney really is for everyone. It\u2019s not just for kids.\u201d She argues that Disney influencers give people \u201ca place to come together and talk about things they love. Be happy. Get away from the negativity for a while.\u201d</p> <p>No one in Watson\u2019s personal life has criticised her for being a grown adult who loves Disney, but other Disney influencers haven\u2019t been so lucky. Britt and Jared are a married couple from Louisiana who have 32,000 followers on their Disney <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/disney_atheart/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Instagram</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/disneyatheart\" title=\"\">YouTube</a> profiles combined. They both still work full time (Jared as a pharmacist, Britt as a hairstylist), though Britt has doubled her income by selling homemade Mickey Mouse ears on Instagram.</p> <p>They are watching 1999\u2019s <em>Tarzan</em> just before I Skype them and they tell me about a Mickey Mouse scarecrow outside their house for the autumn season.</p> <p>\u201cDo you ever get judged by people?\u201d I ask. \u201cOh my <em>God</em>,\u201d Britt exclaims. Jared offers a prolonged laugh punctuated with a simple, \u201c<em>Yeah</em>!\u201d A few years ago, when Britt worked in a bank, she saw her colleague was swamped with work and offered to help. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a colouring book to colour?\u201d her colleague had retorted. \u201cThat\u2019s the rudest thing anybody has ever said to me,\u201d says Britt. \u201cJust because I like Disney doesn\u2019t make me immature. It makes me way more open-minded and broad, that I could find magic in places that you\u2019re struggling to find magic in.\u201d</p> <p>Magic isn\u2019t the only thing the couple find at Disney World. Britt says they were \u201cbroke as a joke\u201d before she began selling her ears. Now, if the couple have a big bill or need money quickly, she can open up her ear shop and instantly sell 40-50 pairs, which she will make in the course of a month. But the couple say they\u2019re not just motivated by money, they enjoy the opportunity \u2013 through the Disney vlogs they post every Monday \u2013 to share the parks with those who can\u2019t afford to visit them in real life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e2409599195ac6f6ba6ad0b5c460e78f9278740f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2409599195ac6f6ba6ad0b5c460e78f9278740f/0_1467_4000_3094/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I know my family don\u2019t always fully understand how it works\u2019: Chelsea Watson who blogs at @StyledByMagic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"774\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I know my family don\u2019t always fully understand how it works\u2019: Chelsea Watson who blogs at <a href=\"mailto:@StyledByMagic\">@StyledByMagic</a></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @StyledByMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had people message us from all over the world saying they were suicidal and our videos helped them through the darkest parts of their lives,\u201d Britt says. \u201cIt\u2019s helped them through sicknesses. It\u2019s helped them through family feuds. It\u2019s helped them through their own depression, their own fights. It\u2019s amazing that us going on vacation is helping someone else.\u201d</p> <p>Once, in the Magic Kingdom, the couple saw a Colombian woman standing alone, crying as she looked at ornaments in the year-round Christmas shop. She told them she was a cancer survivor and that her family had pooled all their money to send her to Disney World, but couldn\u2019t afford for anyone else to accompany her. \u201cIt was almost like an out-of-body experience,\u201d says Britt. \u201cI looked around\u2026 I can literally wake up any day and get on a plane and go to Disney World. I have a career out of going to this place; I\u2019ve made friends. It put into perspective how grateful we are to be able to do what we do.\u201d</p> <p>They also enjoy Disney parks because they feel secure there. \u201cWe don\u2019t ever have to worry about not feeling safe. The world is really scary now,\u201d says Jared. When Britt goes to Disney, she is happy in the knowledge that everyone else is visiting for the same reason she is. \u201cWhen you go to a place like New York City, you don\u2019t know what the person standing next to you is there for.\u201d</p> <p>A reputation for being the happiest place on Earth means Disneyland has always been profitable, but it\u2019s undoubtable the company benefits from the influencer trend. Since 2018, Disneyland Paris has run an influencer programme called InsidEARS, giving a select number of influencers early access to information in the hope they\u2019ll promote the parks to a millennial audience, often Dinks (dual income, no kids) who have cash to spare.</p> <p>Steph and Dave, 34 and 32, are InsidEARS from Eastbourne. They have 30,000 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnEucarQRlFRmBVJ5SyX5CA\">YouTube</a> subscribers and 14,000 Instagram followers. When they Skype me from their home office, they are sitting in front of a copy of the \u201cPurple Wall\u201d in Disney\u2019s Magic Kingdom park. Above the fireplace in their living room is a painting of Mufasa and Simba from <em>The Lion King</em>. \u201cWe have to create some story when we have an electrician come into the house,\u201d laughs Steph. \u201cBut when people comment online and say, \u2018You brighten my day up,\u2019 that\u2019s the best thing ever.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aa9c1d022508c3c7871e10f0b811bab4ddcf1368\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa9c1d022508c3c7871e10f0b811bab4ddcf1368/0_0_4928_2955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Global appeal: fireworks exploding over the castle at an event to mark the first anniversary of the opening of Shanghai Disneyland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Global appeal: fireworks exploding over the castle at an event to mark the first anniversary of the opening of Shanghai Disneyland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Steph and Dave\u2019s viewers are mostly aged between 25-35. \u201cA lot of people think Disney is a kids\u2019 thing,\u201d says Dave. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep this going until I\u2019m old and wrinkly, and still going to the parks.\u201d Do Disney influencers ever get sick of Disney?

      "bodyText": "When she was living in New York City, AJ Wolfe would read guidebooks about Walt Disney World on her way to work. Wolfe used the books to \u201cescape from real life\u201d on her commute. Fifteen years later, she makes a living doing a job that didn\u2019t even exist then, and many can hardly believe exists now \u2013 eating sweets at the Most Magical Place on Earth. Since 2009, Wolfe, a mother of one from Texas, has posted pictures and food reviews of Disney food online at her Disney Food Blog, which has evolved into a wildly successful website, video channel and Instagram page. She has accumulated more than 82m views on YouTube and has more than 530,000 followers on Instagram. Like most content creators, Wolfe earns money by selling adverts and taking sponsorships directly from brands. She can hardly believe it. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 incredible,\u201d she says. Wolfe, 41, travels to Disney World once a month. On those days, she gets up at 6am, visits the park, tastes and takes pictures of the food and works until 2am editing content. \u201cIt\u2019s an unsustainable way of living if you\u2019re there every day,\u201d she says, \u201cbut if you\u2019re only there for a few days\u2026\u201d A decade ago, Wolfe relied on credit cards to pay for her frequent Disney trips. Now, she\u2019s essentially paid to go. \u201cI like to say Disney World is the opposite of New York: perfectly manicured, cultivated happiness versus the gritty reality of the city that never sleeps,\u201d she explains. \u201cI think that\u2019s why Disney approaches \u2018obsessive\u2019 levels for some people. It\u2019s such a marked escape from the worries and stresses of their real, day-to-day life.\u201d For years, \u201cDisney was an absolute obsession for me,\u201d she says. Now it\u2019s her career. Wolfe is one of hundreds of people who make a living posting Disney content online, and one of many millions who enjoy consuming it. Though usually not officially affiliated with the brand itself, people who photograph themselves in Disney parks have collectively earned a small fortune by posting about the mouse. We\u2019re familiar with the concept of Instagram influencers \u2013 people who live polished and perfect lives that we love (and hate) to follow. But in a world oversaturated with #beauty and #bikini shots, niche influencers are on the rise, too. There are influencers who only post about Harry Potter \u2013 dressing up as characters and attempting to cook foods mentioned in the books \u2013 and influencers obsessed with Poundland, who show off their weekly bargains. There are vegan influencers, Christian influencers, dog influencers, kidfluencers. \u201cYou surround yourself with your tribe,\u201d Wolfe theorises of the trend. \u201cDisney is a happy place, a getaway, so it makes sense that you want to dive into it. When I\u2019m not in Disney World, I do the same thing. I think everyone wants to get a little taste of vacation life.\u201d Over the past few years, marketing agencies have begun to understand the benefits of \u201cmicro influencers\u201d. Typically, they have fewer followers than the traditionally internet famous, but small-time influencers are valuable because their followers are often more loyal and thus more likely to purchase recommended products. In an age of increasing distrust towards influencers, marketers feel micro influencers who command the attention of a close-knit group will provide a better return on investment. In the early years of the internet, online spaces were fragmented. You might have logged on to 20 different websites, which might not have overlapped with the 20 sites visited by your neighbour. Today, however, we\u2019re stuck in a cycle of constantly checking Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, then Facebook again. Arguably, we are now trying to recapture more personalised online experiences. Between 2017 and 2018, membership of subject-specific Facebook groups increased by 40%, as more and more people sought to interact with like-minded people online. Niche influencers offer an opportunity for people to reclaim a personalised internet experience. We\u2019re less interested in following the same travel vlogger followed by 4m others. In short: love Disney? Follow the Disney micro influencer. Chelsea Watson is a Disney Instagrammer (@StyledByMagic; 65,000 followers) whose grid is bursting with bright colours and classic influencer shots. She twirls her skirts, pouts her lips and strikes over-the-shoulder poses. The key difference between Watson, 24, and other famous Instagrammers \u2013 the model Kylie Jenner, for example, or Britain\u2019s girl-next-door Zoella \u2013 is the mouse ears atop Watson\u2019s head. \u201cI know my family don\u2019t always fully understand how it works,\u201d Watson says, of her influencing career. In 2017, she and her husband moved to Florida from New Hampshire so Watson could pursue a Disney career full-time and she now visits the parks \u201cat least twice a week\u201d. Her posts are dedicated to Disney-inspired fashion and accessories. She creates roughly three sponsored posts a month; brands pay her to advertise their products in a picture. Though she won\u2019t talk exact figures, this is now her sole income. \u201cIn a sense, I\u2019m just like any other fashion blogger,\u201d she says. \u201cThe dream is to always do something you love.\u201d Watson has a passion for fashion. But she also has a passion for Disney. When we speak over Skype, her hair is half-up-half-down in a big scrunchie, and she is wearing a Dumbo T-shirt in which the cartoon elephant\u2019s ears are tied into a cute little knot. \u201cDisney was such a formidable part of my generation\u2019s upbringing. We consumed so much as we were growing up that it made a lasting impact.\u201d In a remarkably prescient essay from 1992, NYU professor David Forgacs wrote that anyone born after 1925 is a \u201cDisney baby\u201d, brought up on a diet of films, stories and merchandise dictated by the mouse. \u201cDisney babies grow, ideally, into Disney adults,\u201d he wrote, arguing that Disney adults have Disney babies of their own. Forgacs spoke of the way the parks marketed nostalgia and played with the boundaries between adolescent and child, in order to profit. \u201cChildren are a major source of Disney income, but only indirectly: it is adults who spend money on them,\u201d he reminds us. This summer, a New York Post writer declared: \u201cSorry, childless millennials going to Disney World is weird,\u201d after a mother\u2019s Facebook rant went viral: \u201cPeople without children need to be banned!!!!\u201d But Watson and Wolfe say their audiences are diverse. They are followed by families, elderly couples and childless millennials. \u201cI\u2019m always taken aback by the mix of people,\u201d Watson says. Why does she think people find her content so compelling? \u201cI think it has a lot to do with the climate in general,\u201d she says. \u201cIn today\u2019s world, people want something happy and positive to focus on. Disney really is for everyone. It\u2019s not just for kids.\u201d She argues that Disney influencers give people \u201ca place to come together and talk about things they love. Be happy. Get away from the negativity for a while.\u201d No one in Watson\u2019s personal life has criticised her for being a grown adult who loves Disney, but other Disney influencers haven\u2019t been so lucky. Britt and Jared are a married couple from Louisiana who have 32,000 followers on their Disney Instagram and YouTube profiles combined. They both still work full time (Jared as a pharmacist, Britt as a hairstylist), though Britt has doubled her income by selling homemade Mickey Mouse ears on Instagram. They are watching 1999\u2019s Tarzan just before I Skype them and they tell me about a Mickey Mouse scarecrow outside their house for the autumn season. \u201cDo you ever get judged by people?\u201d I ask. \u201cOh my God,\u201d Britt exclaims. Jared offers a prolonged laugh punctuated with a simple, \u201cYeah!\u201d A few years ago, when Britt worked in a bank, she saw her colleague was swamped with work and offered to help. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a colouring book to colour?\u201d her colleague had retorted. \u201cThat\u2019s the rudest thing anybody has ever said to me,\u201d says Britt. \u201cJust because I like Disney doesn\u2019t make me immature. It makes me way more open-minded and broad, that I could find magic in places that you\u2019re struggling to find magic in.\u201d Magic isn\u2019t the only thing the couple find at Disney World. Britt says they were \u201cbroke as a joke\u201d before she began selling her ears. Now, if the couple have a big bill or need money quickly, she can open up her ear shop and instantly sell 40-50 pairs, which she will make in the course of a month. But the couple say they\u2019re not just motivated by money, they enjoy the opportunity \u2013 through the Disney vlogs they post every Monday \u2013 to share the parks with those who can\u2019t afford to visit them in real life. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people message us from all over the world saying they were suicidal and our videos helped them through the darkest parts of their lives,\u201d Britt says. \u201cIt\u2019s helped them through sicknesses. It\u2019s helped them through family feuds. It\u2019s helped them through their own depression, their own fights. It\u2019s amazing that us going on vacation is helping someone else.\u201d Once, in the Magic Kingdom, the couple saw a Colombian woman standing alone, crying as she looked at ornaments in the year-round Christmas shop.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s perhaps testimony to the golden moment that the novel in English is currently enjoying that the cull from Booker longlist to shortlist has felt so painful over the past few years. Three of my favourite books of 2019 missed the cut \u2013 Max Porter\u2019s <em>Lanny</em>, Deborah Levy\u2019s <em>The Man Who Saw </em><em>Everything</em> and John Lanchester\u2019s <em>The </em><em>Wall</em> \u2013 but once I\u2019d stopped my indignant spluttering, I recognised that it was still a shortlist worth celebrating. And, perhaps, also worth putting a tenner on, given that the prize is notoriously just \u201cposh bingo\u201d. I got last year badly wrong (my money was on <em>Everything Under</em> by Daisy Johnson), but I have a half-decent record otherwise, with bets on Marlon James, Richard Flanagan and George Saunders covering at least the cost of a new dinner jacket to wear to this year\u2019s ceremony at London\u2019s Guildhall.</p> <p>Clear favourite with the bookies is <strong>Margaret Atwood</strong>\u2019s <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-testaments-9781784742324.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Testaments</em></a>, at 2/1. Atwood makes a stunning return to the world of her classic <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em>, which was shortlisted for the 1986 prize but lost out to Kingsley Amis\u2019s <em>The Old Devils</em>. You\u2019d have to have been living in Gilead to have missed the fanfare surrounding T<em>he Testaments</em>, a subtle, moral novel that is both a clear response to the urgency of the political moment and an attempt to reach beyond the headlines. Here we\u2019re presented with the second generation of handmaids, with the narrative split among three women, each of whom provides a different perspective on the patriarchal totalitarianism of Gilead.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A novel that makes you question whether it should strictly be called a novel is by default a good thing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Next up, at 7/2, is<strong> Chigozie Obioma\u2019</strong>s second novel, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/an-orchestra-of-minorities-9780349143187.html\" title=\"\"><em>An Orchestra of Minorities</em></a><em>. </em>His<em> </em>debut, <em>The </em><em>Fisherm</em><em>en</em><em>,</em> was shortlisted for the prize in 2015. His follow-up is longer, more complex and better than that first book, and is a contemporary retelling of Homer\u2019s <em>Odyssey</em> narrated by the spirit of a chicken farmer. Obioma intertwines classical mythology with Nigerian folklore, but this is above all a love story, in which the genial Chinonso sets out to win the hand of the high-born Ndali, and his voyage is every bit as epic and perilous as that of his Greek predecessor. Obioma\u2019s expansive, tragic, multilingual novel \u2013 it steps between English, Igbo and Nigerian pidgin \u2013 is a magnificent achievement.</p> <p>At 5/1 is <strong>Bernardine </strong><strong>Evaristo</strong>\u2019s <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/girl-woman-other-9780241364901.html\" title=\"\"><em>Girl, Woman, Other</em></a>. Another multi-perspective novel, this one tells the story of 12 black British women (although each of those terms are radically interrogated by the book). Their narratives are interwoven, intimate, rendered in fluid sentences of lyrical prose that often feel more like poetry. I was often reminded of great documentary historians such as Tony Parker and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/13/studs-terkel-race-us-20-years\" title=\"\">Studs Terkel</a> \u2013 the lives presented here leap off the page, building into a tapestry that is at once moving and funny, deceptively simple and yet a powerful commentary on the state of our divided nation, taking in issues of race, gender identity, migration and colonialism.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s perhaps testimony to the golden moment that the novel in English is currently enjoying that the cull from Booker longlist to shortlist has felt so painful over the past few years. Three of my favourite books of 2019 missed the cut \u2013 Max Porter\u2019s Lanny, Deborah Levy\u2019s The Man Who Saw Everything and John Lanchester\u2019s The Wall \u2013 but once I\u2019d stopped my indignant spluttering, I recognised that it was still a shortlist worth celebrating. And, perhaps, also worth putting a tenner on, given that the prize is notoriously just \u201cposh bingo\u201d. I got last year badly wrong (my money was on Everything Under by Daisy Johnson), but I have a half-decent record otherwise, with bets on Marlon James, Richard Flanagan and George Saunders covering at least the cost of a new dinner jacket to wear to this year\u2019s ceremony at London\u2019s Guildhall. Clear favourite with the bookies is Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Testaments, at 2/1. Atwood makes a stunning return to the world of her classic The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, which was shortlisted for the 1986 prize but lost out to Kingsley Amis\u2019s The Old Devils. You\u2019d have to have been living in Gilead to have missed the fanfare surrounding The Testaments, a subtle, moral novel that is both a clear response to the urgency of the political moment and an attempt to reach beyond the headlines. Here we\u2019re presented with the second generation of handmaids, with the narrative split among three women, each of whom provides a different perspective on the patriarchal totalitarianism of Gilead. Next up, at 7/2, is Chigozie Obioma\u2019s second novel, An Orchestra of Minorities. His debut, The Fishermen, was shortlisted for the prize in 2015. His follow-up is longer, more complex and better than that first book, and is a contemporary retelling of Homer\u2019s Odyssey narrated by the spirit of a chicken farmer. Obioma intertwines classical mythology with Nigerian folklore, but this is above all a love story, in which the genial Chinonso sets out to win the hand of the high-born Ndali, and his voyage is every bit as epic and perilous as that of his Greek predecessor. Obioma\u2019s expansive, tragic, multilingual novel \u2013 it steps between English, Igbo and Nigerian pidgin \u2013 is a magnificent achievement. At 5/1 is Bernardine Evaristo\u2019s Girl, Woman, Other. Another multi-perspective novel, this one tells the story of 12 black British women (although each of those terms are radically interrogated by the book). Their narratives are interwoven, intimate, rendered in fluid sentences of lyrical prose that often feel more like poetry. I was often reminded of great documentary historians such as Tony Parker and Studs Terkel \u2013 the lives presented here leap off the page, building into a tapestry that is at once moving and funny, deceptively simple and yet a powerful commentary on the state of our divided nation, taking in issues of race, gender identity, migration and colonialism. A novel that makes you question whether it should strictly be called a novel is by default a good thing \u2013 this is a book that pushes at the limits of the genre and leaves you feeling lucky to have spent time in the presence of a writer of such warm-hearted wisdom. Twitter has had great fun quoting my review of Lucy Ellmann\u2019s Ducks, Newburyport (6/1) back to me. I said that \u201c98% of those who pick it up will think it unspeakable guff\u201d, a comment I stand by, notwithstanding her shortlisting.

Shafak is a powerful force for good in the world and a writer of extraordinary gifts, but this one left me cold. A few weeks ago, 1981 winner Salman Rushdie\u2019s Quichotte was an even-odds favourite. It\u2019s now a 12/1 outsider. We\u2019re not saying that there have been loose lips from one of the judging panel, but it seems a precipitous fall from grace for a splendid novel.

And you are not allowed to go for the chest or privates. Choke-holds seem to be fine, though.

Her peers are getting stabbed and friends of friends have been killed. \u201cHappens a lot around this area,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat\u2019s a bloody punch in the face compared to getting stabbed up the road?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Price reasons.</p> <p>Dyer got into MMA through her father, who took her with him to the boxing gym to give her mum a bit of space. A third fighter, 19-year-old Cory McKenna from Colchester, was introduced to it by her mother, with whom she has fought and sparred. There is something in the parental connection, though it is never fully explored. McCann talks about how she was not academic at school, but sport allowed her to express herself; it just happened that MMA was the one that made her feel most comfortable in her skin. She talks of her single mother, who was an addict and later sobered up. After winning a crucial bout, she says, heartbreakingly, \u201cI just wish my mum was here.\u201d</p> <p>The psychological elements are handled lightly, though, as is the notion that these are three women trying to make it big in a world traditionally dominated by men. On one hand, it was nice to watch a documentary about women in sport that didn\u2019t dwell on their gender, but rather their talent and ambition. On the other, the world of MMA is very male, at least as it appears here. The trainers and teams we saw were all men. Even in the US, at a big Ultimate Fight Club night, only three of the 11 fights on the slate involved women.

In North Carolina, she ends up screaming support for McCann as she takes on her biggest opponent yet.

      "bodyText": "Melissa Mollen Dupuis watched from the sidelines as Greta Thunberg, the teenage Swedish climate activist, led hundreds of thousands of protesters in a climate strike through central Montreal last month. At the vanguard, a group of 30 indigenous and non-indigenous young people unfurled a banner that declared: \u201cTo the frontlines, for Mother Earth.\u201d Dupuis, a prominent indigenous rights and environmental activist from Quebec, had helped train those young men and women: part of a broader, grassroots effort to marry the two causes \u2013 climate crisis and indigenous rights \u2013 and raise a new generation of youth activists. As she saw them lead the march, she wept. \u201cThose plants I grew, I was picking the fruits of that work,\u201d she said. \u201cI see it growing bigger and bigger.\u201d The climate march in September drew half a million people, the largest demonstration in Montreal\u2019s history. It was the culmination of a broader national conversation on the climate crisis and environmental policies ahead of a federal election later this month that may weaken the prime minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s hold on power. \u201cThis was a defining moment for a generation,\u201d said Professor Sylvie de Blois, the director of McGill University\u2019s school of environment, in Montreal.

The prime minister is expected to convene the House of Commons for a rare Saturday session, either to ask for support for his deal, if he succeeds in striking one at this week\u2019s European council \u2013 or to request that MPs back a no-deal exit at the end of this month. Pro-remain MPs hope to amend any motion put by the government, to insist that Johnson\u2019s deal be subject to a public vote. But asked by Sophy Ridge on Sky News whether some MPs would be more likely to support a deal if it would be put to a referendum, Corbyn said, \u201cI think many in parliament, not necessarily Labour MPs but others, might be inclined to support it, because they don\u2019t really agree with the deal \u2013 but I would caution them on this.\u201d He said he would instead be keen to see a Labour-style Brexit deal, including a customs union, and guarantees on workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards, put to the public. Corbyn\u2019s comments appeared to put him at odds with the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, who said in a speech in Glasgow on Saturday that Labour would press for any deal Johnson secures to be subject to a referendum. \u201cNext week our priorities are clear: if Boris Johnson does manage to negotiate a deal, then we will insist that it is put back to the people in a confirmatory vote,\u201d Starmer said. The Labour leadership has been torn for many months between what it sees as the need to reach out to leave voters in Labour constituencies and the party\u2019s membership, which is strongly remain. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has been accused by some on the left of the party in recent days of making too many concessions to the People\u2019s Vote campaign. The shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, who is a close ally of McDonnell\u2019s and widely regarded as a potential future leadership contender, struck a different tone to Corbyn on Sunday.

      "body": "<p>Rebecca Ferguson is almost entirely convinced the following ordeal is indicative of her true character, her <em>deep down</em> self, but she struggles with how.</p> <p>The story goes like this. Not long ago, Ferguson happened to see a woman collapse unconscious, and then she watched panic spread across the face of the woman\u2019s husband and ripple on to the faces of the people around him. Though it was not her place, because she is a big-time Hollywood actor and is in no way a medical professional, she waded into the formed crowd, located the woman\u2019s pulse (which she could not properly count) and began barking instructions. A stranger suggested water for the fallen woman, but Ferguson shouted, \u201cNo! Orange juice!\u201d a tip she\u2019d picked up watching <em>ER</em>. When the crowd edged closer, Ferguson yelled, \u201cSome space, <em>please!</em>\u201d The instructions tumbled out of her mouth before she could think to recover them, one after the other, an apparently natural act, until the woman came to and the crowd broke apart. As Ferguson walked away, someone asked, \u201cAre you a nurse?\u201d And she was forced to say no, she was an actor, that her actions had been formed in make-believe, a revelation she admits could have gone either way.</p> <p>It was a confidence act, she says now. She is surrounded by cushions in the window seat of a caf\u00e9, in a plush part of south London, waving her long hands around, being confident. \u201cWhat I realised,\u201d she says, making the realisation all over again, \u201cis that as soon as someone takes control, people feel safe.\u201d She looks awed: \u201cHuman psychology\u2026\u201d Then sincere, like she might have done a bad thing: \u201cShe could have been dying.\u201d</p> <p>For a while now, Ferguson, 35, has been popping up in some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest productions. She starred in the 2016 thriller <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/09/the-girl-on-the-train-review-emily-blunt-paula-hawkins\" title=\"\">The Girl on the Train</a></em>, and has appeared alongside Tom Cruise in the <em>Mission Impossible</em> franchise and with Hugh Jackman and Michelle Williams in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-greatest-showman\" title=\"\">The Greatest Showman</a></em>. She is about to star in <em>Doctor Sleep</em>, a sequel to <em>The Shining</em> and, next year, in Denis Villeneuve\u2019s <em>Dune</em> and Lisa Joy\u2019s <em>Reminiscence</em> \u2013 major box-office events. She has appeared in magazines and on late-night talk-show couches and on big screens around the world. She has likely already made more money than most people earn in a lifetime.</p> <p>So what is more remarkable: that Ferguson did this weird thing, pretended to be a medical professional at a real-life emergency, thought it would be a good idea to do the thing she is best at doing: acting, making people <em>believe</em>? Or that, throughout the entire ordeal, not a single person realised who she was?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56db34b7ea4fbb62f230e107407332837a7aab9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56db34b7ea4fbb62f230e107407332837a7aab9d/22_140_4075_5092/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018For me, it\u2019s been a slow process\u2019: Rebecca Ferguson.l\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018For me, it\u2019s been a slow process\u2019: Rebecca Ferguson wears suit by Margaret Howell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gustavo Papaleo/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That she was not recognised is not unusual, Ferguson says. She looks around the caf\u00e9, where nobody is recognising her. \u201cI never am.\u201d It suits her; it is a good thing. Does she enjoy fame? No! Is she private? Yes, completely, so private she avoids her own phone, which is problematic for her family when they need to reach her. She says of her phone: \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of the device,\u201d and pours scorn over it. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m tired of technology,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s too simplistic \u2013 it\u2019s all around us. It\u2019s that I know what I\u2019m like. When I start something I want to finish it. I hate having 400 things up in the air.\u201d</p> <p>So all this time she spends not being recognised is good for her. She is able to \u201cdisconnect\u201d, which means she can focus fully on \u201clife\u201d: her 15-month-old daughter, her 11-year-old son, a house renovation, a house move, work, publicity for work, learning new accents for work, experimenting with new accents for work, all the many things tied into being a \u201cvery busy\u201d actor and mum and friend and wife.</p> <p><strong>For a time,</strong> Ferguson was the most recognisable girl in Sweden, but that was her mother\u2019s fault. Ferguson grew up in Stockholm, a happy child of separation. Her mother was English and glamorous and loving. Before dinner parties, she would light a cigar, percolate coffee, fill a glass with cognac and sprinkle it around the home. \u201cLike people do now with sage,\u201d to create a feeling of warmth. She encouraged Ferguson to try new things: gymnastics, salsa, playing cards. When she was very young, Ferguson was \u201cthe only kid in a bridge class, learning to gamble with 70-year-old women\u201d. Her mother thought she might have a knack for numbers; she thought she might have a knack for many things. \u201cBridge is a very cool game,\u201d Ferguson says, \u201cif you were born in 1765.\u201d</p> <p>When Ferguson was 15, her mother encouraged her to attend a TV casting. She\u2019d already tried modelling but disliked it so much she never booked a job. \u201cI remember thinking: that\u2019s absolutely terrifying. Hated the idea. I would blush just standing in front of my class.\u201d But the casting was a revelation. Somehow, she forgot about the camera and the crew \u2013 all those people around \u2013 and she just started \u201ctrying things\u201d, changing language, making things more \u201cnatural\u201d. The job, which she won, happened to be the lead role in a Swedish soap opera, <em>Nya Tider</em> (<em>New Times</em>), that almost everyone in the country tuned into. She filmed five episodes a week for a year and a half. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bca96fdfeebe0b1980545c218ee98c1569c62244\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bca96fdfeebe0b1980545c218ee98c1569c62244/98_0_3803_2282/1000.jpg\" alt=\"What a scream: Rebecca Ferguson in the new Stephen King film Doctor Sleep.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">What a scream: Rebecca Ferguson in the new Stephen King film Doctor Sleep.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She matured quickly, she says. She had become part of \u201cthe media\u201d. It was fun and exhausting. But nothing lasts. When the job ended, \u201cIt was one of those moments of, \u2018Yes, you\u2019re a famous soap actor in Sweden, what now?\u2019 Most <em>sincere</em> actors go to drama school. They watch Bergman and wear purple berets. That wasn\u2019t me. I didn\u2019t know what the craft was. I didn\u2019t know anything. How do I get a job? I didn\u2019t know what a casting director was. Could I look one up? Could I send them my CV?\u201d</p> <p>What followed was a kind of wilderness, bleak in her telling. She missed out on an important part of youth, she says: \u201cHaving sex with lots of people. Doing drugs.\u201d For a while, she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to act. So she got other jobs. She worked at a daycare centre and as a nanny. She worked in a jewellery shop and in a shoe shop and at a Korean restaurant. \u201cSome people sharp-elbow themselves through life,\u201d she says, \u201cjust to get what they want. I never felt that drive, which sometimes made me think I\u2019m not really worthy of the job I do. For me, it\u2019s been a slow process.\u201d </p> <p>Her international career is still newish, she thinks, which might explain why, despite having appeared in very major films, few people recognise her on the street. She remembers turning up at castings as recently as five years ago, recording self-tapes, running lines with her mother, who could be counted on to overact. She used to take any role she could get, but \u201cnow I get enough offers to be working and complaining about it. In the beginning, you\u2019re so grateful you grab and you grab. You need to do all the jobs you can. To be versatile, to meet people. But after a while you get to a point where you can sift things out.\u201d She offers me some you-can-do-it advice. \u201cIt will get to the point where <em>you</em> can turn down jobs, too. Rebecca Ferguson? No, way\u2026 Unless it\u2019s that Liverpudlian singer.\u201d</p> <p><strong>To prepare for</strong> her role in <em>Doctor Sleep</em>, a psychological horror film, Ferguson steeled herself to watch other horror films, which was in itself an ordeal, she admits, because she doesn\u2019t watch horror films, can\u2019t handle them, hates losing control. \u201cI have a bad startle reflex,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you jump out, I will <em>hit</em> you.\u201d Her husband told her she\u2019d be remiss if she didn\u2019t research. \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen <em>Nightmare on Elm Street</em>. <em>Halloween</em>? Fuck off! Because. I. Will. Not. Sleep!\u201d Eventually she relented, on one condition: no clowns, no kids. \u201cHate the look of a clown,\u201d she says. \u201cHate their need for attention.

      "bodyText": "Rebecca Ferguson is almost entirely convinced the following ordeal is indicative of her true character, her deep down self, but she struggles with how. The story goes like this. Not long ago, Ferguson happened to see a woman collapse unconscious, and then she watched panic spread across the face of the woman\u2019s husband and ripple on to the faces of the people around him. Though it was not her place, because she is a big-time Hollywood actor and is in no way a medical professional, she waded into the formed crowd, located the woman\u2019s pulse (which she could not properly count) and began barking instructions. A stranger suggested water for the fallen woman, but Ferguson shouted, \u201cNo! Orange juice!\u201d a tip she\u2019d picked up watching ER. When the crowd edged closer, Ferguson yelled, \u201cSome space, please!\u201d The instructions tumbled out of her mouth before she could think to recover them, one after the other, an apparently natural act, until the woman came to and the crowd broke apart. As Ferguson walked away, someone asked, \u201cAre you a nurse?\u201d And she was forced to say no, she was an actor, that her actions had been formed in make-believe, a revelation she admits could have gone either way. It was a confidence act, she says now. She is surrounded by cushions in the window seat of a caf\u00e9, in a plush part of south London, waving her long hands around, being confident. \u201cWhat I realised,\u201d she says, making the realisation all over again, \u201cis that as soon as someone takes control, people feel safe.\u201d She looks awed: \u201cHuman psychology\u2026\u201d Then sincere, like she might have done a bad thing: \u201cShe could have been dying.\u201d For a while now, Ferguson, 35, has been popping up in some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest productions. She starred in the 2016 thriller The Girl on the Train, and has appeared alongside Tom Cruise in the Mission Impossible franchise and with Hugh Jackman and Michelle Williams in The Greatest Showman. She is about to star in Doctor Sleep, a sequel to The Shining and, next year, in Denis Villeneuve\u2019s Dune and Lisa Joy\u2019s Reminiscence \u2013 major box-office events. She has appeared in magazines and on late-night talk-show couches and on big screens around the world. She has likely already made more money than most people earn in a lifetime. So what is more remarkable: that Ferguson did this weird thing, pretended to be a medical professional at a real-life emergency, thought it would be a good idea to do the thing she is best at doing: acting, making people believe?

I love how sweet-hearted and loving it is.

They have such a kind, funny relationship on the show: it feels real, actually capturing the ways people have fun with each other. The whole programme is written with a true and clear comic voice that is also incredibly big and silly. I watch every episode two or three times just so I don\u2019t miss anything.

It\u2019s so brave of him \u2013 he really puts himself out there, all of the emotional difficulty, all the vulnerability.

      "body": "<h2><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-tv-plus/\" title=\"\">AppleTV+</a></h2> <p>Surprising it took Apple this long to get on the original-content video-on-demand (VOD) bandwagon, but here it is, launching 1 November: a glossy-looking library of brand-new, all-star, Apple-produced series, documentaries and films, with everyone from Oprah Winfrey to <em>Sesame Street </em>on board. Subscriptions are \u00a34.99 a month (new Apple device purchasers get a year free).</p> <p><strong>Hottest content</strong><br>Buzz so far has centred on scripted series, with comedy <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA7D4_qU9jo\" title=\"\">The Morning Show</a></em> featured foremost in the marketing: starring Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell, it\u2019s a slick look at breakfast-TV politics aiming for both popular and critical cred. Also getting hyped: <em>Dickinson</em>, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/aug/27/from-little-women-to-dickinson-how-modernised-should-adaptations-be\" title=\"\">period sitcom</a> with Hailee Steinfeld as the young poet, and a reboot of Steven Spielberg\u2019s <em>Amazing Stories</em>.</p> <p><strong>Hidden gems</strong><br>There\u2019s been less talk about cinematic content, but it seems Apple is seeking to challenge Netflix as a go-to for US indie film-makers. At Sundance in January, they made their first festival purchase: <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhztfiQ9zqo\" title=\"\">Hala</a></em>, director Minhal Baig\u2019sa well-received coming-of-age study of a Muslim teen at an American high school, streaming from 22 November.</p> <p><strong>How essential is it?</strong><br>That remains to be seen as it grows. It will launch with a relatively small starter collection, so whether or not to subscribe depends on which individual attractions take your fancy: if you absolutely must be first to see <em>The Morning Show</em>, for example, a fiver (after a free week-long trial) is fair enough. But its place in the market doesn\u2019t seem unique just yet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0543df8a2f01378f131067a3c5e1775f99e0c6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0543df8a2f01378f131067a3c5e1775f99e0c6d/130_0_1075_645/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston in Aple TV\u2019s exclusive comedy-drama The Morning Show.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston in Aple TV\u2019s exclusive comedy-drama The Morning Show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AppleTV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Best for</strong><br>Families with diverse interests needing extra viewing options. (One account serves up to six household members.) Very small people get the <em>Sesame Street</em> spinoff <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9xMsmXvG04\" title=\"\">Helpsters</a></em> and a new educational <em>Peanuts</em> cartoon, <em>Snoopy in Space</em>; older children get a <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyHYMozXc4A\" title=\"\">Ghostwriter</a></em> reboot and <em>Prehistoric Planet.</em><em> </em>Parents get the big-name dramas.</p> <p><strong>They say</strong><br>Apple CEO Tim Cook: \u201cIt\u2019s not about whether Netflix wins and we lose, or if we win and they lose. Many people use multiple services, and we are now trying to become one of them.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Score: 7/10</strong><br>Hard to rate sight-unseen, but thus far their launch has been characterised by all the polished presentation and classy celebrity endorsement we expect from the Apple brand. Now it\u2019s time to see if their programming lives up to it.</p> <h2>Disney+</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8125a233d0033a87ff6099827fbbfbfc0c41581\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8125a233d0033a87ff6099827fbbfbfc0c41581/0_1182_5824_3493/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeff Goldblum\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The World According to Jeff Goldblum will be among the more offbeat factual shows on Disney+.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What is it?</strong><br>Soon to be a one-stop shop for all things Disney, both films and TV, as well as subsidiaries Pixar, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Fox and National Geographic. There\u2019s no confirmed UK date yet but it arrives in the US, Canada, Australia and beyond next month, and industry experts predict an early 2020 UK launch at around \u00a35.99 a month (rumour has it that the later launch here is due to pre-existing licensing deals).</p> <p><strong>Hottest content</strong><br>The entire Disney film library will eventually be available, but <em>Captain Marvel</em> will be their first cinema release to stream exclusively on the service. It\u2019s also the only place to stream all 30 series of <em>The Simpsons</em>, and the new Star Wars spin-off series The Mandalorian, launching in November. An updated <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2ZDDU34gYw\" title=\"\">Lady and the Tramp</a></em> will be their first live-action remake to bypass cinemas.</p> <p><strong>Hidden gems</strong><br>Though the primary selling point of Disney+ is its gathering of already familiar favourites, there are some swerves in the promised lineup, particularly in factual content. Who can resist the sound of <em><a href=\"https://disneyplusoriginals.disney.com/show/the-world-according-to-jeff-goldblum\" title=\"\">The World According to Jeff Goldblum</a></em>, a series in which the eccentric star explores such everyday subjects as trainers and tattoos?</p> <p><strong>How essential is it?</strong><br>Given that this will eventually be the only place to access the entire Disney canon, not to mention the <em>Star Wars</em> and Marvel franchises among other ubiquitous fixtures of pop culture, Disney+ is likely to become indispensable to a wide audience. Loyalists of physical media may hold out, at least until the original content becomes a sufficient draw.</p> <p><strong>Best for</strong><br>Parents, first and foremost: family entertainment is the name of the game here, to the extent that no films with an adult age restriction from Fox or Fox Searchlight \u2013 <em>The Favourite</em>, for example \u2013 will be included. But child-free fantasy fans and comic-book geeks will also be subscribing en masse.</p> <p><strong>They say</strong><br>Disney exec Agnes Chu: \u201cWe\u2019re not making a large volume of things just to make them. Everything we do, we have a very clear focus that it needs to meet the standards that the originals set, and hopefully take it to another level on Disney+. So we\u2019re pretty thoughtful about harnessing the nostalgia.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Score: 8/10</strong><br>Disney is the dominant force in contemporary entertainment, and this promised colossus looks set to cement that: this is the one giving Netflix bosses the most sleepless nights. Still, the lack of details about its UK launch is beginning to frustrate fans.</p> <h2>Britbox</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef9771637cf29795285ae83084251b5ec7c57882\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef9771637cf29795285ae83084251b5ec7c57882/0_44_1900_1140/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fawlty Towers, available on Britbox.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fawlty Towers, available on Britbox.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What is it?</strong><br>A solution to streamline the tangle of free VOD services offered by British TV channels, Britbox will gather new and classic series from ITV and the BBC in one place. An internationally tailored version has proven popular in the US and Canada; it will belatedly launch on home turf later this year (date TBC) at \u00a35.99 a month.</p> <p><strong>Hottest content</strong><br>You can already sample Britbox\u2019s wares on the limited beta service they\u2019re testing. It\u2019s only a taster, though it offers many of the current popular phenomena (<em>Love Island</em>, if you feel the need to catch up) and throwback favourites (from <em>Prime Suspect</em> to <em>Fawlty Towers</em>).</p> <p><strong>Hidden gems</strong><br>Britbox appears to be mainly about familiar comfort viewing rather than off-the-radar surprises. But the inclusion of Alan Bleasdale\u2019s gritty Liverpudlian landmark <em>Boys </em><em>from the Blackstuff</em> in the initial lineup suggests it may also be an archive for tougher British drama. Exclusive original content is also promised, though details are scarce.</p> <p><strong>How essential is it?</strong><br>That really depends on how much British TV you want in your life, on top of what\u2019s readily available.

      "bodyText": "AppleTV+ Surprising it took Apple this long to get on the original-content video-on-demand (VOD) bandwagon, but here it is, launching 1 November: a glossy-looking library of brand-new, all-star, Apple-produced series, documentaries and films, with everyone from Oprah Winfrey to Sesame Street on board. Subscriptions are \u00a34.99 a month (new Apple device purchasers get a year free). Hottest content Buzz so far has centred on scripted series, with comedy The Morning Show featured foremost in the marketing: starring Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell, it\u2019s a slick look at breakfast-TV politics aiming for both popular and critical cred. Also getting hyped: Dickinson, a period sitcom with Hailee Steinfeld as the young poet, and a reboot of Steven Spielberg\u2019s Amazing Stories. Hidden gems There\u2019s been less talk about cinematic content, but it seems Apple is seeking to challenge Netflix as a go-to for US indie film-makers. At Sundance in January, they made their first festival purchase: Hala, director Minhal Baig\u2019sa well-received coming-of-age study of a Muslim teen at an American high school, streaming from 22 November. How essential is it? That remains to be seen as it grows. It will launch with a relatively small starter collection, so whether or not to subscribe depends on which individual attractions take your fancy: if you absolutely must be first to see The Morning Show, for example, a fiver (after a free week-long trial) is fair enough. But its place in the market doesn\u2019t seem unique just yet. Best for Families with diverse interests needing extra viewing options. (One account serves up to six household members.) Very small people get the Sesame Street spinoff Helpsters and a new educational Peanuts cartoon, Snoopy in Space; older children get a Ghostwriter reboot and Prehistoric Planet. Parents get the big-name dramas. They say Apple CEO Tim Cook: \u201cIt\u2019s not about whether Netflix wins and we lose, or if we win and they lose. Many people use multiple services, and we are now trying to become one of them.\u201d Score: 7/10 Hard to rate sight-unseen, but thus far their launch has been characterised by all the polished presentation and classy celebrity endorsement we expect from the Apple brand. Now it\u2019s time to see if their programming lives up to it. Disney+ What is it? Soon to be a one-stop shop for all things Disney, both films and TV, as well as subsidiaries Pixar, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Fox and National Geographic. There\u2019s no confirmed UK date yet but it arrives in the US, Canada, Australia and beyond next month, and industry experts predict an early 2020 UK launch at around \u00a35.99 a month (rumour has it that the later launch here is due to pre-existing licensing deals). Hottest content The entire Disney film library will eventually be available, but Captain Marvel will be their first cinema release to stream exclusively on the service. It\u2019s also the only place to stream all 30 series of The Simpsons, and the new Star Wars spin-off series The Mandalorian, launching in November. An updated Lady and the Tramp will be their first live-action remake to bypass cinemas. Hidden gems Though the primary selling point of Disney+ is its gathering of already familiar favourites, there are some swerves in the promised lineup, particularly in factual content. Who can resist the sound of The World According to Jeff Goldblum, a series in which the eccentric star explores such everyday subjects as trainers and tattoos? How essential is it? Given that this will eventually be the only place to access the entire Disney canon, not to mention the Star Wars and Marvel franchises among other ubiquitous fixtures of pop culture, Disney+ is likely to become indispensable to a wide audience. Loyalists of physical media may hold out, at least until the original content becomes a sufficient draw. Best for Parents, first and foremost: family entertainment is the name of the game here, to the extent that no films with an adult age restriction from Fox or Fox Searchlight \u2013 The Favourite, for example \u2013 will be included. But child-free fantasy fans and comic-book geeks will also be subscribing en masse. They say Disney exec Agnes Chu: \u201cWe\u2019re not making a large volume of things just to make them. Everything we do, we have a very clear focus that it needs to meet the standards that the originals set, and hopefully take it to another level on Disney+. So we\u2019re pretty thoughtful about harnessing the nostalgia.\u201d Score: 8/10 Disney is the dominant force in contemporary entertainment, and this promised colossus looks set to cement that: this is the one giving Netflix bosses the most sleepless nights. Still, the lack of details about its UK launch is beginning to frustrate fans. Britbox What is it? A solution to streamline the tangle of free VOD services offered by British TV channels, Britbox will gather new and classic series from ITV and the BBC in one place. An internationally tailored version has proven popular in the US and Canada; it will belatedly launch on home turf later this year (date TBC) at \u00a35.99 a month. Hottest content You can already sample Britbox\u2019s wares on the limited beta service they\u2019re testing. It\u2019s only a taster, though it offers many of the current popular phenomena (Love Island, if you feel the need to catch up) and throwback favourites (from Prime Suspect to Fawlty Towers). Hidden gems Britbox appears to be mainly about familiar comfort viewing rather than off-the-radar surprises. But the inclusion of Alan Bleasdale\u2019s gritty Liverpudlian landmark Boys from the Blackstuff in the initial lineup suggests it may also be an archive for tougher British drama. Exclusive original content is also promised, though details are scarce. How essential is it? That really depends on how much British TV you want in your life, on top of what\u2019s readily available. The picture has been clouded a bit by the BBC\u2019s newly announced plans to revamp the free iPlayer service including digital box sets alongside regular programming, and removing that peskily narrow 30-day viewing window. This risks undermining the worth of Britbox. Best for Old-school TV nostalgists who no longer bother with physical media and thus have no other way to wallow in the lush 1980s pleasures of The Jewel in the Crown. Younger audiences are likely to find their favourite British programming by another method. They say The BBC director general, Tony Hall, likens Britbox to the Beeb\u2019s DVD collection: \u201cThis is just a modern-day version of that... a better version of that, because it used to be infuriating when you\u2019d seen a programme on the BBC and you couldn\u2019t get hold of the DVD.\u201d Score: 6/10 The quality of the programming isn\u2019t in doubt, but many punters will quibble with paying a subscription fee for content their TV licences have already covered. The appearance of the beta site, meanwhile, is functional rather than exciting: one hopes they\u2019re saving some sparkle for the official launch. Netflix What is it? In case you\u2019ve just emerged from a 10-year coma, the former DVD rental service Netflix has evolved into the biggest name in streaming, with nearly 150 million subscribers worldwide. Initially a library of existing films and TV, it has, since 2012, gone into producing original content, winning Oscars and Emmys. Subscriptions start at \u00a35.99 a month. Hottest content It\u2019s increasingly to keep up with what\u2019s hottest on Netflix: popular favourites include Ryan Murphy\u2019s satirical drama series The Politician, which stars Gwyneth Paltrow, critically acclaimed true-crime miniseries Unbelievable and the final series of loopy philosophical sitcom The Good Place. On the film side, anticipation is feverish for their biggest original production to date: Martin Scorsese\u2019s three-and-a-half-hour gangster saga The Irishman. Hidden gems Netflix\u2019s archive has dwindled since they poured funds into original content, but you can still find surprises including Pioneers: First Women Filmmakers, a fascinating anthology of early silent cinema by female trailblazers including Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9 and Lois Weber. That they\u2019re rubbing shoulders with Queer Eye is Netflix in a nutshell. How essential is it? As essential as any streaming service can be right now, despite flawed presentation and deep reserves of dross. There\u2019s too much content here essential to the current cultural conversation \u2013 be it BoJack Horseman or Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s Roma \u2013 for anyone wishing to remain in the loop to do without it. Best for Everyone, really. The more Netflix invests in its \u201cOriginals\u201d (sometimes a misnomer for films they\u2019ve acquired rather than produced), the less they seem to cultivate any kind of demographic, aiming at teens (To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before), highbrow cinephiles (Senegalese Cannes winner Atlantics, coming next month) and everyone in between. They say Martin Scorsese explains why Netflix is now a film studio in its own right: \u201cThe movie business is changing hour by hour \u2013 not necessarily for the better \u2013 and many places we would have gone to for funding in the past were no longer viable.

We agreed on everything, most importantly that we all wanted to make the same movie.\u201d Score: 9/10 There\u2019s a reason why Netflix has become a noun (or verb) bigger than its own brand, as in the proverbial invitation to \u201cNetflix and chill\u201d: for younger generations in particular, the streaming giant isthe default, and their content production is only getting more elaborate and far-reaching. Amazon Prime What is it? The most brand-entangled of all these services, Amazon Prime Video is effectively a side perk of Prime membership \u2013 some might value it less than free same-day delivery on their online purchases. But for a side perk, it\u2019s grown into rather a good one, with access to a vast library of films, TV, original content and even live-streamed sports events as part of a \u00a37.99-a-month Prime subscription. Hottest content Prime\u2019s original programming never quite attained the fashionability of Netflix\u2019s, even when it\u2019s been very good, but the now-departed Transparent and the glossy, Emmy-guzzling The Marvelous Mrs Maisel have granted them a lot of cred. And last month, Amazon signed the hottest name in TV, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, to create and produce multiple shows exclusively for the platform in a \u00a350m deal: hopes are high. Hidden gems Prime\u2019s film selection is packed with mainstream favourites, but the surprises come with the service\u2019s glut of add-on channels \u2013 pick the ones you want, and each will appear on your interface for a monthly top-up fee. They range from an Amazon-allied edition of the BFI Player to horror service Shudder, while cinephiles should seek out FilmBox Live, with its menu ranging from Tsai Ming-Lliang\u2019s The River to Luchino Visconti\u2019s Ossessione. How essential is it? Some people take an either/or approach to Netflix and Prime, given the similarity of their remits. If you\u2019re choosing one, it\u2019s a matter of priorities: Prime\u2019s original programming hasn\u2019t made them invaluable yet, but their back catalogue is a bit stronger. If you\u2019re already a regular Amazon shopper, that tilts the balance in favour of a Prime subscription. Best for Discerning adult viewers who can afford the slightly higher subscription cost (particularly when you factor in extra channels), to whom the service\u2019s best programming is generally aimed. If they\u2019re parents with Peppa Pig-addicted toddlers, so much the better: multiple series of the pink terror\u2019s antics are available. They say Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos: \u201cOur goal with Amazon Prime, make no mistake, is to make sure that if you are not a Prime member, you are being irresponsible.\u201d Score: 8/10 It\u2019s not the most well-presented streaming service on the block \u2013 browsing beyond its homepage offerings gets a bit fiddly \u2013 but it\u2019s gradually shaking its \u201cNetflix\u2019s dowdier sister\u201d image and asserting its own brand of cool. Peacock (NBCUniversal) What is it? Named to reflect the logo of American TV channel NBC, this is one of multiple US network-based streaming services striking fear in the hearts of Netflix with plans to reclaim exclusive streaming rights to their most beloved shows. It launches in the US next April, with UK plans unconfirmed \u2013 though word is that an international version will eventually be free to Sky subscribers. Hottest content The primary draw, as it stands, will be streaming access to a library of NBC Universal\u2019s most popular drama, comedy and reality series, including 30 Rock, Battlestar Galactica, Will &amp; Grace, Friday Night Lights and, er, The Real Housewives franchise.

At first, I thought it would be great material for a play, then afterwards perhaps a documentary. Then I realised the victims had already told their stories to the press and if they trusted me it was because I was a film director and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/13/spotlight-reporters-uncovered-catholic-child-abuse-boston-globe\" title=\"\">they wanted a </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/13/spotlight-reporters-uncovered-catholic-child-abuse-boston-globe\" title=\"\">Spotlight</a></em> \u00e0 la Fran\u00e7aise.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"644bc5d7026931eb6f5a3b1fbece17eb5cba3a76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/644bc5d7026931eb6f5a3b1fbece17eb5cba3a76/0_0_3072_2047/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, who in March was convicted of failing to report the abuse of children, pictured with Pope Francis earlier this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, who in March was convicted of failing to report the abuse of children, pictured with Pope Francis earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The film also focuses on two other victims, now adults but struggling to deal with long-buried memories of Preynat\u2019s abuse and the devastating effect it has had on their lives and families.</p> <p>Ozon says he felt an immense sense of responsibility to be scrupulously true to the victims\u2019 stories. The words of Preynat, Barbarin and a third person, the diocese\u2019s volunteer psychologist R\u00e9gine Maire, are taken verbatim from what they told the press and legal statements, he says. The film title comes from Cardinal Barbarin\u2019s response when asked why he had not acted earlier to remove Preynat from contact with children. \u201cBy the grace of God most of these cases are now out of date,\u201d he replied, meaning that they were covered by the statute of limitations and no legal action could begin.</p> <p>Maire was accused of covering up Preynat\u2019s abuse but was acquitted after a judge decided she had acted in \u201cgood faith\u201d. She went to court to prevent her real name being used in the film, but the action failed. An appeal by Preynat against the court\u2019s decision to allow the film to be released was dismissed in June, allowing it to be streamed and released on DVD and abroad.</p> <p>On screen, Barbarin is ambiguous. His sympathy for the priest\u2019s victims is portrayed as being overridden by a greater desire to avoid scandal and protect the church. In March, after the film\u2019s release, Barbarin was convicted of failing to report the abuse and taking months to follow a Vatican directive to remove Preynat from duties that put him in contact with children. He has appealed against his conviction.</p> <p>\u201cThe weight of this responsibility to tell these men\u2019s stories was on my shoulders. I w anted to show them as they are, their humanity, their complex characters, but also like we see in American films, the ordinary heroes taking on a powerful institution,\u201d Ozon says. \u201cI wanted the film to show them as heroes because they really are and they changed things. Barbarin was convicted, Preynat defrocked, so they succeeded.\u201d</p> <p>In a powerful and painfully tense scene, the diocese organises a meeting between Alexandre and Preynat. Known as a \u201cconfrontation\u201d, this is a legal process where the victim meets their attacker, usually before a judge. We see Preynat admit he remembers Alexandre and confess: \u201cI have always been attracted to children\u2026 it is a blot on my life and it has always caused me pain. It\u2019s a sickness.\u201d</p> <p>The paedophile priest then contests Alexandre\u2019s calling him a \u201cpaedophile\u201d, arguing that the strict meaning of the word is \u201csomeone who loves children\u2026 and we are all supposed to love children\u201d. As the French magazine <em>Le Point </em>wrote: \u201cPreynat is considered a monster\u2026 even by himself.\u201d</p> <p>Afterwards, Maire, who acts as a mediator, is shocked by Preynat\u2019s failure to demand forgiveness, but advises Alexandre not to \u201cscratch the wounds too much\u201d. Even Alexandre\u2019s parents question why he is \u201cdigging up all these old affairs\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b674c58806b1b640641b6dfbb53843bc95d6083d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b674c58806b1b640641b6dfbb53843bc95d6083d/0_0_3557_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from By the Grace of God.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from By the Grace of God.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI asked Alexandre if he had really wanted Preynat to ask for forgiveness and he said he honestly didn\u2019t know. He was happy with how the meeting went because he wanted Preynat to admit he had abused him, because we know lots of priests have denied it,\u201d Ozon says. \u201cWhat he wanted was for someone of authority in the church, in this case Barbarin, to hear Preynat admit he was a paedophile and to do something about it.\u201d</p> <p>It was while hearing Preynat\u2019s victims recount how he abused them as boys while they attended catechism or scout camps that Ozon was struck by a revelation of his own.</p> <p>\u201cI was listening to the stories of what had happened to these men as children when I remembered something. I must have been seven or eight and went to catechism and we were playing hide and seek,\u201d Ozon says. \u201cThe priest, he was a short man, pushed me into the corner behind a door against the wall and said it was a good hiding place. He held me and I remember he was breathing heavily. At the time, I just thought he was bizarre \u2013 and he smelled bad too \u2013 then someone shouted \u2018game over\u2019 and I ran off. But it was one of those shocking, vertiginous moments when I suddenly realised that if I hadn\u2019t run off, if that priest had touched me, then my life would also have been turned upside down.\u201d</p> <p>In its review of <em>By the Grace of God</em>, the British Film Institute described it as a \u201cwelcome act of solidarity with a group of men who have been betrayed and ignored by the very institution sworn to protect the helpless\u201d.</p> <p>Tension is maintained by Ozon\u2019s use of subtle often soft-focus flashbacks to the boys\u2019 ordeals and the race to find a victim whose abuse is more recent and can be used to bring Preynat to trial.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I researched this subject, what really shocked me was that everyone knew [about Preynat] and nobody did anything,\u201d Ozon says.</p> <p>\u201cFor 30 years, Preynat was a priest in the region and he looked after hundreds of children. Of them, 70 have come forward but he had contact with around 300 children a year for 30 years\u2026 some are now dead, some killed themselves and others don\u2019t want to speak out. For some, the facts are covered by the statute of limitations so they feel there\u2019s no point speaking.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I realised I had run away as a child without any understanding that the priest had a sexual desire</p> <footer> <cite>Fran\u00e7ois Ozon</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cPreynat was honest and that was part of the drama. He never denied it. He said he had a problem with kids; he sent letters to the parents in the 1990s in which he admitted it. Barbarin knew about it. Still nothing happened.\u201d</p> <p>Ozon\u2019s own epiphany when talking to Preynat\u2019s victims has given him a profound empathy that comes through in the film and when he talks. \u201cI realised I had run away as a child without any understanding that the priest had a sexual desire. It\u2019s only suddenly, today, I realise that. At the time, I just thought, \u2018Why is he breathing like that? It\u2019s bizarre.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cSo I asked the victims why they didn\u2019t run and each one told me they felt paralysed. I wanted to show this in the film, how each time the child is like a lamb who goes to the wolf because they trust the adult and they don\u2019t know there is danger.</p> <p>\u201cA child has no weapon against this. Psychologists say when this happens to a child their brain switches off and they don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happened. It\u2019s only when they become an adult it comes back and they realise what has happened. That is the horror. I think what all this shows is that a molested child is a ticking time bomb waiting to go off. And when it does, it touches the whole family.\u201d</p> <p>When filming started, Ozon says he worked in secret with a false working title and outside France to avoid alerting anyone to the real subject. He says he did not meet Barbarin, Preynat and Maire and has no wish to.</p> <p>The film recounts events entirely from the point of the victims and the others are secondary characters whose words we\u2019d already heard from their statements and depositions. What I showed are the victims in their private lives with their families, friends, parents \u2013 all the things people had not spoken about. This is what interested me, to show how this abuse destroyed the victim\u2019s whole family. How it woke up so many things, the guilt felt by the parents, the jealousy of siblings, the anger, the hatred.\u201d</p> <p>When the film was ready, Ozon organised screenings around the country, inviting clergy to attend. \u201cWe went to towns to show the film and invited priests, cardinals, nuns \u2013 anyone from the diocese who wanted to come. At the beginning, I think the church was afraid of the film, then they realised it was quite objective and showed the facts,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cWhat helped was that Alexandre is very Catholic and they realised it was not a film against Catholicism but against the functioning of the church as an institution. The problem was the institution.</p> <p>Ozon insists his film is not an attack on Catholics but on the \u201cchurch as an institution\u201d. As the eldest of four children growing up in a practising Catholic family in Paris, he attended catechism and mass and says he is pleased to have had a Catholic education. Openly gay, he says he lost his faith as an adolescent because of what he saw as the church\u2019s \u201chypocrisy towards issues like sexuality\u201d.</p> <p>Having succeeded in getting <em>By the Grace of God</em> released, he says it is for the audiences to run with the cause in support of victims and for the church to adopt a more transparent and reactive approach to stop abuse by priests.</p> <p>At the end of the film, one of Alexandre\u2019s children asks him if he still believes in God.</p> <p>\u201cThe question should have been, \u2018Do you believe in the church?\u2019 Faith and the institution are not the same thing,\u201d Ozon says.</p> <p>He has been accused of \u201cmanipulating\u201d emotions in the film, but the response in France, even from Catholics, has been largely positive, Ozon says. Vincent Neymon, spokesman for the Bishops\u2019 Conference of France, told France 2 television it was \u201canother stone in the building that is the fight against paedophilia\u201d. <em>Le Monde</em> declared Ozon had succeeded in making a film that was both a \u201csensitive telling of a collective drama and a political film\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/23/film-about-clerical-child-abuse-opens-in-french-cinemas\">Film about clerical child abuse opens in French cinemas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a political film but of course there is a political aspect. I knew the film would make people talk about these things but not as much as it has,\u201d Ozon says. \u201cIf the film gives people the courage to speak out about what has happened, that is wonderful. The victims were absolutely stunned when they saw it\u2026 it shook them up. It\u2019s complicated when you see your own stories told. But they liked it and thanks to the film their association received more money and other victims came forward so it\u2019s a kind of recognition for them.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cPeople often ask: \u2018Do you think cinema can change the world?\u2019 and everyone always replies, \u2018No\u2019. But here, you know I like to think maybe we did change things a little bit. And this was a surprise. I didn\u2019t imagine it would have the positive effect that it\u2019s had.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 By the Grace of God is released in UK cinemas and on <a href=\"https://www.curzonhomecinema.com/\">Curzon Home Cinema</a> on 25 October</em></p> <p><br></p>",

Fortunately.\u201d Even for Ozon, who is known for zigzagging across cinematic genres \u2013 farce, horror, comedy, psychosexual \u2013 By the Grace of God is a departure from style, a dramatised retelling of the story of the victims of Bernard Preynat, a former Catholic priest in the city of Lyon who is believed to have abused 70 children over three decades. Without morphing into documentary, the film presents the facts of the most serious scandal to hit the Catholic church in France. Preynat\u2019s penchant for young boys was widely known and covered up by his superiors, who were more concerned to put the reputation of the church before the shattered childhoods, fractured families and splintered lives of the survivors. Shockingly, even after Preynat admitted in apologetic letters to parents that he was \u201csick\u201d and had \u201ca problem with children\u201d, his diocese protected him and he continued working with youngsters.

It won the Jury Grand Prix prize at the 69th Berlin international film festival and has been likened to Spotlight, the Oscar-winning American film about a team of journalists uncovering paedophilia in the US Catholic church. Sitting on a plush green velvet sofa in his film company\u2019s offices in a discreet building in the financial district a stone\u2019s throw from the Paris stock exchange, Ozon cuts a suave figure in neat blue jeans, a navy polo shirt and brown suede boots. He has the face of a screen matinee idol but after stage lessons when young decided he was a \u201cterrible\u201d actor and preferred the other side of the camera. Those who label him the enfant terrible of French cinema for a directing style that subverts typical genres see him as provocative; fans view his eclectic output as thought-provoking. Filmmaker magazine compared him to Alfred Hitchcock and Rainer Werner Fassbinder and labelled him the \u201chardest working director in France\u201d. Some identify the influence of Ken Loach in Ozon\u2019s often stark film-making. In France, he is better known for lighter films: thrillers, comedies, musicals and melodramas, mostly starring women, including 8 femmes (8 Women) with Catherine Deneuve, Isabelle Huppert, Fanny Ardant and Emmanuelle B\u00e9art and Sous le sable (Under the Sand) with Charlotte Rampling. By the Grace of God came about while he was looking to make a new film about three or four middle-aged men showing their emotions and \u201cmasculine fragility\u201d and stumbled across La Parole Lib\u00e9r\u00e9e (The Liberating Word), the website of an association of Preynat\u2019s victims on which they gave their testimonies. The film begins in 2014, when 40-year-old Alexandre, a successful banker and father of five, from Lyon, who attends mass and sends his children to Catholic schools, is horrified to discover that Preynat, who abused him as a boy at scout camp, is still working with children. Alexandre writes to the diocese and the priest\u2019s superior Cardinal Philippe Barbarin asking them to stop this, but is frustrated and increasingly angry that the church is determined to sweep the matter under the carpet. \u201cWhen I met Alexandre, he came with a big file with all the mails he had sent and the responses and said, \u2018Do what you want with them?\u2019 I began reading and found it incredible. At first, I thought it would be great material for a play, then afterwards perhaps a documentary. Then I realised the victims had already told their stories to the press and if they trusted me it was because I was a film director and they wanted a Spotlight \u00e0 la Fran\u00e7aise.\u201d The film also focuses on two other victims, now adults but struggling to deal with long-buried memories of Preynat\u2019s abuse and the devastating effect it has had on their lives and families. Ozon says he felt an immense sense of responsibility to be scrupulously true to the victims\u2019 stories. The words of Preynat, Barbarin and a third person, the diocese\u2019s volunteer psychologist R\u00e9gine Maire, are taken verbatim from what they told the press and legal statements, he says. The film title comes from Cardinal Barbarin\u2019s response when asked why he had not acted earlier to remove Preynat from contact with children. \u201cBy the grace of God most of these cases are now out of date,\u201d he replied, meaning that they were covered by the statute of limitations and no legal action could begin. Maire was accused of covering up Preynat\u2019s abuse but was acquitted after a judge decided she had acted in \u201cgood faith\u201d. She went to court to prevent her real name being used in the film, but the action failed. An appeal by Preynat against the court\u2019s decision to allow the film to be released was dismissed in June, allowing it to be streamed and released on DVD and abroad. On screen, Barbarin is ambiguous. His sympathy for the priest\u2019s victims is portrayed as being overridden by a greater desire to avoid scandal and protect the church. In March, after the film\u2019s release, Barbarin was convicted of failing to report the abuse and taking months to follow a Vatican directive to remove Preynat from duties that put him in contact with children. He has appealed against his conviction. \u201cThe weight of this responsibility to tell these men\u2019s stories was on my shoulders. I w anted to show them as they are, their humanity, their complex characters, but also like we see in American films, the ordinary heroes taking on a powerful institution,\u201d Ozon says. \u201cI wanted the film to show them as heroes because they really are and they changed things. Barbarin was convicted, Preynat defrocked, so they succeeded.\u201d In a powerful and painfully tense scene, the diocese organises a meeting between Alexandre and Preynat. Known as a \u201cconfrontation\u201d, this is a legal process where the victim meets their attacker, usually before a judge. We see Preynat admit he remembers Alexandre and confess: \u201cI have always been attracted to children\u2026 it is a blot on my life and it has always caused me pain. It\u2019s a sickness.\u201d The paedophile priest then contests Alexandre\u2019s calling him a \u201cpaedophile\u201d, arguing that the strict meaning of the word is \u201csomeone who loves children\u2026 and we are all supposed to love children\u201d. As the French magazine Le Point wrote: \u201cPreynat is considered a monster\u2026 even by himself.\u201d Afterwards, Maire, who acts as a mediator, is shocked by Preynat\u2019s failure to demand forgiveness, but advises Alexandre not to \u201cscratch the wounds too much\u201d. Even Alexandre\u2019s parents question why he is \u201cdigging up all these old affairs\u201d. \u201cI asked Alexandre if he had really wanted Preynat to ask for forgiveness and he said he honestly didn\u2019t know. He was happy with how the meeting went because he wanted Preynat to admit he had abused him, because we know lots of priests have denied it,\u201d Ozon says. \u201cWhat he wanted was for someone of authority in the church, in this case Barbarin, to hear Preynat admit he was a paedophile and to do something about it.\u201d It was while hearing Preynat\u2019s victims recount how he abused them as boys while they attended catechism or scout camps that Ozon was struck by a revelation of his own. \u201cI was listening to the stories of what had happened to these men as children when I remembered something. I must have been seven or eight and went to catechism and we were playing hide and seek,\u201d Ozon says. \u201cThe priest, he was a short man, pushed me into the corner behind a door against the wall and said it was a good hiding place. He held me and I remember he was breathing heavily. At the time, I just thought he was bizarre \u2013 and he smelled bad too \u2013 then someone shouted \u2018game over\u2019 and I ran off. But it was one of those shocking, vertiginous moments when I suddenly realised that if I hadn\u2019t run off, if that priest had touched me, then my life would also have been turned upside down.\u201d In its review of By the Grace of God, the British Film Institute described it as a \u201cwelcome act of solidarity with a group of men who have been betrayed and ignored by the very institution sworn to protect the helpless\u201d. Tension is maintained by Ozon\u2019s use of subtle often soft-focus flashbacks to the boys\u2019 ordeals and the race to find a victim whose abuse is more recent and can be used to bring Preynat to trial. \u201cWhen I researched this subject, what really shocked me was that everyone knew [about Preynat] and nobody did anything,\u201d Ozon says. \u201cFor 30 years, Preynat was a priest in the region and he looked after hundreds of children. Of them, 70 have come forward but he had contact with around 300 children a year for 30 years\u2026 some are now dead, some killed themselves and others don\u2019t want to speak out. For some, the facts are covered by the statute of limitations so they feel there\u2019s no point speaking. \u201cPreynat was honest and that was part of the drama. He never denied it. He said he had a problem with kids; he sent letters to the parents in the 1990s in which he admitted it. Barbarin knew about it. Still nothing happened.\u201d Ozon\u2019s own epiphany when talking to Preynat\u2019s victims has given him a profound empathy that comes through in the film and when he talks. \u201cI realised I had run away as a child without any understanding that the priest had a sexual desire. It\u2019s only suddenly, today, I realise that. At the time, I just thought, \u2018Why is he breathing like that? It\u2019s bizarre.\u2019 \u201cSo I asked the victims why they didn\u2019t run and each one told me they felt paralysed. I wanted to show this in the film, how each time the child is like a lamb who goes to the wolf because they trust the adult and they don\u2019t know there is danger. \u201cA child has no weapon against this. Psychologists say when this happens to a child their brain switches off and they don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happened. It\u2019s only when they become an adult it comes back and they realise what has happened. That is the horror. I think what all this shows is that a molested child is a ticking time bomb waiting to go off. And when it does, it touches the whole family.\u201d When filming started, Ozon says he worked in secret with a false working title and outside France to avoid alerting anyone to the real subject. He says he did not meet Barbarin, Preynat and Maire and has no wish to. The film recounts events entirely from the point of the victims and the others are secondary characters whose words we\u2019d already heard from their statements and depositions. What I showed are the victims in their private lives with their families, friends, parents \u2013 all the things people had not spoken about. This is what interested me, to show how this abuse destroyed the victim\u2019s whole family. How it woke up so many things, the guilt felt by the parents, the jealousy of siblings, the anger, the hatred.\u201d When the film was ready, Ozon organised screenings around the country, inviting clergy to attend. \u201cWe went to towns to show the film and invited priests, cardinals, nuns \u2013 anyone from the diocese who wanted to come. At the beginning, I think the church was afraid of the film, then they realised it was quite objective and showed the facts,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat helped was that Alexandre is very Catholic and they realised it was not a film against Catholicism but against the functioning of the church as an institution. The problem was the institution. Ozon insists his film is not an attack on Catholics but on the \u201cchurch as an institution\u201d. As the eldest of four children growing up in a practising Catholic family in Paris, he attended catechism and mass and says he is pleased to have had a Catholic education. Openly gay, he says he lost his faith as an adolescent because of what he saw as the church\u2019s \u201chypocrisy towards issues like sexuality\u201d. Having succeeded in getting By the Grace of God released, he says it is for the audiences to run with the cause in support of victims and for the church to adopt a more transparent and reactive approach to stop abuse by priests. At the end of the film, one of Alexandre\u2019s children asks him if he still believes in God. \u201cThe question should have been, \u2018Do you believe in the church?\u2019 Faith and the institution are not the same thing,\u201d Ozon says. He has been accused of \u201cmanipulating\u201d emotions in the film, but the response in France, even from Catholics, has been largely positive, Ozon says. Vincent Neymon, spokesman for the Bishops\u2019 Conference of France, told France 2 television it was \u201canother stone in the building that is the fight against paedophilia\u201d. Le Monde declared Ozon had succeeded in making a film that was both a \u201csensitive telling of a collective drama and a political film\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not a political film but of course there is a political aspect. I knew the film would make people talk about these things but not as much as it has,\u201d Ozon says. \u201cIf the film gives people the courage to speak out about what has happened, that is wonderful. The victims were absolutely stunned when they saw it\u2026 it shook them up. It\u2019s complicated when you see your own stories told. But they liked it and thanks to the film their association received more money and other victims came forward so it\u2019s a kind of recognition for them.\u201d He adds: \u201cPeople often ask: \u2018Do you think cinema can change the world?\u2019 and everyone always replies, \u2018No\u2019. But here, you know I like to think maybe we did change things a little bit. And this was a surprise. I didn\u2019t imagine it would have the positive effect that it\u2019s had.\u201d \u2022 By the Grace of God is released in UK cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema on 25 October",

The Dolby expert explained that ageing affects the intelligibility of dialogue and makes us more sensitive to sound.</p> <p>Phil Clapp, chief executive of the Cinema Association, the trade body that represents most British cinema operators, said that \u201cthe increasing sophistication of cinema sound\u201d was at the heart of the matter, as it meant the \u201cdynamic range\u201d of the built-in systems had grown.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough this has had no effect on the average sound levels, it has required cinemas to work with equipment manufacturers to ensure that the standard settings on systems keep maximum sound levels within acceptable parameters. These are typically recalibrated on a weekly basis.\u201d</p> <p>Regulatory controls ensure that British cinemas abide by the provisions of the Noise at Work regulations 2005, said Clapp. These are formulated to govern noise for any employee over a working day and so are also considered safe for most cinemagoers.</p> <p>Average sound levels of 85 decibels, coupled with limits on the maximum permitted sound levels, \u201care well below those likely to pose any health risk to customers,\u201d he said.</p>",

Distortion is when a sound system was not appropriate for the size of room it is installed in and at peaks causes distortion, which is objectionable to a listener.\u201d And it turns out that Grant may be right: it does also have something to do with age. The Dolby expert explained that ageing affects the intelligibility of dialogue and makes us more sensitive to sound. Phil Clapp, chief executive of the Cinema Association, the trade body that represents most British cinema operators, said that \u201cthe increasing sophistication of cinema sound\u201d was at the heart of the matter, as it meant the \u201cdynamic range\u201d of the built-in systems had grown. \u201cAlthough this has had no effect on the average sound levels, it has required cinemas to work with equipment manufacturers to ensure that the standard settings on systems keep maximum sound levels within acceptable parameters. These are typically recalibrated on a weekly basis.\u201d Regulatory controls ensure that British cinemas abide by the provisions of the Noise at Work regulations 2005, said Clapp. These are formulated to govern noise for any employee over a working day and so are also considered safe for most cinemagoers. Average sound levels of 85 decibels, coupled with limits on the maximum permitted sound levels, \u201care well below those likely to pose any health risk to customers,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>In most of the photographs of Charlotte Perriand, whether as a precocious pioneer in the 1920s or as a contented old woman in the 1990s, she is smiling. In one of the most famous you can\u2019t tell, as she turns her naked back to the camera in order to salute with upraised arms a snowy mountain landscape, but you can guess that she is. It is certainly an exultant image. The famous creators with whom she worked \u2013 Le Corbusier, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Isamu Noguchi \u2013 are more often shown solemn and serious, in keeping with their image as men of destiny.</p> <p>There are many things that can be said about Perriand (1903-99) \u2013 that she was the principal author of some of the 20th century\u2019s most memorable pieces of furniture, that she could be as inventive with traditional materials such as bamboo as she was with tubular steel, that she could turn her unique hand and eye to furniture, to photographs, to impassioned political photomontages, to a 30,000-bed ski resort. Among the most important is that she believed in \u201cthe joy of creating and living\u201d, as she put it, \u201cin this century of ours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have to keep your eyes as open as fans,\u201d she told her daughter, Pernette Perriand-Barsac. \u201cNothing is off the table,\u201d she also said, \u201cthere is no single answer.\u201d And so, although she made her name in her 20s as an exponent of the machine age aesthetic, she aligned herself with no single style. She based a carpet on an untutored drawing by a sailor she met on a voyage to Japan. If she saw a remarkable piece of wood, a magnificent slice of jacaranda in Brazil, for example, she would design a table to suit it. Her photographs bring out the beauty of driftwood, fish bones and scrap metal, of pieces of ice lifted against the sky.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0163436fd87e51f5c9d6d77249540164f57794de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0163436fd87e51f5c9d6d77249540164f57794de/0_0_3000_2248/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Le refuge Tonneau, 1938 by Charlotte Perriand and  Pierre Jeanneret.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"749\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Le refuge Tonneau, 1938 by Charlotte Perriand and <br> Pierre Jeanneret.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fondation Louis Vuitton / Marc Domage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc581c14eb140307644a8e4d4f0655c0b160c219\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc581c14eb140307644a8e4d4f0655c0b160c219/0_0_3000_2248/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Le refuge Tonneau, 1938 by Charlotte Perriand and Pierre Jeanneret.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"749\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside Perriand and Pierre Jeanneret\u2019s mountain refuge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fondation Louis Vuitton / Marc Domage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Charlotte Perriand has now been honoured by a <a href=\"https://www.fondationlouisvuitton.fr/en/exhibitions/exhibition/charlotte-perriand.html\" title=\"\">mighty exhibition</a> at the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris, which takes over, across four floors, its big, rambling Frank Gehry building.

The first was when Turkey opened its borders to foreign jihadists entering Syria, which ultimately enabled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/turkey-iraqi-kurds-kobani-isis-fighters-us-air-drops-arms\" title=\"\">Isis to build a caliphate</a> the size of Britain in 2014.</p> <p>Both the time and manner of the intervention risk unravelling the situation in Syria beyond the buffer zone that Turkey intends to establish in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/09/what-is-situation-north-eastern-syria-turkey-kurds\" title=\"\">the north-east</a>. It will take the pressure off extremist forces and disturb a delicate equilibrium and the relative quiet that have existed in the country for about two years.</p> <p>The move comes at a critical time in the fight against Isis, merely seven months after the collapse of the caliphate and while stabilisation and recovery are still in their early stages. In recent months, the US has stepped up efforts to improve local forces\u2019 capabilities in detecting and removing sleeper cells linked to Isis and, under these circumstances, the group seemed to have been struggling to mount a large-scale insurgency.</p> <p>President Donald <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/07/us-to-let-turkish-forces-move-into-syria-abandoning-kurdish-allies\" title=\"\">Trump\u2019s decision</a> \u2013 allowing Ankara to invade areas previously protected by the US and controlled by a Kurdish-dominated coalition known as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) \u2013 took almost everyone involved in the Syrian conflict by surprise; the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reported that a commander of the Kurdish force that spearheaded the fight against Isis stormed out of a meeting with the Americans after declaring: \u201cYou sold us!\u201d</p> <p>The Kurdish-dominated local forces still needed to learn how to deal with an underground insurgency that Isis and its previous incarnations so perfected in the years after the US invasion of Iraq. The counter-insurgency efforts proved different from and, at times, more challenging than the street-to-street fighting that the SDF conducted over the past five years.</p> <p>The military intervention in northern Syria disrupts this process and distracts militia in charge of securing the former Isis areas that make up one-third of the country. Despite flaws, the Kurdish-led local forces chased down Isis from town to town and village to village. This operation involved a complex effort of collecting information and intelligence. These forces learned a great deal about how Isis operates and established counter-measures and a communication mechanism for reaching out to local tribes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"771391dadb46960eabd37fb43df3bbc480f15f1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/771391dadb46960eabd37fb43df3bbc480f15f1c/0_176_5158_3096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US president Donald Trump and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Brussels in July 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US president Donald Trump and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Brussels in July 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pablo Mart\u00ednez Monsiv\u00e1is/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The change of hands in the north alone will probably leave gaps for Isis to exploit. A similar scenario took place in Iraq, after government forces with militias beholden to Iran <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/16/iraq-kurdish-forces-army-us-military\" title=\"\">seized Kirkuk</a> from the Kurdish peshmerga this time two years ago. The patterns after that were indisputable: Isis found an opportunity to stage a prolonged insurgency in that area, which expanded to adjacent areas. The attack on Kirkuk was one of many factors that enabled Isis to recover relatively faster in Iraq than in Syria. Kirkuk provided an opening and Isis seized it.</p> <p>The same is likely to happen in north-eastern Syria, no matter how capable the Turkish-backed forces prove. The mere disruption of an established security architecture opens cracks for an extremist group that watches diligently for chances to regroup and attack. Once such attacks become steady, they spread to other areas. Making this scenario even more likely is the nature of Trump\u2019s decision to allow Turkey to proceed, made impulsively, without deliberation and consultation with his team, much less with US allies on the ground.</p> <p>Also, Ankara does not seem to have an endgame in mind. From a Turkish perspective, the destruction of a nascent Kurdish statelet to the south of its borders, established by a group that it views as an extension of the PKK, the separatist insurgents that it battled for four decades, has always been a top national security priority. The invasion is informed by this national priority, regardless of the costs. But beyond that calculation, Turkey has no exit strategy. In fact, the absence of an endgame by <em>both</em> the US and Turkey increases the risks for a security vacuum, the re-emergence of extremists and renewed chaos.</p> <p>Another factor to consider is that Turkey also received a clearance from Russia before intervention, framed by Russia as part of the agreement between Ankara, Moscow and Tehran about the Syrian conflict. According to a well-placed Syrian source, the intervention in the Kurdish areas was part of a Russian-Turkish understanding about the fate of Idlib in the north-west, the last stronghold of the rebels fighting the regime of Bashar al-Assad.</p> <p>Idlib is dominated by the group formerly known as Jabhat al-Nusra and various stakeholders in the Syrian conflict have struggled to agree on how to deal with the challenge of having jihadists in charge of a significant swath of the country.

      "bodyText": "Future historians might remember Turkey\u2019s incursion into northern Syria, launched last week, as the second time that President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan provided Islamic State with a lifeline, intentionally or not. The first was when Turkey opened its borders to foreign jihadists entering Syria, which ultimately enabled Isis to build a caliphate the size of Britain in 2014. Both the time and manner of the intervention risk unravelling the situation in Syria beyond the buffer zone that Turkey intends to establish in the north-east. It will take the pressure off extremist forces and disturb a delicate equilibrium and the relative quiet that have existed in the country for about two years. The move comes at a critical time in the fight against Isis, merely seven months after the collapse of the caliphate and while stabilisation and recovery are still in their early stages. In recent months, the US has stepped up efforts to improve local forces\u2019 capabilities in detecting and removing sleeper cells linked to Isis and, under these circumstances, the group seemed to have been struggling to mount a large-scale insurgency. President Donald Trump\u2019s decision \u2013 allowing Ankara to invade areas previously protected by the US and controlled by a Kurdish-dominated coalition known as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) \u2013 took almost everyone involved in the Syrian conflict by surprise; the Wall Street Journal reported that a commander of the Kurdish force that spearheaded the fight against Isis stormed out of a meeting with the Americans after declaring: \u201cYou sold us!\u201d The Kurdish-dominated local forces still needed to learn how to deal with an underground insurgency that Isis and its previous incarnations so perfected in the years after the US invasion of Iraq. The counter-insurgency efforts proved different from and, at times, more challenging than the street-to-street fighting that the SDF conducted over the past five years. The military intervention in northern Syria disrupts this process and distracts militia in charge of securing the former Isis areas that make up one-third of the country. Despite flaws, the Kurdish-led local forces chased down Isis from town to town and village to village. This operation involved a complex effort of collecting information and intelligence. These forces learned a great deal about how Isis operates and established counter-measures and a communication mechanism for reaching out to local tribes. The change of hands in the north alone will probably leave gaps for Isis to exploit. A similar scenario took place in Iraq, after government forces with militias beholden to Iran seized Kirkuk from the Kurdish peshmerga this time two years ago. The patterns after that were indisputable: Isis found an opportunity to stage a prolonged insurgency in that area, which expanded to adjacent areas. The attack on Kirkuk was one of many factors that enabled Isis to recover relatively faster in Iraq than in Syria. Kirkuk provided an opening and Isis seized it. The same is likely to happen in north-eastern Syria, no matter how capable the Turkish-backed forces prove. The mere disruption of an established security architecture opens cracks for an extremist group that watches diligently for chances to regroup and attack. Once such attacks become steady, they spread to other areas. Making this scenario even more likely is the nature of Trump\u2019s decision to allow Turkey to proceed, made impulsively, without deliberation and consultation with his team, much less with US allies on the ground. Also, Ankara does not seem to have an endgame in mind. From a Turkish perspective, the destruction of a nascent Kurdish statelet to the south of its borders, established by a group that it views as an extension of the PKK, the separatist insurgents that it battled for four decades, has always been a top national security priority. The invasion is informed by this national priority, regardless of the costs. But beyond that calculation, Turkey has no exit strategy. In fact, the absence of an endgame by both the US and Turkey increases the risks for a security vacuum, the re-emergence of extremists and renewed chaos. Another factor to consider is that Turkey also received a clearance from Russia before intervention, framed by Russia as part of the agreement between Ankara, Moscow and Tehran about the Syrian conflict. According to a well-placed Syrian source, the intervention in the Kurdish areas was part of a Russian-Turkish understanding about the fate of Idlib in the north-west, the last stronghold of the rebels fighting the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Idlib is dominated by the group formerly known as Jabhat al-Nusra and various stakeholders in the Syrian conflict have struggled to agree on how to deal with the challenge of having jihadists in charge of a significant swath of the country. The source claims that Turkey also reassured the Americans that the intervention would be followed by serious steps to deal with the dilemma in Idlib, by enabling a Russia-led incursion and that any expected mass displacement from Idlib will move to the Turkish zones inside Syria, not to Turkey itself. Until now, Turkey and the US have asserted control over two separate zones in eastern and northern Syria. In both zones, extremists pose a serious lingering challenge if the situation spins out of control. The Turkish intervention could provide this trigger in both zones concurrently. Unless the US and western powers move to prevent such a disruptive and unpredictable scenario, the Turkish move will probably unleash the spectre of both the reheating of Syrian civil war and a resurgence in the threat of jihadist extremists, long thought to have been put under control.

      "bodyText": "USA\u2019s unenviable run of World Cup loses continues - making it ten in a row across the last three tournaments. It\u2019s a statistic that in no way does justice to the effort shown by the American Eagles today, in a bruising match in which they came within one late score of snatching a hard-fought result. Tonga for their part at times appeared the engineers of their own demise - brilliant at times, mind-bogglingly wasteful at others. Tries dropped over the line, far too many balls turned over from open play, but when it mattered most they came up big - pulling away around the hour mark with two quick tries before adding a late coup de grace after the final gong. A game that would have delighted fans and frustrated coaches in equal measure - plenty to hang the hat on for US Rugby, they\u2019ll examine the tape and come away with plenty of \u201clearnings\u201d, while for Tonga it\u2019s five points at the last, to wrap a tournament in which they came so close, so often, but perhaps failed to put it all together enough to reward their evident ability. And if you missed any of that - here\u2019s the full-time report. A game equal parts chaotic and exhilarating to close Pool C: There is of course so much more World Cup rugby action to come today. Luke McLaughlin is the man on the joystick for Wales v Uruguay. No doubt there will be a huge boilover there and any Australian fans reading this will delight at a shock top spot and subsequent quarter-final match up with France. All of which is just a prelude to what\u2019s fast become one of the most anticipated clashes of the entire pool stage: host nation Japan - chasing their first ever knockout stages berth - against Scotland for the last spot in the finals. Crunch stuff. Fittingly, it\u2019s the Tongan skipper Siale Piutau who is awarded the player of the match honours, in his last ever outing in the red of Tonga. The hard-working flanker Sione Kalamafoni has also announced he\u2019ll hang up his boots, so lovely that Tonga could go out winners for two of their veteran stars. So that\u2019s how it finishes. Tonga secure the bonus point with that late, after-the-gong balls-and-all play, and finish the tournament with six points. The way they played against France - falling just two points short - you do wonder if they\u2019ll look back on this tournament in weeks and months to come and think: what if.. For the US - so much credit despite the loss. They put on a whopping 147 tackles - and when you think each of those was on a rampaging Tongan, you get a sense for how much energy, how much determination is needed to back up for four lots of 80+ minutes of World Cup rugby. There will be plenty of long magnesium baths this evening - these boys will be battered and bruised. What a finish. What drama. And what an end to the Japan World Cup from Pool C. They came back to within just a converted try, the Eagles. They had almost no rights to be that close, given the dominance across the game that Tonga enjoyed - with possession, with territory - but they showed such heart, just four days after their previous match. 80 min: Unbelievable finish! The Tonga coaches box exploded when the players elected to play the scrum, and not take the guaranteed three points. But from the resulting play Tonga roll in the grubber, and it\u2019s the fullback Veainu who races through to score under the posts! Remarkable finish. And if we wanted more drama, we go upstairs for a TMO to check it anyway. And the whole team lines up to support the skipper, Piutau, who is given the honours of taking the last conversion. It\u2019s an ugly old strike, but it wobbles over! 79 min: Penalty advantage, Tonga! There\u2019s an infringement at the scrum. And forget the easy three points - Tonga are setting for a scrum! Is this high risk? Can the US snatch it and go coast-to-coast?! IMAGINE. 78 min: We\u2019ve got a scrum about 15m out from the US line though, with a Tongan feed. Can they control the ball and run down the clock? 77 min: HELLO. The blindside flanker gets the ball against the post, and there\u2019s the try! McGinty smashes through the conversion in quick time - and suddenly, we\u2019ve got around 120 seconds for the miraculous to happen! Can they lock this up, the Eagles?! 76 min: They\u2019re just 3m out, USA - they drive centrally but a big hit from Vaipulu momentarily halts momentum. Hilderbrand tries the big leg drive - do they get contact with the post? They\u2019re ever so close, but Nigel Owens says no! He talks to his TMO - just to check: is this the lifeline for the USA? 75 min: They run a deep line, USA, but it just cedes metres. The Eagles swing right before Brache puts it on the toe - but the Tongan back three avert the danger! Credit to America, they\u2019re not going down without a fight. They have an offensive lineout, about 10m out. Is this it? 74 min: Tonga look to move it both sides - but the defence does very well once more, and this time it\u2019s a man in red bundled into touch. USA lineout - just inside their half. 72 min: The clock is starting to become a little bit of a factor for the States - they need something, and soon if they\u2019re to snatch this one. Campbell looks to scamper down the touchline, but he\u2019s put into touch by some excellent covering defence. 70 min: It\u2019s a high pass, and the runner has little chance - ball down! Credit the defensive tackle, but the timing was all wrong for the US. But now it\u2019s Civetta with a huge bump and run! Ach, it\u2019s happened again - he\u2019s done so well, he\u2019s been isolated from his teammates, and Tonga earn the turnover. 68 min: USA look to launch another attack, but they lose it and it\u2019s another scrum. Advice from the sideline overturns the call, and the feed goes to USA. 22m out. What can they fashion here? 66 min: We set for a scrum, but a break in play as one of the Tongan players looks to receive treatment. Pakalani, I believe it is, getting attention for a bloody noggin. We reset, as the Tongan front row collapses. 64 min: So a really critical next 5-10 minutes for the Americans. They have to score next, and they can\u2019t afford to concede if they\u2019re to end this horror run of World Cup loses. They\u2019re o the attack now, and it\u2019s McGinty who finds a half-break, before Mullen makes a bust. But there\u2019s an accidental offside - what a shame, that was a good passage for the US. 62 min: It\u2019s another break - and would you believe it, it\u2019s the Wagnerian prop Siegfried Fisi\u2019ihoi who makes the bust! Vaipulu backs up, and as they spread right, it\u2019s the skipper Piutau - in his last ever game in a Tongan shirt - who scores a deserving try. His teammates rush to celebrate with him. Faiva slots the conversion, two points added. 60 min: The US regather - can they rally again? They\u2019ve been so solid defensively, but they had to get through a weight of work. Will that start to have an effect on tiring bodies? 58 min: Wow. What a counter-attack! The fullback Veainu sees that the US have nobody at home, so he kicks over the top. The chase is on and the fullback just does enough to prevent the one covering Eagle from scooping it up - and Tonga regather, and the centre Hingano is backing up on the inside. A lightning raid! No mistake from the kick - and Tonga move to a unconverted try lead. 55 min: Good quick ball from USA, they go wide but to little effect. You have to think they\u2019ve lost a bit extra in that regard with Scully off the field. His replacement Te\u2019o looks to get things moving and the replacement Mullen gets some more good metres. They build 15 phases - the first time either side has hit that mark - and they move within the 22m. This is good stuff from the USA. But he\u2019s lost it! Civetta hits the line at pace, and it spills loose! 54 min: It\u2019s a smart kick over the line from McGinty - the bounce is wicked and deceives the fullback, but in the scramble that follows it ends up a Tongan lineout feed. 52 min: Tonga kick to touch - we\u2019ve seen more of this from them this half, given they have the wind behind them now. It\u2019s a USA lineout feed bang on halfway. They claim, and look to get something going - and it\u2019s the scrum half de Haas who finds a gap from broken play! And from just to the right, Takulua bangs it over, and we\u2019re back within a penalty - or a drop goal (*looks excitedly*) - the margin. 48 min: If they don\u2019t get up here Tonga you\u2019ll imagine there will be 23 men in red (and half a dozen coaching staff) having nightmares about this game for years to come. They earn a penalty though, and Takulua has a chance to add three vital points. 46 min: Another big opportunity though as Tonga set down a scrum just inside the US 22m zone. The skipper Piutau runs with ball in-hand but he\u2019s well brought down. This is rugged defence from the USA, they\u2019ve been especially good in that regard today. Tonga build the phases though - they\u2019re about 3m out! Oh my. It\u2019s the skipper Piatau - and has he gone the wrong way?? It\u2019s three on one, he\u2019s got men outside him, and the skipper tries the miracle ball inside for Lolohea, but surely the play was simple catch and pass! Remarkable. 44 min: A great dart from Vaipulu from the back of the scrum - some great metres, and Tonga swing right as Veainu joins the line. He has a winger outside him - all he has to do is hit his chest and they\u2019re in for a try here - but the ball sails into touch! Almost a carbon copy of a loose pass we saw from the US in the first half; is the wind wreaking havoc out there? Big chance missed. 42 min: That\u2019s remarkable - they trade a series of kicks, possibly eight back and forth - but it\u2019s de Haas who has the last laugh as he drills an inch-perfect kick just a few metres out from the Tongan line. They win their lineout, the men in red, but USA will get the lineout feed in decent possession as Tonga look to clear their lines. The wind could play a factor this second half - if it aids the US kicking game it could really get away from Tonga. Second half! And we\u2019re back - the USA with ball in-hand, but again there are early turnovers, with defences once again on top. McGinty fires a monster kick - they\u2019ve definitely done well with their kicking game so far, the United States. So - your thoughts on that opening half?! Have USA been good value for their lead, or have Tonga shot themselves in the foot a little? They\u2019ve enjoyed 62% possession, 69% of the territory, and carried 363m to USA\u2019s 151m, the Ikale Tahi. But it\u2019s been far too stop-start, there\u2019s been too many easy balls to ground, and at times the play has been forced just a little too much for coach Kefu\u2019s liking, you\u2019d imagine. 40 + 2 min: They probe and push, Tonga, but the defence stands up, and finally a pass is forced, and adjudged to fly forward. Nigel Owens says enough - and a frenetic first forty comes to a close! 40 min: A penalty just on the gong for Tonga, and they kick to touch to set up one last opportunity from the lineout. They\u2019re about 25m out - still plenty to do from here, and the maul is slowed but a good US counter-push. 38 min: The crowd come to life once more - it\u2019s really all-action stuff, you can\u2019t imagine either coach is loving this though - plenty of turnovers, plenty of forced plays and dicey last passes! 36 min: USA set a scrum 5m out - they win it but the metres are hard to get out. Eventually they opt for the box kick - solid metres from de Haas. Another turnover, and the US run a deep line. But in turn it\u2019s pinched by Takulua! A mad few moments - neither side can retain possession - there\u2019s some very broken play out there. 34 min: Oh no! It was the prop they called Siegfried - and he\u2019s dropped it over the line!! De Haas with a desperate hand on the ball in defence, and it\u2019s enough to distract him. How\u2019d he bomb that - he did all the hard work, did Fisi\u2019ihoi! 32 min: Good metres from Hingano, despite early heavy contact from his opposite number Campbell. The fullback Veainu joins the action - this is better from Tonga - they build the phases and reach the 22m. Veainu almost puts Vaipulu in a hole - but it\u2019s ball loose! USA race down field with a quick counter attack, and they almost isolate Kapeli at the back (what\u2019s he doing there?!) but the back rower escapes. Lively stuff! 30 min: Ach, they\u2019ve butchered that! Piutau with a solid run, but he got isolated, and they\u2019ve turned it over, Tonga. A chance to go level, or even ahead goes begging - USA clear their lines. 28 min: Ach - he\u2019s been exception early on, but it\u2019s Al-Jiboori who puts it down, directly from the kickoff! A big opportunity for Tonga to settle a little. They were well on top over the first 20, but it\u2019s run away from them just lately. Now, a scrum to see what they can set up about 15m out from the US line. 26 min: USA look to set the maul, but the Tongan pack drives them back. They build the phases, try some one-out runs, but they see the numbers wide, and a terrific long pass out finds the winger in acres of space on the flank! And in as many minutes, the replacement \u201cMagic Mike\u201d Te\u2019o has a brace. The conversion is struck well by McGinty, but the wind takes it just right. No extras. 24 min: I\u2019ll confess, I hadn\u2019t even noticed Scully leave the play - hopefully that\u2019s not for the night, I\u2019ll try to find out what\u2019s happened there. But we\u2019ve got another penalty to the US, and they pass up the three points and look to capitalise on this mini-momentum. 22 min: And like that - they\u2019re back level! A terrific move, it\u2019s Cam Dolan who flicks a nice offload, and Mike Te\u2019o - barely on the field to replace the skipper Scully - and he\u2019s in under the sticks. Great response, and the conversion is made as well. 20 min: A reward for their early dominance, but they concede a high tackle the States, and now they\u2019ll need to work hard to defend their line once again. Tonga lose the opportunity - there\u2019s a turnover, and it\u2019s Al-Jiboori again breaking the line! Hasn\u2019t he been brilliant early on. 17 min: Gosh, and I swear I didn\u2019t pre-prep that, but scarely as I\u2019ve typed it Lolohea hits a hole, and dashes away for the line - but Scully catches him around 5m out! It was terrific work from the prop Fisi\u2019ihoi - the big man they call Siegfried, for the simple reason that it\u2019s his name - to start the whole move; and it\u2019s the front rower who finishes it, burrowing over close to the posts. And no mistake from the conversion, two points added. 15 min: McGinty looks to break the line, but he\u2019s well wrapped up, before Lolohea claims an excellent high ball, with the US skipper Scully racing through. He\u2019s looked lively early on, the Tongan winger. I won\u2019t be surprised if he finishes today with a try to his name. 13 min: It\u2019s almost another lineout steal from Tonga, but there\u2019s a double knock on and we set for a scrum, USA\u2019s feed. The Pasifika nation are definitely enjoying the lion\u2019s share of the early possession though. But the US defence has been equal to the task, so far. 11 min: They pinch the lineout, Tonga, and again look to break forward. It\u2019s been a lively start from both sides, but it\u2019s all a little helter-skelter early on. 9 min: The Eagles win their lineout and again it\u2019s Al-Jiboori who makes good metres, but there\u2019s a ball to ground, and Tonga look to counter attack. The crowd come to life, some great metres here, but USA scramble, and pull the play down around the 22m. And then they turn it over - and a late hit on the kicker earns the Eagles a penalty. 8 min: USA boot downfield to clear their lines, but it comes back with interest. Now they look for the crossfield kick, and it\u2019s almost inch perfect - just creeping into touch as the runners screamed through. Fine play. 6 min: We wait for a scrum reset as Nigel Owens gives both front rows a talking to. Tonga win their feed and spread wide - some good metres down the left touchline, and now they\u2019re pulled down just metres out! A great run from Vaipulu, but Takalua loses it in the tackle - and they escape, the Eagles. 4 min: It\u2019s the USA looking to run it around the half-way line, but they float a loose pass wide. Did the wind pick that up, it really wobbled out of the hand - and a brief break as Ngauamo receives some treatment. 2 min: So decent defence here from the USA, as Tonga build 10 phases. A lot of one-out running - plenty of heavy contact, and hard metres as you\u2019d expect. But a terrific intervention from the new man Al-Jiboori - strong work from the back rower, and he\u2019s earned the penalty! And it\u2019s Tonga, from right-to-left running into a slight breeze, that get us underway! The hugely respected Nigel Owens is our man with the whistle - and USA receive well, but are quickly under pressure, as Tonga turn it over just outside the 22m. What can they manage early on? A minute\u2019s silence for the recent victims of Typhoon Habigis makes for a sombre and slightly surreal atmosphere, but the striking sounds of the Star Spangled Banner quickly shift the mood. Say what you like, it really is a toe tapper of an anthem. And for their part the Tongan team belt out Ko e fasi \u2018o e tu\u2019i \u2018o e \u2018Otu Tonga. And yes, I did look that up. And then it\u2019s the Sipi Tau. The Eagles meet it as a line, Tonga present it in three rows - and it\u2019s greeted with rapturous applause. Our players are coming out onto this immaculate pitch at the Hanazono Rugby Stadium, in Higashiosaka. It\u2019s a decent looking crowd in - plenty of stars and stripes in attendance, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll hear plenty from the Tongan fans as soon as their team have ball in hand. So, to team news: Ruben de Haas retains his spot ahead of Shaun Davies, skipper Blaine Scully is set for a record-equalling 11th World Cup appearance, while Will Hooley, Nick Civetta and Malon Al-Jiboori are the three new starters for the Eagles. USA: (15-1) 15. Will Hooley, 14. Blaine Scully (c), 13. Bryce Campbell, 12. Paul Lasike, 11. Marcel Brache, 10. AJ McGinty, 9. Ruben de Haas, 8. Cam Dolan, 7. Malon Al-Jiboori, 6. Tony Lamborn, 5. Nick Civetta, 4. Greg Peterson, 3. Titi Lamositele, 2. Joe Taufete\u2019e, 1. Eric Fry. Bench: 16. James Hilterbrand, 17. Olive Kilifi, 18. Paul Mullen, 19. Ben Landry, 20. Hanco Germishuys, 21. Ben Pinkleman, 22. Nate Auspurger, 23. Mike Te\u2019o Three changes for Tonga as well, two new wingers and a new starting prop in Siua Halanukonuka, in what will be skipper Siale Piutau\u2019s last game for the national team, at his third World Cup. Tonga: (15-1) 15. Telusa Veainu, 14. Atieli Pakalani, 13. Malietoa Hingano, 12. Siale Piutau (c), 11. Viliami Lolohea, 10. James Faiva, 9. Sonotane Takalua, 8. Maama Vaipulu, 7. Zane Kapeli, 6. Sione Kalamafoni, 5. Halaleva Fifita, 4. Sam Lousi, 3. Siua Halanukonuka, 2. Paula Ngauamo, 1. Siegfried Fisi\u2019ihoi And Tonga\u2019s coach Toutai Kefu is pretty direct in his assessment of his side\u2019s tournament - \u201cWe\u2019ve had some good moments, we just need more of them, and for longer\u201d: Use of possession has been identified by Eagles coach Gary Gold as the key area for the US today - it\u2019s a fair point, they\u2019ve not struggled to get the ball across the tournament, it\u2019s what they\u2019ve done with it that at times has no doubt frustrated home fans. Here\u2019s the former Springboks assistant coach, speaking pre-game: But! To USA v Tonga. Five competition points on offer, and if that\u2019s not enough of an incentive - there\u2019s a very unwanted record looming for the Eagles: a loss today will make ten straight defeats at World Cup level. They\u2019ve won three games in eight tournament appearances - Tonga have won seven in seven; ominously though, you\u2019d have to go back to 2003 for the last time Tonga left the Rugby World Cup without a win. Winds of up to 216km/hr, a storm front covering over 1,400km, some areas of Japan receiving up to 40% of their annual rainfall in just 24-48 hours, and just for good measure - a significant earthquake as well. It\u2019s hard to appreciate the magnitude of it all, sheltered half a world away: In terms of the Rugby World Cup, there was no Namibia v Canada earlier, but this match and the subsequent Wales v Uruguay clash have been cleared to go ahead. The match that\u2019s been subjected to the most speculation has however been the crunch Pool A decider between Japan and Scotland - this has officially been cleared to be played - Rob Kitson has the latest on that: Morning/afternoon/evening all! I trust this finds you safe, dry and warm - wherever you\u2019re following our coverage. I appreciate that sport is necessarily an escape/leisure activity, but it\u2019s hard not to let the woes of the world interfere when you see such pictures of devastation as those wreaked by Typhoon Hagibis - our hearts and thoughts go to those communities affected. In the context of loss of life, deadly floods and landslides, its hard not to be distracted by Typhoon Hagibis and it\u2019s affect on the Japanese people. And while much has been written about whether or not games elsewhere will be cancelled, threats of legal actions, and complaints that the entire competitive integrity of the World Cup has been called into question - for fans of USA or Tongan rugby there\u2019s only one game that matters today. By both their standards it\u2019s been perhaps a disappointing tournament for USA and Tonga - two aspiring nations with so many gifted individual talents. But we know the ability is there - just ask the French who survived a narrow two-point victory over the proud Pasifika nation in their last hit out. Qualification is out of the question, so it\u2019s all about pride today - who can give the faithful who have braved tumultuous conditions to support them in Higashiosaka something to cheer about? We\u2019ll have all the action, here, shortly.",

China is \u2013 and one that may prove increasingly attractive to many non-aligned countries because of its amazing accomplishment of lifting so many people out of poverty so quickly.</p> <p>The west \u2013 and its giant tech corporations \u2013 urgently needs to come up with a smarter way of dealing with China than the current approach of kowtowing to it on account of its market potential. It\u2019s time they remembered that kowtow is derived from a Chinese word that means \u201cthe act of deep respect shown by prostration, that is, kneeling and bowing so low as to have one\u2019s head touching the ground\u201d. In other words, a servile cringe.</p> <p>\u2022 John Naughton writes the Networker column for the Observer New Review</p>",

Since the Chinese state asserts its right to all data gathered by digital companies, this is seen as giving its firms a colossal advantage over western firms, which are hampered by our tiresome obsessions with privacy, human rights and the rule of law. This perception is what makes tech companies apparently unable to see China as what its behaviour reveals it to be: a growing and existential threat to freedom. That\u2019s why the developments of the last few weeks have been so revealing. They show how perceptions of commercial power and fear of losing out can intimidate people and corporations. What\u2019s happened is that the old world of the cold war has morphed into a new bipolar world in which the alternative to liberal democracy is not the Russian federation but China. Russia is annoying and dangerous (and it has nukes), but it\u2019s not an alternative system. China is \u2013 and one that may prove increasingly attractive to many non-aligned countries because of its amazing accomplishment of lifting so many people out of poverty so quickly. The west \u2013 and its giant tech corporations \u2013 urgently needs to come up with a smarter way of dealing with China than the current approach of kowtowing to it on account of its market potential. It\u2019s time they remembered that kowtow is derived from a Chinese word that means \u201cthe act of deep respect shown by prostration, that is, kneeling and bowing so low as to have one\u2019s head touching the ground\u201d. In other words, a servile cringe. \u2022 John Naughton writes the Networker column for the Observer New Review",

As MPs gather in the House of Commons for an emergency weekend sitting to discuss Brexit, more than a million people are expected to mass outside parliament for a People\u2019s Vote march, while Extinction Rebellion climate campaigners launch the finale to a near fortnight of continuous protest. Scotland Yard confirmed it was expecting a huge event and was liaising with the National Police Coordination Centre (NPoCC), which is responsible for the deployment of officers from across the UK to assist during large-scale events. Deputy assistant commissioner Laurence Taylor, who is in charge of policing Saturday\u2019s march, said: \u201cWe have considered what the event may entail and we will continue to monitor the resource level that we have.

Talks over which group controls Parliament Square on the actual day indicate that Extinction Rebellion is likely to surrender its prime spot to accommodate the anti-Brexit protest, which could form the biggest public rally Britain has ever witnessed. To date, the two largest public protests have been the Iraq war rally in 2003 and the last People\u2019s Vote march held six months ago, which both drew more than a million people. Baldwin added: \u201cIt does look like it\u2019s going to be a very, very large event, without any doubt one of the largest protests this country has ever seen.\u201d For next weekend\u2019s People\u2019s Vote march, its third in the capital, 172 coaches have so far been booked from across the country, compared to 130 last time.

Children sleep on broken beds and the heating is so expensive families huddle in the library downstairs to keep warm in the winter. The lifts break down regularly, forcing mothers with health conditions to walk up to seven flights of stairs.</p> <p>The <em>Observer</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/26/how-firms-make-millions-nightly-paid-temporary-flats-homeless\" title=\"\">reported the concerns of the families last year</a> but conditions appear to have deteriorated further. Last week the water supply was cut off for two days, with families, regardless of size, given only a 10-litre bottle of water to last them all day. A mother of two young children, who asked not to be named, said the water usually only stops for a few hours. \u201cThis is the first time it has been days,\u201d she says. \u201cIt takes five litres to flush the toilet so it goes straightaway. I can\u2019t afford to buy water any more. I feel helpless.\u201d</p> <p>She has found needles in the back stairwell, where residents say drug users have been shooting up and smoking crack. \u201cThey get in because security guards are too busy on video calls or watching movies,\u201d she says, gesturing around the filthy, sick-stained landing. \u201cEvery other night I see two or three people sleeping here in the winter. They are weeing and pooing. It is disgusting.\u201d</p> <p>Sofa Akther, 43, finds cockroaches every time she goes to her kitchen. Her 11-year-old son translates for her: \u201cI see them crawling around. It makes me feel disgusted.\u201d She opens the door to the musty-smelling shower room. \u201cThere\u2019s mould all over the ceiling \u2013 my dad complains but they don\u2019t come,\u201d explains her son.</p> <p>Anisa Sheikh, 31, says she cannot afford to buy enough prepaid electricity cards from Theori to heat her flat. \u201cIn the winter I spend \u00a320 a day. Most people go to the library in the afternoon to keep warm,\u201d she says.</p> <p>There was a fire in one of the flats in December. The Ghani family, who were placed in the block two years ago by Newham council, were among the last to get out as they are on the top floor. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear the alarm. I had to carry my children because my wife was out shopping,\u201d says Mohammed Ghani. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see anything because there was so much smoke.\u201d</p> <p>Email exchanges seen by the <em>Observer</em> show Theori director Tony Theori failed to show up, phone in or send a representative to a meeting with 15 concerned families after the fire. This led the councillor who organised the meeting to warn \u201ctrust is withering rapidly\u201d because of his firm\u2019s \u201cshocking response\u201d to complaints by families. Tony Theori \u2013 who lives in a \u00a31.8m five-bedroom detached house in the Hadley Wood conservation area in Barnet, north London \u2013 says he missed the meeting due to heavy snowfall.</p> <p>Further south, towards the towers of Canary Wharf, lies Custom House, a rundown estate used as temporary accommodation. Outsourcing giant Mears, which picked up \u00a35m from councils in the last financial year, <a href=\"https://www.mearsgroup.co.uk/housing-management\" title=\"\">manages about 280 properties on the estate</a>, which has long been earmarked for development. Residents say they have raised more than 250 cases of disrepair and mismanagement with the company since 2015.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5333c2bed78f3c6aa459eabfd5c235bc2cb322a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5333c2bed78f3c6aa459eabfd5c235bc2cb322a9/126_0_3780_2268/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Male in the hallway where her ceiling collapsed in Custom House, Newham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Male in the hallway where her ceiling collapsed in Custom House, Newham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Wall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sarah Male points towards the ceiling in the hallway of her Mears-managed flat, where she was placed in 2011 by Newham council. \u201cWhen I opened the door, the ceiling started falling in. It hit me on my head and I fell down,\u201d she says. \u201cAn ambulance took me to Newham University hospital and I was there two days.\u201d</p> <p>Male, 60, and her family had started complaining about water dripping from the ceiling lights in February 2018, but Mears managed to fix the leak only after she was hospitalised in September 2018. Now she is worried it might happen again as water is seeping through the kitchen ceiling. \u201cI\u2019m scared when I do the washing-up,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Mears Group said it was sorry to hear about Male\u2019s concerns: \u201cThe repair in question was caused by a leak from a council property above, which has now been resolved.\u201d</p> <p>Theori said it had agreed timescales with local authorities to address any issues that might arise. \u201cWe pride ourselves on the service we provide and work with all partners and public bodies to meet all requirements and standards and have an excellent track record in providing a quality service,\u201d it claimed.</p> <p>Finefair said it was aware of a previous outbreak of bedbugs in the hostels and had taken measures, including changing beds and frequent treatments. It said there were some single people staying in the hostels and a system was in place to deal with any antisocial behaviour. It added that not all suitability reviews were successful. \u201cFinefair has been actively working with the council to look at how we can improve the quality of the accommodation and the satisfaction level of residents,\u201d its statement said.</p> <p>The mayor of Hackney, Philip Glanville, said firms such as Finefair were able to operate only because of the government\u2019s failure to address the root causes of the homelessness crisis. \u201cGiven the scale of the problem, we have no choice but to work with private providers like Finefair, and we monitor them closely to ensure that they meet the standards we expect and that any concerns from residents are properly dealt with,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Newham council said it was increasingly reliant on private firms such as Theori as the number of homeless applicants far exceeded available properties. \u201cWe are aware of issues with Donald Hunter House and are working closely with Theori to ensure they are resolved as quickly as possible,\u201d said a spokesperson.</p> <p>The authority said it was looking at \u201calternative management solutions\u201d for Mears residents on the Custom House estate, adding \u201cwe will follow up \u2026 this leak and ensure urgent action is taken\u201d.</p> <p>Blue Chip Trading Ltd did not respond to a request for comment. The <em>Observer</em> was unable to contact the owner of Donald Hunter House, Stratos Holdings Ltd.</p> <p>The situation is not likely to get any easier for councils in the near future \u2013 or for the people who find themselves in need of temporary housing. Councillor Billington says spiralling rents and a shortage of social homes mean the new hostel in her borough will soon fill up with homeless mothers and children. \u201cIf Hackney had better homes to put them in we would,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is absolutely heartbreaking to find ourselves in this position.\u201d</p> <h2>A mother\u2019s story</h2> <p>Jamie-Leigh McCarthy paces the narrow room she shares with her teething baby daughter in Terminus House, which was turned into more than 200 flats last year. \u201cFrom my front door to my window is 14 steps. The width is eight steps,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything is in one room. My kitchen. My bed. Her cot. Her highchair and toybox.

It isn\u2019t safe.\u201d</p> <p>Terminus House is owned by Caridon, which received \u00a31.2m from councils including Broxbourne and Croydon in the last financial year. It has led the way in converting former offices into what critics have described as \u201cshoe-box\u201d and \u201crabbit hutch\u201d homes since planning rules were relaxed in 2013 by the coalition government.</p> <p>There has been a rash of conversions in Harlow, with the council identifying 13 blocks that have been converted into 1,000 flats. Almost 40% are owned and managed by Caridon. A report by the Children\u2019s Commissioner has warned that many of the flats in converted offices do not meet space standards and that \u2013 like B&amp;Bs \u2013 families find themselves living next to vulnerable adults.</p> <p>Harlow\u2019s Conservative MP, Robert Halfon, who is helping McCarthy, wants office conversions such as Terminus House shut down. \u201cThese landlords are profiting out of human misery. We were supposed to have got rid of this kind of thing in Victorian times,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He adds that removing planning constraints on office conversions had been an unmitigated disaster. \u201cIt has created modern ghettos for the most vulnerable people and led to social cleansing by London councils, who see it as an easy way to ship problems out of their boroughs. The law needs to change urgently.\u201d</p> <p>Caridon is run by millionaire property developer, Mario Carrozzo, who reportedly drives a \u00a3164,000 Ferrari and lives in a \u00a36m mansion in Surrey, with a tennis court, indoor swimming pool and home cinema.</p> <p>McCarthy, who has been in Terminus House for 15 months, claims the building is not properly managed by Caridon. \u201cSomeone got beaten up in the lift about six months ago. They left all the blood in there for three days,\u201d she says. \u201cThey can\u2019t control this place. It is getting worse.\u201d</p> <p>Caridon said: \u201cTerminus House has helped house many people who would have otherwise struggled to secure accommodation, or worse, faced street homelessness.\u201d It said the building had 24-hour on-site security along with CCTV and the firm took a \u201czero-tolerance approach to criminal and antisocial activity\u201d. It added: \u201cAll of our apartments meet the relevant and applicable space standards for permitted developments.\u201d</p>",

But as school pick-up time approaches, a succession of mothers with buggies struggle down the slippery steps of the former Victorian-era hospital and return soon afterwards with older children in tow, babbling about homework and playground squabbles. As a fine autumnal rain begins to fall, these mothers tell their distressing stories. Some have been in the eight-storey hostel for more than three years \u2013 others one or two years. Whole families cook, eat and sleep in cramped, sometimes bedbug-infested single rooms. Clothes have to be washed by hand as they lack their own washing machines. Children do their homework on the floor because broken furniture is not replaced. The corridors are frightening no-go zones because they claim they are sharing with people straight out of prison and others with alcohol or drug addiction problems. They are just some of the 66,910 households stuck in predominantly privately managed temporary accommodation in England. It is a figure that has grown by 64% since 2011 \u2013 as more and more low-income families have been driven out of their homes by rent rises and benefit cuts, amid a chronic shortage of social housing. There are 1,779 households in mainly private sector temporary homes in Wales and 4,250 in Scotland. The Observer has established that their plight is driving a \u00a3215m industry in England\u2019s top 50 homeless blackspots, where 156 of the largest private management companies are receiving on average more than \u00a310,000 of public money per booking. Councils have done what they can to hold down ballooning costs by agreeing guideline rates and building up their own property portfolios. But the sheer number of households coming to them for help, which has widened under new homelessness reforms, mean private providers can keep increasing their charges. The Observer has used council payment records obtained under freedom of information laws and previously unpublished data collected by London boroughs to lift the lid on an industry that has been accused by the public accounts committee of providing often poor-quality, overpriced accommodation for some of society\u2019s most vulnerable families. Many of these providers, which typically offer investors a guaranteed one- or five-year return on their properties, have grown from often humble backstreet beginnings to become multimillion-pound companies with swanky headquarters and flashy websites as the nation\u2019s housing crisis has deepened. The Metro and St Peter\u2019s Way hostels are run by the country\u2019s highest-earning private provider, Finefair Ltd. The east London-based firm collected more than \u00a311.5m from councils in the last financial year \u2013 more than any other provider \u2013 even though its accommodation led to an above average number of suitability reviews following serious complaints from families. It was also the second largest provider of B&amp;B rooms to homeless households, taking 387 bookings in the capital last year. Finefair, which operates across London as well as in the Midlands, promises investors it can turn their properties into \u201chigh-yielding\u201d multi-occupied homes or hostels with increased \u201cpotential for profit\u201d. The company\u2019s CEO, Kamran Naseem, lives in a \u00a32m gated, five-bedroom detached house in Woodford Green, a prosperous London suburb, near Epping Forest. The mothers in Metro and St Peter\u2019s Way hostels have a somewhat different life. Hassan says Finefair has failed to treat the bedbugs in the single room she shares with her nine-year-old son and one-year-old daughter for more than a year. \u201cMy son had a rash all over his body because he was bitten by so many of them \u2026 he had to see a doctor,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are in the old, ripped mattress they gave us, but they say they cannot replace it.\u201d Nicolette Dialundama, 39, has just picked up her nine-year-old daughter from school.

Hackney councillor Polly Billington, whose ward includes the hostels, says families routinely complain about overcrowding, pest infestations, broken furniture and lack of laundry facilities. \u201cThese companies are making money out of distress. They therefore have a moral responsibility to treat families in their accommodation with dignity and respect,\u201d she says. \u201cBut too often the standards fall short of what is acceptable.\u201d Four miles away, in the borough of Newham, about 80 homeless families are preparing for another night in what they claim is a squalid and dangerous tower block, Donald Hunter House. The former BT building is managed by Theori, one of the country\u2019s largest providers of temporary accommodation. Theori received \u00a36.9m from councils in the last financial year, including taking 384 bookings for studio flats and 173 bookings for B&amp;Bs. Many of the flats in Donald Hunter House are infested with cockroaches and some of the shower rooms are covered in dark blooms of mould. Children sleep on broken beds and the heating is so expensive families huddle in the library downstairs to keep warm in the winter.

I feel helpless.\u201d She has found needles in the back stairwell, where residents say drug users have been shooting up and smoking crack. \u201cThey get in because security guards are too busy on video calls or watching movies,\u201d she says, gesturing around the filthy, sick-stained landing. \u201cEvery other night I see two or three people sleeping here in the winter. They are weeing and pooing. It is disgusting.\u201d Sofa Akther, 43, finds cockroaches every time she goes to her kitchen. Her 11-year-old son translates for her: \u201cI see them crawling around. It makes me feel disgusted.\u201d She opens the door to the musty-smelling shower room. \u201cThere\u2019s mould all over the ceiling \u2013 my dad complains but they don\u2019t come,\u201d explains her son. Anisa Sheikh, 31, says she cannot afford to buy enough prepaid electricity cards from Theori to heat her flat. \u201cIn the winter I spend \u00a320 a day. Most people go to the library in the afternoon to keep warm,\u201d she says. There was a fire in one of the flats in December. The Ghani family, who were placed in the block two years ago by Newham council, were among the last to get out as they are on the top floor. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear the alarm. I had to carry my children because my wife was out shopping,\u201d says Mohammed Ghani. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see anything because there was so much smoke.\u201d Email exchanges seen by the Observer show Theori director Tony Theori failed to show up, phone in or send a representative to a meeting with 15 concerned families after the fire. This led the councillor who organised the meeting to warn \u201ctrust is withering rapidly\u201d because of his firm\u2019s \u201cshocking response\u201d to complaints by families. Tony Theori \u2013 who lives in a \u00a31.8m five-bedroom detached house in the Hadley Wood conservation area in Barnet, north London \u2013 says he missed the meeting due to heavy snowfall. Further south, towards the towers of Canary Wharf, lies Custom House, a rundown estate used as temporary accommodation. Outsourcing giant Mears, which picked up \u00a35m from councils in the last financial year, manages about 280 properties on the estate, which has long been earmarked for development. Residents say they have raised more than 250 cases of disrepair and mismanagement with the company since 2015. Sarah Male points towards the ceiling in the hallway of her Mears-managed flat, where she was placed in 2011 by Newham council. \u201cWhen I opened the door, the ceiling started falling in. It hit me on my head and I fell down,\u201d she says. \u201cAn ambulance took me to Newham University hospital and I was there two days.\u201d Male, 60, and her family had started complaining about water dripping from the ceiling lights in February 2018, but Mears managed to fix the leak only after she was hospitalised in September 2018. Now she is worried it might happen again as water is seeping through the kitchen ceiling. \u201cI\u2019m scared when I do the washing-up,\u201d she says. Mears Group said it was sorry to hear about Male\u2019s concerns: \u201cThe repair in question was caused by a leak from a council property above, which has now been resolved.\u201d Theori said it had agreed timescales with local authorities to address any issues that might arise. \u201cWe pride ourselves on the service we provide and work with all partners and public bodies to meet all requirements and standards and have an excellent track record in providing a quality service,\u201d it claimed. Finefair said it was aware of a previous outbreak of bedbugs in the hostels and had taken measures, including changing beds and frequent treatments. It said there were some single people staying in the hostels and a system was in place to deal with any antisocial behaviour. It added that not all suitability reviews were successful. \u201cFinefair has been actively working with the council to look at how we can improve the quality of the accommodation and the satisfaction level of residents,\u201d its statement said. The mayor of Hackney, Philip Glanville, said firms such as Finefair were able to operate only because of the government\u2019s failure to address the root causes of the homelessness crisis. \u201cGiven the scale of the problem, we have no choice but to work with private providers like Finefair, and we monitor them closely to ensure that they meet the standards we expect and that any concerns from residents are properly dealt with,\u201d he said. Newham council said it was increasingly reliant on private firms such as Theori as the number of homeless applicants far exceeded available properties. \u201cWe are aware of issues with Donald Hunter House and are working closely with Theori to ensure they are resolved as quickly as possible,\u201d said a spokesperson. The authority said it was looking at \u201calternative management solutions\u201d for Mears residents on the Custom House estate, adding \u201cwe will follow up \u2026 this leak and ensure urgent action is taken\u201d. Blue Chip Trading Ltd did not respond to a request for comment. The Observer was unable to contact the owner of Donald Hunter House, Stratos Holdings Ltd. The situation is not likely to get any easier for councils in the near future \u2013 or for the people who find themselves in need of temporary housing. Councillor Billington says spiralling rents and a shortage of social homes mean the new hostel in her borough will soon fill up with homeless mothers and children. \u201cIf Hackney had better homes to put them in we would,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is absolutely heartbreaking to find ourselves in this position.\u201d A mother\u2019s story Jamie-Leigh McCarthy paces the narrow room she shares with her teething baby daughter in Terminus House, which was turned into more than 200 flats last year. \u201cFrom my front door to my window is 14 steps. The width is eight steps,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything is in one room. My kitchen. My bed. Her cot. Her highchair and toybox. There\u2019s no room for a wardrobe and I have to eat my dinner off my bed.\u201d McCarthy, 26, who was placed in the 14-storey block by Epping Forest council, says it is a scary place to live. \u201cThere are people in the corridor taking drugs and I\u2019ve had to call the police because I\u2019ve had people off their face banging on my door and trying to come in,\u201d she says. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any kids living in this building. It isn\u2019t safe.\u201d Terminus House is owned by Caridon, which received \u00a31.2m from councils including Broxbourne and Croydon in the last financial year. It has led the way in converting former offices into what critics have described as \u201cshoe-box\u201d and \u201crabbit hutch\u201d homes since planning rules were relaxed in 2013 by the coalition government. There has been a rash of conversions in Harlow, with the council identifying 13 blocks that have been converted into 1,000 flats. Almost 40% are owned and managed by Caridon. A report by the Children\u2019s Commissioner has warned that many of the flats in converted offices do not meet space standards and that \u2013 like B&amp;Bs \u2013 families find themselves living next to vulnerable adults. Harlow\u2019s Conservative MP, Robert Halfon, who is helping McCarthy, wants office conversions such as Terminus House shut down. \u201cThese landlords are profiting out of human misery. We were supposed to have got rid of this kind of thing in Victorian times,\u201d he says. He adds that removing planning constraints on office conversions had been an unmitigated disaster. \u201cIt has created modern ghettos for the most vulnerable people and led to social cleansing by London councils, who see it as an easy way to ship problems out of their boroughs. The law needs to change urgently.\u201d Caridon is run by millionaire property developer, Mario Carrozzo, who reportedly drives a \u00a3164,000 Ferrari and lives in a \u00a36m mansion in Surrey, with a tennis court, indoor swimming pool and home cinema. McCarthy, who has been in Terminus House for 15 months, claims the building is not properly managed by Caridon. \u201cSomeone got beaten up in the lift about six months ago. They left all the blood in there for three days,\u201d she says. \u201cThey can\u2019t control this place. It is getting worse.\u201d Caridon said: \u201cTerminus House has helped house many people who would have otherwise struggled to secure accommodation, or worse, faced street homelessness.\u201d It said the building had 24-hour on-site security along with CCTV and the firm took a \u201czero-tolerance approach to criminal and antisocial activity\u201d. It added: \u201cAll of our apartments meet the relevant and applicable space standards for permitted developments.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>I had begun last week with a determination to avoid Brexit. Or at least to stick to some kind of personal Brexit diet: either a spartan, fact-based Brexit-Atkins plan, or maybe a four-days-on, three-days-off regime. It was not the first time in the past couple of years that I\u2019d made that resolution. Like many of us, on all sides, I felt jaded by the same questions and the same answers, sated with vitriol, numbed by non-negotiation. I had heard of people who had gone whole weeks without discussing with their kids or their colleagues the removal of the backstop and its implications for the Good Friday agreement, but, in honesty, I didn\u2019t believe they existed.</p> <p>In this spirit I set out on Monday morning to make a point of listening to music rather than news. I used my lunch hour to read a novel rather than Brexit commentary. I deleted the Twitter app from my phone. I wouldn\u2019t, I resolved, give the noise and nonsense any more attention, perhaps until the EU summit \u2013 perhaps, with any luck, until Halloween.</p> <p>On Tuesday morning, inevitably, I was suckered back in by an overheard mention of Dominic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/08/immature-no-10-briefings-trigger-another-day-of-brexit-trouble\" title=\"\">Cummings\u2019s</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/08/immature-no-10-briefings-trigger-another-day-of-brexit-trouble\" title=\"\"> unguarded strategy briefing to the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/08/immature-no-10-briefings-trigger-another-day-of-brexit-trouble\" title=\"\">Spectator</a></em>. I could not resist Googling. And then, of course, there was the thuggish racism of the Leave.EU poster about world wars and krauts, and I was back composing outraged tweet-lines in my head, admonishing myself for taking the bait, a lost cause.</p> <p>By Friday, like the abstemious Lenten nobleman in the film <em>Chocolat</em>, who ends up gorging on prohibited Easter eggs in the chocolate shop window, I found myself back again at something like peak Brexit. I happened to be down near Parliament Square, mooching among bedraggled tourists and aimless pockets of Extinction rebels and drenched Ode to Joy pipers and St George flag wavers. I stepped into a cafe out of the rain and disappeared down another Brexit rabbit hole for an hour or two. It began with a clip of <em>Question Time</em>: an exchange between Theo Paphitis off <em>Dragons\u2019 Den</em><em> </em>and an audience member voicing the angry beliefs that she both \u201cknew what she had voted for\u201d and that \u201cnobody knows what\u2019s going to happen\u201d.</p> <p>Then I was watching, one after another, the 11 Brexit \u201cexplainer\u201d videos tweeted out by Andrea Leadsom, each one a mesmerising catalogue of the freedoms we are collectively dying in a ditch to discard.

That land was divided along many lines, he suggested, but one of the primary ones was between those \u201cwho are junkies for this stuff and those who just want to get it done\u201d.</p> <p>It was a nice distinction but I wasn\u2019t quite convinced.

A small part of most of us perhaps wonders how we might replace it when it is over; a much larger part fears it never will be.</p> <p>As any student of addiction knows, hits must get stronger for the craving to be satisfied. In Brexit terms, that means ever more layers of manufactured complexity and false hope in pursuit of a deal that will satisfy nobody. One thing that Boris Johnson understands is that the old tropes are not enough to engage attention. \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d will no longer cut it.

In his novella, McEwan was able to quote a speech of Johnson\u2019s verbatim, an unhinged fantasy about an unfettered Britain that was home to the electric aeroplane; satire was already priced in.

Meanwhile it was noted that the pause in conversation between the British and Irish leaders allowed \u201ca period of reflection\u201d as to next steps. The nation, as ever, was left to ponder what either of those phrases might mean. That Johnson had developed a plan so subtle in its tracery that it would not bear the light of day? That a meditative safe space was essential to creating a plan for beyond the end of the month?</p> <p>As ever there were one or two new coinages designed to frame the drama. \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d was rolled out as the phrase to describe the emergency session of parliament on October 19 at which a deal or an absence of a deal will be addressed. The Tory MP Nigel Evans repeated this phrase with the dedication of a promoter drawing attention to the latest pay-per-view cage fight.</p> <p>Leaving the EU was always going to be an interminable process, not a singular event, but that has never stopped its cheerleaders persisting with fake promises of a brisk final act. Once again, then, we are about to enter a \u201cnow or never\u201d week, and we will be invited to go through the motions of believing in the possibility of climax \u2013 until we are not. There have been many other crisis weeks. Each promised to be the beginning of the end. None proved to be close to the end of the beginning.</p> <p>In his lazy bestseller <em>The Churchill Factor</em><em>,</em> Johnson dwelt on the few dramatic moments in which his hero changed the course of history, attempting to associate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/09/digested-read-the-churchill-factor-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">his own flaky character with Churchill\u2019s indomitable will</a>. In thinking about the coming week, the prime minister is deluded enough to have in mind the image of Churchill facing down a rebellious party minded to negotiate with Hitler, and his \u201cdarkest hour\u201d speech, which concluded: \u201cIf this long island story of ours is to end at last, let it end only when each one of us lies choking in his own blood upon the ground.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The country is so energised by the prospect of liberation from the EU that productivity is falling at the fastest pace for five years</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The intent of Johnson\u2019s \u201csurrender act\u201d and \u201cdo or die\u201d is a shaming echo of that rhetoric. His emergency Saturday parliament is another effort to shackle the crisis of his own making to previous notable occasions when parliament had weekend sittings: at the outbreak of the war in 1939, for the Suez Crisis in 1956 and on the invasion of the Falklands in 1982. None of those previous threats to the nation was a homegrown invention. Unlike Churchill (or Eden or Thatcher), Johnson, would \u2013 in continuing to countenance a no-deal Brexit \u2013 have his country suffer an economic and social blitz simply to demonstrate that he has a semblance of spirit.</p> <p>If this is his personal plan it feels more than ever like a by-product of a wider philosophy. In his blogs, Cummings dwells on some of his own heroes, those cross-disciplinary \u201csynthesisers\u201d, with their \u201ccool Thucydidean courage to face reality\u201d. His most recent long missive argues that \u201cwhat is happening now is a once in a 50- or 100-year crisis and such crises also are the waves that can be ridden to change things normally unchangeable\u201d. His aim appears to be to surf the current \u201ccreative chaos\u201d in the belief it might beach government in a technocratic future in which policy and strategy are dictated by an elite \u201cRed Team\u201d in his own image. <a href=\"https://dominiccummings.com/tag/cameron/\" title=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to create a wave and it\u2019s much easier to ride one</a>,\u201d he notes.</p> <p>In this realm of deliberate turbulence, in the name of future efficiencies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/01/get-ready-for-brexit-government-launches-information-blitz\" title=\"\">billions of pounds continue to be squandered</a> to prepare for a no-deal exit that the courts and parliament have agreed cannot happen. Meanwhile, the government reneges on its promise to settled EU nationals by threatening deportations, and pledges to reward expatriate citizens with six months of healthcare when a lifetime of provision was once guaranteed. And the country is so energised by the prospect of liberation from the European Union that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/08/uk-productivity-brexit-boris-johnson-labour\" title=\"\">productivity of its workforce is falling at the fastest pace for five years</a>, and remains drastically below the EU average.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/15/divided-pessimistic-angry-survey-reveals-bleak-mood-of-pre-brexit-uk\" title=\"\">Surveys of the nation\u2019s psychological health</a> catch the effects of those figures. The latest revealed that around four in 10 people \u2013 22 million \u2013 reported feeling powerless (43%), angry (39%) or anxious (38%) because of Brexit in the last year. An LSE study which examined data from 35,000 people found significant increased levels of \u201cmental distress\u201d post-referendum that showed \u201cno significant difference\u201d between Remainers and Leavers.</p> <p>Where will it end? The news, as I write this, offers the promise that the EU27 have given \u201cthe green light for Brexit talks to move to the \u2018tunnel\u2019 phase\u201d. There is debate about whether that means negotiations are actually \u201centering the tunnel\u201d, or whether intensified discussions are to prepare for \u201cpossibly entering the tunnel\u201d. And so we approach another week, employing more millions of collective hours and days of attention and emotion discovering if we are yet in the dark, and being fed our daily bread of catchphrase and half-truth, waiting for what comes next.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a0b6de3b38d4794d5d3d0fa7f9275f1ffdcab56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a0b6de3b38d4794d5d3d0fa7f9275f1ffdcab56/0_265_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May, then UK prime minister, with Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May, then UK prime minister, with Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, in 2017, when it seemed a deal could be achieved.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>17 January 2017</h2> <p>In her first substantial speech on Brexit, Prime Minister Theresa May sets out her \u201cred lines\u201d and a 12-point \u201cplan for Britain\u201d, ruling out membership of the customs union.

      "bodyText": "I had begun last week with a determination to avoid Brexit. Or at least to stick to some kind of personal Brexit diet: either a spartan, fact-based Brexit-Atkins plan, or maybe a four-days-on, three-days-off regime. It was not the first time in the past couple of years that I\u2019d made that resolution. Like many of us, on all sides, I felt jaded by the same questions and the same answers, sated with vitriol, numbed by non-negotiation. I had heard of people who had gone whole weeks without discussing with their kids or their colleagues the removal of the backstop and its implications for the Good Friday agreement, but, in honesty, I didn\u2019t believe they existed. In this spirit I set out on Monday morning to make a point of listening to music rather than news. I used my lunch hour to read a novel rather than Brexit commentary. I deleted the Twitter app from my phone. I wouldn\u2019t, I resolved, give the noise and nonsense any more attention, perhaps until the EU summit \u2013 perhaps, with any luck, until Halloween. On Tuesday morning, inevitably, I was suckered back in by an overheard mention of Dominic Cummings\u2019s unguarded strategy briefing to the Spectator. I could not resist Googling. And then, of course, there was the thuggish racism of the Leave.EU poster about world wars and krauts, and I was back composing outraged tweet-lines in my head, admonishing myself for taking the bait, a lost cause. By Friday, like the abstemious Lenten nobleman in the film Chocolat, who ends up gorging on prohibited Easter eggs in the chocolate shop window, I found myself back again at something like peak Brexit. I happened to be down near Parliament Square, mooching among bedraggled tourists and aimless pockets of Extinction rebels and drenched Ode to Joy pipers and St George flag wavers. I stepped into a cafe out of the rain and disappeared down another Brexit rabbit hole for an hour or two. It began with a clip of Question Time: an exchange between Theo Paphitis off Dragons\u2019 Den and an audience member voicing the angry beliefs that she both \u201cknew what she had voted for\u201d and that \u201cnobody knows what\u2019s going to happen\u201d. Then I was watching, one after another, the 11 Brexit \u201cexplainer\u201d videos tweeted out by Andrea Leadsom, each one a mesmerising catalogue of the freedoms we are collectively dying in a ditch to discard. As I was watching, a text happened to come through on my phone, announcing that \u201cpassport validity rules will change after Brexit\u201d and I needed to look up the new restrictions. From there, it was only a few Google steps into the back catalogue of Cummings\u2019s blog archive \u2013 not the recent, pithy, government one-liners but the impacted, self-mythologising screeds about how the referendum was won and how \u201cthe systemic and consistent dysfunction of establishment decision-making systems over a long period, with very poor mechanisms for good, accurate feedback from reality, created the space for a guerrilla operation to exploit\u201d. Or: how I used technology and behavioural science to create division by manipulating fears about immigration. The trigger for that latest restless effort to make some sense of things, to get a grip, was Thursday\u2019s news that, after three-and-a-half years, the government had identified \u201ca pathway\u201d that might yet lead to \u201ca deal\u201d. Forget about the fact that the unknown concessions would, by any account, make the nation significantly worse off and likely dissolve the union, this shift in \u201cmood music\u201d was apparently a cause for hope. The pound surged, though it was hard not to latch on to the twin qualifiers in the announcement: \u201cThey agreed that they could see a pathway to a possible deal.\u201d The politicians hadn\u2019t set off on the grail quest. But they had identified the place it might start from if they did. Talking earlier this week about his brief Brexit fable, The Cockroach, in which the prime minister\u2019s body is taken over by a giant insect, Ian McEwan noted that, as a nation, \u201cwe have moved into a mystical realm\u201d when it comes to Brexit, somewhere murky and surreal. That land was divided along many lines, he suggested, but one of the primary ones was between those \u201cwho are junkies for this stuff and those who just want to get it done\u201d.

A small part of most of us perhaps wonders how we might replace it when it is over; a much larger part fears it never will be. As any student of addiction knows, hits must get stronger for the craving to be satisfied.

In his novella, McEwan was able to quote a speech of Johnson\u2019s verbatim, an unhinged fantasy about an unfettered Britain that was home to the electric aeroplane; satire was already priced in.

Meanwhile, the government reneges on its promise to settled EU nationals by threatening deportations, and pledges to reward expatriate citizens with six months of healthcare when a lifetime of provision was once guaranteed.

All eight indicative votes to discover where parliament\u2019s will over Brexit lies are defeated, along with a third attempt by May to pass her withdrawal bill. \u201cParliament finally has its say\u201d, the Guardian reports: \u201cNo. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.\u201d The prime minister offers to resign if MPs will back her deal. 24 May 2019 Having moved to find a cross-party consensus over Brexit with Labour, Theresa May is forced into an emotional resignation as prime minister by her own party. \u201cIt all ends in tears\u201d the Times reports. 28 August 2019 In one of the first acts of his leadership, Boris Johnson announces that he will prorogue parliament for five weeks in an apparent effort to keep the possibility of a no-deal Brexit alive. The decision is subsequently overturned as unconstitutional in the courts.",

By contrast, married men are <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/marriage-and-mens-health\">healthier</a> than men who are not.

Women are also traditionally better at maintaining social networks than men. When a man divorces, he may see his physical and emotional health slide. He loses the person concerned with keeping him healthy and much of his social network.

Even among more open-minded millennial men, the female spouse still <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/26/success/millennial-women-income/index.html\">ends up doing</a> the majority of caregiving and housekeeping.</p> <p>More women, however, are foregoing marriage and motherhood. In doing so, they trade in their \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Second_Shift\">second shift</a>\u201d and instead begin taking care of themselves. To use Hirshman\u2019s language, they are rejecting a \u201cbad bargain\u201d. This new status quo frustrates men who feel entitled to female companionship, such as angry male \u201cincels\u201d.</p> <p>While trying to explain the danger of incels (\u201cinvoluntary celibates\u201d) to my mother, I was surprised to hear her say, \u201cWell, they\u2019re not entirely wrong.\u201d Realizing my horror, she went on to explain that women used to need a man to survive. That led to a lot of bad marriages and deterred divorces. She loves that, thanks to modern feminism, she gets to see women like me make decisions that are not predicated on needing a man to keep a roof over my head. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to settle,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Women have more economic power and freedom to set standards regarding the men they will be with, and what they will put up with from those men, than at any time in history. More women are deciding that being in a bad marriage, or trying to co-parent with an irresponsible man, <em>is </em>much worse than dying alone.</p> <p>Once dying alone is no longer scary to women, men lose power. So it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that some incels are outraged. It\u2019s no different than those who mourn the days when they didn\u2019t have to compete for jobs against women and racial minorities. It must be frustrating to lose power you once had but didn\u2019t necessarily deserve.</p> <p>Which is why I owe a big thank you to my mom. Despite being married for nearly 50 years, she\u2019s never pressured me to get married (even when she\u2019s been a fan of the man I\u2019m dating). But the main reason I owe her thanks is because she\u2019s never minded going to dinner by herself. Until I grew older I didn\u2019t realize such a small act was actually strangely politically subversive. Countless adults are terrified of simply going to the movies by themselves.

The doors open and more passengers press in before \u2013 inch by inch \u2013 the hydraulic doors groan shut, slowly shunting the new arrivals inside. \u201cAll the buses are coming like this,\u201d said Roberto L\u00f3pez, 66, on his way \u2013 fingers crossed \u2013 to buy biscuits in the city centre. Bus services throughout Cuba have been slashed in recent weeks as the island grapples with acute petrol shortages caused by US sanctions which target companies and oil tankers transporting Venezuelan petroleum to the island. Cuba\u2019s president, Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, has said the island is currently operating with 62% of the petrol it needs, and announced emergency measures to \u201cdisrupt the plans of imperialism\u201d. Across the island, production has been cut and stopgaps found, so that fuel can be prioritized for hospitals, schools and food distribution. Oxen have replaced tractors in sugarcane fields; some bakeries are using firewood to power their ovens. Transport inspectors have been deployed to ensure that anyone driving a vehicle which belongs to a ministry or state enterprise gives fellow citizens a lift. At the Alamar textile factory \u2013 and in offices and factories throughout the island \u2013 all machines and lights are switched off between 11am and 1pm.

The current US plan to starve the Cuban economy of oil \u2013 which the state department says is necessary to pressure Cuba to stop supporting Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s regime \u2013 is part of an onslaught on the communist-ruled island unleashed by the Trump administration this year.

The Cuban government insists the situation is \u201ctemporary\u201d and has said there will be no return to anything resembling the \u201cSpecial Period\u201d, the official term for the deep economic crisis Cuba went through after the fall of the Soviet Union, when the average adult lost more than 5kg and getting through the day without electricity was so common that Cubans talked not so much of \u201cpower cuts\u201d (apagones) but of \u201cpower ons\u201d (alumbrones).

      "body": "<p>\u201cAren\u2019t I supposed to be cross with you about something?\u201d says John Humphrys, busying himself with making coffee. \u201cWhat was it? I\u2019ve forgotten\u2026 Do you want a banana?\u201d</p> \n<p>I\u2019m OK for a banana, thanks. We\u2019re in Humphrys\u2019s homely kitchen in his house in west London. And yes, the long-serving co-presenter of Radio 4\u2019s <em>Today</em> programme has been cross with me before. About a year ago, as the <em>Observer\u2019s</em> radio reviewer, I\u2019d written <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jul/01/is-today-programme-losing-its-grip\" title=\"\">an article</a> about the <em>Today</em> programme that wasn\u2019t entirely complimentary, and Humphrys had fired off an angry email at me, making some points I agreed with, and several I didn\u2019t. I answered, and, after a bit of to-ing and fro-ing, we ended up on fairly good terms. So now, here we are. I\u2019m armed with umpteen readers\u2019 questions for him \u2013 many hostile, I must say \u2013 and Humphrys is all set to answer them.</p> \n<p>Now 76, wiry and fiery, dressed in cosy fleece, Humphrys <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/19/john-humphrys-last-today-programme-review-a-too-long-lap-of-honour\" title=\"\">finally retired</a> from <em>Today</em> a week or so ago, after more than three decades at the helm during which he became the show\u2019s best-known host. He\u2019s published his memoirs to coincide with that retirement, and <em>A Day Like Today</em> is a 400-page doorstopper of a book that describes Humphrys\u2019s early life growing up poor but proud in Splott, Wales, and moves through his career as a newspaper reporter, foreign correspondent and TV news presenter. It is very detailed on his years at <em>Today</em> (he joined in 1987, at the age of 43), which provide about two-thirds of the book. Though he doesn\u2019t reveal much about his private life, he is straightforward in his opinions about other people: he doesn\u2019t seem to like Eddie Mair or Jane Garvey very much, for instance.</p> \n<p>\u201cEddie Mair is a brilliant broadcaster,\u201d he says today, \u201cbut I dislike his style of broadcasting when applied to a hard news programme. And Jane Garvey is too opinionated for my taste. You shouldn\u2019t lace questions with your own views, and Jane tells the listener what she thinks about everything. But then it is <em>Woman\u2019s Hour</em>, not <em>Today</em>.\u201d</p> \n<p>This last point seems at the very least ironic, given that one reason Humphrys\u2019s detractors dislike him is that they believe they can tell his opinion of interviewees by the way he interviews them. Humphrys argues hard to me that they can\u2019t: though he\u2019s assumed to be a Brexiteer, he voted remain, and he cites a time when a very good friend of his came on to <em>Today</em>, and Humphrys gave him a roasting. (It was Patrick Holden, then director of the Soil Association.)</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"46e952aa-cfdb-4cc6-8606-77bbc5745bf2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5bPAJ9t-qh8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve known Patrick for 40 years,\u201d he says, \u201cand I believe in everything he\u2019s done and does, I believe organic farming is vital, but when I interviewed him, I put the opposite argument to him. I am a devil\u2019s advocate. That is what I do.\u201d</p> \n<p>John Humphrys, for many, came to epitomise both the good and bad about the <em>Today</em> programme. His tenacious interviewing style was admired when it was used to effect against politicians but, post-Brexit, as the country divided along non-party lines, many felt that his rottweiler questioning technique was used on the wrong people. And his interviews with non-politicians \u2013 fashion journalists, artists, authors, scientists \u2013 could seem naive, even inept. In his book, he admits that, though <em>Today</em>\u2019s researchers always prepared him briefs for interviews, he mostly didn\u2019t read them. Is this true?</p> \n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean I am notoriously\u2026 \u2018stupid\u2019 is the only word. Mostly you don\u2019t know what interviews you\u2019re going to be doing until you see them, and the sensible thing to do is to sit down and read the brief very carefully. I don\u2019t do that. It\u2019s a sort of brinksmanship, and also I don\u2019t want to already know the answers to my questions. Not with politicians, but if you\u2019re talking to real people about real things \u2013 somebody who\u2019s just swum the channel 19 times or something \u2013 then if you ask them a question that you genuinely don\u2019t know the answer to, you are genuinely surprised.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc161cf0d57f349c5f44b4a185f8a76b77e57c65\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc161cf0d57f349c5f44b4a185f8a76b77e57c65/0_605_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Humphrys talking to David Cameron on his last day presenting Today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Humphrys talking to David Cameron on his last day presenting Today.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff&nbsp;Overs/BBC/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He\u2019s a strange mix, John Humphrys. He gets upset if presenters voice opinions, but is quick to give his own. He rues the BBC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/21/john-humphrys-attacks-bbcs-liberal-bias-days-after-retiring-from-radio-4\" title=\"\">liberal bias</a>, but is a natural liberal himself. He is, I think, a highly emotional man, who decries emotion in reporting. He seeks precise answers but sometimes struggles to articulate accurately what he wants to say. And, though he often falls foul of feminists, he is pro-women.</p> \n<p>\u201cI detest the word feminism, because of course I\u2019m a feminist,\u201d he says. \u201cGod, why does one have to say it? Obviously, obviously\u2026 Racism is a profoundly moral issue, as is feminism. That\u2019s why I refused to wear one of those \u201cThis is what a feminist looks like\u201d T-shirts. No, it isn\u2019t. This is what a white man looks like, who happens to believe that women are equal to men. I mean, even saying it makes you sound like a dickhead.\u201d</p> \n<p>You seem to prefer being interviewed by women, I say.</p> \n<p>\u201cI do,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe I trust them more. I like talking to women.\u201d</p> \n<p>Are you more competitive with men?</p> \n<p>\u201cYes! Of course. It\u2019s instinctive, I think. It\u2019s not learned. Or it might be. I went to an all-boys school.\u201d</p> \n<p>Humphrys runs a charity, the <a href=\"http://www.kitchentablecharities.org/what.htm\" title=\"\">Kitchen Tables Charity Trust</a>, which helps feed money to small charities in the developing world, mostly those that work with children. We talk a bit about it, how it works, and about his feelings around the misuse of power and the lack of respect for \u201cordinary\u201d people. When he was a young journalist, he witnessed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/09/aberfan-50-years-owen-sheers-the-green-hollow-film-poem\" title=\"\">tragedy at Aberfan</a> \u2013 he thumps the table when he tells me about it \u2013 and saw terrible things, too, when he reported from South Africa.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou see children dying of starvation, and you know, you know it\u2019s because of men who want power,\u201d he says. \u201cMen who want power so much that they will do anything. And it is always the men. With our charity, we don\u2019t give any money to men, ever. Because in our experience, if you give the money to a woman, whether it\u2019s running a little business, or a school, or a charity, it\u2019s used for good reasons. You give it to the man, it\u2019s often pissed against the wall. I would always opt for women because I think they are more \u2013 this will get me in trouble with the right-thinking brigade \u2013 because I think women are more sensitive to the fear of abuse of childen. The ultimate measure of a society is first, how we deal with children, and second, how we deal with very old people who can\u2019t help themselves. That\u2019s how you judge the humanity of a society and humanity is what it is all about.\u201d</p> \n<p>Humphrys can\u2019t help himself. He\u2019s thumping the table again, already all riled up.

I wondered why she said it in such a posh way, but it\u2019s dorgis, she explained to me. Dachshund corgi, join it together, dorgis. Anyway, I asked her for an interview and I went into a big spiel and said, these are the reasons why you could, you know? And she listened to me very patiently and she said: \u201cNo\u2026 And what\u2019s more, Mr Humphrys, if one were ever to do such an interview, it would certainly not be with you.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"30b01aad230653bb4cd242f6fee456934dddf8d3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30b01aad230653bb4cd242f6fee456934dddf8d3/17_0_873_842/500.jpg\" alt=\"Jenni Murray\" width=\"500\" height=\"482\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Jenni Murray</strong><br><strong>Presenter of BBC Radio 4\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>What\u2019s the most important question that needs to be put to Boris Johnson, and what answer would you expect to get?</strong><br>That\u2019s a killer, isn\u2019t it?

But obviously we must, and I speak as somebody who voted to remain.</p> \n<p><strong>MS: Why do you think people think you voted for Brexit?</strong><br>I\u2019ve no idea! My reasons to vote to remain are many and varied, and largely to do with, you know, no more war in western Europe and being born in 1943, and all that kind of thing. But people who voted to leave were more\u2026 passionate is such a ghastly word\u2026 more motivated than those who voted remain, because they really did, I think, believe in sovereignty and freedom. Largely, those arguments did not resonate with me. What worries me is that there will be trouble if we don\u2019t leave, unless there is something pretty concrete in its place. Not riots in the street, but if people are told: \u201cYou voted, but now you can just fuck off and die,\u201d that\u2019s worrying.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1877de573c1c382617b71a61fd1fd1469ab0d2e9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1877de573c1c382617b71a61fd1fd1469ab0d2e9/0_0_4480_6713/667.jpg\" alt=\"John Humphrys photographed at his home in London\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Humphrys photographed at his home in London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Matthew Lenton <br><strong>Observer reader</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>What are your feelings about the effect your earning so much more than them had on your female colleagues, particularly Sarah Montague?</strong><br>Sarah was upset and she was right to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/08/sarah-montague-incandescent-with-rage-over-bbc-pay-gap-radio-4-today\" title=\"\">upset</a>. Absolutely right. I didn\u2019t know how much she was earning. I have never talked to any other presenter on the <em>Today</em> programme about how much we earn. I think Sarah\u2019s wonderful. But we never had a conversation about our pay.</p> \n<p><strong>MS: Not even after it had come out?</strong><br>No. I suppose it is odd in a way. But no. I can\u2019t explain it.</p> \n<p><strong>MS: There\u2019s another part to this question\u2026 What are your thoughts on whether you might have volunteered to take a very large pay cut?</strong><br>I did volunteer. Three times. The first time was when I went back on to the staff, because I\u2019d gone freelance in my mid-30s, when the BBC were keen on making you do it. I regretted it because it meant you had to set up a company and all that kind of crap, which I hated. But they made you do it. I\u2019ve still got the bloody memo saying: \u201cIf you don\u2019t set up a company we can\u2019t pay you.\u201d I got rid of my private company and became a sole trader because I did not like the idea of not paying tax. And the BBC in the end accepted that I could do that legitimately and they could pay me.</p> \n<p><strong>MS: Why do you think the BBC wanted journalists to set up as companies?</strong><br>We\u2019re talking about nearly 40 years ago, of course, but I think it was a ruse by the BBC at the time to avoid paying national insurance. Where were we? I\u2019ve forgotten the question.</p> \n<p><strong>MS: You taking a pay cut\u2026</strong><br>Yes. I\u2019d always thought we should have disclosed our pay, I know I sound like goody two shoes, but it is the case. The important one was when it was announced that presenters\u2019 pay was going to be revealed. I had a chat with James Harding and he said: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a disparity.\u201d And I said: \u201cWell, I\u2019ll cut my pay,\u201d and I think I went down, I don\u2019t know, a hundred grand. A lot, anyway. And that was that. But they\u2019d left it too late and when the pay was announced, though I\u2019d taken a pay cut, my pay was announced as, I think \u00a3650,000. And it made me the sixth- or seventh-highest paid. It was <em>Mastermind</em>, and my previous salary. And later, two years after that, I volunteered another cut. I ended up with earning about half what I had been earning. I\u2019m not ashamed of it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d1e5d0f754db5cac6e2b38ac7d9074e990a838c4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1e5d0f754db5cac6e2b38ac7d9074e990a838c4/81_0_800_800/500.jpg\" alt=\"Ayesha Hazarika\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Ayesha Hazarika</strong><br><strong>Former Labour adviser, commentator</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>You\u2019re known for your strong views.

Absolutely no doubt about that, it was a racist thing to say. But for Dan [Walker] to invite her then to analyse Trump\u2019s motives, I would be uncomfortable with that, as a presenter. If you\u2019re talking to a political correspondent, like Jon Sopel, then I would ask: \u201cWhat do you think is behind that, then? Why are they doing that?\u201d And that is a totally valid question for a specialist, an expert, who would know much more than you do about the political situation... But I\u2019m slightly uneasy about one presenter asking that of another presenter. Only because of the position that the presenter holds \u2013 which is that of observer, rather than an analyst. I\u2019m not dogmatic about this, by the way, I\u2019m trying to work it through.</p> \n<p><strong>MS: But if you aren\u2019t white and you live in a majority white environment, you\u2019re automatically an expert on racism.

And I went out too and there were massive, massive queues\u2026 oh, it was deeply moving. And I looked for somebody who looked like promising material for a live interview. I settled on a very old lady \u2013 she looked about 90 \u2013 standing next to a young woman, who was very pregnant. I wanted a bit of righteous anger, a bit of: \u201cThese bastards, apartheid,\u201d all that kind of thing. And 8.10 came and I did a little introduction and I said to the old lady: \u201cYou\u2019re going to be voting soon, what does it mean to you?\u201d And she quietly said: \u201cMmm, for me, not very much.\u201d And I thought: \u201cOh, shit.\u201d And then she hesitated for a moment and she leaned across and patted the swollen stomach of the young woman, and she said: \u201cBut for the young man in this lady\u2019s stomach, it will mean everything. Because he will be granted the gift of dignity that has been denied to me all my life.\u201d And it was\u2026 amazing.</p> \n<h2>Hugh Stokes<br><strong>Observer reader</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Do you feel you ever crossed the line into editorialising, </strong><strong>by making contentious statements or challenging </strong><strong>interviewees with opinions, particularly in relation to Brexit or climate change?</strong><br>Well, the answer is obviously yes, there\u2019s yet to be a presenter born who hasn\u2019t crossed that line. Also, if you put a contentious view to an interviewee, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you say: \u201cThis is the view held by Joe Bloggs,\u201d the audience will hear your voice saying: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as climate change,\u201d and they\u2019ll think you believe it and will say: \u201cWhat a wanker he is.\u201d Quite rightly.

And so they climb the second mountain, one focused on </strong><strong>things that have real value. John, having reached the pinnacle of your first mountain, what second mountain are you planning to climb?</strong><br>I wouldn\u2019t often say this of Jonathan Sacks, who is a deeply thoughtful man, but he\u2019s wrong, the underlying assumption of the question is wrong. I haven\u2019t scaled a mountain. I\u2019ve been successful because I\u2019ve done a job well enough to stay in the job for a long time, and if you stay in any job for long enough, you get respect for the fact that you survived. But I haven\u2019t done anything that I think when\u2026 when my children, grandchildren and partner, whoever, stand around my death bed, I\u2019d be able to say: \u201cYou see, I did that.\u201d And one\u2019s hope is that one might do something, and it could be something immensely small but important, but I don\u2019t feel I have yet.</p> \n<p><strong>MS: What are you planning to do that might be that thing?</strong><br>Well, maybe\u2026 trees? I\u2019m a guy who has planted a few woodlands in my time, and I would love to find out something about woodlands, about trees, just from observation and talking to lots of people who know, but that\u2019s an interest rather than a mountain to climb.</p> \n<p><strong>MS: It\u2019s a crucial interest at the moment.</strong><br>But more important than that, I\u2019ve been a very average father.

And so she was doing an important job, much more important than my job. And when she became pregnant, I said: \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d She said: \u201cI want to give up work, and I do not intend to work again until the kids are at university.\u201d I can remember where we had the conversation. It was a mutual decision. I mean, it suited me perfectly because then I could go away, and of course she always did work at schools, voluntary stuff. But it meant that I missed stuff with the kids. I mean, when I first became a foreign correspondent, it meant being away for months at a time. Then the <em>Today</em> programme came along, and that meant working stupid hours. And so you haven\u2019t got time. I now have time and I hope that I\u2019ll use that time more\u2026 meaningfully.

You\u2019d have to be a moron to be suspicious of art. When I see a Turner masterpiece or listen to a piece of Bach or read a wonderful book, I am swept away. But I am sceptical about, for instance, found art. I don\u2019t understand how something becomes art because someone important says it\u2019s art. It\u2019s such an interesting conversation but it gets you nowhere. I can\u2019t help feeling that Damien Hirst is not worthy of being in the same room as Turner, but my knowledge is not huge. It\u2019s more heart than head for me, disgracefully, because it\u2019s instinctive.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"46e952aa-cfdb-4cc6-8606-77bbc5745bf2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5bPAJ9t-qh8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>James Atkinson<br><strong>Observer reader</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Were you open about your conservative views with your editors when you were presenter on the </strong><em><strong>Today</strong></em><strong> programme?

      "bodyText": "\u201cAren\u2019t I supposed to be cross with you about something?\u201d says John Humphrys, busying himself with making coffee. \u201cWhat was it? I\u2019ve forgotten\u2026 Do you want a banana?\u201d I\u2019m OK for a banana, thanks. We\u2019re in Humphrys\u2019s homely kitchen in his house in west London. And yes, the long-serving co-presenter of Radio 4\u2019s Today programme has been cross with me before. About a year ago, as the Observer\u2019s radio reviewer, I\u2019d written an article about the Today programme that wasn\u2019t entirely complimentary, and Humphrys had fired off an angry email at me, making some points I agreed with, and several I didn\u2019t. I answered, and, after a bit of to-ing and fro-ing, we ended up on fairly good terms. So now, here we are. I\u2019m armed with umpteen readers\u2019 questions for him \u2013 many hostile, I must say \u2013 and Humphrys is all set to answer them. Now 76, wiry and fiery, dressed in cosy fleece, Humphrys finally retired from Today a week or so ago, after more than three decades at the helm during which he became the show\u2019s best-known host. He\u2019s published his memoirs to coincide with that retirement, and A Day Like Today is a 400-page doorstopper of a book that describes Humphrys\u2019s early life growing up poor but proud in Splott, Wales, and moves through his career as a newspaper reporter, foreign correspondent and TV news presenter. It is very detailed on his years at Today (he joined in 1987, at the age of 43), which provide about two-thirds of the book. Though he doesn\u2019t reveal much about his private life, he is straightforward in his opinions about other people: he doesn\u2019t seem to like Eddie Mair or Jane Garvey very much, for instance. \u201cEddie Mair is a brilliant broadcaster,\u201d he says today, \u201cbut I dislike his style of broadcasting when applied to a hard news programme. And Jane Garvey is too opinionated for my taste. You shouldn\u2019t lace questions with your own views, and Jane tells the listener what she thinks about everything. But then it is Woman\u2019s Hour, not Today.\u201d This last point seems at the very least ironic, given that one reason Humphrys\u2019s detractors dislike him is that they believe they can tell his opinion of interviewees by the way he interviews them. Humphrys argues hard to me that they can\u2019t: though he\u2019s assumed to be a Brexiteer, he voted remain, and he cites a time when a very good friend of his came on to Today, and Humphrys gave him a roasting. (It was Patrick Holden, then director of the Soil Association.) \u201cI\u2019ve known Patrick for 40 years,\u201d he says, \u201cand I believe in everything he\u2019s done and does, I believe organic farming is vital, but when I interviewed him, I put the opposite argument to him. I am a devil\u2019s advocate. That is what I do.\u201d John Humphrys, for many, came to epitomise both the good and bad about the Today programme. His tenacious interviewing style was admired when it was used to effect against politicians but, post-Brexit, as the country divided along non-party lines, many felt that his rottweiler questioning technique was used on the wrong people. And his interviews with non-politicians \u2013 fashion journalists, artists, authors, scientists \u2013 could seem naive, even inept. In his book, he admits that, though Today\u2019s researchers always prepared him briefs for interviews, he mostly didn\u2019t read them. Is this true? \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean I am notoriously\u2026 \u2018stupid\u2019 is the only word. Mostly you don\u2019t know what interviews you\u2019re going to be doing until you see them, and the sensible thing to do is to sit down and read the brief very carefully. I don\u2019t do that. It\u2019s a sort of brinksmanship, and also I don\u2019t want to already know the answers to my questions. Not with politicians, but if you\u2019re talking to real people about real things \u2013 somebody who\u2019s just swum the channel 19 times or something \u2013 then if you ask them a question that you genuinely don\u2019t know the answer to, you are genuinely surprised.\u201d He\u2019s a strange mix, John Humphrys. He gets upset if presenters voice opinions, but is quick to give his own. He rues the BBC\u2019s liberal bias, but is a natural liberal himself. He is, I think, a highly emotional man, who decries emotion in reporting. He seeks precise answers but sometimes struggles to articulate accurately what he wants to say. And, though he often falls foul of feminists, he is pro-women. \u201cI detest the word feminism, because of course I\u2019m a feminist,\u201d he says. \u201cGod, why does one have to say it? Obviously, obviously\u2026 Racism is a profoundly moral issue, as is feminism. That\u2019s why I refused to wear one of those \u201cThis is what a feminist looks like\u201d T-shirts. No, it isn\u2019t. This is what a white man looks like, who happens to believe that women are equal to men. I mean, even saying it makes you sound like a dickhead.\u201d You seem to prefer being interviewed by women, I say. \u201cI do,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe I trust them more. I like talking to women.\u201d Are you more competitive with men? \u201cYes! Of course. It\u2019s instinctive, I think. It\u2019s not learned. Or it might be. I went to an all-boys school.\u201d Humphrys runs a charity, the Kitchen Tables Charity Trust, which helps feed money to small charities in the developing world, mostly those that work with children. We talk a bit about it, how it works, and about his feelings around the misuse of power and the lack of respect for \u201cordinary\u201d people. When he was a young journalist, he witnessed the tragedy at Aberfan \u2013 he thumps the table when he tells me about it \u2013 and saw terrible things, too, when he reported from South Africa. \u201cYou see children dying of starvation, and you know, you know it\u2019s because of men who want power,\u201d he says. \u201cMen who want power so much that they will do anything. And it is always the men. With our charity, we don\u2019t give any money to men, ever. Because in our experience, if you give the money to a woman, whether it\u2019s running a little business, or a school, or a charity, it\u2019s used for good reasons. You give it to the man, it\u2019s often pissed against the wall. I would always opt for women because I think they are more \u2013 this will get me in trouble with the right-thinking brigade \u2013 because I think women are more sensitive to the fear of abuse of childen. The ultimate measure of a society is first, how we deal with children, and second, how we deal with very old people who can\u2019t help themselves. That\u2019s how you judge the humanity of a society and humanity is what it is all about.\u201d Humphrys can\u2019t help himself. He\u2019s thumping the table again, already all riled up.

Because I\u2019ve been doing it for 33 years and when you\u2019re doing the Today programme it totally dominates you. It isn\u2019t just the getting up at half past three in the morning and having to go to bed at half past eight at night. It\u2019s all the other stuff. You\u2019ve got to read all the newspapers, or try to. You\u2019ve got to keep in touch with everything that\u2019s happening all the time. And that dominates your life. And I\u2019ve had enough of that. Michael Carter Observer reader Are you ready for the adjustment in your whole life or will you end up at the kitchen table interrogating breakfast cereals by the dawning light? [Laughs] No, I\u2019m not ready. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m going to do what I\u2019m going to do, or how I\u2019m going to do it, or where it\u2019s going to be done, or who it is going to be done with. And that\u2019s the glory of it. New vistas are open to me. And yes, I\u2019ll probably end up arguing with the DHL man. Kate Losowsky Observer reader Who do you wish you\u2019d interviewed and never got the chance to, and why? I\u2019m not a royalist, but: the Queen. She is unique. I got invited to one of these private lunches \u2013 note, private lunches \u2013 three others and me, with Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh. And after we\u2019d had the lunch, I did ask her if she would do an interview with me. She likes to take her coffee, not in the dining room, but in the adjoining room so she can throw bits of food to her doggies. I wondered why she said it in such a posh way, but it\u2019s dorgis, she explained to me. Dachshund corgi, join it together, dorgis. Anyway, I asked her for an interview and I went into a big spiel and said, these are the reasons why you could, you know? And she listened to me very patiently and she said: \u201cNo\u2026 And what\u2019s more, Mr Humphrys, if one were ever to do such an interview, it would certainly not be with you.\u201d Jenni Murray Presenter of BBC Radio 4\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour What\u2019s the most important question that needs to be put to Boris Johnson, and what answer would you expect to get? That\u2019s a killer, isn\u2019t it? Curse you, Jenni\u2026 How about: \u201cYou tell lies routinely. Do you know you\u2019re doing that?\u201d In a sense it would be a pointless question, because he\u2019d say \u201cflhmpthflfhfhhhmph\u201d [posh waffly Johnson-style noise], but then you\u2019d follow up with, you know, \u201can inverted pyramid of piffle\u201d. And in the process of taking apart his denials, you would get somewhere, I think. Miranda Sawyer: Were you shocked that Johnson didn\u2019t come on when you were on Today? Ha! I retire and within days, he\u2019s on. Diana Fowler Observer reader I would like to know what John Humphrys thinks the UK will gain should we leave the EU. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s much easier to say what we\u2019ll gain, or at least, keep if we don\u2019t leave the union. But obviously we must, and I speak as somebody who voted to remain. MS: Why do you think people think you voted for Brexit? I\u2019ve no idea! My reasons to vote to remain are many and varied, and largely to do with, you know, no more war in western Europe and being born in 1943, and all that kind of thing. But people who voted to leave were more\u2026 passionate is such a ghastly word\u2026 more motivated than those who voted remain, because they really did, I think, believe in sovereignty and freedom. Largely, those arguments did not resonate with me. What worries me is that there will be trouble if we don\u2019t leave, unless there is something pretty concrete in its place. Not riots in the street, but if people are told: \u201cYou voted, but now you can just fuck off and die,\u201d that\u2019s worrying. Matthew Lenton Observer reader What are your feelings about the effect your earning so much more than them had on your female colleagues, particularly Sarah Montague? Sarah was upset and she was right to be upset. Absolutely right. I didn\u2019t know how much she was earning. I have never talked to any other presenter on the Today programme about how much we earn. I think Sarah\u2019s wonderful. But we never had a conversation about our pay. MS: Not even after it had come out? No. I suppose it is odd in a way. But no. I can\u2019t explain it. MS: There\u2019s another part to this question\u2026 What are your thoughts on whether you might have volunteered to take a very large pay cut? I did volunteer. Three times. The first time was when I went back on to the staff, because I\u2019d gone freelance in my mid-30s, when the BBC were keen on making you do it. I regretted it because it meant you had to set up a company and all that kind of crap, which I hated. But they made you do it. I\u2019ve still got the bloody memo saying: \u201cIf you don\u2019t set up a company we can\u2019t pay you.\u201d I got rid of my private company and became a sole trader because I did not like the idea of not paying tax. And the BBC in the end accepted that I could do that legitimately and they could pay me. MS: Why do you think the BBC wanted journalists to set up as companies? We\u2019re talking about nearly 40 years ago, of course, but I think it was a ruse by the BBC at the time to avoid paying national insurance. Where were we? I\u2019ve forgotten the question. MS: You taking a pay cut\u2026 Yes. I\u2019d always thought we should have disclosed our pay, I know I sound like goody two shoes, but it is the case. The important one was when it was announced that presenters\u2019 pay was going to be revealed. I had a chat with James Harding and he said: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a disparity.\u201d And I said: \u201cWell, I\u2019ll cut my pay,\u201d and I think I went down, I don\u2019t know, a hundred grand. A lot, anyway. And that was that. But they\u2019d left it too late and when the pay was announced, though I\u2019d taken a pay cut, my pay was announced as, I think \u00a3650,000. And it made me the sixth- or seventh-highest paid. It was Mastermind, and my previous salary. And later, two years after that, I volunteered another cut. I ended up with earning about half what I had been earning. I\u2019m not ashamed of it. Ayesha Hazarika Former Labour adviser, commentator You\u2019re known for your strong views. Do you think it\u2019s right that the BBC found against Naga Munchetty for pointing out how a lot of people of colour interpret the phrase: \u201cGo back\u201d? Naga Munchetty was absolutely right to \u2013 I hate the expression \u2013 but to \u201ccall out\u201d Trump the racist. Absolutely no doubt about that, it was a racist thing to say. But for Dan [Walker] to invite her then to analyse Trump\u2019s motives, I would be uncomfortable with that, as a presenter. If you\u2019re talking to a political correspondent, like Jon Sopel, then I would ask: \u201cWhat do you think is behind that, then? Why are they doing that?\u201d And that is a totally valid question for a specialist, an expert, who would know much more than you do about the political situation... But I\u2019m slightly uneasy about one presenter asking that of another presenter. Only because of the position that the presenter holds \u2013 which is that of observer, rather than an analyst. I\u2019m not dogmatic about this, by the way, I\u2019m trying to work it through. MS: But if you aren\u2019t white and you live in a majority white environment, you\u2019re automatically an expert on racism. I mean, just through walking through the world. That\u2019s true. Of course, of course. But you\u2019re not an expert in Donald Trump\u2019s political motives. And that\u2019s\u2026 there is a difference there. It\u2019s quite a subtle one, but there is a difference. I think. MS: Do you think the BBC handled the situation badly? Yes. The BBC invariably handles these things badly. It\u2019s because the BBC\u2019s strengths are also its weaknesses. It\u2019s just that the BBC is not didactic. It isn\u2019t an authoritarian organisation. So there cannot be a single clear BBC view. And I think that\u2019s reassuring. Michael Kemp Observer reader Which interviewee surprised you the most, and why? It was an old woman. I went back to South Africa when they had the first Mandela elections. They\u2019d opened the polling booths a day early for old people, people in wheelchairs, pregnant women, so they wouldn\u2019t be crushed to death in the queue. And I went out too and there were massive, massive queues\u2026 oh, it was deeply moving. And I looked for somebody who looked like promising material for a live interview. I settled on a very old lady \u2013 she looked about 90 \u2013 standing next to a young woman, who was very pregnant. I wanted a bit of righteous anger, a bit of: \u201cThese bastards, apartheid,\u201d all that kind of thing. And 8.10 came and I did a little introduction and I said to the old lady: \u201cYou\u2019re going to be voting soon, what does it mean to you?\u201d And she quietly said: \u201cMmm, for me, not very much.\u201d And I thought: \u201cOh, shit.\u201d And then she hesitated for a moment and she leaned across and patted the swollen stomach of the young woman, and she said: \u201cBut for the young man in this lady\u2019s stomach, it will mean everything. Because he will be granted the gift of dignity that has been denied to me all my life.\u201d And it was\u2026 amazing. Hugh Stokes Observer reader Do you feel you ever crossed the line into editorialising, by making contentious statements or challenging interviewees with opinions, particularly in relation to Brexit or climate change? Well, the answer is obviously yes, there\u2019s yet to be a presenter born who hasn\u2019t crossed that line. Also, if you put a contentious view to an interviewee, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you say: \u201cThis is the view held by Joe Bloggs,\u201d the audience will hear your voice saying: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as climate change,\u201d and they\u2019ll think you believe it and will say: \u201cWhat a wanker he is.\u201d Quite rightly. Except that you haven\u2019t said it, you\u2019ve attributed to somebody else. But yes, sometimes you will get a bit\u2026 you go over the top. MS: What about tone? People react so differently to your tone. Well, over the years you establish a relationship with somebody like Heseltine, or John Prescott, or Tony Blair, and you know what to expect and then you have that sort of conversation. That is inevitably going to upset a lot of people who might regard Tony Blair or John Prescott as the spawn of Satan. They will react, because we all hear everything in different ways, don\u2019t we? You are allowed to express controversial views that may not be your own, and I think, for instance, Justin Webb got short-changed over that when he interviewed Nigel Lawson about global warming. MS: People didn\u2019t want Nigel Lawson on at all, because he\u2019s a climate change denier. Quite. I\u2019ve always hated the word denier because it makes it sound like climate change is a religion. MS: The word is used in the same way as Holocaust denier. The Holocaust happened. Climate change is happening. That is true, but there was a very long period of time when we didn\u2019t know that it was happening. The Holocaust has never been, ever, in any doubt, at all. Samira Ahmed Broadcaster Lots of people probably ask you for advice because of your experience, but what you would say is the most important thing you\u2019ve learned from younger staff members? I know inevitably that I am not going to be \u201cin touch\u201d with young people, in spite of the fact that I have children and grandchildren. Obviously I have a set of prejudices, of attitudes that have developed over the past 76 years. Working with so many young people \u2013 and by young, I\u2019m afraid I mean anybody under the age of 30 \u2013 it\u2019s like you enter into another world. You always learn something. Jamesread Observer reader, posted online Is it appropriate to holiday with David Davis and then also to interview him at 8:10 on numerous occasions for a nice cosy chat about Brexit? All those holidays, David Davis and I, they\u2019ve all come as news to me. This is the glory of Twitter. There was a bloke who worked for David Davis for a couple of years, and then had a nervous breakdown of some sort, and appeared on Twitter sounding off about various things, including the \u201cfact\u201d that I had gone on holiday with David Davis. But I\u2019ve had lunch with David Davis twice in the 35 years that I\u2019ve known him, and that\u2019s it. MS: Who do you go on holiday with, John? I don\u2019t go on holiday very often, unfortunately. Ideally with my partner. I\u2019ve never been on a holiday with a politician. I can\u2019t imagine anything worse. In my 33 years on the Today programme, I\u2019ve had lunch with, maybe\u2026 half a dozen? MS: Who would they be? One of them was the chancellor after Geoffrey Howe\u2026 Norman Lamont. OK, so I\u2019ve had lunch with David Davis. I\u2019ve had lunch with Norman Lamont. I\u2019ve had lunch with, I can\u2019t remember this guy\u2019s name, but he was a very senior figure in Blair\u2019s administration. I had tea in the House of Commons with Gordon Brown. I had a coffee in his office with Tony Blair, in his office in the House of Commons. I think that\u2019s it. No Theresa May, no Maggie Thatcher, no Cameron, none of his lot. MS: What about newspaper proprietors and editors? Do you ever lunch with them? I\u2019ve had lunch with a few. Dacre, at Dacre Towers, as it was all those years ago. Once. People like Charles Moore and\u2026 oh, I had dinner once with the last editor of the Guardian. What\u2019s his name? Plays the piano. MS: Alan Rusbridger. Yes. I had dinner with Alan Rusbridger. I am not a great socialiser. Sophie Walker Founder of the Women\u2019s Equality party Do you think you would have had the same success and earning power at the BBC if you\u2019d been a woman? No, not in the early days. It\u2019s difficult. Kate Adie was a little bit older than me and she was far more successful than me in the early days. She\u2019s bloody good. And because she was a woman, and an extremely courageous woman, and brilliant, Kate brought something to her reporting that I would not have been able to bring. The management thing is where the BBC goes wrong. It has been hideously under-managed by women, especially when you consider the women who have worked there \u2013 Helen Boaden, for instance, who I wanted to be director general... I\u2019ve been banging on for 15 years about we must have a female director general. No female director general, ever? It\u2019s shocking. Robert Jones Observer reader Would you encourage any young person to go into journalism today? I wouldn\u2019t be encouraging, no, because it is an immensely competitive field. When my son wanted to be a cellist, he had an audition at the Royal College, and I went in with him to turn the pages of the music. When he finished, the tutor said: \u201cHmm, I would advise you not to become a professional cellist.\u201d You can imagine my son\u2019s face. And then the tutor said: \u201cUnless doing anything else would make you very unhappy.\u201d That\u2019s corny, but that\u2019s how I feel about journalism. hotfeet Observer reader, posted online You are happy to promote the Daily Mail. You trust them with the story of your life. Do you observe any political bias in the Daily Mail? This is about the serialisation of my book extracts in the Mail. The deal was done by the publisher. MS: Did the Mail show you the edited version of the extracts? Yes. They did and they not only did that, but they also sought my approval. I was not particularly happy with the splash [the headline] the Mail used, but you know\u2026 I don\u2019t give a flying fuck whether people think that a particular newspaper is biased in this way or that way. All I\u2019m concerned with is that my material is presented in the way I\u2019ve written it and they didn\u2019t change a word. MS: Do you understand why some people don\u2019t like the Daily Mail? I have always read the Daily Mail as a journalist because it speaks to an awful lot of people. Its views may in some cases not be compatible with mine. As the views of the Guardian are sometimes not compatible with mine. People should be able to read views other than their own, or their own views, whichever they choose. They have the choice. And if you\u2019re going to say the Mail is a vicious, pernicious, hideous, biased, prejudiced, cruel, wicked newspaper, then that\u2019s fine. You\u2019re entitled to say that. I don\u2019t happen to believe that; its campaigns around plastic or people with dementia or racism \u2013 Stephen Lawrence \u2013 are exemplary. But to say that the 5 million people who read the Daily Mail are themselves somehow inferior to, let us say, the people who read the Guardian or the Observer\u2026 that is grotesque. It is hugely offensive. I mean, I know people who read the Daily Mail whom I like. Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks Former chief rabbi In his most recent book, the New York Times columnist David Brooks talks about how people scale two mountains in their lives. The main part of their lives is focused on the self \u2013 being a success, making a mark \u2013 but having reached the pinnacle of the first mountain, they sometimes find it unsatisfying or empty, and realise that there are even bigger things in life that they want to achieve. And so they climb the second mountain, one focused on things that have real value. John, having reached the pinnacle of your first mountain, what second mountain are you planning to climb? I wouldn\u2019t often say this of Jonathan Sacks, who is a deeply thoughtful man, but he\u2019s wrong, the underlying assumption of the question is wrong. I haven\u2019t scaled a mountain. I\u2019ve been successful because I\u2019ve done a job well enough to stay in the job for a long time, and if you stay in any job for long enough, you get respect for the fact that you survived. But I haven\u2019t done anything that I think when\u2026 when my children, grandchildren and partner, whoever, stand around my death bed, I\u2019d be able to say: \u201cYou see, I did that.\u201d And one\u2019s hope is that one might do something, and it could be something immensely small but important, but I don\u2019t feel I have yet. MS: What are you planning to do that might be that thing? Well, maybe\u2026 trees? I\u2019m a guy who has planted a few woodlands in my time, and I would love to find out something about woodlands, about trees, just from observation and talking to lots of people who know, but that\u2019s an interest rather than a mountain to climb. MS: It\u2019s a crucial interest at the moment. But more important than that, I\u2019ve been a very average father. I\u2019ve provided and all that, but I\u2019ve never felt that I\u2019ve been\u2026 I\u2019m not massively proud of how I\u2019ve been a father\u2026 I\u2019ve excused my personal behaviour, the way that I\u2019ve related to and treated the people who are closest and most important to me. And obviously my children are top of that list. MS: How was your wife about you being away a lot? [Humphrys married Edna Wilding in 1964. They divorced in the late 80s and she died in 1997.] My wife was a nurse, and she helped to run the first spina bifida unit in the country \u2013 for some reason there\u2019s a very high incidence of spina bifida in south Wales. And so she was doing an important job, much more important than my job. And when she became pregnant, I said: \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d She said: \u201cI want to give up work, and I do not intend to work again until the kids are at university.\u201d I can remember where we had the conversation. It was a mutual decision. I mean, it suited me perfectly because then I could go away, and of course she always did work at schools, voluntary stuff. But it meant that I missed stuff with the kids. I mean, when I first became a foreign correspondent, it meant being away for months at a time. Then the Today programme came along, and that meant working stupid hours. And so you haven\u2019t got time. I now have time and I hope that I\u2019ll use that time more\u2026 meaningfully. God, this sounds wishy-washy! Mike Morris Observer reader In an interview with Helen McEntee on 26 January, you said Irish exports to the UK were about 50% of total exports. It\u2019s actually about 13% to 14%. Were you troubled by that sort of basic factual error or do you feel your \u201cinterviewing style\u201d was more important? Of course I\u2019m troubled about any factual errors. It is what I was told, and I repeated it, I probably should\u2019ve gone back over it in some detail and it did slip through the net. But that\u2019s nothing to do with my interview style. malarkey Observer reader, posted online Why are you so suspicious of art? I\u2019m not! You\u2019d have to be a moron to be suspicious of art. When I see a Turner masterpiece or listen to a piece of Bach or read a wonderful book, I am swept away. But I am sceptical about, for instance, found art. I don\u2019t understand how something becomes art because someone important says it\u2019s art. It\u2019s such an interesting conversation but it gets you nowhere. I can\u2019t help feeling that Damien Hirst is not worthy of being in the same room as Turner, but my knowledge is not huge. It\u2019s more heart than head for me, disgracefully, because it\u2019s instinctive. James Atkinson Observer reader Were you open about your conservative views with your editors when you were presenter on the Today programme? And did they try to compensate in any way? That is such a stupid question. I am not conservative, you know. I am genuinely one of those pathetic people who has very strong views about issues. I think it\u2019s quite difficult to be a hack for as long as I\u2019ve been and come out of that with firm politics. I\u2019m a reporter and my views are informed by what I see and the people I talk to. So every other bloody week I change my mind about something or other, and when you vote, you look for the party that comes closest to what you believe. Simon Mayo DJ Why did you insist on wearing the worst headphones in the world? Because, Simon, because when I\u2019m sitting in a studio, I want to hear what the interviewee is saying, and those headphones enable me to do that. But they also let me communicate with the person sitting on my left, and I like to be able to communicate with my fellow presenters, as well as with the outside world. If I was in a studio by myself, then maybe I would have those bloody headphones that make you look like a pensioned-off airline pilot. But \u2013 get a life, Mayo!",

In May, he scored a brilliant 161 off 136 balls for Middlesex against Kent to confirm his position as one of the most exciting young batsmen in the game and made his England debut in an ODI against West Indies at the age of 22. In June, he played his first Twenty20 international, scoring six off eight balls against the Netherlands at Lord\u2019s. In July, he played his final game for Finchley, scoring 22 off 48 balls against Hampstead in the Middlesex County Cricket League before being dismissed off the bowling of a 40-year-old Paul Weekes. \u201cI remember getting him out. I made it a must if any Middlesex player played against me I tried to dominate that particular day,\u201d says Weekes, a former Middlesex bowler and friend of Morgan\u2019s from their time playing together at county level, who was captaining Hampstead that day. \u201cHe hit the ball before for six and then he just pushed at a wide one and was caught at slip.

After Roger Bannister made history, it took me another 65 years. I\u2019ve tried but I\u2019ve done it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Throughout the attempt, he had stuck to a pace of 2min 50sec per kilometre \u2013 the equivalent, as many later pointed out on social media, to running 100m in 17.2 seconds, 422 times.</p> \n<p>He hit the one-hour mark with 11 seconds to spare and, with 500m to go, burst clear of his support team to break the hallowed two-hour barrier, punching his chest twice in celebration.</p> \n<p>As he sprinted towards the finish line, where his wife, Grace Sugutt, was waiting to greet him, Kipchoge waved to the crowds. Upon breaking the tape he grabbed a Kenyan flag and was mobbed by his support crew.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2019/oct/12/eliud-kipchoges-sub-two-hour-marathon-in-pictures\">Eliud Kipchoge's sub two-hour marathon \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In characteristically modest style, he said afterwards: \u201cThis shows no one is limited. Now I\u2019ve done it, I am expecting more people to do it after me.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bannister\u2019s record was broken just weeks after he ran his sub four-minute mile. But any expectation that Kipchoge\u2019s crown will be claimed imminently seems unlikely, at least in the short term.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a while before anybody else breaks two again,\u201d said Andrew Jones, a professor of sport and health sciences at the University of Exeter, pointing out that Kipchoge ran on a special course using pacemakers.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely to be replicated in a major city marathon so you\u2019d need another specific situation to be created to make another attempt.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kipchoge\u2019s extraordinary, superhuman feat seemed the stuff of fantasy only a few years ago. An article published in 2010 on the Science of Sport website suggested that the world <a href=\"https://sportsscientists.com/2010/08/the-sub-2-hour-marathon-who-and-when/\" title=\"\">would have</a><a href=\"https://sportsscientists.com/2010/08/the-sub-2-hour-marathon-who-and-when/\" title=\"\"> \u201c80 years to wait for the two-hour marathon\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>In 2017, Kipchoge had tried to dip under two hours at the Formula One track in Monza, Italy, as part of Nike\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nike.com/gb/en_gb/c/running/breaking2\" title=\"\">Breaking 2 project</a>, but missed out then by just 26 seconds.</p> \n<p>He had been joined by two other elite runners - Ethiopia\u2019s Lelisa Desisa and Zersenay Tadese, of Eritrea - who both finished well off the pace.</p> \n<p>This time, for the Ineos 1:59 Challenge, Kipchoge was on his own, confirmation that few can rival him.</p> \n<p>Jones, an adviser on the Breaking 2 project, said Kipchoge\u2019s achievement could \u201creset the psychological framework for everybody else\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think it will now be more common to see people running 2:02 or 2:01 and, more importantly, for the youngsters in Ethiopia and Kenya and elsewhere - it\u2019s reset what\u2019s possible. For them, 1:59 is the new status quo.\u201d</p> \n<p>The man behind the attempt, the INneos chief, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, paid tribute to how Kipchoge finished: \u201cThat last kilometre where he actually accelerated was superhuman. He ran the first half marathon in under an hour and then he had to do it again.\u201d</p> \n<p>The conditions in Prater park were perfect. Almost pancake-flat, the 9.6km course, which Kipchoge completed more than four times, boasted long straights, protected from the wind by high trees.</p> \n<p>The achievement will not be recognised as an official marathon world record as it was not run in open competition. Nevertheless, Kipchoge\u2019s place in the history books is assured.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s astonishing, what he has achieved today,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe\u2019s clearly the outstanding endurance athlete of our generation, possibly any generation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sports stars from around the world were awestruck by the achievement.</p> \n<p>The British sprinter Adam Gemili declared on Twitter: \u201cTruly inspirational. Sub 2 hour marathon. So blessed to have witnessed that.

      "bodyText": "When he made history in Austria on Saturday morning, Eliud Kipchoge, the first person to run a marathon in less than two hours, was quick to refer to another jaw-dropping athletic milestone reached more than 50 years ago. Amid jubilant scenes in Prater park, Vienna, the 34-year-old Kenyan declared: \u201cI\u2019m feeling good. After Roger Bannister made history, it took me another 65 years. I\u2019ve tried but I\u2019ve done it.\u201d Throughout the attempt, he had stuck to a pace of 2min 50sec per kilometre \u2013 the equivalent, as many later pointed out on social media, to running 100m in 17.2 seconds, 422 times. He hit the one-hour mark with 11 seconds to spare and, with 500m to go, burst clear of his support team to break the hallowed two-hour barrier, punching his chest twice in celebration. As he sprinted towards the finish line, where his wife, Grace Sugutt, was waiting to greet him, Kipchoge waved to the crowds. Upon breaking the tape he grabbed a Kenyan flag and was mobbed by his support crew. In characteristically modest style, he said afterwards: \u201cThis shows no one is limited. Now I\u2019ve done it, I am expecting more people to do it after me.\u201d Bannister\u2019s record was broken just weeks after he ran his sub four-minute mile. But any expectation that Kipchoge\u2019s crown will be claimed imminently seems unlikely, at least in the short term. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a while before anybody else breaks two again,\u201d said Andrew Jones, a professor of sport and health sciences at the University of Exeter, pointing out that Kipchoge ran on a special course using pacemakers. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely to be replicated in a major city marathon so you\u2019d need another specific situation to be created to make another attempt.\u201d Kipchoge\u2019s extraordinary, superhuman feat seemed the stuff of fantasy only a few years ago. An article published in 2010 on the Science of Sport website suggested that the world would have \u201c80 years to wait for the two-hour marathon\u201d. In 2017, Kipchoge had tried to dip under two hours at the Formula One track in Monza, Italy, as part of Nike\u2019s Breaking 2 project, but missed out then by just 26 seconds. He had been joined by two other elite runners - Ethiopia\u2019s Lelisa Desisa and Zersenay Tadese, of Eritrea - who both finished well off the pace. This time, for the Ineos 1:59 Challenge, Kipchoge was on his own, confirmation that few can rival him. Jones, an adviser on the Breaking 2 project, said Kipchoge\u2019s achievement could \u201creset the psychological framework for everybody else\u201d. \u201cI think it will now be more common to see people running 2:02 or 2:01 and, more importantly, for the youngsters in Ethiopia and Kenya and elsewhere - it\u2019s reset what\u2019s possible. For them, 1:59 is the new status quo.\u201d The man behind the attempt, the INneos chief, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, paid tribute to how Kipchoge finished: \u201cThat last kilometre where he actually accelerated was superhuman. He ran the first half marathon in under an hour and then he had to do it again.\u201d The conditions in Prater park were perfect. Almost pancake-flat, the 9.6km course, which Kipchoge completed more than four times, boasted long straights, protected from the wind by high trees. The achievement will not be recognised as an official marathon world record as it was not run in open competition. Nevertheless, Kipchoge\u2019s place in the history books is assured. \u201cIt\u2019s astonishing, what he has achieved today,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe\u2019s clearly the outstanding endurance athlete of our generation, possibly any generation.\u201d Sports stars from around the world were awestruck by the achievement. The British sprinter Adam Gemili declared on Twitter: \u201cTruly inspirational. Sub 2 hour marathon. So blessed to have witnessed that. History!\u201d The England rugby star Maro Itoje described it as \u201cincredible\u201d. Kipchoge, who has won 10 of his 11 marathons and holds the official world record marathon time of 2:01:39, appeared overwhelmed by the reaction. An hour after forcing the world to reconsider what was humanly possible, the four-time London marathon winner posted on Twitter: \u201cToday we went to the Moon and came back to earth! I am at a loss for words for all the support I have received from all over the world. Thank you to all who gave me the opportunity. Asante.\u201d Game changers Sir Roger Bannister is the first person to run a sub four-minute mile, in 3min 59.4sec (6 May 1954). Bob Beamon breaks the long-jump record by 55cm (October 18 1968).

      "bodyText": "Pierre van Hooijdonk does a very good Ron Atkinson impression. It is genuinely funny as, in the lobby of an Amsterdam hotel, he tries in vain to collapse his 6ft 4in frame into something resembling Big Ron. The Dutchman\u2019s accent and intonation, however, are spot on as we discuss his final few months under Atkinson at Nottingham Forest in 1998-99, when the club was relegated from the Premier League. They have not been back since. \u201cDespite being bottom of the league, Ron had just appeared in a Carling advert as some sort of clueless medieval king who had just discovered football,\u201d Van Hooijdonk says. \u201cI remember one training session afterwards where I was pissed off with the whole situation and I cursed loudly. Ron replied: \u2018If you don\u2019t like it, why don\u2019t you fuck off?\u2019 So I did, and as I walked off the training pitch I shouted: \u2018The only reason they asked you on that beer ad is because you are the biggest pub manager in the country.\u2019 \u201cLater that afternoon, Ron called me at home to come and see him in his office.

And all the players were pissing themselves when he got into the wrong dugout in his first game in charge.\u201d It proved a rare moment of lightness in a turbulent time for Forest and Van Hooijdonk, who had fired the club to the 1997-98 First Division title the previous season with 34 goals, scored at the World Cup for the Netherlands and then spent the first few months of the next season on strike after failing to secure a move away from Forest. \u201cThe thing that started all that was after the World Cup Newcastle and Ruud Gullit came in with a \u00a37m bid, twice what Forest had paid,\u201d Van Hooijdonk says. \u201cBut Bassett told the papers my price was \u00a310m.

At present, it\u2019s a strong tailwind down the straight to the line with a headwind into the \u2018S\u2019 Curves and down the back straight into the Spoon Curve. How will that shape the tactics of both the Ferrari and Mercedes teams? At any rate, cannot wait to see how Vettel handles pole position after his antics in Sochi. No doubt his intention will be to never see a car from lap 1 through to 53. Incredibly, and ominously perhaps for Mercedes, this Suzuka track has never produced a winner from the second row.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5da29c438f083d8b3b9dae22\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-13T04:41:25.376Z\">5.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>What of Mercedes? The general consensus is that Suzuka is tailor-made for the car but their bid for a sixth straight win in the Japanese GP - they haven\u2019t lost at Suzuka in the hybrid engine era - looks less than straightforward now after Ferrari\u2019s tour de force in qualifying. Still, the Silver Arrows will have their own plans with both Bottas and Hamilton enjoying an unobstructed view of their Ferrari rivals on the grid. And they\u2019ll need them. Around 0.3 secs clear of their rivals through practice, the gap was turned on its head in qualifying with Hamilton 0.238 secs behind the best that Vettel could muster.</p> <p>Hamilton\u2019s win in Russia strengthened his grip on the title but he can\u2019t wrap up his sixth drivers\u2019 championship today. It is possible, however, for the champ to eliminate everyone bar Bottas from contention heading to Mexico. Vettel is one of four men mathematically in the hunt of running down Hamilton, but he is a whopping 128 points in arrears of the Brit. Bottas (73 points behind Hamilton), Leclerc (107) and Max Verstappen (110) are the others. As for Mercedes, they can equal Ferrari\u2019s record of six consecutive constructors\u2019 championships at Suzuka if they outscore the Scuderia by 14 points.</p> <p>The stage is set for an epic race.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MercedesAMGF1/status/1183205688669102081\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What a Quali session! \ud83d\ude4c It\u2019s an all silver second row for today\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JapaneseGP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#JapaneseGP</a>! <br><br>Valtteri will start P3, with Lewis alongside him in P4! <br><br>We gave that everything everything we had!

Welcome to a Sunday at Suzuka that, thanks to Typhoon Hagibis, can only be described as super. This is just the fifth time in Formula One history that qualifying and the race has been held on the same day. And the morning\u2019s action didn\u2019t disappoint, whetting the appetite for what should be a fascinating race.</p> <p>Qualifying belonged solely to Ferrari, the Scuderia locking out the front row with Sebastian Vettel to start from pole ahead of Charles Leclerc. It\u2019s Ferrari\u2019s fifth successive pole position, a feat they haven\u2019t achieved since 2001 and something that will be even more satisfying after the dominance of Mercedes in practice. The Mercedes duo of Valtteri Bottas and Lewis Hamilton will start on the second row.</p> <p>Ferrari\u2019s tactics this afternoon will be fascinating after the meltdown of Sochi. Regardless, the simmering rivalry between Leclerc and Vettel is now compulsory viewing. Prior to Japan, Leclerc had outqualified Vettel in the past nine GPs and following qualifying Damon Hill suggested to Leclerc that he had awoken the beast inside Vettel. Certainly, the rise of the Mon\u00e9gasque driver has given rise to the theory that Vettel is fast becoming yesterday\u2019s man. That train of thought has been derailed after qualifying and, if anything, Vettel can thank his teammate for stirring the competitive juices.</p> <p>Mercedes looked to be the team to beat after Friday\u2019s practice sessions but conditions on Sunday morning were quite different. Clear, dry but still windy, Vettel commented after qualifying that he felt his Ferrari was almost glued to the long-radius corners of Suzuka and that he only needed his brake once.</p> <p>How do you see the race panning out?

      "bodyText": "Updated 2019 driver standings: 1. Hamilton - 338 2. Bottas - 274 3. Leclerc - 223 4. Verstappen - 212 5. Vettel - 212 This means only Bottas can catch Hamilton, meaning Mercedes have won a record sixth consecutive constructors\u2019 and drivers\u2019 championship double. The 1-2-3 - Bottas, Vettel, Hamilton - are now on the podium. Bottas is all smiles, less so Hamilton but surely it\u2019s a matter of when, not, if he wraps up another drivers\u2019 title. Bottas was at his opportunistic best but this was a race of lost opportunity for Vettel and indeed Ferrari. That slow start will haunt Vettel after starting in pole position and the case is not closed on Leclerc\u2019s involvement in that early scrimmage with Verstappen. But congratulations to Mercedes on yet another title. Thanks for your company. It\u2019s been fun. Valtteri Bottas after becoming the first driver to win at Suzuka from the second row: \u201cI am very happy. Starting third here is never easy but no point ever giving up on anything. I knew anything is possible and the opportunities were there today. The first one was at the start and I had a really nice start. Obviously Sebastian had an issue so I managed to get in the lead. The pace was super good and I could really control the race. I really enjoyed it. Had fun.\u201d \u201cOh, oh, oh yeees!,\u201d Bottas says down the line to his team. That fast start from third on the grid, where he overtook pole-sitter Vettel at the first bend, was decisive. And he never looked back. Mercedes win their sixth consecutive constructors\u2019 championship. Ferrari owned qualifying, but it was all Mercedes when it was show time. Lap 53/53: Perez crashes out at the \u2018S\u2019 curves, costing Leclerc a shot at the fastest lap. Bottas well out in front and Vettel is holding Hamilton at bay. Lap 52/53: More power for Vettel and now Hamilton is calling on his team for the same. The gap between second and third is now 0.67 secs. Hamilton\u2019s rear tyres look shot. Lap 51/53: The traffic ahead isn\u2019t helping Vettel. Hamilton is within two car lengths of the Ferrari driver. Bottas now 14 secs out in front. Lap 50/53: Bottas now 12 secs in front of Vettel, who holds a 0.5 secs buffer over Hamilton. Can he keep the Mercedes man at bay? Lap 49/53: Albon sits in fourth and Sainz in fifth after Leclerc\u2019s pit stop. Hamilton still eyeing that gap to take Vettel. Lap 48/53: Hamilton is tempted to try to pass Vettel but thinks better of it. The battle is on for second, with Bottas in glorious isolation out in front. Lap 47/53: Hamilton now just 0.67 secs behind Vettel, who looks to be labouring on the medium tyres. Leclerc now pits, with his team looking to bag the fastest lap. Lap 46/53: Ricciardo takes Stroll into eighth place. If nobody betters Hamilton\u2019s fastest lap, and nothing untoward happens to theri drives in the final few laps, the constructors\u2019 championship will be Mercedes\u2019. Lap 45/53: Hamilton now owns the fastest lap of the race and is closing on Vettel with a 1-2 Mercedes finish in his sights. Lap 44/53: Leclerc talking to his team, saying he doesn\u2019t want to pit again. Hamilton to finish the race on soft tyres. Vettel is on the mediums. Bottas leads by 10.5 secs. Lap 42/53: Ricciardo takes Perez into 10th. Bottas closing the gap on Hamilton, who now pits. Team instruction? The world champion emerges from the pits 5.3 secs behind Vettel and 15.3 secs behind the leader, Bottas. Lap 41/53: Mercedes need to outscore Ferrari by 14 points to secure another constructors\u2019 championship and as things stand they will do so today. Lap 40/53: Leclerc has left Gasly for dead in seventh place. He\u2019s now 5.6 secs behind Sainz in fifth. Lap 39/53: Verstappen apoplectic after the early collision that saw him retire from the race. Says he likes tough racing but basically accused Leclerc of irresponsible driving. Hamilton 9 secs in front of Bottas. Does he stay out there and try to win it? Lap 38/53: Bottas back onto the soft tyres after that pit stop. \u201cTell me what I need to do to win this race,\u201d Hamilton asks his team. Beat your teammate, it would seem. Fifteen laps to go. Lap 37/53: Bottas does head into the pits. Nice work by the team and he resurfaces still in front of Vettel. Bottas just under 10 secs behind Hamilton after that pit stop. Lap 36/53: Leclerc takes Gasly into sixth place. A daring and brilliant move. But it\u2019s all about Bottas to this point, 13.5 secs ahead of Hamilton and almost 30 in front on Vettel. But a pit stop looms for the leader. Lap 34/53: Leclerc is driving like a man possessed after that early incident and is now in seventh place. Gasly is in his sights. Ricciardo in 11th after being the last man to pit. Lap 33/53: The top seven drivers are all on the medium tyres. Hamilton is reporting that his tyres are still good. Bottas now 13.3 secs out in front, with Vettel 20 secs back in third after his latest pit stop. Lap 32/53: Leclerc into ninth place now, just 10 seconds behind Gasly in sixth. Vettel is now in the pits. Hamilton stays out on the track for now. Lap 30/53: Leclerc weaves his way into 11th place. Ricciardo finally heads to the pits, resuming the race with softs. Lap 29/53: Hulkenberg takes Perez into 9th place, underlining a good day for Renault. Hamilton seems unhappy with team strategy today, constantly questioning his team. Albon into fourth after Sainz\u2019s stop. Lap 28/53: Sainz onto the mediums, which he\u2019ll hope will last him. Leclerc back in 12th having gone a soft-medium-soft combination. Bottas still 11 secs out in front, with Hamilton 7 secs further back. Lap 26/53: Norris looks to be going backwards in 11th after that incident with Albon. Leclerc in the pits again and he emerges with the soft tyres. Will that last him to the end? Unlikely. Sainz now heads to the pits, leaving Ricciardo and Kyvat as the only in the top 10 yet to pit. Lap 25/53: Hamilton on the medium tyres now but this race looks like Bottas\u2019s to lose. Sainz driving well in fourth but Albon has him in his sights. Lap 23/53: With a pit stop each, Bottas leads Vettel by 11.7 secs with a further 9.5 secs back to Hamilton. Hamilton complaining to team about the time he has lost. Mercedes are banking on Vettel taking another stop. Lap 22/53: Hamilton now in the pits, his tyres deteriorating. No action on the Norris-Albon incident. The Leclerc-Verstappen collision to be looked at after the race. Lap 21/53: Ricciardo driving very well in fifth after starting from 16th on the grid with medium tyres. Lap 19/53: Vettel zips past Sainz into third place following his pit stop. Hamilton, who hasn\u2019t stopped yet, leads Bottas by 6.8 secs and Vettel by 10.8 secs. Now the quickest lap of the race belongs to Bottas. Lap 18/53: Bottas heads to the pits. He emerges with the medium tyres. Albon has just clocked the quickest lap. Lap 17/53: Bottas now 7 secs in front of Vettel. That fast start is paying dividends. Vettel in the pits. He\u2019s keeping the red tyres. Lap 15/53: Mercedes on the radio to Hamilton.They think Vettel will be pitting soon and they may make a strategic pit stop themselves. Verstappen now out of the race after that early collision. Lap 13/53: Albon in 5th for Red Bull, no doubt to the cheers of the locals. Bottas now 4.1 secs ahead of Vettel, who is now only 1.8 secs ahead of Hamilton. Leclerc takes Raikkonen into 14th place. No case for Vettel to answer after a possible false start. It was just very slow! Lap 12/53: The two Mercedes are clocking the quickest laps with Vettel in between them. Leclerc up to 15th, weaving his way through the field. Can he stay on without another stop? Lap 11/53: Leclerc now on the mediums after his pit stop. Verstappen struggling in 17th after that contact with the Ferrari driver. The two Mercedes drivers are sandwiching Vettel with a big gap to Sainz in fourth. Lap 9/53: Leclerc takes Verstappen with a minimum of fuss. No contact this time. These Ferraris are so quick. The two Renaults are 8th and 10th on the medium tyres. Good effort after showing very little in qualifying. Lap 8/53: Leclerc 33 secs behind Bottas in 17th after his early pit stop. It\u2019s unlikely the investigation will look fondly on his part in the ding with Verstappen. Lap 7/53: Bottas 2.4 secs ahead of Vettel, 5.2 secs ahead of Hamilton and 12.8 secs ahead of Sainz. Tough luck for Verstappen - that prang with Leclerc was not his fault. And now there WILL be an investigation. Lap 6/53: Norris is into the pits, saying he we was forced off by Albon. Verstappen moves ever so slowly into 16th. Bottas driving comfortably out in front. Lap 4/53: And now Leclerc is off, promoting Sainz to fourth. If it\u2019s a one-track stop for Leclerc, might not be the end of the world. There will be no investigation into the coming together between Verstappen and Leclerc, much to the former\u2019s chagrin. Lap 3/53: Hamilton is complaining of his vision being affected by the wing damage of Leclerc. The champ can\u2019t believe the Ferrari driver hasn\u2019t been ordered off the track. Lap 2/53: Leclerc is being encouraged to stay on and see how he goes. Bottas keeps his lead from Vettel, Leclerc and Hamilton. Terrible start for Vettel, who is immediately passed by Bottas. Wing damage for Leclerc after a tussle with Verstappen, who spins off the track. Leclerc in third but is staying on the track despite reporting damage to his team. Incredible opening to this race! OK, we are just moments away from the start ... hold on tight. It\u2019s formation lap time. All drivers from the top 10 on the grid are using soft tyres. Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto is sporting a grin that would make the Joker look straight faced: \u201cWe are very happy. Suzuka is a difficult circuit but it is now five poles in a row.\u201d As for team tactics, with two drivers on the front row, Binotto isn\u2019t giving much away: \u201cNothing sophisticated. We are simply trying to do our best. It\u2019s good to start ahead but the race will be difficult.\u201d The Japanese fans are out in force at Suzuka, no doubt many of them Honda fans and hoping for a Red Bull victory. Incredible that both Red Bull drivers clocked 1\u201927.851 in qualifying. The strong winds at Suzuka played their part in qualifying and will likely do so in the race. At present, it\u2019s a strong tailwind down the straight to the line with a headwind into the \u2018S\u2019 Curves and down the back straight into the Spoon Curve. How will that shape the tactics of both the Ferrari and Mercedes teams? At any rate, cannot wait to see how Vettel handles pole position after his antics in Sochi. No doubt his intention will be to never see a car from lap 1 through to 53. Incredibly, and ominously perhaps for Mercedes, this Suzuka track has never produced a winner from the second row. What of Mercedes? The general consensus is that Suzuka is tailor-made for the car but their bid for a sixth straight win in the Japanese GP - they haven\u2019t lost at Suzuka in the hybrid engine era - looks less than straightforward now after Ferrari\u2019s tour de force in qualifying. Still, the Silver Arrows will have their own plans with both Bottas and Hamilton enjoying an unobstructed view of their Ferrari rivals on the grid. And they\u2019ll need them. Around 0.3 secs clear of their rivals through practice, the gap was turned on its head in qualifying with Hamilton 0.238 secs behind the best that Vettel could muster. Hamilton\u2019s win in Russia strengthened his grip on the title but he can\u2019t wrap up his sixth drivers\u2019 championship today. It is possible, however, for the champ to eliminate everyone bar Bottas from contention heading to Mexico. Vettel is one of four men mathematically in the hunt of running down Hamilton, but he is a whopping 128 points in arrears of the Brit. Bottas (73 points behind Hamilton), Leclerc (107) and Max Verstappen (110) are the others. As for Mercedes, they can equal Ferrari\u2019s record of six consecutive constructors\u2019 championships at Suzuka if they outscore the Scuderia by 14 points. The stage is set for an epic race. 1 Vettel 2 Leclerc 3 Bottas 4 Hamilton 5 Verstappen 6 Albon 7 Sainz Jr 8 Norris 9 Gasly 10 Grosjean 11 Giovinazzi 12 Stroll 13 R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen 14 Kyvat 15 Hulkenberg 16 Ricciardo 17 Perez 18 Russell 19 Magnussen 20 Kubica Lights out: 4.10pm (AEDT) Good afternoon, sports fans. Welcome to a Sunday at Suzuka that, thanks to Typhoon Hagibis, can only be described as super. This is just the fifth time in Formula One history that qualifying and the race has been held on the same day. And the morning\u2019s action didn\u2019t disappoint, whetting the appetite for what should be a fascinating race. Qualifying belonged solely to Ferrari, the Scuderia locking out the front row with Sebastian Vettel to start from pole ahead of Charles Leclerc. It\u2019s Ferrari\u2019s fifth successive pole position, a feat they haven\u2019t achieved since 2001 and something that will be even more satisfying after the dominance of Mercedes in practice. The Mercedes duo of Valtteri Bottas and Lewis Hamilton will start on the second row. Ferrari\u2019s tactics this afternoon will be fascinating after the meltdown of Sochi. Regardless, the simmering rivalry between Leclerc and Vettel is now compulsory viewing. Prior to Japan, Leclerc had outqualified Vettel in the past nine GPs and following qualifying Damon Hill suggested to Leclerc that he had awoken the beast inside Vettel. Certainly, the rise of the Mon\u00e9gasque driver has given rise to the theory that Vettel is fast becoming yesterday\u2019s man. That train of thought has been derailed after qualifying and, if anything, Vettel can thank his teammate for stirring the competitive juices. Mercedes looked to be the team to beat after Friday\u2019s practice sessions but conditions on Sunday morning were quite different. Clear, dry but still windy, Vettel commented after qualifying that he felt his Ferrari was almost glued to the long-radius corners of Suzuka and that he only needed his brake once.

This is the question being asked across the art world about the Salvator Mundi - the first Leonardo to be discovered for more than a century - as the Louvre prepares for its blockbuster da Vinci exhibition. With just under two weeks to go before the show opens, there are now serious doubts as to whether the star of the exhibition will be included, as the Paris museum had hoped. The world\u2019s most expensive painting, a depiction of Jesus in Renaissance dress, which sold at auction in 2017 for $450m, would draw huge crowds. Described as a devotional counterpart to the Mona Lisa, Leonardo\u2019s most famous work, it is said to have an \u201cextraordinary, communicative presence\u201d.

A New York art historian and dealer, Robert B Simon, bought it from a New Orleans auction house for just $1,175 in 2005 and it was attributed to Leonardo in 2011. \u201cThere are a host of reasons why I believe 100% in Leonardo\u2019s authorship of the Salvator Mundi \u2013 most of all the inimitable style, unique iconography and phenomenal quality of the painting,\u201d Simon told the Observer. \u201cTo these one could add the peculiarities of Leonardo\u2019s technique, the relationship of the painting to autograph drawings, and the evidence of the work\u2019s history.

Sotheby\u2019s, which did not return requests for comment, contests the claims, as does Bouvier. The extraordinary alacrity with which the painting\u2019s value sky-rocketed, and the opaque circumstances surrounding its sale and ownership, have prompted calls for the art market to be more heavily regulated.

Starmer has made clear he would campaign to Remain in a second referendum. The 19 MPs are now coming under intense pressure both from party whips and colleagues not to help Johnson get a deal across the line \u2013 something many believe would allow him to enter a general election having defused the threat from the Brexit party and in a strong position to form a majority.

      "body": "<p>Look up! Is that a kestrel? A swallow? Take note. These sightings are getting rarer. A recent RSPB report blamed the climate crisis for dwindling bird numbers in the UK. But as the number of birds decreases, the number of young bird enthusiasts in the UK is on the rise. Birdwatchers have long endured an unfair reputation for being anorak-sporting \u201ctwitchers\u201d, lumped into the same category as their equally derided cousins, the trainspotters. But times have changed. Now, as a young person, it is becoming acceptable \u2013 cool, even \u2013 to show the world the mental and physical benefits of getting outside and observing wildlife.</p> <p>Today, young \u201cbirders\u201d are using social-media platforms to form positive communities and share their sightings and experiences. Amusingly, most of it happens on Twitter, where birders pledge allegiance to certain species in their bios and discuss rare species with some of the world\u2019s foremost experts. They use apps and spreadsheets, often photographing their finds and uploading pictures to their social channels instantly. Instagram accounts have been created. WhatsApp groups have formed.</p> <p>Offline, young birders gather at wetland centres, hold meet-ups in areas of natural beauty, organise hiking excursions. They offer each other tremendous support and subscribe to the same defining message: that anyone can birdwatch anywhere. All you need is a pair of eyes and a desire to go outside.</p> <h2>Mya-Rose Craig, 17,<em> </em>Somerset</h2> <p>I\u2019ve been going out birdwatching with my family since I was a baby. It was OK during primary school, but when I went into secondary I very quickly realised that birdwatching is strange. I\u2019d avoid talking about it like the plague. If any of my primary school friends brought it up, I\u2019d change the conversation very swiftly. Like most 13-year-olds, I didn\u2019t know how to deal with being different from other people, but as I\u2019ve got older I don\u2019t care any more. You should never stop doing what you love because of other people. It helps that I\u2019m friends with people who appreciate going outside and going into nature.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"42f187ab6ce075eee4f92caa9549f9e66f709108\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42f187ab6ce075eee4f92caa9549f9e66f709108/288_1679_4737_5922/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Going outside is my version of meditation\u2019: Mya-Rose Craig.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Going outside is my version of meditation\u2019: Mya-Rose Craig.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Peters/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I am now just over 100 bird species away from having seen half of all of the bird species in the world. I\u2019ve been going out birdwatching with my family since I was a baby. It\u2019s something that\u2019s very important in my life, and I can\u2019t really picture myself without it. But I\u2019m one of the lucky ones, you know? Most people don\u2019t have parents who take them out birdwatching for the weekend.</p> <p>I enjoy the separation from everyday life, I find it really relaxing. Loads of people I talk to always go on about meditating, but I just can\u2019t do it, because my brain goes very fast all the time. Going outside is my version of meditation. It\u2019s something that\u2019s integral to me. I\u2019ve recently been visiting potential universities and greenery has been a factor in that. Sheffield has got so many trees and parks everywhere, and it felt really nice.</p> <p>With the rise of the youth strikes, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greta-thunberg\" title=\"\">Greta Thunberg</a>, the last nine months have been amazing. Everything\u2019s just suddenly taking off, after not much happening for years and years. It\u2019s been encouraging seeing older people join the movement. I\u2019m in a group chat with loads of climate activists, and sometimes, if I feel a bit hopeless, I like to go on there and see how passionate and motivated everyone is to create change.</p> <h2>Sam Marsh, 9, Wales</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"2df20b187d4eedd5a93fdc0f5e4f09e07b59d53d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2df20b187d4eedd5a93fdc0f5e4f09e07b59d53d/0_748_7668_4601/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I want to be a naturalist when I\u2019m older\u2019: Sam Marsh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I want to be a naturalist when I\u2019m older\u2019: Sam Marsh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Peters/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My Granny and Bampa are really into birdwatching. They travel all over the world and they\u2019re always on the lookout for feathers and different birds to bring back for me. My favourite is the <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/white-tailed-eagle/\" title=\"\">white-tailed eagle</a> feather: it\u2019s about a foot and a half long, and stiff \u2013 like wood. Gran found it in Norway. And pheasant feathers, which I like for their patterns, and how flexible they are. I\u2019ve got about 20 altogether. I find them stuck in trees, or in dense forest, where they can\u2019t really blow around.</p> <p>We do a lot of hiking and walking. I take my book and my binoculars, which used to belong to my grandfather when he was in the army, and I see what I can spot, and when I get home I look them up online and see what they are. Or I look in my bird book, or on an app called <a href=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/seek_app\" title=\"\">Seek</a>. I want to be a naturalist when I am older, to look at animals, go to different countries, go on telly, tell people how they hunt, how they make their dens, stuff like that. And I\u2019d like to learn more about nature at school. I\u2019ve got dyslexia and I struggle with reading, so I prefer to be out looking at things.</p> <h2>Amelia Bradbury, 9, Norfolk</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"3b8e3b20b94213483f758689bed0116f1ae81dec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b8e3b20b94213483f758689bed0116f1ae81dec/0_246_8223_4934/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I\u2019d like to see a snowy owl, or a little owl, in the wild.

It\u2019s a salt and freshwater marsh and nature reserve, and it attracts loads of different waders and birds.

Sometimes we stop the car when we\u2019re driving, if we see a kestrel. We always keep binoculars in the car just in case. I\u2019d like to see a snowy owl, or a little owl, in the wild. And I\u2019d like to see a <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/green-woodpecker/\" title=\"\">green woodpecker</a>. My mum saw two recently, but I wasn\u2019t with her.</p> <p>I record my sightings on a spreadsheet on my dad\u2019s phone and I\u2019ve got my own little notebook, too. I have \u201ccollected\u201d more than 120 bird species so far. I can tell birds apart quite easily \u2013 they look different, obviously, and they also have different calls. Sometimes I can hear a bird and know what it is. I like the sounds that owls make, and the blackbird\u2019s song, which is probably my favourite. But I also like the woodpigeon\u2019s call. Sometimes I like to draw what I see, and at other times I just draw other random animals.</p> <p>Anyone can look for birds. Or insects. Go and start in the back garden and work your way out to somewhere else. Look at all the birds and all the insects and try to find some interesting stuff. People seem to <em>see</em> nature, but they don\u2019t always appreciate it. Often, we\u2019re all too busy minding our own business.</p> <p>Most people in my class like video games. I like some video games, too! But I think a lot of kids would enjoy birdwatching, if they just tried.</p> <h2>Kabir Kaul, 14, Hillingdon</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"4ff0ba7cf7e061ebed3ba956a7ca7f2b1c52085f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ff0ba7cf7e061ebed3ba956a7ca7f2b1c52085f/0_668_7262_4357/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It\u2019s all there on your doorstep, this is why I created an interactive map\u2019: Kabir Kaul.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s all there on your doorstep, this is why I created an interactive map\u2019: Kabir Kaul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Peters/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For most of my life I have lived in Eastcote, in the London borough of Hillingdon. When I was about seven or eight I looked outside the window and saw lots of pigeons and robins and sparrows, and I thought: \u201cLet me explore more.\u201d So I got some binoculars, and my uncle bought me a field guide for my 10th birthday, and I just went out to discover the local area.</p> <p>I realised from a young age that I like nature and wildlife from around the world, but I only started to develop an interest in the wildlife in Britain when I actually looked outside and I realised the wildlife around me was mainly birds. That\u2019s how I got into birdwatching. What most people don\u2019t realise is that everything is hiding in plain sight: it\u2019s all just there, on your doorstep. This is partly why I created an interactive map, <a href=\"http://thekauliswild.blogspot.com/p/nature-reserves-of-london-2nd-edition.html\" title=\"\">Nature Reserves of London</a>. It shows all designated wildlife sites and nature reserves around and throughout the capital, and reveals how much biodiversity there really is.</p> <p>I think if you live in an inner city, or a built-up place, you just have to look harder. Look at the trees, see if there are ants. And if there are, maybe there\u2019s a blackbird. I\u2019ve been surprised to see <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/waxwing/\" title=\"\">waxwings</a> in Wimbledon.</p> <p>For young children, I\u2019d suggest they get involved with local organisations, or some grassroots projects nearby \u2013 maybe an allotment site or a city farm. They might not even have a garden, but if they have a balcony, they could maybe make a pond by filling up an old container with water and putting plants in it. Or they could make bird feeders or nest boxes to hang from the outside of their house. It\u2019s all to do with passion, and the will to do it.</p> <p>I only have one or two friends at school who are as interested in birding as me. But birdwatching is so calming. It\u2019s wonderful to see the birds and the colours of their plumage and their different sizes and to hear their song.</p> <p>If people who suffer from mental health issues \u2013 or people who are on their phones all the time and they don\u2019t notice their surroundings \u2013 actually go outside and look at the trees and hear the birdsong, they will automatically just feel better because they\u2019ll be at one with nature.

      "bodyText": "Look up! Is that a kestrel? A swallow? Take note. These sightings are getting rarer. A recent RSPB report blamed the climate crisis for dwindling bird numbers in the UK. But as the number of birds decreases, the number of young bird enthusiasts in the UK is on the rise. Birdwatchers have long endured an unfair reputation for being anorak-sporting \u201ctwitchers\u201d, lumped into the same category as their equally derided cousins, the trainspotters. But times have changed. Now, as a young person, it is becoming acceptable \u2013 cool, even \u2013 to show the world the mental and physical benefits of getting outside and observing wildlife. Today, young \u201cbirders\u201d are using social-media platforms to form positive communities and share their sightings and experiences. Amusingly, most of it happens on Twitter, where birders pledge allegiance to certain species in their bios and discuss rare species with some of the world\u2019s foremost experts. They use apps and spreadsheets, often photographing their finds and uploading pictures to their social channels instantly. Instagram accounts have been created. WhatsApp groups have formed. Offline, young birders gather at wetland centres, hold meet-ups in areas of natural beauty, organise hiking excursions. They offer each other tremendous support and subscribe to the same defining message: that anyone can birdwatch anywhere. All you need is a pair of eyes and a desire to go outside. Mya-Rose Craig, 17, Somerset I\u2019ve been going out birdwatching with my family since I was a baby. It was OK during primary school, but when I went into secondary I very quickly realised that birdwatching is strange. I\u2019d avoid talking about it like the plague. If any of my primary school friends brought it up, I\u2019d change the conversation very swiftly. Like most 13-year-olds, I didn\u2019t know how to deal with being different from other people, but as I\u2019ve got older I don\u2019t care any more. You should never stop doing what you love because of other people. It helps that I\u2019m friends with people who appreciate going outside and going into nature. I am now just over 100 bird species away from having seen half of all of the bird species in the world. I\u2019ve been going out birdwatching with my family since I was a baby. It\u2019s something that\u2019s very important in my life, and I can\u2019t really picture myself without it. But I\u2019m one of the lucky ones, you know? Most people don\u2019t have parents who take them out birdwatching for the weekend. I enjoy the separation from everyday life, I find it really relaxing. Loads of people I talk to always go on about meditating, but I just can\u2019t do it, because my brain goes very fast all the time. Going outside is my version of meditation. It\u2019s something that\u2019s integral to me. I\u2019ve recently been visiting potential universities and greenery has been a factor in that. Sheffield has got so many trees and parks everywhere, and it felt really nice. With the rise of the youth strikes, and Greta Thunberg, the last nine months have been amazing. Everything\u2019s just suddenly taking off, after not much happening for years and years. It\u2019s been encouraging seeing older people join the movement. I\u2019m in a group chat with loads of climate activists, and sometimes, if I feel a bit hopeless, I like to go on there and see how passionate and motivated everyone is to create change. Sam Marsh, 9, Wales My Granny and Bampa are really into birdwatching. They travel all over the world and they\u2019re always on the lookout for feathers and different birds to bring back for me. My favourite is the white-tailed eagle feather: it\u2019s about a foot and a half long, and stiff \u2013 like wood. Gran found it in Norway. And pheasant feathers, which I like for their patterns, and how flexible they are. I\u2019ve got about 20 altogether. I find them stuck in trees, or in dense forest, where they can\u2019t really blow around. We do a lot of hiking and walking. I take my book and my binoculars, which used to belong to my grandfather when he was in the army, and I see what I can spot, and when I get home I look them up online and see what they are. Or I look in my bird book, or on an app called Seek. I want to be a naturalist when I am older, to look at animals, go to different countries, go on telly, tell people how they hunt, how they make their dens, stuff like that. And I\u2019d like to learn more about nature at school. I\u2019ve got dyslexia and I struggle with reading, so I prefer to be out looking at things. Amelia Bradbury, 9, Norfolk As a family, we\u2019ve always enjoyed the outdoors. Every Sunday we go to volunteer and birdwatch at Cley Marshes nature reserve, in Norfolk. It\u2019s a salt and freshwater marsh and nature reserve, and it attracts loads of different waders and birds. We have seen shelducks, mallards, avocets, black-tailed godwits, redshanks, lots of different sandpipers\u2026 At home we see buzzards, kestrels and sometimes red kites. I look everywhere for birds. Sometimes we stop the car when we\u2019re driving, if we see a kestrel. We always keep binoculars in the car just in case. I\u2019d like to see a snowy owl, or a little owl, in the wild. And I\u2019d like to see a green woodpecker. My mum saw two recently, but I wasn\u2019t with her. I record my sightings on a spreadsheet on my dad\u2019s phone and I\u2019ve got my own little notebook, too. I have \u201ccollected\u201d more than 120 bird species so far. I can tell birds apart quite easily \u2013 they look different, obviously, and they also have different calls. Sometimes I can hear a bird and know what it is. I like the sounds that owls make, and the blackbird\u2019s song, which is probably my favourite. But I also like the woodpigeon\u2019s call. Sometimes I like to draw what I see, and at other times I just draw other random animals. Anyone can look for birds. Or insects. Go and start in the back garden and work your way out to somewhere else. Look at all the birds and all the insects and try to find some interesting stuff. People seem to see nature, but they don\u2019t always appreciate it. Often, we\u2019re all too busy minding our own business. Most people in my class like video games. I like some video games, too! But I think a lot of kids would enjoy birdwatching, if they just tried. Kabir Kaul, 14, Hillingdon For most of my life I have lived in Eastcote, in the London borough of Hillingdon. When I was about seven or eight I looked outside the window and saw lots of pigeons and robins and sparrows, and I thought: \u201cLet me explore more.\u201d So I got some binoculars, and my uncle bought me a field guide for my 10th birthday, and I just went out to discover the local area. I realised from a young age that I like nature and wildlife from around the world, but I only started to develop an interest in the wildlife in Britain when I actually looked outside and I realised the wildlife around me was mainly birds. That\u2019s how I got into birdwatching. What most people don\u2019t realise is that everything is hiding in plain sight: it\u2019s all just there, on your doorstep. This is partly why I created an interactive map, Nature Reserves of London. It shows all designated wildlife sites and nature reserves around and throughout the capital, and reveals how much biodiversity there really is. I think if you live in an inner city, or a built-up place, you just have to look harder. Look at the trees, see if there are ants. And if there are, maybe there\u2019s a blackbird. I\u2019ve been surprised to see waxwings in Wimbledon. For young children, I\u2019d suggest they get involved with local organisations, or some grassroots projects nearby \u2013 maybe an allotment site or a city farm. They might not even have a garden, but if they have a balcony, they could maybe make a pond by filling up an old container with water and putting plants in it.

      "body": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.gatetheatre.co.uk/whats-on/mephisto-a-rhapsody/\">Mephisto [A Rhapsody] </a></strong>is one of the most thought-provoking and enjoyable pieces of theatre I have seen in a long while. It was inspired by Klaus Mann\u2019s 1936 novel, which was itself based on the true story of Mann\u2019s fecklessly amoral brother-in-law, Gustaf Gr\u00fcndgens, an actor who sold his soul to the Nazis. The last line of the novel is a feeble petition: \u201cWhat do men want from me? Why do they pursue me? Why are they so hard? All I am is a perfectly ordinary actor.\u201d The French playwright Samuel Gallet has used this as his departure for <em>Mephisto </em><em>[A Rhapsody]</em> and given his story a contemporary context, setting it in the invented provincial town of Balbek.</p> <p>The play examines artistic morality: should theatre lead a charmed life? Can an actor travel light, afford to be neutral about local and global politics with the failsafe excuse that he is acting? In a world menaced by the new right, is it acceptable to shelter within (to take just one example) Chekhov\u2019s <em>The Cherry Orchard</em>? The answer to this, and heftier questions, is never as simple as you might suppose.</p> <p>This bracing show has been translated by Chris Campbell and tailored for an English-speaking audience by the remarkable Kirsty Housley (she describes herself as a theatre maker rather than a director). Her work fizzes with ideas (look out for her ingeniously stylised take on how to use stage blood). Serious without being worthy, the play is excruciatingly pertinent \u2013 especially in its exploration of nationalistic feeling. There is no stage, only a margin of red carpeted floor with mirrors behind (designer Basia Bi\u0144kowska). We see our reflections and wonder: who is watching who?</p> <p>Leo Bill is brilliant as Aymeric Dupr\u00e9, an actor whose deep self-interest is not altogether camouflaged by his nervous, ingratiating manner or his energetic stutter. No matter how over the top his rave reviews, Aymeric\u2019s invariable response when they are read aloud to him is: \u201cAny more?\u201d</p> <p>In a first-rate cast, Rebecca Humphries is marvellous as his principled lover, Barbara, and Elizabeth Chan vivid as his uncompromising and, eventually, scandalised colleague Luca. And Anna-Maria Nabirye splendidly uncorks the second half with a devastating monologue about the way black actors are typecast and allocated cameos in which to show off their singing voices. She makes the point powerfully \u2013 then sings. Everything, she tells us, is \u201cpolitical\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s wonderful to see the Gate, which holds no more than 75 people, back on top form, doing the sort of work it does best.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhuitaDBGfI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OhuitaDBGfI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhuitaDBGfI\">Watch a trailer for Mephisto [A Rhapsody].</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Peter Nichols\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://joeeggplay.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIpurP-7KR5QIVhbHtCh07ygdrEAAYAiAAEgJor_D_BwE\" title=\"\">A Day in the Death of Joe Egg</a> </strong>(1967) is a comfortless play about a couple with a disabled daughter. Directed with conviction by Simon Evans, it is full of uneasy jokes; but Nichols is there before you with the question: \u201cIsn\u2019t there a point where the joke starts using you?\u201d</p> <p>Toby Stephens is superb as the complicated Bri, an aggrieved schoolteacher who berates his class (the audience). At home, he\u2019s attention-starved and pesters his wife with his amorous japes \u2013 a fall guy who seems to take up too much space in his own front room.</p> <p>Claire Skinner, who played a delightfully dizzy mother in the TV series <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/01/how-we-made-outnumbered-claire-skinner-interview\" title=\"\">Outnumbered</a></em>, skilfully revisits motherhood. When we first meet her, she has an air of suburban preoccupation and we can fool ourselves we are at the start of an inconsequential comedy \u2013 until Joe enters in a wheelchair, dressed like a speechless grownup baby in a knitted pink cardigan.</p> <p>Joe\u2019s desperate parents amuse themselves by putting words into her mouth. She interrupts them with painful groans. She is often talked about as though she were more turnip than human being. The best thing about this production is that Joe is played by an actor with cerebral palsy (the first time in the West End that the role has been taken on by a disabled actor). It is particularly uplifting hearing Storme Toolis, at the end of the first act, break free from her role \u2013 she has a lovely speaking voice \u2013 to tell us the interval has arrived.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ce2dac8c54c45a9e159a07a29b423b9d869c3ef4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce2dac8c54c45a9e159a07a29b423b9d869c3ef4/0_0_5553_3124/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Claire Skinner, Toby Stephens and Storme Toolis in A Day in the Death of Joe Egg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claire Skinner, Toby Stephens and Storme Toolis in A Day in the Death of Joe Egg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Brenner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You need whatever cheer you can muster to soldier on with this play. In spite of Nichols\u2019s consummate ability, I resist his view of humanity, his low expectations of his characters. Any compassion in the play is compromised. Love itself seems disabled. (Is that his point?) When Sheila calls her daughter \u201cBlossom\u201d, she sounds like a patronising nurse. Her thought that \u201ceveryone is damaged in some way\u201d is left to dangle uselessly.</p> <p>At least Nichols gets comic mileage out of Bri\u2019s mother, Grace. Patricia Hodge is a star turn, talking in an unstoppably boring stream to rival Jane Austen\u2019s Miss Bates in <em>Emma</em>. The play is set at Christmas \u2013 in a depressing, paper-chained living room, designed by Peter McKintosh. And it quickly becomes clear, metaphorically at least, that the paper chains cannot hold.</p> <p>Written and directed by Sean Foley, <strong><a href=\"https://www.delfontmackintosh.co.uk/tickets/the-man-in-the-white-suit/\" title=\"\">The Man in the White Suit</a> </strong>is based on the much-loved 1951 Ealing comedy starring Alec Guinness. Michael Taylor\u2019s impressive, no-expense-spared set looks variously like a Lowry painting, a mad scientist\u2019s laboratory and a baronial house. It even features a flashy red MG with footage of disappearing road behind it. It\u2019s a theatrical farce that sings so hard for its supper (including skiffle songs by Charlie Fink, played by Matthew Durkan) that it seems churlish to be underwhelmed. But the flimsy narrative has nowhere near enough tension to keep one interested.

      "bodyText": "Mephisto [A Rhapsody] is one of the most thought-provoking and enjoyable pieces of theatre I have seen in a long while. It was inspired by Klaus Mann\u2019s 1936 novel, which was itself based on the true story of Mann\u2019s fecklessly amoral brother-in-law, Gustaf Gr\u00fcndgens, an actor who sold his soul to the Nazis. The last line of the novel is a feeble petition: \u201cWhat do men want from me? Why do they pursue me? Why are they so hard? All I am is a perfectly ordinary actor.\u201d The French playwright Samuel Gallet has used this as his departure for Mephisto [A Rhapsody] and given his story a contemporary context, setting it in the invented provincial town of Balbek. The play examines artistic morality: should theatre lead a charmed life? Can an actor travel light, afford to be neutral about local and global politics with the failsafe excuse that he is acting? In a world menaced by the new right, is it acceptable to shelter within (to take just one example) Chekhov\u2019s The Cherry Orchard? The answer to this, and heftier questions, is never as simple as you might suppose. This bracing show has been translated by Chris Campbell and tailored for an English-speaking audience by the remarkable Kirsty Housley (she describes herself as a theatre maker rather than a director). Her work fizzes with ideas (look out for her ingeniously stylised take on how to use stage blood). Serious without being worthy, the play is excruciatingly pertinent \u2013 especially in its exploration of nationalistic feeling. There is no stage, only a margin of red carpeted floor with mirrors behind (designer Basia Bi\u0144kowska). We see our reflections and wonder: who is watching who? Leo Bill is brilliant as Aymeric Dupr\u00e9, an actor whose deep self-interest is not altogether camouflaged by his nervous, ingratiating manner or his energetic stutter. No matter how over the top his rave reviews, Aymeric\u2019s invariable response when they are read aloud to him is: \u201cAny more?\u201d In a first-rate cast, Rebecca Humphries is marvellous as his principled lover, Barbara, and Elizabeth Chan vivid as his uncompromising and, eventually, scandalised colleague Luca. And Anna-Maria Nabirye splendidly uncorks the second half with a devastating monologue about the way black actors are typecast and allocated cameos in which to show off their singing voices. She makes the point powerfully \u2013 then sings. Everything, she tells us, is \u201cpolitical\u201d. It\u2019s wonderful to see the Gate, which holds no more than 75 people, back on top form, doing the sort of work it does best. Peter Nichols\u2019s A Day in the Death of Joe Egg (1967) is a comfortless play about a couple with a disabled daughter. Directed with conviction by Simon Evans, it is full of uneasy jokes; but Nichols is there before you with the question: \u201cIsn\u2019t there a point where the joke starts using you?\u201d Toby Stephens is superb as the complicated Bri, an aggrieved schoolteacher who berates his class (the audience). At home, he\u2019s attention-starved and pesters his wife with his amorous japes \u2013 a fall guy who seems to take up too much space in his own front room. Claire Skinner, who played a delightfully dizzy mother in the TV series Outnumbered, skilfully revisits motherhood. When we first meet her, she has an air of suburban preoccupation and we can fool ourselves we are at the start of an inconsequential comedy \u2013 until Joe enters in a wheelchair, dressed like a speechless grownup baby in a knitted pink cardigan. Joe\u2019s desperate parents amuse themselves by putting words into her mouth. She interrupts them with painful groans. She is often talked about as though she were more turnip than human being. The best thing about this production is that Joe is played by an actor with cerebral palsy (the first time in the West End that the role has been taken on by a disabled actor). It is particularly uplifting hearing Storme Toolis, at the end of the first act, break free from her role \u2013 she has a lovely speaking voice \u2013 to tell us the interval has arrived. You need whatever cheer you can muster to soldier on with this play. In spite of Nichols\u2019s consummate ability, I resist his view of humanity, his low expectations of his characters. Any compassion in the play is compromised. Love itself seems disabled. (Is that his point?) When Sheila calls her daughter \u201cBlossom\u201d, she sounds like a patronising nurse. Her thought that \u201ceveryone is damaged in some way\u201d is left to dangle uselessly. At least Nichols gets comic mileage out of Bri\u2019s mother, Grace. Patricia Hodge is a star turn, talking in an unstoppably boring stream to rival Jane Austen\u2019s Miss Bates in Emma. The play is set at Christmas \u2013 in a depressing, paper-chained living room, designed by Peter McKintosh. And it quickly becomes clear, metaphorically at least, that the paper chains cannot hold. Written and directed by Sean Foley, The Man in the White Suit is based on the much-loved 1951 Ealing comedy starring Alec Guinness. Michael Taylor\u2019s impressive, no-expense-spared set looks variously like a Lowry painting, a mad scientist\u2019s laboratory and a baronial house. It even features a flashy red MG with footage of disappearing road behind it. It\u2019s a theatrical farce that sings so hard for its supper (including skiffle songs by Charlie Fink, played by Matthew Durkan) that it seems churlish to be underwhelmed. But the flimsy narrative has nowhere near enough tension to keep one interested. Chemist Sidney Stratton (played with bumptious goodwill by Stephen Mangan) is on the verge of inventing an indestructible textile. It could potentially put people out of work. In the film this mattered; on stage it\u2019s no more than a pantomime obstacle. The most enjoyable moment is a dance in which slinky Kara Tointon, as the mill owner\u2019s daughter, Daphne, entangles herself with our white-suited scientist. But unless you find spontaneous explosions (fart and belch sound effects), trousers falling down and sooty noses unmissably hilarious, you\u2019d do better to head off and see Mephisto.

The occasion will not offer any clarification about Brexit, because no one will know tomorrow whether the recently more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/12/brexit-deal-prospects-look-promising-nicky-morgan\" title=\"\">optimistic noises</a> about striking a deal will amount to anything. It is possible that this will be the first Queen\u2019s speech to be voted down <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32816450\" title=\"\">since 1924</a>. That triggered an election, though it won\u2019t necessarily be the case when so many Labour MPs are tremulous about facing the voters.</p> <p>One thing I confidently expect to hear in the script put into the monarch\u2019s mouth is that \u201cmy government\u201d is going to be doing much more for public services. The Tories have suddenly started sounding like people who have discovered the joys of spending. Their recent party conference was bedecked with banners booming: \u201cInvest in our NHS, schools and police.\u201d Billions more are promised for \u201can infrastructure revolution\u201d, splashing the cash on roads and broadband. A big pay rise is dangled before low earners as the reward for voting Tory.</p> <p>The next election will be the first post-austerity election. I don\u2019t mean by this that austerity is actually over for everyone; it isn\u2019t. Nor am I trying to suggest that the extra spending promised by the Tories will repair all the damage done to public services. It won\u2019t. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/29/police-recruitment-delays-as-home-office-silent-over-funding\" title=\"\">20,000 new police officers</a> they are pledging won\u2019t replace all the numbers cut in the past 10 years.

In the first two, the Tories prevailed with their case that Labour had spent beyond the country\u2019s means and Britain had to tighten its belt. By 2017, when Theresa May called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2017/jun/08/live-uk-election-results-in-full-2017\" title=\"\">an early election</a> in an ill-fated bid to improve her majority, a lot of the public had lost patience with austerity.

The Tory leader floundered before provoking anger by responding: \u201cThere isn\u2019t a magic money tree that we can shake that suddenly provides for everything that people want.\u201d</p> <p>Memories of that, and similar doorstep encounters with aggrieved voters, prompt the Tories to now claim that they have located a lush forest of magic money trees. They are promising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/04/sajid-javid-promises-decade-renewal-sets-out-post-brexit-spending\" title=\"\">the largest annual increase in public spending in 15 years</a> and tax cuts on top. It is not hard to discern why. They are trying to cover the flanks that made Mrs May vulnerable to voter discontent in 2017. The Tories also know that they will need to replace the seats that they are likely to lose in Remain-supporting areas of the country. They hope to do this by taking Brexity constituencies in the north and Midlands represented by Labour MPs. To many of the voters that the Tories are after, state provision matters a lot and the protracted squeeze on public services has been especially painful.</p> <p>Having examined the Tory promises, Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, warns: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/08/no-deal-brexit-would-push-national-debt-to-levels-last-seen-in-60s\" title=\"\">The government is now adrift without any effective fiscal anchor</a>.\u201d The steely axemen of austerity now declare that they will spend like an inebriated sailor.

A hatred of austerity has been the signature tune of Jeremy Corbyn and yet austerity politics was the making of him in 2015 and it was the saving of him in 2017. One of the reasons <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/12/jeremy-corbyn-wins-labour-party-leadership-election\" title=\"\">he won the leadership</a> in 2015 was the widespread feeling within the party that Labour had failed to mount a sufficiently robust counter to the austerity narrative of David Cameron and George Osborne. Ed Balls and Ed Miliband, who learned their politics as proteges of Gordon Brown, were always nervous of promising very much for fear of being painted as reckless. With Mr Corbyn, it has always been a case of in for a penny, in for a billion. He used austerity to his advantage again in 2017 by changing the nature of the battle. What Mrs May had intended to be a Brexit election turned into a contest in which a lot of the argument was about what her party had done to public services.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c00b02dcde7a965f86ce21c4f095d51afe38b80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c00b02dcde7a965f86ce21c4f095d51afe38b80/0_109_2064_1238/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sajid Javid\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The chancellor, Sajid Javid: \u2018The steely axemen of austerity now declare that they will spend like an inebriated sailor.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since the Tories are always going to attack them as economically ruinous whatever they do, the Labour leader and his shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have taken the view that they might as well go large, very large, with their spending promises. Mr Corbyn is rather unlikely to join those saying that the Tory pledges are cavalier and unfulfillable because Labour is committed to spending a whole lot more. Labour\u2019s last manifesto came in at something like <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14390\" title=\"\">\u00a375bn of extra spending a year</a>. To the large number of pledges made then, including the expensive promise to scrap all university tuition fees, Labour has added a further massive heap. They came out of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/28/labour-manifesto-just-how-radical-schools-health\" title=\"\">their recent conference</a> pledged to deliver free personal care for the over-65s, more generous universal credit, an end to rough sleeping, free prescriptions for everyone, a state-owned bank and a state-owned pharma company to make cheap drugs for the NHS.

One shadow cabinet member groaned to me that he had spent going on for \u00a310bn while the party was at the seaside and barely got a headline out of it because his announcements were drowned out by the furore around the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/21/explained-attempt-to-remove-tom-watson-deputy-labour-leader\" title=\"\">botched plot to depose Tom Watson</a> and Brexit splits.</p> <p>Both parties are running significant risks. Unless Britain\u2019s economy unexpectedly starts to roar along, they are going to have a lot of trouble paying for all these promises without raising borrowing and/or hiking taxes by more than they are admitting. If Britain slides into a recession, they will find it even harder to deliver and a burst of extra spending could well be followed by another dose of austerity. And if Britain suffers a calamitously disorderly Brexit, no one\u2019s promises will be worth the manifestos they are written on.</p> <p>Then there are the electoral risks. Tory strategists are hoping that promising more for the public services will induce amnesia about the austerity years, or at least inoculate them against some of the anger.

If you pay for your prescriptions at the moment, getting them free sounds alluring. The historical problem for Labour is that wary voters have often concluded that the party\u2019s promises are too good to be true and too lavish to be deliverable. Despite everything that has happened since 2010, Labour still trails a long way behind when pollsters ask voters to rate the parties on their economic competence.</p> <p>Both will fight the coming election by promising an extravaganza of spending.

At around 11.30am, she will address the assembled peers and MPs: \u201cMy Lords and Members of the House of Commons, there now follows an election broadcast on behalf of the Conservative party.\u201d Well, probably not, but she might as well. It is always the case that the Queen is a jewel-encrusted ventriloquist\u2019s dummy for the prime minister of the day.

According to the parliamentary library, of a total of 84 individuals and groups who made submissions to a parliamentary inquiry examining the proposed repeal only the home affairs department supported the government bill.

      "body": "<p>Patti Smith and Debbie Harry went to something like rock\u2019n\u2019roll high school together, as the Ramones might have put it. But that\u2019s the only common denominator to be found in their two memoirs. New York in the 70s was a school of hard knocks, from which these fellow travellers emerged with honours of very different sorts.</p> <p>Both books are highly anticipated, however. Harry\u2019s memoir is her first, correcting an egregious absence. That one of the most famous women in pop should not have recounted her story until now is hard to believe \u2013 that is, until you start reading and learn of Harry\u2019s deep reticence at having to rake over the past. She spends a chapter discussing the marvel that is the opposable thumb, as though straining for the word count on a homework assignment.</p> <p>Patti Smith\u2019s is her third, including the award-winning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/14/just-kids-book-review\" title=\"\"><em>Just Kids</em></a> (2010), an account of her years with Robert Mapplethorpe. The slim pamphlet that is <em>Year of the </em><em>Monkey</em> covers just one lunar year in Smith\u2019s life, her 70th, which coincides with the political upheavals of 2016 and some significant endings.</p> <p>Harry\u2019s book is full of pictures of her made by other people, a gallery of fan art the singer has collected over the years, from her <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artwork/andy-warhol-debbie-harry-6\" title=\"\">Andy Warhol portrait</a> down to children\u2019s scrawls. On the page, she is far goofier than you\u2019d expect. There is a surprising matter-of-factness with which Harry discusses her face: she knows full well people masturbated to posters of her. She acknowledges the weird superpowers beauty gave her and has unapologetic surgery to preserve it.</p> <p>But there is also ambivalence towards her looks. As an adopted child, Harry resembled no one in her family; people used to say she looked \u201cEuropean\u201d. As a child, she was \u201calways afraid\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Patti Smith and Debbie Harry went to something like rock\u2019n\u2019roll high school together, as the Ramones might have put it. But that\u2019s the only common denominator to be found in their two memoirs. New York in the 70s was a school of hard knocks, from which these fellow travellers emerged with honours of very different sorts. Both books are highly anticipated, however. Harry\u2019s memoir is her first, correcting an egregious absence. That one of the most famous women in pop should not have recounted her story until now is hard to believe \u2013 that is, until you start reading and learn of Harry\u2019s deep reticence at having to rake over the past. She spends a chapter discussing the marvel that is the opposable thumb, as though straining for the word count on a homework assignment. Patti Smith\u2019s is her third, including the award-winning Just Kids (2010), an account of her years with Robert Mapplethorpe. The slim pamphlet that is Year of the Monkey covers just one lunar year in Smith\u2019s life, her 70th, which coincides with the political upheavals of 2016 and some significant endings. Harry\u2019s book is full of pictures of her made by other people, a gallery of fan art the singer has collected over the years, from her Andy Warhol portrait down to children\u2019s scrawls. On the page, she is far goofier than you\u2019d expect. There is a surprising matter-of-factness with which Harry discusses her face: she knows full well people masturbated to posters of her. She acknowledges the weird superpowers beauty gave her and has unapologetic surgery to preserve it. But there is also ambivalence towards her looks. As an adopted child, Harry resembled no one in her family; people used to say she looked \u201cEuropean\u201d. As a child, she was \u201calways afraid\u201d. She is at pains to point out that the Harry who fronted Blondie was always a caricature, in drag, \u201can inflatable doll\u201d. Although her looks could have made her one of the beautiful people, Harry was a punk, into bricolage and heroin and early hip-hop, her role in John Waters\u2019s movie Hairspray far closer to her heart than the entitlements of conventional glamour. At one point, in London\u2019s Kensington High Street, she accidentally walks into her own reflection and sustains whiplash and damage to her spine. One particularly terrific shot of Harry by her then partner, Blondie guitarist Chris Stein, finds her holding a burning frying pan in the squalor of their New York apartment, wearing a chiffon gown. It\u2019s the squalor to which you are inevitably drawn. Face It\u2019s title reveals a grudging reckoning. The book\u2019s difficult gestation involved interviews with Leonard Cohen biographer Sylvie Simmons, in which Harry recalls, matter-of-factly, a violent partner, her near-abduction by a man she is convinced was the serial killer Ted Bundy, a rape during a robbery, several near-death experiences and Stein\u2019s serious autoimmune illness. She brought him the heroin he also needed, the nurses turning a blind eye. Because Blondie\u2019s managers and accountants were strangers to due diligence, the tax authorities took away all their assets \u2013 including Stein\u2019s health insurance \u2013 while he was clinging to life in hospital. Unexpectedly lyrical are the passages where Harry compares her singing to her blood family\u2019s plumbing business. \u201cI now know I am a part of a forced air legacy,\u201d she says. Smith\u2019s book is full of black and white photographs she herself has taken, all simple, many moving \u2013 her father\u2019s teacup, the late Sam Shepard\u2019s Stetson. One of this strange memoir\u2019s subplots concerns a photograph Smith took of the Chilean writer Roberto Bola\u00f1o\u2019s board games cupboard. Year of the Monkey presents more like a work of poetry or a novella than a conventional first-person narrative, doubling down on the peregrinations of 2015\u2019s M Train, her second memoir. Real things happen: Smith goes to the deathbed of her longtime friend Sandy Pearlman, and to work on a manuscript alongside Shepard, also not long for this world. \u201cA yellow-haired confidence man\u201d is elected and inaugurated. The other goings-on, however, are both elliptical and not a little confounding. Smith finds herself in conversation with a motel sign at the Dream Inn; they bicker. From then on, this road trip plays out oneirically, Smith wandering in a kind of charmed hyper-reality, everything full of portent. Just as often, coffee is uppermost in her mind, or huevos rancheros. Weird coincidences dog Smith; she hitches rides with creepy strangers and strikes up intense conversations about art, film and literature with coffeehouse denizens who recur, implausibly, along her route. Everything is unprecedented in Year of the Monkey, Smith seems to be saying. Time concertinas, reality is unmoored. But you get the feeling that Smith might exist in a permanent Stendhal syndrome swoon, as Flemish altarpieces, Dragon Ball anime and Billie Holiday\u2019s Strange Fruit all swirl around in her mind. The book is a highly individual stocktaking of a most unusual 70th year of a great woman of letters. But what happens next? Towards the end, Smith has an apocalyptic vision in her dreams, perhaps brought on by Chinese herbal tea, in which vast numbers of refugees, \u201cclothed in the fabric of lamentations\u201d, plough across a benighted landscape, watched by people on their tablets and smartwatches: the next reality TV hit. \u2022 Face It by Debbie Harry is published by HarperCollins (\u00a320).

The shift in British perceptions of Germany is nevertheless expressive of the wider recasting of political attachments and faultlines.</p> <p>Brexit has thrown into turmoil not simply traditional political alignments but also Britain\u2019s understanding of itself and of its place in the world. From debates about \u201cglobal Britain\u201d to worries about the union, the question of what Britain stands for seems less certain. The past has become a battlefield in the struggle to define the present.

The Second World War has helped anchor Britain\u2019s sense of itself as a nation, not just as the last moment when it could act as a world power but also because the Holocaust provided an unalloyed moral symbol of evil.</p> <p>In her book <em>Learning From the Germans</em>, the philosopher Susan Neiman observes that the enormity of the Holocaust has forced Germany to address the darkest aspects of its past. But it has also allowed Britain and America not to do so, to avoid thinking too deeply about the history of slavery or of empire, to minimise their horrors in comparison with the Holocaust.</p> <p>The turmoil over Brexit is throwing many of the old certainties into question. The question is \u2013 will we use that uncertainty to have a grown-up debate about history and identity?</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",

Angela Merkel\u2019s decision in 2015 to open the borders to migrants and refugees, and its role in helping the growth of the far right, reveals for many the dangers of an overweening liberalism, that, in their eyes, has unleashed darker forces \u2013 witness the attack last week, during Yom Kippur, on a synagogue in the German city of Halle by a far-right gunman. This view of the supposed liberalism of Germany and the EU over immigration is, as I have argued, disturbingly mistaken, as are the claims about the reasons for the rise of the far right. The shift in British perceptions of Germany is nevertheless expressive of the wider recasting of political attachments and faultlines. Brexit has thrown into turmoil not simply traditional political alignments but also Britain\u2019s understanding of itself and of its place in the world. From debates about \u201cglobal Britain\u201d to worries about the union, the question of what Britain stands for seems less certain. The past has become a battlefield in the struggle to define the present. The bicentenary of the Peterloo massacre in August was, for instance, notable for attempts by both Brexiters and Remainers to claim its legacy as their own, to draw from the 19th-century struggle for democracy lessons for the meaning of democracy today. The shifting perceptions of Germany also speak to this contestation over the past. The Second World War has helped anchor Britain\u2019s sense of itself as a nation, not just as the last moment when it could act as a world power but also because the Holocaust provided an unalloyed moral symbol of evil. In her book Learning From the Germans, the philosopher Susan Neiman observes that the enormity of the Holocaust has forced Germany to address the darkest aspects of its past. But it has also allowed Britain and America not to do so, to avoid thinking too deeply about the history of slavery or of empire, to minimise their horrors in comparison with the Holocaust. The turmoil over Brexit is throwing many of the old certainties into question. The question is \u2013 will we use that uncertainty to have a grown-up debate about history and identity? \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "Last month Michael Jennings received a text and a final statement, both on the same day, informing him that his dual-fuel account was in the red. The statement bore the logo, livery and customer services hotline of Extra Energy, which had supplied his home since 2016. The alarming thing was that Extra Energy ceased trading last November and the pensioner, along with its other customers, had been transferred to Scottish Power. Moreover the charges, which covered a one-month period between October and November 2018, amounted to \u00a32,919.12. Jennings called customer services and discovered that the alleged debt was based on an estimated reading and was told that none of the actual readings provided over the years could be retrieved. He then contacted Scottish Power, which confirmed that his account had a zero balance when it was transferred last year. Nevertheless, the phantom Extra Energy insisted its figures were correct. \u201cI was told I had three choices: to pay in full immediately, to pay over three months or to await a collection agency,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I requested a bill, the South African operative asked for my first name twice. When I checked the number online I found that it is attributable to a number of scams. I have always paid \u00a380 per month by direct debit and fail to understand how this alleged figure could have been reached in a single month.\u201d Jennings feared that the demand was an attempt to defraud him and contacted the Observer. Depressingly, it turns out that he is not the victim of a scam, but of a similarly damaging incompetence. The final statement had been issued by Extra Energy\u2019s administrator, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), although only a paragraph of tiny print on the final statement explains this. Only when the Observer requested a breakdown of the sum did PwC admit that the debt had accrued due to \u201ca history of under-billing\u201d by Extra Energy, despite regular meter readings having been submitted. When we pointed out that customers can\u2019t be charged for more than 12 months of arrears if they have not been billed, PwC slashed his balance to \u00a31,132.00. In the wake of Extra Energy\u2019s collapse, its 108,000 domestic customers were promised that they would receive final statements by September 2019, leaving them exposed to shock bills for up to 10 months. To meet that deadline PwC appears to have issued demands without adequate evidence. Asked by the Observer whether it first checked customers\u2019 billing histories and meter readings, it implied it had inherited a shambles from the defunct supplier. \u201cWe have encountered issues with customer data and billing systems that could not have been reasonably foreseen,\u201d it says. \u201cWe are in the process of coordinating the complex process of final billing.\u201d Hundreds more Extra Energy customers have received unexplained three- and four-figure bills months after the company ceased trading and many, who were never customers, claim to have been contacted over phantom debts. One woman, who had omitted to cancel her direct debit, was left unable to pay her mortgage when \u00a3540 was taken from her account seven months after the supplier went into administration. Some have been threatened with debt collectors, while others are still waiting for a credit on their accounts to be refunded. MoneySavingExpert, the consumer forum, says it received scores of complaints in April when the first bills started to land. \u201cA number of former customers were unexpectedly told by PricewaterhouseCoopers that they owed cash and others, who claimed they were never customers of the firm, said they were also chased,\u201d says Steve Nowottny from the website. \u201cWe told those affected that they shouldn\u2019t just ignore the letter, even if they believe they didn\u2019t owe money, since some did owe cash. Those who believed they were being wrongly chased were urged to get in touch with PwC as soon as possible to dispute the claim and present whatever evidence they could showing they\u2019d paid money owed.\u201d Utilities regulator Ofgem acknowledges that customers have been poorly treated. \u201cOfgem\u2019s role is to appoint a supplier of last resort and ensure a smooth customer transfer. We do not appoint the administrator,\u201d it says. \u201cUnfortunately, in the case of Extra Energy customers, we have had to engage very closely with PwC as we are aware of high levels of complaints. \u201cWe\u2019re extremely disappointed that Extra Energy customers have had to wait so long to receive final bills and we are aware of some customers disagreeing with the final amount.

PwC advises those who dispute or query their bills to call its customer service line included on the final statements. But, as Jennings found, its agents may be unable to fish the facts out of the quagmire that is Extra Energy\u2019s database. Moreover, many may be put off by the fact that the number is rated \u201cdangerous\u201d on website, Who Called Me. Comments on the site report long periods on hold or calls cutting off and contributors complain of being harassed by South African call centres with inadequate or out-of-date details. Dismayingly, if the administrator does not budge on its demands the options are limited. Administrators such as PwC are not bound by Ofgem\u2019s regulations, because they are not an energy company and, for the same reason the energy ombudsman is powerless. \u201cUnfortunately, we cannot investigate complaints about administrators, as these companies fall outside our remit,\u201d it says. \u201cSimilarly, we cannot require action of an energy supplier once it ceases trading.\u201d Customers who feel that PwC has not adequately handled a formal complaint can escalate it through the Insolvency Service\u2019s online gateway.

Back then, there was a touch of <a href=\"https://stjohnrestaurant.com/\" title=\"\">St John</a> to his cooking. I still mutter wistfully about his toast fried in duck fat, laid with horseradish cream and pink folds of roast beef. He might put a mince and onion pie on the menu, but raise the humble to the extravagant, or put a cake of crisped pig\u2019s head alongside slices of fillet. His dishes have always been on the plate what they promise on the menu.</p> <p>And now here\u2019s the shiny <a href=\"http://www.flinthousebrighton.com/\" title=\"\">Flint House</a>, in a new development within the city\u2019s Lanes. It\u2019s seemingly unlike any other McKellar outpost before, which may explain the absence of \u201cGinger\u201d in the title. Upstairs is a dining room and cocktail bar looking out over the Brighton rooftops. Downstairs is dominated by a counter around a fully open kitchen for those who like a bit of nerdy cooking theatre. Thrill to the induction hob with its plancha fitting; perv over the Thermomix and the Pacojet, and the prepped ingredients waiting in their plastic pots for their moment.</p> <p>It\u2019s all polished surfaces and sharp angles and yes, of course, small plates because everything is right now. They do not take bookings, because this is meant to be a restlessly modern venture that you fall into and out of at speed. So far so modish. Don\u2019t be distracted. Dig through the unstructured menu, its belt unloosened to the last notch. Take in the nods to Spain and Italy. The bit of the <a href=\"http://www.flinthousebrighton.com/\" title=\"\">menu</a> headed encouragingly \u201cFried/toast/snacks\u201d, for example, includes ham croquettes with saffron mayo, which feels like a departure from his overtly British agenda. But you\u2019ll still find the big fat McKellar thumbprint: it\u2019s about solid dishes that don\u2019t sacrifice substance for looks.

I\u2019m still to work out exactly what the salt does, but I know the beef is exceptionally good. Like some terrible brand fetishist, I relax when I see his name on a menu. A serious cut of that beef is the most expensive dish here at \u00a342 (for sharing). There\u2019s also his ox cheek, cured to a rosy red and given a ride through a sugar pit, to produce something on more than nodding terms with the very best maple-syrup-sweetened bacon. There\u2019s a toasty onion pur\u00e9e beneath. It needs the heavy grating of nose-slapping horseradish to tip it away from cloying.

      "body": "<p>I like this time of year, with its huddling clouds and lack of outdoor expectations; autumn is the most at-peace-with-itself season. It is also the start of hot-chocolate weather. You can make really good hot chocolate by simply breaking your favourite chocolate bar (without bits in) into small pieces and then whisking it into warm milk. I take this further by using chocolate ganache as a base \u2013 100g of 70% chocolate, 75g of milk chocolate and 225g of cream all melted in a bowl atop a pan of simmering water. When done, store in a jar in the fridge and when needed, dollop a large tablespoonful into a pan with some milk, heat and whisk. You don\u2019t need much.</p> <p>I like my hot chocolate small and punchy - more molten chocolate than milky drink.</p> <p>My favourites, after weeks of testing, are <strong>Misco\u2019s </strong>Hot Chocolate Drink;<strong> Sim\u00f3n Coll</strong>\u2019s Chocolate a la Taza 60% cocoa with vanilla; <strong>Hotel Chocolat</strong> 50% milky and 70% dark; <strong>Zotter</strong>\u2019s little bars with adventurous flavours (honey cinnamon/coffee cardamom) for the more outr\u00e9, and <strong>Pump Street</strong>\u2019s just launched single-estate 75-85% hot chocolate flakes. I\u2019ve worked out that if you make it at home, 37g of powder/flakes to 250ml of milk is the perfect combination.</p> <p>Out and about there are two places that I search out for my hot-choc needs: <strong>Carluccio</strong>\u2019s for its Cioccolata Fiorentina and <strong>AG Lifestyle </strong>in Suffolk. I\u2019ve heard amazing things about <strong>SAID</strong> of London\u2019s hot chocolate, but have yet to try it.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I like this time of year, with its huddling clouds and lack of outdoor expectations; autumn is the most at-peace-with-itself season. It is also the start of hot-chocolate weather. You can make really good hot chocolate by simply breaking your favourite chocolate bar (without bits in) into small pieces and then whisking it into warm milk. I take this further by using chocolate ganache as a base \u2013 100g of 70% chocolate, 75g of milk chocolate and 225g of cream all melted in a bowl atop a pan of simmering water. When done, store in a jar in the fridge and when needed, dollop a large tablespoonful into a pan with some milk, heat and whisk. You don\u2019t need much. I like my hot chocolate small and punchy - more molten chocolate than milky drink. My favourites, after weeks of testing, are Misco\u2019s Hot Chocolate Drink; Sim\u00f3n Coll\u2019s Chocolate a la Taza 60% cocoa with vanilla; Hotel Chocolat 50% milky and 70% dark; Zotter\u2019s little bars with adventurous flavours (honey cinnamon/coffee cardamom) for the more outr\u00e9, and Pump Street\u2019s just launched single-estate 75-85% hot chocolate flakes. I\u2019ve worked out that if you make it at home, 37g of powder/flakes to 250ml of milk is the perfect combination. Out and about there are two places that I search out for my hot-choc needs: Carluccio\u2019s for its Cioccolata Fiorentina and AG Lifestyle in Suffolk. I\u2019ve heard amazing things about SAID of London\u2019s hot chocolate, but have yet to try it.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Domaine Albert Boxler Riesling Grand Cru Sommerberg, Alsace, France 2014 (\u00a345, <a href=\"http://thewinesociety.com\" title=\"\">The Wine Society</a>) </strong>Ask a group of winemakers what it is they think is so special about wine, what makes it worthy of all the attention they give it, and a majority will say something about the way it captures like nothing else the essence of a certain place at a certain time. This high-minded attitude isn\u2019t always easy to sustain. So much wine is really no more special than anything else at the supermarket: it might be worth drinking, it might be disgusting, but it\u2019s on those terms \u2013 rather than any quasi-mystical relationship between man and the natural world \u2013 that it should be judged. Sometimes, however, there are bottles that really do seem to have the magical time-and-space travelling effect. Albert Boxler\u2019s riesling is one such: a gorgeous swell of mellow orchard fruit over a steely frame of acidity that takes me right back to the single, singular vineyard where it is made.</p> <p><strong>Domaine Rolly Gassmann Gewurztraminer, Alsace, France 2016 (from \u00a324, <a href=\"http://bbr.com\" title=\"\">Berry Bros &amp; Rudd</a>; <a href=\"http://uncorked.co.uk\" title=\"\">Uncorked</a>; <a href=\"http://woodwinters.com\" title=\"\">WoodWinters</a>) </strong>Thoughts about the complex causal web of place and time in Boxler\u2019s Sommerberg Riesling were prompted by tasting three vintages of the wine back to back: the expansive 2014 i more immediately appealing on the day than the tighter, tauter 2013 or the honeyed 2012. But in a week, a year, or a decade\u2019s time? I wouldn\u2019t like to say. You can buy all three vintages from <strong><a href=\"http://thewinesociety.com\" title=\"\">The Wine Society</a></strong> if you want to perform your own experiment or simply enjoy the work of one of France\u2019s best white wine producers. I\u2019d be curious to put a few bottles of Rolly-Gassmann\u2019s Gewurztraminer away, too, for a similar experiment. It\u2019s another white wine that shows off the French region\u2019s ability for making white wines of spine-tingling spicy intensity, with a heady, almost musky mix of lychee, rose garden and ginger that you feel will only get more decadent as the year\u2019s go by.</p> <p><strong>Exquisite Collection Alsace Pinot Gris, France 2017 (\u00a37.49, <a href=\"https://www.aldi.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Aldi</a>)</strong> As well as being a source of graceful fine wine, Alsace does a neat line in accessible and accessibly priced varietal wines \u2013 wines for drinking young, enjoying the way they capture the essence of a single grape variety.

      "bodyText": "Domaine Albert Boxler Riesling Grand Cru Sommerberg, Alsace, France 2014 (\u00a345, The Wine Society) Ask a group of winemakers what it is they think is so special about wine, what makes it worthy of all the attention they give it, and a majority will say something about the way it captures like nothing else the essence of a certain place at a certain time. This high-minded attitude isn\u2019t always easy to sustain. So much wine is really no more special than anything else at the supermarket: it might be worth drinking, it might be disgusting, but it\u2019s on those terms \u2013 rather than any quasi-mystical relationship between man and the natural world \u2013 that it should be judged. Sometimes, however, there are bottles that really do seem to have the magical time-and-space travelling effect. Albert Boxler\u2019s riesling is one such: a gorgeous swell of mellow orchard fruit over a steely frame of acidity that takes me right back to the single, singular vineyard where it is made. Domaine Rolly Gassmann Gewurztraminer, Alsace, France 2016 (from \u00a324, Berry Bros &amp; Rudd; Uncorked; WoodWinters) Thoughts about the complex causal web of place and time in Boxler\u2019s Sommerberg Riesling were prompted by tasting three vintages of the wine back to back: the expansive 2014 i more immediately appealing on the day than the tighter, tauter 2013 or the honeyed 2012. But in a week, a year, or a decade\u2019s time? I wouldn\u2019t like to say. You can buy all three vintages from The Wine Society if you want to perform your own experiment or simply enjoy the work of one of France\u2019s best white wine producers. I\u2019d be curious to put a few bottles of Rolly-Gassmann\u2019s Gewurztraminer away, too, for a similar experiment. It\u2019s another white wine that shows off the French region\u2019s ability for making white wines of spine-tingling spicy intensity, with a heady, almost musky mix of lychee, rose garden and ginger that you feel will only get more decadent as the year\u2019s go by. Exquisite Collection Alsace Pinot Gris, France 2017 (\u00a37.49, Aldi) As well as being a source of graceful fine wine, Alsace does a neat line in accessible and accessibly priced varietal wines \u2013 wines for drinking young, enjoying the way they capture the essence of a single grape variety. Gewurztraminer\u2019s uninhibited puffs of rose perfume and exotic fruit, for example, are given full, Thai green curry-partnering rein in the succulent Tesco Finest Alsace Gewurztraminer (\u00a39); while Cave de Turckheim Riesling Vieilles Vignes 2015 (from \u00a311.69, Rannoch Scott; Highbury Vintners) has riesling\u2019s classic swish of acidity and bright, tangy lime and lemon zip. The region\u2019s take on pinot gris (aka pinot grigio) is also well worth looking out for. I enjoyed the fresh and fragrant peachiness in Aldi\u2019s good value version, while Domaine Schlumberger\u2019s mushroom risotto-matching Les Princes Abb\u00e9s Pinot Gris 2016 (from \u00a317.49, Tanners Wine; Nobel Green Wines) serves its crystallised citrus, spiced pear and quince richness with polished charm.

      "bodyText": "Arlington National Cemetery is the hallowed resting place of America\u2019s war dead. It is also home to a Confederate memorial with a frieze depicting a \u201cmammy\u201d \u2013 the stereotype of a black woman loyal to a white family \u2013 and an African American man wearing Confederate uniform. \u201cFor many people, that is evidence of black Confederate soldiers,\u201d Kevin Levin told an audience at the National Archives in Washington last month. \u201cBut it\u2019s not. In fact, no one was confused during the dedication that this was in fact a body servant.\u201d In other words, an enslaved man. The American civil war has never been in short supply of myths, but Levin describes black Confederates as the \u201cmost persistent\u201d. Hundreds of articles, organisations and websites rewrite history by asserting that between 500 and 100,000 free and enslaved African Americans volunteered as soldiers in an army fighting to preserve slavery. Just because it is counterintuitive does not make it true. In the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s election and the white nationalist protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee still stands, the issue resonates beyond the halls of academia. Levin, a historian, educator and author of the blog civil war memory, has been writing on the subject since 2008. \u201cOne of the things that I\u2019m fascinated by is the extent to which Americans still struggle over coming to terms with the core issues of the civil war and reconstruction, and that is slavery and the issue of race,\u201d he says by phone from Boston. \u201cThis is, it seems to me, the perfect case study through which to track that memory of the war, whether it\u2019s a matter of erasing slavery from the landscape of memory or mythologising, which I think the black Confederate narrative, at least in the last few decades, is really just a perfect example of.\u201d Levin\u2019s new book, Searching for Black Confederates: The Civil War\u2019s Most Persistent Myth, argues that slavery was central to the south\u2019s war effort. Drawing on research including letters, diary entries and newspaper editorials, it demolishes the notion that the Confederacy embraced black men as soldiers from the beginning of the war. After war broke out in 1861, thousands of enslaved men were forced to accompany their masters into the army as body servants or camp slaves. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely important to think of these enslaved men as the cornerstone or foundation of any Confederate army because it\u2019s their presence, it\u2019s the roles that they\u2019re playing, that make camping, marching and conducting battles even possible,\u201d Levin says. Life in the camps could be harsh. Levin \u201cfound a couple of cases where the punishments are brutal. One Confederate officer wrote home to his wife in vivid detail about stretching out his camp slave and laying on 400 lashes. The kinds of punishments that you would have found back home on the plantation, you would have found all of that present in the army. \u201cIt may have even been heightened because you have to remember most of these men who bring camp slaves are officers, so they have to constantly demonstrate their rank.\u201d When the war ended, enslaved African Americans serving the Confederate army were liberated. But by the end of the 19th century, they began to play a central role in the lost cause, a narrative white southerners developed as a way to rationalise and romanticise defeat.

      "bodyText": "The most xenophobic and isolationist American president in modern history has been selling America to foreign powers for his own personal benefit. Trump withdrew American troops from the Syrian-Turkish border, leaving our Kurdish allies to be slaughtered and opening the way for a resurgent Islamic State. Trump\u2019s rationale? He promised to bring our soldiers home. There could be another reason. Trump never divested from his real estate business, and the Trump Towers Istanbul is the Trump Organization\u2019s first and only office and residential building in Europe. Businesses linked to the Turkish government are also major patrons of the Trump Organization. Which may be why Trump has repeatedly sided with the Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who has been intent on eliminating the Kurds. Back home, Trump has separated families at the border, locked migrant children in cages and tried to ban Muslims from entering the country. He says he wants to protect America\u2019s borders. But guarding America\u2019s geographic borders isn\u2019t nearly as important as guarding the integrity of American democracy, which Trump has repeatedly compromised for personal political gain. He did this on 25 July when he asked the president of Ukraine to do him a personal \u201cfavor\u201d by digging up dirt on Joe Biden, his most likely 2020 opponent. Trump justifies his trade war with China as protecting America from Chinese predation. But he asked China to start an investigation of Biden, and last week his adviser on China conceded he spoke with Chinese officials about the former vice-president. During the 2016 election, Trump publicly called on Russia to find Hillary Clinton\u2019s missing emails. Within hours, Russian agents sought to do just that by trying to break into her computer servers. Special counsel Robert Mueller found that Russia sought to help Trump get elected, and Trump\u2019s campaign welcomed the help. Now Trump is playing at being a double foreign agent \u2013 pushing the prime minister of Australia, among others, to gather information to discredit Mueller. Rudy Giuliani is Trump\u2019s international thug, arranging deals with foreign powers. On Wednesday, two of Giuliani\u2019s business associates were arrested in connection with a criminal scheme to funnel foreign money to candidates for office, including donations to a Super Pac formed to support Trump. Under Trump, thuggery has replaced diplomacy. On Friday, in an opening statement for congressional impeachment investigators, Marie Yovanovitch, former US ambassador to Ukraine, said people associated with Giuliani \u201cmay well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine\u201d. Meanwhile, even as Trump spews conspiracy theories about the Biden family, his own children are openly profiting from foreign deals. Eric and Don Jr have projects in the works in Ireland, India, Indonesia, Uruguay, Turkey and the Philippines. Trump is pocketing money from foreign governments eager to curry favor by staying at his hotels. The practice has become so routine that during Trump\u2019s 25 July phone call, the Ukrainian president assured him that the \u201clast time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park and I stayed at the Trump Tower\u201d. According to a former Trump Organization official, foreign governments spent more than a million dollars at Trump businesses in 2018, mostly at the Trump International hotel in Washington. Trump will make even more money if he carries out his plan to host next year\u2019s G7 meeting at his Doral golf resort, in Florida. All of this is precisely what the founding fathers sought to prevent. When they gathered in Philadelphia 232 years ago to write a constitution, a major goal was to protect the new nation from what Alexander Hamilton called the \u201cdesire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils\u201d. To ensure no president would \u201cbetray his trust to foreign powers\u201d, as James Madison put it, they included an emoluments clause \u2013 barring a president from accepting foreign payments. They also gave Congress the right to impeach a president for \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\u201d. During the Virginia ratifying convention, Edmund Randolph confirmed that a president \u201cmay be impeached\u201d if discovered \u201creceiving [help] from foreign powers\u201d. You don\u2019t have to be an originalist to see the dangers to democracy when a president seeks or receives personal favors from foreign governments. There is no limit to how far a foreign power might go to help a president enlarge his political power and wealth, in exchange for selling out America. Donald Trump is a xenophobe in public and international mobster in private. He has brazenly sought private gain from foreign governments at the expense of the American people. This is shameful and criminal. At the very least, it is impeachable.

      "bodyText": "Hindus: Do We Have a Caste Problem? 10.30pm, BBC One The modern Indian caste system is a controversial practice, a discriminatory and hereditary idea of class that many believe stems from British colonial rule in the country. While those in the lowest caste category \u2013 \u201cuntouchables\u201d or dalits \u2013 still suffer from widespread persecution in India, in this one-off documentary Parle Patel investigates the repercussions of caste for Hindus living in Britain today. A fascinating and largely underreported phenomenon. Ammar Kalia Lost Pharaohs of the Nile 8pm, Channel 4 A fascinating tale of a real-life Wakanda whose secrets are now being unearthed in Sudan. The Kushite civilisation rivalled ancient Egypt in terms of its power and technological advancement but, partly due to racism, its achievements have been underplayed. A remarkable untold black history. Phil Harrison The Americas With Simon Reeve 9pm, BBC Two After travelling from Alaska down through Canada to Vancouver last week, Reeve reaches the United States and witnesses how the cowboy way of life is threatened in the prairies of Montana and the dependence on prison inmates\u2019 labour in a Colorado town. He applies a typically empathic tact in this engaging watch. AK Sanditon 9pm, ITV It is the night of the Midsummer Ball, and a burgeoning if inevitable romance has come to a head. But the fate of the eponymous idyllic seaside town hangs in the balance, and young, spirited Charlotte Heywood and the Parker family face some impossible choices, as the Jane Austen-inspired Regency drama concludes. Ali Catterall I Love You, Now Die 9pm, Sky Crime The concluding part of an exhaustive take on Michelle Carter, imprisoned for texts and calls encouraging her boyfriend to kill himself. In the middle is a disturbing and fascinating picture of a woman for whom digital communication and pop-culture fandom contributed to a warped view of reality. Jack Seale Why We Hate 10pm, Discovery Steven Spielberg and documentarian Alex Gibney exec-produce this series on the evolutionary development of hate among humans, from genocide to internet trolling. This first episode tackles the origins of hate, questioning the intersections of nature and nurture in humanity. AK Film choice All Is True 10am, 6.15pm, Sky Cinema Premiere Writer Ben Elton is in a melancholy Shakespearean mood here. Director Kenneth Branagh plays the bard who, after the destruction of the Globe in 1613, heads home to Stratford where wife Anne (Judi Dench) awaits and his muse, Ian McKellen\u2019s Earl of Southampton, pays a visit. Paul Howlett Live sport F1: Japanese Grand Prix 6.05am, Sky Sports Main Event. From the Suzuka Circuit. Women\u2019s Super League: Chelsea v Arsenal 2.45pm, BT Sport 1. A top-flight clash from Kingsmeadow. International Football: Wales v Croatia 7.15pm, Sky Sports Main Event. Group E Euro 2020 qualifier from Cardiff City Stadium. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 October 2019 because an earlier version omitted to include the Canadian element to last week\u2019s episode of The Americas With Simon Reeve.

He and I have significant differences of opinion. Nonetheless, I can report that his book is well-paced and shot through with vivid detail and scene.</p> <p>In a typical passage, Marantz describes the lobby of the Trump Hotel in Washington after the 2016 election. He sees \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/14/proud-boys-far-right-portland-oregon\">tatted-up Proud Boys</a>\u201d, \u201cnotorious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/4chan\">4chan</a> shitlords who seemed flummoxed by the mechanics of face-to-face conversation\u201d, \u201ca former Marine wearing a hunting vest\u201d and \u201ca wealthy deaconess from Nigeria wearing a gaudy church hat\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTrump had won,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe libs had been triggered. Now the Deplorables drank together in the same glassed-in atrium, listening to the same elevator music, trying to figure out what they actually had in common.\u201d</p> <p>Despite Marantz\u2019s distaste for his politics, his profile of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/06/burst-your-bubble-conservatives-mike-cernovich-trump-foreign-policy\">Mike Cernovich</a> \u2013 the men\u2019s rights activist turned alt-lite crusader and would-be lifestyle guru \u2013 is empathetic enough to recognize how an unhappy upbringing in an Illinois farm town might explain Cernovich\u2019s hatred of the political establishment.</p> <p>\u201cLook, if the experts decide tomorrow that we\u2019re going to war with Russia, who\u2019s gonna fight that war?\u201d Cernovich asks. \u201c<a href=\"https://jonahgoldberg.com/\">Jonah Goldberg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/ross-douthat\">Ross Douthat</a>? Fuck no. It\u2019ll be guys I know from Kewanee.\u201d</p> <p>Another chapter, The Mountain, brings the reader deep into the psychology of Samantha, a young, fairly apolitical woman who gets sucked into neo-Nazism before having a crisis of conscience.</p> <p>Marantz makes the interesting decision to recount the events of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/19/charlottesville-police-molly-conger-newspaper\">Charlottesville</a> in August 2017 \u2013 including the killing of Heather Heyer \u2013 through the eyes, or words, of the alt-right. The far-right activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/04/canada-far-right-anti-muslim-propaganda-targeting-trudeau\">Faith Goldy</a> was on the scene, livestreaming, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/26/charlottesville-car-attacker-trial-murder-kames-alex-fields-heather-heyer\">James Alex Fields</a> attacked. We see Goldy\u2019s distress quickly give way to rationalization and false equivalence.</p> <p>The word \u201cTrump\u201d appears less than one might expect. But Trump is, of course, everywhere. Antisocial speaks to what has become a pervasive progressive-left anxiety about the influence of misinformation and disinformation on American democracy. You know: Russian hackers, bots, fake news, \u201clow-information\u201d voters, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/11/elizabeth-warren-facebook-zuckerberg-trump-troll\">scurrilous Facebook ads</a>. Marantz laments the fall of the journalistic \u201cgatekeepers\u201d who used to arbitrate public discourse.</p> <p>But that \u201cgatekeeping\u201d also brought us Vietnam and Iraq and an establishment whose reflexive favor for the status quo often meant quietism about civil rights and poverty.</p> <p>Marantz recognizes that the gatekeepers had their flaws. His stance on the old media is similar to Churchill\u2019s <a href=\"https://richardlangworth.com/worst-form-of-government\">famous remark</a> that democracy is the worst system except for all the others. But he seems less interested in understanding why the old media lost the trust of so many Americans. He is skeptical of \u201ctwerp bashing\u201d \u2013 the temptation to take cheap swipes at those who run the prestige media \u2013 but misses an opportunity to consider such grievances more seriously.</p> <p>What if our media gatekeepers \u2013 overwhelmingly white, coastal, secular, educated at a handful of elite universities and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/05/06/just-7-percent-of-journalists-are-republicans-thats-far-less-than-even-a-decade-ago/\">only 7%</a> Republican \u2013 suffer from <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/25/media-bubble-real-journalism-jobs-east-coast-215048\">profound myopias and bias</a>?

For years progressives have claimed rightwing propaganda causes Americans to vote against their self-interest. As the sometime <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/thomas-frank\">Guardian columnist Thomas Frank</a> put it, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Whats-Matter-Kansas-Conservatives-America-ebook/dp/B003J4VEM2\">What\u2019s the matter with Kansas?</a>\u201d But when progressives talk like this they don\u2019t seem that different from the social conservatives <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/09/what-the-ahmari-french-debate-was-really-about.html\">upset</a> at liberal democracy because it has brought outcomes \u2013 \u201cdrag queen story hour\u201d, sexual permissiveness \u2013 that they don\u2019t like.</p> <p>The real elephant in the room, made more explicit in Marantz\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/opinion/sunday/free-speech-social-media-violence.html?smtyp=cur%26smid=tw-nytopinion\">recent New York Times op-ed</a>, is his skepticism about freedom of speech. It should be balanced, he argues, against other liberal principles.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/sep/16/how-to-fight-anti-semitism-review-bari-weiss-tree-of-life-pittsburgh\">How to Fight Anti-Semitism review \u2013 Bari Weiss's elegy for Pittsburgh</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, Facebook and Twitter and Periscope are private platforms. No one has a constitutional \u201cright\u201d to tweet any more than someone can demand the New York Times print their racist screed. I\u2019m OK with putting PR pressure on private tech companies to de-platform bigots and bad actors. But things get murky quickly. A Facebook page advocating genocide is obviously hate speech. But is a group against gay marriage, or a page critical of child gender transition? What about a Twitter bot that just repeats the phrase \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d?</p> <p>It\u2019s the same with \u201cfake news\u201d. Is a cruel, bullying but factually true statement real or fake news? What about false claims made in satire? What about a claim that is factual but lacks context? Should we ban all conspiracy theories, or just those that are actively harmful? And on and on and on.</p> <p>Marantz has written what may be the definitive book on the nexus of internet culture and the new far right.

      "bodyText": "As Andrew Marantz discovers in his new book, chutzpah \u2013 sheer, outrageous shamelessness \u2013 may be the most powerful and most dangerous form of charisma. The New Yorker writer argues that the unfettered internet created a loose coalition of reactionaries \u2013 rightwing muckrakers, pro-Trump trolls and outright fascists \u2013 whose cynical exploitation of free speech has derailed American discourse. The subtext of Antisocial: Online Extremists, Techno-Utopians and the Hijacking of the American Conversation is Marantz\u2019s anxiety at embedding with bad people and his fear that no matter how much critical distance he tries to maintain, the very act of immersion implicates him. As if to prove the point, his book, although dark and often disturbing, is also sometimes funny thanks to its wry, observatorial style and the surreality of the material. Some of his subjects can charm even as they appall \u2013 others just appall \u2013 and Marantz is particularly good at dissecting how alt-right trolls use irony and meta-humor and plausible deniability to obscure their horrible beliefs even as they promote them. The result is an impressive work of writing and reporting, probing and profound if not always persuasive. Disclosure: I know Marantz. He and I have significant differences of opinion. Nonetheless, I can report that his book is well-paced and shot through with vivid detail and scene. In a typical passage, Marantz describes the lobby of the Trump Hotel in Washington after the 2016 election. He sees \u201ctatted-up Proud Boys\u201d, \u201cnotorious 4chan shitlords who seemed flummoxed by the mechanics of face-to-face conversation\u201d, \u201ca former Marine wearing a hunting vest\u201d and \u201ca wealthy deaconess from Nigeria wearing a gaudy church hat\u201d. \u201cTrump had won,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe libs had been triggered. Now the Deplorables drank together in the same glassed-in atrium, listening to the same elevator music, trying to figure out what they actually had in common.\u201d Despite Marantz\u2019s distaste for his politics, his profile of Mike Cernovich \u2013 the men\u2019s rights activist turned alt-lite crusader and would-be lifestyle guru \u2013 is empathetic enough to recognize how an unhappy upbringing in an Illinois farm town might explain Cernovich\u2019s hatred of the political establishment. \u201cLook, if the experts decide tomorrow that we\u2019re going to war with Russia, who\u2019s gonna fight that war?\u201d Cernovich asks. \u201cJonah Goldberg and Ross Douthat? Fuck no. It\u2019ll be guys I know from Kewanee.\u201d Another chapter, The Mountain, brings the reader deep into the psychology of Samantha, a young, fairly apolitical woman who gets sucked into neo-Nazism before having a crisis of conscience. Marantz makes the interesting decision to recount the events of Charlottesville in August 2017 \u2013 including the killing of Heather Heyer \u2013 through the eyes, or words, of the alt-right. The far-right activist Faith Goldy was on the scene, livestreaming, when James Alex Fields attacked. We see Goldy\u2019s distress quickly give way to rationalization and false equivalence. The word \u201cTrump\u201d appears less than one might expect. But Trump is, of course, everywhere. Antisocial speaks to what has become a pervasive progressive-left anxiety about the influence of misinformation and disinformation on American democracy. You know: Russian hackers, bots, fake news, \u201clow-information\u201d voters, scurrilous Facebook ads. Marantz laments the fall of the journalistic \u201cgatekeepers\u201d who used to arbitrate public discourse. But that \u201cgatekeeping\u201d also brought us Vietnam and Iraq and an establishment whose reflexive favor for the status quo often meant quietism about civil rights and poverty. Marantz recognizes that the gatekeepers had their flaws. His stance on the old media is similar to Churchill\u2019s famous remark that democracy is the worst system except for all the others. But he seems less interested in understanding why the old media lost the trust of so many Americans. He is skeptical of \u201ctwerp bashing\u201d \u2013 the temptation to take cheap swipes at those who run the prestige media \u2013 but misses an opportunity to consider such grievances more seriously. What if our media gatekeepers \u2013 overwhelmingly white, coastal, secular, educated at a handful of elite universities and only 7% Republican \u2013 suffer from profound myopias and bias? What if the media was discredited in the eyes of many long before Mike Cernovich or Periscope came along? Despite his distress at how trolls and reactionaries have \u201chijacked\u201d democracy, Marantz often seems ambivalent about democracy. For years progressives have claimed rightwing propaganda causes Americans to vote against their self-interest. As the sometime Guardian columnist Thomas Frank put it, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Kansas?\u201d But when progressives talk like this they don\u2019t seem that different from the social conservatives upset at liberal democracy because it has brought outcomes \u2013 \u201cdrag queen story hour\u201d, sexual permissiveness \u2013 that they don\u2019t like. The real elephant in the room, made more explicit in Marantz\u2019s recent New York Times op-ed, is his skepticism about freedom of speech. It should be balanced, he argues, against other liberal principles. Of course, Facebook and Twitter and Periscope are private platforms. No one has a constitutional \u201cright\u201d to tweet any more than someone can demand the New York Times print their racist screed. I\u2019m OK with putting PR pressure on private tech companies to de-platform bigots and bad actors. But things get murky quickly. A Facebook page advocating genocide is obviously hate speech. But is a group against gay marriage, or a page critical of child gender transition? What about a Twitter bot that just repeats the phrase \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d? It\u2019s the same with \u201cfake news\u201d. Is a cruel, bullying but factually true statement real or fake news? What about false claims made in satire? What about a claim that is factual but lacks context? Should we ban all conspiracy theories, or just those that are actively harmful? And on and on and on. Marantz has written what may be the definitive book on the nexus of internet culture and the new far right. Whether it is the definitive explanation of the limits of free speech remains to be seen. Generals are always preparing to fight the last war.",

The outcome of such a second referendum should then be accepted by all. That is the only democratic way to transcend the unnecessary and vicious divisiveness that is prevailing now.<br><strong>Pritam Singh, </strong>visiting scholar<br>Wolfson College, University of Oxford<br><strong> </strong></p> <p>Does Nicky Morgan not realise that when she says: \u201cThere is nothing ultimately to be gained for our country or our constituents in any of us remaining stuck in our views from three years ago\u201d, she is giving free licence to those of us who support the idea of a second referendum (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/05/brexit-boris-johnson-plan-eu-nicky-morgan-comment\" title=\"\">I voted Remain but now I\u2019m backing the PM on leaving</a>\u201d, News)? Nowhere does she recognise this, so busy is she justifying her own, sadly somewhat unsurprising, change of heart.<br><strong>Henry Gold</strong><br>Bildeston, Ipswich, Suffolk</p> <h2>A case for eating meat<br></h2> <p>Has the environmental case against meat eating been oversimplified (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/06/jonathan-safran-foer-we-are-the-weather-saving-planet-begins-breakfast-review\" title=\"\">Has the burger had its day?</a>\u201d, Books, New Review)? When flying, for example, an individual\u2019s carbon footprint can be fairly easily quantified, but animal husbandry methods vary across the world and impacts are harder to assess as they are usually constrained by climate, soil and topography. Industrial farming obliterates the natural world and cares nothing for animal welfare. It should cease.</p> <p>We should be eating less meat for health reasons and to release land for rewilding, ie: repairing our natural life support systems. Most of our ancestors saw meat as a luxury; today, the developed world consumes too much of everything and that includes intensively grown cereals, vegetables and fruit. From palm oil to oilseed rape, the farming of non-meat products is destroying the biosphere more surely than much low-intensity livestock rearing.</p> <p>Rather than importing these, would it not be preferable to get some of our protein and vitamins from local, organic, grass-fed beef? Vegetarians need to be as vigilant as meat eaters to avoid industrially produced food that may have involved the destruction of pristine ecosystems, agrichemicals and long, carbon-emitting food miles.<br><strong>Thane Meldrum</strong><br>Almeley, Hereford<br></p> <h2>Justice for Meghan<br></h2> <p>In five short paragraphs, Barbara Ellen has condensed all my own thoughts about Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and her plight with vicious tabloid newspapers (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/05/it-was-gutsy-of-hillary-clinton-to-stand-by-bill-but-it-made-political-sense\" title=\"\">Please don\u2019t let Meghan\u2019s strong spirit be extinguished</a>\u201d, Comment). By falling in love, little did Meghan know what might lie ahead. That her situation coincides with the corrosive and depression-inducing atmosphere surrounding Brexit is most unfortunate. Meghan is indeed a strong, independently minded woman, and this will stand her in good stead, but there is only so much that personal strength can withstand. All power to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in their search for normal, humane justice. <br><strong>Catherine Roome</strong><br>Staplehurst, Tonbridge, Kent<br></p> <h2>Service with a smile<br></h2> <p>Has Jay Rayner forgotten that, for many of us, eating out is not just about the food but the whole package of the room, service and ambience (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/oct/06/moor-hall-lancashire-guys-just-bring-us-the-food-restaurant-review\" title=\"\">Food &amp; drink</a>, <em>Observer</em> Magazine)? Rayner may not have appreciated the tour of garden and kitchen at Moor Hall in Aughton, Lancashire, but we certainly did when we went for lunch on the same day the review appeared. In his rush to get to the table, Rayner will have missed the two additional snacks that were provided during the tour of the kitchen and the meeting with the chef, Mark Birchall.</p> <p>Rayner may have met many chefs and been in many kitchens, but this does not usually happen to members of the paying public. We certainly didn\u2019t find a restaurant basking in its own self-importance, but one of great food, good service and very pleasant staff. <br><strong>Dr Martin Jaffa</strong><br>Prestwich, Manchester<br></p> <h2>Britain has lost its tolerance</h2> <p>I agree with Nick Cohen that migrants in Europe and Britain feel a sense of betrayal and that they have lost a certain idea of Britain as a moderate, tolerant country (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/05/europeans-in-britain-used-to-feel-at-home-now-they-their-doubts\" title=\"\">Europeans in Britain used to feel at home. Now they have their doubts</a>\u201d, Comment). My German wife and many of her European colleagues, who had so much admiration and respect for Britain, now feel unwanted and despised; they are heartbroken. I was recently served drinks at a reception by a Latvian national who tearfully confided that she could not wait to return home. And Cohen is also right that the way a state treats foreigners under its control is indicative of how it will treat the rest of the population if it has the chance. It makes me ashamed to be British.<br><strong>Stan Labovitch</strong><br>Windsor, Berkshire<br></p> <p>Nick Cohen rightly focuses on the creation of insecure minorities by Brexit. I belong to one such that has received little attention. The Good Friday agreement assured \u201cthe people of Northern Ireland\u201d that they would be entitled to \u201cidentify themselves\u2026 as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose\u201d. Unfortunately, an annex to the GFA restricts the definition of the people of Northern Ireland to those born there. It does not extend to all citizens. So, as I was born in England, and despite a 40-year association, 25-year permanent residence, marriage to a Northern Irish woman, it is denied me, whereas an Englishman who has never set foot on the island of Ireland can claim Irish citizenship on the grounds of an Irish-born grandparent. Where is the justice? There are many others like me who are similarly discriminated against. We are forced into, as Cohen said, an identity we do not want.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong><br></p> <h2>Loyalty to people, not country<br></h2> <p>I read Anthony Lipmann\u2019s response to the article about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/28/edmund-de-waal-nazis-banished-my-family-from-vienna-interview\" title=\"\">Edmund de Waal</a> with interest and sympathy (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/06/our-loyalty-uk-not-austria-letters\" title=\"\">Our loyalty is to Britain, not Austria</a>\u201d, Letters). My father and aunt left Vienna on the Kindertransport in early 1939. They spent the next seven years with a British family with whom they had no previous connection and who treated them as their own children. I would not be here if it were not for both the UK\u2019s willingness to take them in and that family\u2019s selflessness.</p> <p>I have reclaimed the Austrian citizenship that my father had taken away. Part of the reason is Brexit, but more than that it feels like putting right something that was wrong. Today\u2019s Austrians are not the people who persecuted my family, any more than the British government of today is the one that gave them a future. I\u2019m afraid I feel that loyalty to any country is nonsense. My loyalty is to the individuals who saved my family then and the individuals now who are doing the same for people in similarly desperate plights and to refugees who are in peril everywhere. <br><strong>Mark Walford</strong><br>London N12<br></p>",

And Blair is right that, with three years of accumulated experience and knowledge, people would be able to make a more informed judgment in the second referendum than was possible in the first. The outcome of such a second referendum should then be accepted by all. That is the only democratic way to transcend the unnecessary and vicious divisiveness that is prevailing now. Pritam Singh, visiting scholar Wolfson College, University of Oxford Does Nicky Morgan not realise that when she says: \u201cThere is nothing ultimately to be gained for our country or our constituents in any of us remaining stuck in our views from three years ago\u201d, she is giving free licence to those of us who support the idea of a second referendum (\u201cI voted Remain but now I\u2019m backing the PM on leaving\u201d, News)? Nowhere does she recognise this, so busy is she justifying her own, sadly somewhat unsurprising, change of heart. Henry Gold Bildeston, Ipswich, Suffolk A case for eating meat Has the environmental case against meat eating been oversimplified (\u201cHas the burger had its day?\u201d, Books, New Review)? When flying, for example, an individual\u2019s carbon footprint can be fairly easily quantified, but animal husbandry methods vary across the world and impacts are harder to assess as they are usually constrained by climate, soil and topography. Industrial farming obliterates the natural world and cares nothing for animal welfare. It should cease. We should be eating less meat for health reasons and to release land for rewilding, ie: repairing our natural life support systems. Most of our ancestors saw meat as a luxury; today, the developed world consumes too much of everything and that includes intensively grown cereals, vegetables and fruit. From palm oil to oilseed rape, the farming of non-meat products is destroying the biosphere more surely than much low-intensity livestock rearing. Rather than importing these, would it not be preferable to get some of our protein and vitamins from local, organic, grass-fed beef? Vegetarians need to be as vigilant as meat eaters to avoid industrially produced food that may have involved the destruction of pristine ecosystems, agrichemicals and long, carbon-emitting food miles. Thane Meldrum Almeley, Hereford Justice for Meghan In five short paragraphs, Barbara Ellen has condensed all my own thoughts about Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and her plight with vicious tabloid newspapers (\u201cPlease don\u2019t let Meghan\u2019s strong spirit be extinguished\u201d, Comment). By falling in love, little did Meghan know what might lie ahead. That her situation coincides with the corrosive and depression-inducing atmosphere surrounding Brexit is most unfortunate. Meghan is indeed a strong, independently minded woman, and this will stand her in good stead, but there is only so much that personal strength can withstand. All power to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in their search for normal, humane justice. Catherine Roome Staplehurst, Tonbridge, Kent Service with a smile Has Jay Rayner forgotten that, for many of us, eating out is not just about the food but the whole package of the room, service and ambience (Food &amp; drink, Observer Magazine)? Rayner may not have appreciated the tour of garden and kitchen at Moor Hall in Aughton, Lancashire, but we certainly did when we went for lunch on the same day the review appeared. In his rush to get to the table, Rayner will have missed the two additional snacks that were provided during the tour of the kitchen and the meeting with the chef, Mark Birchall. Rayner may have met many chefs and been in many kitchens, but this does not usually happen to members of the paying public. We certainly didn\u2019t find a restaurant basking in its own self-importance, but one of great food, good service and very pleasant staff. Dr Martin Jaffa Prestwich, Manchester Britain has lost its tolerance I agree with Nick Cohen that migrants in Europe and Britain feel a sense of betrayal and that they have lost a certain idea of Britain as a moderate, tolerant country (\u201cEuropeans in Britain used to feel at home. Now they have their doubts\u201d, Comment). My German wife and many of her European colleagues, who had so much admiration and respect for Britain, now feel unwanted and despised; they are heartbroken. I was recently served drinks at a reception by a Latvian national who tearfully confided that she could not wait to return home. And Cohen is also right that the way a state treats foreigners under its control is indicative of how it will treat the rest of the population if it has the chance. It makes me ashamed to be British. Stan Labovitch Windsor, Berkshire Nick Cohen rightly focuses on the creation of insecure minorities by Brexit. I belong to one such that has received little attention. The Good Friday agreement assured \u201cthe people of Northern Ireland\u201d that they would be entitled to \u201cidentify themselves\u2026 as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose\u201d. Unfortunately, an annex to the GFA restricts the definition of the people of Northern Ireland to those born there. It does not extend to all citizens. So, as I was born in England, and despite a 40-year association, 25-year permanent residence, marriage to a Northern Irish woman, it is denied me, whereas an Englishman who has never set foot on the island of Ireland can claim Irish citizenship on the grounds of an Irish-born grandparent. Where is the justice? There are many others like me who are similarly discriminated against. We are forced into, as Cohen said, an identity we do not want. Name and address supplied Loyalty to people, not country I read Anthony Lipmann\u2019s response to the article about Edmund de Waal with interest and sympathy (\u201cOur loyalty is to Britain, not Austria\u201d, Letters). My father and aunt left Vienna on the Kindertransport in early 1939. They spent the next seven years with a British family with whom they had no previous connection and who treated them as their own children. I would not be here if it were not for both the UK\u2019s willingness to take them in and that family\u2019s selflessness. I have reclaimed the Austrian citizenship that my father had taken away. Part of the reason is Brexit, but more than that it feels like putting right something that was wrong. Today\u2019s Austrians are not the people who persecuted my family, any more than the British government of today is the one that gave them a future. I\u2019m afraid I feel that loyalty to any country is nonsense. My loyalty is to the individuals who saved my family then and the individuals now who are doing the same for people in similarly desperate plights and to refugees who are in peril everywhere.

(ITV2) | ITV Hub Finally my Saturday nights have something worth watching once more, in the shape of the seventh (don\u2019t really know why the italics: it\u2019s richly deserved) series of Spiral, the supremely classy Canal+/BBC Four, deep, dirty thriller set firmly in the French language. We even got to see, for all of, ooh, eight minutes or so, the Paris of filmic memory: the boulevards and baguettes and sexy little canals. More than nice, but this isn\u2019t what this is at all about: too soon we are plunged into the filthier arrondissements, the ones sprawling darkly beyond the peripherique, home to scooter gangs, drugs and every kind of laundering available to dirty men. Two of the three stars have survived series six, in which the tight-knit CID team eventually got their men but emerged bruised and battered: they\u2019ve lost the principled Tintin, finally fed up covering for the corrupt life-force that is \u201cGilou\u201d Escoffier. Gilou\u2019s back and now in charge, with a smart new deputy, Ali, while Laure recovers from her breakdown: but she, too, is soon back in the fold, shocked as they all are by the gunning down of Commissioner Herville. And, thankfully, the lovely examining magistrate Juge Roban (Philippe Duclos), with, perhaps, romance (with a twist) on the horizon? The strength is the sheer breadth and depth of all characteristion. Within even half an episode you too will feel as if you know them, and will almost be able to tell when the pot-faced Gilou is going to take it empathetic with a vulnerable crim, and equally when he\u2019s likely to lose it over an imagined slight, the friable bastard, and smash a fat glass ashtray into someone\u2019s nose. All glorious. Happy days. I made the mistake a few weeks ago of powering through every single outing of Nick Hornby\u2019s lovely, subtle State of the Union in a single night. I won\u2019t be erring in similar fashion with the latest series of Motherland, even though it\u2019s tempting, it all having been dumped on iPlayer in one greedy gloop. No, I\u2019ll savour it: and the opener (all right, opening two) have riches to savour indeed.

To, first of all, Julia (Anna Maxwell Martin) and her jealous disdain \u2013 her wordless, mouth-stretching half-sneers to every one of Meg\u2019s matey gambits are a joy to half-behold \u2013 and, then, her sneaking admiration: might Meg even be a role-model, a mentor, someone who can help her navigate the vicissitudes of middle-class London motherhood? No. Julia sinks back to her comfort levels of harried incompetence \u2013 and even below those levels, soon taking to arriving at the losers\u2019 table in the cafe in sweatpants and cheap faux-furry coat.

Broadcasting all day and night for the length of the protests (7-20 October), and hosted by that ever-burgeoning, admirably alternative online broadcaster Soho Radio, <strong><a href=\"https://www.sohoradiolondon.com/rebel-radio/\" title=\"\">Rebel Radio</a></strong> does what most radio stations do: play music tracks, with a bit of chat in between.</p> <p>If you tune in during the day, you\u2019ll hear a lot more music than information (<em><a href=\"https://www.sohoradiolondon.com/presenters/morning-glory/\" title=\"\">Morning Glory</a></em>, Soho Radio\u2019s usual 10am-12pm show, is still there), but there are a couple of Rebel Radio anchor programmes: <em>GMXR</em>, a debrief from leading campaigners, on around breakfast time; <em>Not Too Late</em>, made by the ex-producers of Radio 3\u2019s <em>Late Junction</em>, at 9pm; and <em>Don\u2019t Drive Time</em>, at teatime, hosted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-hutchinson\" title=\"\">Kate Hutchinson</a>. Hutchinson brought us the brilliant <em><a href=\"https://www.thelastbohemians.co.uk/\" title=\"\">The Last Bohemians</a></em> podcast, so I have a lot of time for her. As with most of Rebel Radio, <em>Don\u2019t Drive Time</em> is made slightly on the hoof, bringing in sympathetic guests as and when they are available: the guests are often plucked straight from the protests by someone just asking them if they\u2019d mind talking on the radio. So, on Tuesday evening, Simon Amstell popped in, Polly Toynbee spoke over the phone, and Fay Milton from Savages also had a chat. (As a side point, before <em>Don\u2019t Drive Time</em>, I very much enjoyed the voices of ordinary protesters, recorded from various XR protests across the world.)</p> <p>If you wanted to be picky, you might moan about the lack of what\u2019s often called radio \u201cfurniture\u201d, both prerecorded and presenter-led: there aren\u2019t quite enough audience pointers, along the lines of \u201cHello, this is XXX and you\u2019re listening to\u2026\u201d And Hutchinson, at the opening of both shows, seemed slightly nervous. But, to be honest, slickness is not what this programme, nor this radio station, is truly about. Hutchinson might not have the on-air ease of a DJ veteran, but she is excellent when talking to other people, and her interview with Amstell was one of the best I\u2019ve heard with him. Clearly enjoying himself, Amstell merrily and uproariously talked about being a vegan, about how grime star JME no longer replies to his emails, about taking ayahuasca, how good-looking all the protesters seemed to be, and how he partly became involved in the protests because he liked Extinction Rebellion\u2019s graphic logo.</p> <p>Amstell also spoke about how hard it can be to change the habits of a lifetime. \u201cThe truth is painful and you have to deal with it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a grieving period about climate change and then you think, \u2018How do I joyfully be a rebel?\u2019 \u2026 people carry pain in their body for a long time, partly because they\u2019re used to it\u2026 and so I think there\u2019s a panic about anything that is different, because it isn\u2019t familiar. People feel threatened by the movement because it makes everything seem ridiculous, like: \u2018I\u2019ve just bought a house, is that all right?\u2019 We need systemic change\u2026 Or is it systematic? Like in Greased Lightning?\u201d</p> <p>Amstell\u2019s slightly nutty energy made Toynbee\u2019s interview, later on in the programme, seem a little staid, though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/pollytoynbee\" title=\"\">the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/pollytoynbee\" title=\"\">Guardian</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/pollytoynbee\" title=\"\"> columnist</a> made some excellent points about the need for the XR movement to convince politicians that there are votes in countering climate change. Later on, <em>Not Too Late</em> provided a weirdly familiar listen for those who used to love the experimentalism of <em>Late Junction</em>, though there are different presenters on different nights, such as Max Reinhardt and Josie Long. The whole feel of Rebel Radio reminds me a bit of Resonance FM: it has Resonance\u2019s warm experimentalism and engaging hands-on feel. The music choice can occasionally be a bit chin-scratchy, the presentation a little erratic, but this is a station, and a message, that is clearly worth at least some of anyone and everyone\u2019s time.</p> <h2>Three dramedy double acts that aren\u2019t Joan and Jericha</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/heavypencil\" title=\"\">Heavy Pencil</a></strong><strong><br></strong>Michael Cork is a veteran actor who calls to speak to his agent, Margot.

      "bodyText": "Rebel Radio | Soho Radio Extinction Rebellion (XR), which if you haven\u2019t noticed has been organising global peaceful protests against climate change over last week and the next, has an accompanying temporary radio station in the UK. Broadcasting all day and night for the length of the protests (7-20 October), and hosted by that ever-burgeoning, admirably alternative online broadcaster Soho Radio, Rebel Radio does what most radio stations do: play music tracks, with a bit of chat in between. If you tune in during the day, you\u2019ll hear a lot more music than information (Morning Glory, Soho Radio\u2019s usual 10am-12pm show, is still there), but there are a couple of Rebel Radio anchor programmes: GMXR, a debrief from leading campaigners, on around breakfast time; Not Too Late, made by the ex-producers of Radio 3\u2019s Late Junction, at 9pm; and Don\u2019t Drive Time, at teatime, hosted by Kate Hutchinson. Hutchinson brought us the brilliant The Last Bohemians podcast, so I have a lot of time for her. As with most of Rebel Radio, Don\u2019t Drive Time is made slightly on the hoof, bringing in sympathetic guests as and when they are available: the guests are often plucked straight from the protests by someone just asking them if they\u2019d mind talking on the radio. So, on Tuesday evening, Simon Amstell popped in, Polly Toynbee spoke over the phone, and Fay Milton from Savages also had a chat. (As a side point, before Don\u2019t Drive Time, I very much enjoyed the voices of ordinary protesters, recorded from various XR protests across the world.) If you wanted to be picky, you might moan about the lack of what\u2019s often called radio \u201cfurniture\u201d, both prerecorded and presenter-led: there aren\u2019t quite enough audience pointers, along the lines of \u201cHello, this is XXX and you\u2019re listening to\u2026\u201d And Hutchinson, at the opening of both shows, seemed slightly nervous. But, to be honest, slickness is not what this programme, nor this radio station, is truly about. Hutchinson might not have the on-air ease of a DJ veteran, but she is excellent when talking to other people, and her interview with Amstell was one of the best I\u2019ve heard with him.

      "bodyText": "The Australian film-maker David Mich\u00f4d has been interested in the themes of lineage, loyalty, corruption and succession since his 2010 crime drama debut Animal Kingdom. It makes sense, then, that four films into his career (and with a Netflix-sized budget) he\u2019d scale up \u2013 and what could be more high stakes than Shakespeare? Borrowing his characters from Henry IV Parts 1 and 2 and Henry V but dispensing with his iambic pentameter, Mich\u00f4d and co-writer Joel Edgerton fashion The King as a straightforward and plainspoken coming-of-age tale centring on Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\u2019s Prince Hal. A dishevelled and drunken party boy unfit for, and uninterested in, inheriting the throne, Hal finds himself thrust into power (and a fur-trimmed velvet cape befitting Cruella de Vil) anyway following the deaths of his father Henry IV (Ben Mendelsohn) and younger brother Thomas (Dean-Charles Chapman). Soon enough, the self-proclaimed pacifist is willingly mussing his Goldsmiths-issue haircut in combat following a provocation issued by the Dauphin of France, played by a smirking Robert Pattinson with a blond wig and a goofy accent that distracts but nevertheless entertains. The battle scenes have a crunchy, tactile feel, all swords slicing chainmail, but there\u2019s something standard-issue slick about the rest of the proceedings. An overhead crowd shot of the mud-streaked Battle of Agincourt appears to crib directly from Game of Thrones\u2019 Battle of the Bastards. Hal\u2019s right-hand man Falstaff (Joel Edgerton) has also been sanded down. In this version he\u2019s less lively tragicomic foil than unflappable, infallible soldier. Even more frustrating is Chalamet\u2019s Hal, who is never as compelling as the machinations around him. There\u2019s no sincere inner conflict, neither righteous pride nor concealed Machiavellian impulse. Alas there is only inevitable competence.",

      "body": "<p>The award of the Stirling prize to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/11/spacious-and-green-norwich-award-winning-new-council-houses-goldsmith-street\" title=\"\">Goldsmith Street</a> in Norwich has rightly been hailed as an affirmation of the essential role of well-designed council housing in modern Britain. For the prize, given by the Royal Institute of British Architects to the best building project of the year, has gone to an enclave of homes for rent at affordable prices, with secure tenancies, built by Norwich city council.</p> <p>Designed by the architects Mikhail Riches with Cathy Hawley, it is built to exceptionally high environmental standards, with energy bills about 70% lower than average. Its layout aims to maximise the outdoor space available to children and pedestrians, with cars kept to the edge of the site. It is thoughtful, humanly scaled and well detailed. It also, unlike some council housing of the past, does not set itself apart, or mark out its residents as different kinds of citizens from everyone else. It is a piece of a city like many others.</p> <p>Goldsmith Street is part of a resurgence in council housing in recent years. If in the postwar years it was seen as the principal means of addressing housing need, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government effectively ended it. At the same time, her introduction of the right of council tenants <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/26/right-to-buy-margaret-thatcher-david-cameron-housing-crisis\" title=\"\">to buy their homes</a> progressively reduced the existing stock. Now, albeit within borrowing and spending rules set by central government, some local authorities are picking up where their predecessors stopped more than a generation ago. Many of these are in London, where the high values of land already owned by councils helps them to fund housing.</p> <p>In relation to the country\u2019s continuing and huge housing problems, which are matters of both price and availability, it is now widely recognised that council housing, alongside housing associations and private housebuilders, has a significant role to play.

      "bodyText": "The award of the Stirling prize to Goldsmith Street in Norwich has rightly been hailed as an affirmation of the essential role of well-designed council housing in modern Britain. For the prize, given by the Royal Institute of British Architects to the best building project of the year, has gone to an enclave of homes for rent at affordable prices, with secure tenancies, built by Norwich city council. Designed by the architects Mikhail Riches with Cathy Hawley, it is built to exceptionally high environmental standards, with energy bills about 70% lower than average. Its layout aims to maximise the outdoor space available to children and pedestrians, with cars kept to the edge of the site. It is thoughtful, humanly scaled and well detailed. It also, unlike some council housing of the past, does not set itself apart, or mark out its residents as different kinds of citizens from everyone else. It is a piece of a city like many others. Goldsmith Street is part of a resurgence in council housing in recent years. If in the postwar years it was seen as the principal means of addressing housing need, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government effectively ended it. At the same time, her introduction of the right of council tenants to buy their homes progressively reduced the existing stock. Now, albeit within borrowing and spending rules set by central government, some local authorities are picking up where their predecessors stopped more than a generation ago. Many of these are in London, where the high values of land already owned by councils helps them to fund housing. In relation to the country\u2019s continuing and huge housing problems, which are matters of both price and availability, it is now widely recognised that council housing, alongside housing associations and private housebuilders, has a significant role to play. Conservative politicians can sometimes be heard to speak in favour of council housing, which is a remarkable transformation. But there is very much more to be done. The 105 homes in Goldsmith Street took 12 years from inception to completion, partly because of the complex ways that local authorities have to operate, compounded by the 2008 crash. According to the National Housing Federation, which represents the country\u2019s housing associations, England needs 145,000 new \u201csocial homes\u201d per year. The precise level of such figures is always debatable, but the scale of the problem is not much in doubt to the millions who experience its effects. What is needed is for the issue to be addressed with considerably more determination and belief than has so far been the case. Government policy has been one of mild encouragement towards local authorities, combined with occasional knockbacks. Last week, for example, it was announced that finance from the public works loan board (PWLB), through which the Treasury lends money to local authorities, would now cost an additional 1% in interest. Sharon Taylor, the leader of Stevenage council \u2013 and there are many others who feel the same \u2013 said that this \u201ctrashed\u201d its plans for building housing. In its public pronouncements, including at its recent conference, the Conservative party continues to emphasise the expansion of home ownership, the issue that proved electorally potent for them in the 1980s. They want housing association tenants to be able to buy their homes. They continue to promote their help-to-buy policy of government loans to home buyers, which, in at least some parts of the country, has had the self-defeating effect of pushing up prices.

Authorities lifted rain and flood warnings for the Kanto region around a becalmed Tokyo before dawn on Sunday but imposed them on areas further north after super-typhoon Hagibis blasted through the capital. Attention focused on Fukushima, where Tokyo Electric Power Co overnight reported irregular readings from sensors monitoring water in its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, which was crippled by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Seven people died in Chiba, Gunma, Kanagawa and Fukushima prefectures surrounding Tokyo, according to public broadcaster NHK. Among them was a man in his 60s who was found with no vital signs in a flooded apartment in Kawasaki, NHK said. Seventeen were missing early on Sunday, it said. Evacuation orders had been issued to more than 800,000 households in Tokyo on Saturday as Hagibis threatened power cuts and widespread flooding. Storm surges and high waves raised sea levels by more than a metre along some stretches of the coast, and waters in Tokyo Bay were up by 50cm, increasing the danger of severe flooding in the city centre. The heavy rain caused a river in Nagano prefecture, north-west of Tokyo, to flood its banks.
