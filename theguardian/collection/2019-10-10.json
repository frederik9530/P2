The fact that he got it now proves that he was right. This is Sweden today: an apologist of war crimes gets a Nobel prize while the country fully participated in the character assassination of the true hero of our times, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/julian-assange\">Julian Assange</a>. Our reaction should be: not the literature Nobel prize for Handke but the Nobel peace prize for Assange.\u201d</p> <p>Slovenian author Miha Mazzini said: \u201cSome artists sold their human souls for ideologies (Hamsun and Nazism), some for hate (Celine and his rabid antisemitism), some for money and power (Kusturica) but the one that offended me the most was Handke with his naivety for the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 regime. And it\u2019s personal. I will never forget the cold winter when Yugoslavia was falling apart and there was nothing on the shelves of the stores. We were a young family and my daughter was a toddler and it was bitterly cold. I\u2019d spent the whole day in the queue for the heating oil and in the evening, almost frozen, I started reading <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/18/world/german-writer-sets-off-storm-on-serbia.html\">Handke\u2019s essay about Yugoslavia</a>. He wrote of how he envied me: while those Austrians and Germans, those westerners, had fallen for consumerism, we, Yugoslavs, had to queue and fight for everything. Oh, how close to the nature we were! How less materialistic and more spiritualised we were! Even at the time, I found him cruel and totally self-absorbed in his naivety.\u201d</p> <p>And in a statement issued on Thursday, novelist Jennifer Egan, president of literature and human rights organisation Pen America, said that while Pen \u201cdoes not generally comment on other institutions\u2019 literary awards ... today\u2019s announcement must be an exception.</p> <p>\u201cWe are dumbfounded by the selection of a writer who has used his public voice to undercut historical truth and offer public succor to perpetrators of genocide, like former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic,\u201d Egan continued. \u201cWe reject the decision that a writer who has persistently called into question thoroughly documented war crimes deserves to be celebrated for his \u2018linguistic ingenuity.\u2019 At a moment of rising nationalism, autocratic leadership, and widespread disinformation around the world, the literary community deserves better than this. We deeply regret the Nobel Committee on Literature\u2019s choice.\u201d</p> <p>Handke\u2019s politics have long been derided by former friends and authors. In 2008, novelist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathan-littell\">Jonathan Littell</a> remarked: \u201cHe might be a fantastic artist, but as a human being he is my enemy \u2026 he\u2019s an asshole.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/24/alain-finkielkraut-winds-of-antisemitism-in-europe-gilets-jaune\">Alain Finkielkraut</a> called him \u201can ideological monster\u201d, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/dec/29/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\">Susan Sontag</a>, who spent several months in Sarajevo during the Bosnian war staging a performance of Waiting for Godot, said Handke\u2019s comments had \u201cfinished\u201d him among his former friends in New York.</p> <p>Dr Helen Finch, associate professor in German at the University of Leeds, praised Handke\u2019s ability to explore \u201cthe fringes of human experience in an extraordinary way and for his \u201cearly and complex form of ecopoetics\u201d, but said his Nobel win \u201cshows that the prize committee is still infatuated by white European men writing in an elitist poetic tradition, and is cloth-eared to the political complicity of those men\u201d.</p> <p>Some were pleased by Handke\u2019s win, however: Serbian media lined up to praise the decision, calling Handke a \u201cgreat friend\u201d, while Austrian president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/04/victory-for-van-der-bellen-and-the-left-is-a-sigh-of-relief-for-europe\">Alexander Van der Bellen</a> called Handke\u2019s voice \u201cunfussy and unique \u2026 We have a lot to thank Peter Handke for.

It didn\u2019t sound like a joke and no one was laughing, but that\u2019s maybe because protesters such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/07/charlottesville-james-fields-guilty-murder-heather-heyer\">Heather Heyer in Charlottesville</a> have been killed in such a manner.</p> <p>Bad behaviour has been around forever, but shame has historically kept the behaviour in check by operating as a warning mechanism not to transgress in the first place or, if that fails, triggering consequences for transgressing.</p> <p>If we feel ashamed about something, we either hide it or resolve to amend or examine our behaviour so the shameful act isn\u2019t repeated. It\u2019s how we\u2019ve evolved \u2013 our animal or reptile brain with its instincts towards pleasure, aggression and other base instincts is kept in check by the prefrontal cortex. This is the rational part of the brain that responds to situations with good judgment, conscience and an awareness of social norms.</p> <p>The 19th century Russian philosopher Vladimir Solovyov believed shame is what separates us from animals. Although he was a creature of his time, hung up on sexual shame, his writing can be applied to all areas of shame, including speaking unthinkingly, lying, hurting others, being violent or aggressive to others, being disloyal.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump can betray American allies, be accused of sexual misconduct by 43 women and enrich himself, his family and businesses by his presidency \u2013 and he just bounces along, unashamed. He really could \u201cstand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody\u201d and still not lose any voters. Boris Johnson too is operating in a shame-free zone. It\u2019s not just the lies in the lead-up to the Brexit referendum, his rhetoric damning \u201celites\u201d when he went to Eton and Oxford, and the allegations of unwanted thigh squeezes to women in 1999. Recently he was accused of lying to the Queen. Prince Andrew has refused to be ashamed of his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, his friends telling an incredulous public via the Sunday Times that the three days he spent in Epstein\u2019s mansion were allegedly for the purposes of ending their friendship. And in Australia this week, the daytime television presenter Kerri-Anne Kennerley showed no shame when she said that Extinction Rebellion protesters deserved to be run over by motorists (they should \u201cuse them as a speed bump\u201d) or starved in jail. The following day her network, Channel Ten, said the remarks were \u201cclearly a joke\u201d. It didn\u2019t sound like a joke and no one was laughing, but that\u2019s maybe because protesters such as Heather Heyer in Charlottesville have been killed in such a manner. Bad behaviour has been around forever, but shame has historically kept the behaviour in check by operating as a warning mechanism not to transgress in the first place or, if that fails, triggering consequences for transgressing. If we feel ashamed about something, we either hide it or resolve to amend or examine our behaviour so the shameful act isn\u2019t repeated. It\u2019s how we\u2019ve evolved \u2013 our animal or reptile brain with its instincts towards pleasure, aggression and other base instincts is kept in check by the prefrontal cortex. This is the rational part of the brain that responds to situations with good judgment, conscience and an awareness of social norms. The 19th century Russian philosopher Vladimir Solovyov believed shame is what separates us from animals. Although he was a creature of his time, hung up on sexual shame, his writing can be applied to all areas of shame, including speaking unthinkingly, lying, hurting others, being violent or aggressive to others, being disloyal. He believed \u201ca being who is ashamed of his animality in that very fact proves himself to be more than a mere animal\u201d. So the awareness of shame itself denoted a higher level of consciousness. Although these days you can spend decades in therapy trying to exorcise your shame (or if you go to Jungian therapy, at least integrate your shadow side), some small measure of shame still serves a social and moral purpose. It is part of what provides social cohesion, particularly if a community has a common understanding of shameful behaviour.

When you take away shame at the highest levels of leadership, there is the initial, primitive and disturbing thrill of seeing the normally regulated and submerged id unleashed (the early days of Trump\u2019s Twitter feed prompted such a \u201ccan\u2019t look away\u201d impulse).

      "body": "<p>Playwright Anchuli Felicia King is on a tight schedule. This year alone, the 25-year-old\u2019s plays have taken her to opposite sides of the world: from London\u2019s Royal Court, where she premiered her first full-length play, White Pearl, to the Melbourne Theatre Company, where Golden Shield has just finished up its run. To put it in King\u2019s own words, it\u2019s been \u201cfucking crazy\u201d.</p> <p>Now, King\u2019s in rehearsals for two shows simultaneously: Slaughterhouse (part of Belvoir Downstairs\u2019 independent programming, 25A) and the Australian premiere of White Pearl, a co-production between Sydney Theatre Company and the National Theatre of Parramatta. That\u2019s where I catch her, as she\u2019s describing her daily commuting plans between theatre venues at two ends of Sydney, as \u2013 most simply \u2013 \u201ccooked\u201d.</p> <p>She reflects on the soaring trajectory of her own short but successful writing career with a similar breathlessness: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as writer\u2019s block. I can write bad material, but I have to get <em>something</em> out!\u201d King says, with a laugh.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/may/04/anchuli-felicia-king-white-pearl-royal-court-debut-interview\">Anchuli Felicia King: \u2018What I love about theatre is that it\u2019s innately communal\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>King dons multiple hats with both upcoming shows \u2013 not only as playwright but also video designer, who brings her plays to life using live cameras and projectors. Another constant in her works are the themes of globalisation and technology, and their interplay with millennial startup culture.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing I\u2019m fascinated by with startup culture is the move-fast-break-things-disrupt-at-any-cost mentality, which is not sustainable,\u201d King explains. \u201cOur generation is grappling with that [globally] at the moment.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f7cc13f2aec6866654b8a09b688c6c3a0612f97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f7cc13f2aec6866654b8a09b688c6c3a0612f97/0_124_2139_1283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anchuli Felicia King and director Priscilla Jackman in the rehearsal room for White Pearl.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anchuli Felicia King and director Priscilla Jackman in the rehearsal room for White Pearl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied by NTP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Slaughterhouse, a monologue satire, focuses on five characters at an ethical eating startup after an act of violence has occurred, each of them telling their version of what they believe led to the company\u2019s downfall. White Pearl, on the other hand, opens on a racist PR disaster at a cosmetic company, and its attempts at damage control unravel into increasing chaos in horrifying, black-comedy fashion.</p> <p>Both plays have another thing in common: culturally and ethnically diverse casts. As a Thai-Australian artist, writing \u201cidiosyncratic, very weird\u201d parts for Asian actors was at the top of King\u2019s mind \u2013 particularly in the conception of White Pearl, which is set in the cultural melting pot of Singapore. \u201cI have the opportunity to give really interesting, meaty roles to Asian actors, which I haven\u2019t seen very much on stage,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need plays that speak to now \u2013 where Asian people get to be three-dimensional.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/may/17/white-pearl-review-royal-court-london-anchuli-felicia-king-singapore-beauty-industry\">White Pearl review \u2013 a racist ad, and a bracingly funny corporate satire</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For King, part of that involves debunking traditional western assumptions. In most scripts, it\u2019s assumed a character will be white unless otherwise stipulated; in hers, she specifies if they\u2019re Caucasian. \u201cWhy would [white characters] ever be the default?\u201d she asks, almost incredulously. \u201cCulture and ethnicity are part of what I\u2019m talking about in terms of the politics of globalisation, so it would be impossible for me to not specify that in a character.

      "bodyText": "Playwright Anchuli Felicia King is on a tight schedule. This year alone, the 25-year-old\u2019s plays have taken her to opposite sides of the world: from London\u2019s Royal Court, where she premiered her first full-length play, White Pearl, to the Melbourne Theatre Company, where Golden Shield has just finished up its run. To put it in King\u2019s own words, it\u2019s been \u201cfucking crazy\u201d. Now, King\u2019s in rehearsals for two shows simultaneously: Slaughterhouse (part of Belvoir Downstairs\u2019 independent programming, 25A) and the Australian premiere of White Pearl, a co-production between Sydney Theatre Company and the National Theatre of Parramatta. That\u2019s where I catch her, as she\u2019s describing her daily commuting plans between theatre venues at two ends of Sydney, as \u2013 most simply \u2013 \u201ccooked\u201d. She reflects on the soaring trajectory of her own short but successful writing career with a similar breathlessness: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as writer\u2019s block. I can write bad material, but I have to get something out!\u201d King says, with a laugh. King dons multiple hats with both upcoming shows \u2013 not only as playwright but also video designer, who brings her plays to life using live cameras and projectors. Another constant in her works are the themes of globalisation and technology, and their interplay with millennial startup culture. \u201cThe thing I\u2019m fascinated by with startup culture is the move-fast-break-things-disrupt-at-any-cost mentality, which is not sustainable,\u201d King explains. \u201cOur generation is grappling with that [globally] at the moment.\u201d Slaughterhouse, a monologue satire, focuses on five characters at an ethical eating startup after an act of violence has occurred, each of them telling their version of what they believe led to the company\u2019s downfall. White Pearl, on the other hand, opens on a racist PR disaster at a cosmetic company, and its attempts at damage control unravel into increasing chaos in horrifying, black-comedy fashion. Both plays have another thing in common: culturally and ethnically diverse casts. As a Thai-Australian artist, writing \u201cidiosyncratic, very weird\u201d parts for Asian actors was at the top of King\u2019s mind \u2013 particularly in the conception of White Pearl, which is set in the cultural melting pot of Singapore. \u201cI have the opportunity to give really interesting, meaty roles to Asian actors, which I haven\u2019t seen very much on stage,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need plays that speak to now \u2013 where Asian people get to be three-dimensional.\u201d For King, part of that involves debunking traditional western assumptions. In most scripts, it\u2019s assumed a character will be white unless otherwise stipulated; in hers, she specifies if they\u2019re Caucasian. \u201cWhy would [white characters] ever be the default?\u201d she asks, almost incredulously. \u201cCulture and ethnicity are part of what I\u2019m talking about in terms of the politics of globalisation, so it would be impossible for me to not specify that in a character. There\u2019s no \u2018neutral\u2019 in my plays.\u201d Detailed character descriptions, King says, can eliminate any leeway for moral judgement when determining who should or shouldn\u2019t play certain roles. For example, Sunny in White Pearl is described as a \u201cChinese-Singaporean who speaks with a Singlish dude-bro accent that\u2019s more Singlish depending on who she is talking to\u201d \u2013 which meant finding an actress who really resonated with the part. \u201cIn my author\u2019s note for the London version of [White Pearl], I just wrote: \u2018Don\u2019t be a dick\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cBe culturally cognisant. Talk to your actors about whether they\u2019re comfortable or not comfortable playing a certain role. Reach out to the entire Asian community. Do the work.\u201d Though King is wholly invested in the power of Asian representation, which has seen improving statistics in Hollywood over the past couple of years, with films such as The Farewell and Crazy Rich Asians becoming box-office smashes, she\u2019s also quick to point out Asia as an \u201cincredibly fractious region\u201d.

A town of around 241,000 inhabitants, Halle usually defies the stereotype of the former lands of socialist East Germany as a fertile ground for the rise of the new far right. The Paulus quarter, where Wednesday\u2019s attack took place, is a leafy, period district popular with students and university lecturers: there are French bistros, vegan ice cream bars and pavements daubed in Extinction Rebellion graffiti.

It story goes on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Derby North MP was suspended in February after he claimed that Labour had been \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d in response to criticism of its handling of antisemitism allegations. </p> \n   <p>He was readmitted to the party and issued with a formal warning following a hearing of a national executive committee (NEC) antisemitism panel in June - prompting an outcry from MPs, peers and Jewish groups. </p> \n   <p>But he was suspended again in July after a second panel reviewed the decision to reinstate him and found it \u201ccannot safely stand\u201d. </p> \n   <p>Labour also imposed a separate suspension on September 3 over additional allegations of misconduct. </p> \n   <p>At a hearing in September, Williamson\u2019s lawyers argued that his treatment had been \u201cmanifestly unfair\u201d and asked the high court to declare his suspension from the party was void. </p> \n   <p>Giving judgment this afternoon, Mr Justice Pepperall ruled that \u201cthe Labour party acted unfairly in that there was no proper reason for reopening the case against Mr Williamson\u201d. </p> \n   <p>However, the judge found that there was \u201cnothing in the new allegations, the timing of the letter of 3 September or the decision to suspend that entitles me to take the view upon the papers that the Labour party is acting either unfairly or other than in good faith\u201d. </p> \n   <p>He added: \u201cI therefore refuse relief in respect of Mr Williamson\u2019s recent re-suspension. The new disciplinary case must run its course.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Williamson himself has posted a thread on Twitter about the case.

My take on each passage is below.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The prime minister and taoiseach have had a detailed and constructive discussion.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>\u201cDetailed\u201d and \u201cconstructive\u201d are the key words, and both are positive.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Both continue to believe that a deal is in everybody\u2019s interest. They agreed that they could see a pathway to a possible deal.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The first sentence does not amount to much, because it is what all sides have always said from the moment the Brexit talks started. The second sentence is the most significant, and the one that has sent the pound moving up. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/10/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-varadkar-corbyn-no-deal-would-put-lives-at-risk-says-former-chief-medical-officer-live-news?page=with:block-5d9f3f5f8f084862358fb978#block-5d9f3f5f8f084862358fb978\"> 3.25pm.)</a> It is more positive than people were expecting, and it implies that the Brexit talks are now at least off their deathbed.</p> \n  <p>But does it mean much more than that? We don\u2019t know. It is worth noting that there are two qualifiers in this sentence: \u201cThey agreed that they could see a <em>pathway</em> to a <em>possible </em>deal.\u201d</p> \n  <p>And does it mean they are both looking the same pathway? No one has ever had problems imagining a possible deal, or a pathway to it. The trouble has been finding one acceptable to all veto players in this process: the EU, Dublin, parliament, the Conservative party, the ERG and the DUP.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Their discussion concentrated on the challenges of customs and consen<strong>t.</strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>That is no surprise, because these are the two main features of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan identified as unacceptable by Dublin and Brussels.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>They also discussed the potential to strengthen bilateral relations, including on Northern Ireland.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>It is not clear what this refers to, although the UK government quite often talks about the desirability of improving bilateral relations with Dublin, particularly when they are under strain.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>They agreed to reflect further on their discussions and that officials would continue to engage intensively on them.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This sentence is moderately positive: \u201creflect further\u201d means no one will be pulling the plug on the talks process today, and the reference to officials implies they have some new ideas to discuss.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Following their discussions the taoiseach will consult with the taskforce 50 and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> secretary Stephen Barclay will meet Michel Barnier tomorrow morning.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Originally Barclay and Barnier were due to meet today, but that meeting got put back until Friday. There were some suggestions that, if today went badly, it would get cancelled. The fact it is going ahead means neither side wants to give up yet.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-10T15:00:03.418Z\">at 4.00pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d9f3f5f8f084862358fb978\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-10T14:25:56.081Z\">3.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>From Sky\u2019s economics editor <strong>Ed Conway</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky/status/1182300282711093252\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Pound shoots higher vs dollar after PM concludes talks with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeoVaradkar?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@LeoVaradkar</a> and says: \"both continue to believe that a deal is in everyone's interest.

We would put every bit of possible pressure we could on the United states. </p> \n   <p>If we could mount legal action in the United States, we would do so because it is simply not acceptable for someone to seek diplomatic immunity when somebody - a wholly innocent individual - has been killed by the behaviour of somebody else.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn restated his determination to have a general election before holding a referendum on Brexit.</strong> As <strong>Kate Devlin</strong> reports <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/corbyn-will-split-party-by-pressing-for-election-tjjtfmzzf?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&amp;utm_campaign=5ecd5fafd2-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_10_10_05_57&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_10959edeb5-5ecd5fafd2-189782117\">in today\u2019s Times (paywall)</a>, some Labour MPs want the party to unite with other opposition parties and insist on a referendum first, not least because current polling suggests Labour would lose the election. <strong>Tony Blair </strong>has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/08/brexit-lates-news-boris-johnons-dominic-cummings-accused-of-being-source-of-unofficial-no-10-threat-to-retaliate-against-eu-countries-that-back-extension-live-news?page=with:block-5d9cb5238f081108db9c47e7#block-5d9cb5238f081108db9c47e7\">making this argument strongly too.</a> In her story Devlin says:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Many Labour MPs are desperate to avoid an election during a delay to Brexit and lobbied Mr Corbyn directly over the issue last week.

(See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/10/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-varadkar-corbyn-no-deal-would-put-lives-at-risk-says-former-chief-medical-officer-live-news?page=with:block-5d9f0a308f084862358fb686#block-5d9f0a308f084862358fb686\"> 11.44am.)</a></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn said that he would want EU reform to be part of any proposal for the UK to remain in the EU</strong>. Labour\u2019s plan is to negotiate a deal for a soft Brexit with the EU, and to then offer voters a choice between that option and remain. But, speaking in the Q&amp;A, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>After an election a Labour government would introduce legislation to ensure a referendum takes place between the agreement that we would reach with the European Union and remain. I have to say, in remain I would also want to see some reforms to the European Union.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>It is hard to know what this would mean in practice, but it is not likely to enthuse any EU leaders hoping for a Labour government and the possibility of the UK voting to stay in. EU leaders spent months negotiating a package of reform measures with David Cameron, but voters took little notice and Cameron lost the referendum in 2016 anyway, even though the EU was offering the UK different terms of membership.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn said that the first task of a Labour government would be to \u201cget Brexit sorted\u201d.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The first task of a Labour government will be to finally get Brexit sorted.</p> \n   <p>After three years of Tory failure, it\u2019s time to take the decision out of the hands of politicians and let the people have the final say.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is interesting because \u201cget Brexit sorted\u201d is very similar to the Tories\u2019 slogan, \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. Obviously, the policies are different; the Tories want to settle the matter by delivering Brexit, and Labour wants to settle the matter by having a referendum that could result in a vote to remain. But Corbyn\u2019s use of this phrase may indicate that Labour wants to neutralise a slogan that the Tories clearly believe will work very well for them.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7c4c806378c04dda701e2bd56f3735d01bf1d78\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7c4c806378c04dda701e2bd56f3735d01bf1d78/26_0_3460_2076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Conservative Party annual conference in ManchesterA Brexit slogan is displayed at the venue of the Conservative Party annual conference in Manchester, Britain, October 2, 2019.

      "bodyText": "- Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar \u201cagreed they could see a pathway to a possible deal\u201d during talks in Liverpool over the Brexit deadlock. - Varadkar says a new Brexit treaty agreement is \u201cpossible\u201d by the end of October. - Chris Williamson loses a court battle to get his suspension from Labour lifted. - The prime minister has given the green light for Labour to hold talks with top civil service officials, in the clearest sign yet that an election is looming. Friday\u2019s Times front page Friday\u2019s Financial Times front page Friday\u2019s Daily Telegraph front page Friday\u2019s Daily Mail front page Friday\u2019s Guardian front page For the first time in months, there is a more optimistic tone in tomorrow\u2019s newspapers on the prospect of a deal being reached with the EU. The London Assembly has asked Boris Johnson to explain by 5pm on Monday why his response to an investigation into his links to businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri should be kept confidential. The prime minister wrote to the Assembly regarding the inquiry, insisting the contents of his response should remain private. In the letter to Johnson\u2019s solicitors, Len Duvall, chairman of the Assembly\u2019s oversight committee, said: \u201cTransparency and accountability are at the heart of the London Assembly\u2019s operations and I was disappointed to see that your response is marked \u2018Private and Confidential\u2019 and \u2018Not for Publication\u2019. \u201cThe reason for confidentiality is not given and, on the face of it, is unclear to me. \u201cI would request that you provide reasons for that confidentiality by 5pm on Monday 14 October 2019, so that the GLA oversight committee can consider appropriate handling of the letter.\u201d The oversight committee has asked Mr Johnson for details and a timeline of all contact with Arcuri \u201cincluding social, personal and professional\u201d during his time as mayor of London. Johnson, who has denied any wrongdoing, previously accused his \u201cold friends\u201d in the Assembly of \u201cbarking up the wrong tree\u201d with their investigation. The Guardian\u2019s Peter Walker on the Brexit discussions Lisa O\u2019 Carroll on the full blow-by-blow account of the press conference The former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale is no longer a Labour party member, according to the BBC. Dugdale reportedly told friends that she terminated her membership in July, shortly after she stood down as an MSP, and she did not vote for the party in May\u2019s European elections. A prominent Remain campaigner, Dugdale has been highly critical of Labour\u2019s stance on Brexit. Dugdale led the party for two years before quitting unexpectedly in August 2017, and later stunned supporters by appearing on ITV\u2019s I\u2019m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. Meanwhile, first minister Nicola Sturgeon has insisted that a legal referendum is the only way to secure Scottish independence. In an interview with the BBC ahead of SNP conference this weekend, she said there was \u201cno easy or shortcut route to independence\u201d and that a future referendum had to be \u201cbeyond any doubt in terms of its legitimacy\u201d. Moving away from Brexit, the Lord Speaker has called for an overhaul of how appointments are made to the upper chamber as he criticised peers who are \u201ceager for the title\u201d but do little work. Lord Fowler said some peers are \u201centirely unprepared\u201d for the position as he urged Boris Johnson to follow predecessor Theresa May\u2019s example and show \u201crestraint\u201d in the number of peers he appoints. Writing in The House magazine, the former Conservative Cabinet minister said: \u201cFrankly, we have had enough of peers who are eager enough for the honour of the title but do precious little when they arrive. \u201cThey are a minority - I emphasise that - but it is difficult to justify their place in a modern working House.\u201d Lord Fowler suggested potential peers should be interviewed by a committee. He said they should be \u201casked bluntly what contribution they intend to make\u201d. Deputy prime minister of Ireland Simon Coveney on the Brexit deadline So what happens next? If there is no agreement reached with the EU, Boris Johnson will face demands from opposition parties to comply with the Benn Act which would require him to go back to Brussels and request a further Brexit delay. The prime minister has said that while he will abide by the law, he is determined to leave on the Halloween deadline. Many MPs believe that if he cannot get a deal, Johnson will use the occasion to lambast them for thwarting an agreement, laying the ground for a \u201cpeople versus Parliament\u201d general election, potentially as early as next month. ITV\u2019s Robert Peston on his take on the Brexit discussions Miche\u00e1l Martin\u2019s reaction to the talks in Liverpool Scottish Brexit Secretary Mike Russell responding to Michael Gove who accused the SNP of undermining the Brexit process. Russell said: \u201cMr Gove has completely ignored Scotland\u2019s overwhelming vote to remain in the EU, and has ignored every attempt to find compromise from the Scottish Government - so we will take absolutely no lectures from him on democracy. \u201cWe are preparing as best as we can for Brexit, but no one can fully mitigate the impact of the Brexit chaos that Mr Gove\u2019s government is set to inflict on us.\u201d More from Lisa O\u2019Carroll on the progress made Brexit correspondent Lisa O\u2019Carroll\u2019s take on the meeting between Johnson and Varadkar Boris Johnson cowardly for avoiding critics in Liverpool following Hillsborough remarks, says mayor Michael Gove has claimed the Scottish Government has undermined the Brexit process so it can \u201csmash up the United Kingdom\u201d. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said he feels members of the Scottish Government are not working in the best interests of their citizens by failing to prepare for leaving the European Union. The comments come after Scottish Brexit Secretary Mike Russell said the relationship between Westminster and the devolved administrations has deteriorated. Speaking after the meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee (EU Negotiations) (JMCEN), Gove said: \u201cThe overriding policy of the SNP is to smash up the United Kingdom and separate families. \u201cI sometimes wonder if, not just in rhetoric but in policy, the SNP is not thinking in the interests of Scottish citizens first, but are thinking in the interest of their own agenda. \u201cThese issues are far too important to be politicised in that way and I hope that the wiser voices in the Scottish Government prevail in order to ensure that people do act where they need to act, in order to make sure that the sovereign decision that the United Kingdom\u2019s electorate came to is honoured.\u201d He added the SNP promised in 2014 there would not be another referendum on independence, saying he would \u201ctake them at their word\u201d. Brexit party MEPs vote against plans to address Russian propaganda A few key dates for the diary: Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will meet the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, in Brussels on Friday when they are expected to assess whether there are the grounds to move forward. Boris Johnson almost certainly needs the EU leaders gathering in Brussels on October 17 and 18 to sign off on an agreement in order to be able to take Britain out of the EU on October 31 with a deal. In what has been dubbed Super Saturday, The House of Commons will meet on October 19 for a debate on Brexit, the first time the Commons has met on a Saturday since April 3, 1982 at the start of the Falklands crisis. Sky News is reporting that Downing Street has appealed to the bosses of FTSE-100 companies to publicly endorse Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit \u201ccompromise deal\u201d. Advisers to the prime minister have this week been canvassing support from business leaders for an open letter arguing that the uncertainty over Brexit \u201cneeds to end\u201d. Sources said \u201ca substantial number\u201d of Britain\u2019s most prominent companies had been contacted during the last week to gauge their interest in signing the letter. But they warned that it might not be published because of executives\u2019 reluctance to back its contents amid concerns about its \u201covertly political\u201d message. Gove was also asked by the Guardian about remarks earlier by Gianluca de Ficchy, chairman of Nissan Europe, that a no deal Brexit would put the car firm\u2019s entire European operation \u201cin jeopardy\u201d and would be unsustainable. De Ficchy added his firm\u2019s anxieties were increased by the lack of clarity from the UK government the \u201cfuture evolution of the Brexit discussion.\u201d Gove implied that he sympathised but said de Ficchy\u2019s worries were unfounded: \u201cObviously all of us hope that the negotiations can come to a conclusion and the chairman of Nissan, like all of us, I\u2019m sure will be heartened by the positive and constructive tone of the meeting between the prime and the Taoiseach today \u201cAnd again, more broadly, we know that unmitigated, a no deal Brexit poses particular challenges for particular sections of our economy. I have never hidden from that but it is my job to ensure that we can put the appropriate mitigations in place. \u201cAnd as I have said in the past, while there will be difficulties that we face if we do go down the road of no deal, there are greater difficulties if we say to the British people that we are not going to honour their request to leave the European Union. \u201cThe best way to do that is to leave with a negotiated deal and that\u2019s the prime minister\u2019s principle aim and driving ambition.\u201d Michael Gove, the de facto deputy prime minister, said the apparent breakthrough following Boris Johnson\u2019s talks with Leo Varadkar should allay fears from car maker Nissan about the potential crisis of a no deal Brexit. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with the Scottish and Welsh governments in Edinburgh, Gove said the Taoiseach\u2019s optimistic assessment about the growing prospects by the end of this month were \u201cvery encouraging\u201d. \u201cI know the prime minister and the Taoiseach spoke privately for quite some time before bringing in their officials. I know the tone was positive from that meeting. \u201cThe Irish government will be briefing {EU chief negotiator] Michel Barnier and the [European Commission\u2019s] Taskforce 50 team so I hope that the optimistic and constructive approach that both sides showed can result in more progress.\u201d Audio of Varadkar\u2019s press conference after his talks with the prime minister Home Office minister Brandon Lewis has disclosed that the UK will deport EU citizens after Brexit if they fail to apply for the right to remain in time. He told a German newspaper they would have to leave even if they met all the criteria for a residency permit. Lewis told Die Welt: \u201cIf EU citizens until this point of time have not registered and have no adequate reason for it, then the valid immigration rules will be applied.\u201d When pressed on whether that would include those who met the legal requirements for residence but did not apply in the next 14 months, he replied: \u201cTheoretically yes. We will apply the rules.\u201d Campaign group the3million, which represents EU citizens in the UK, said this was \u201cno way to treat people\u201d. The Home Office said 1.8 million people had applied to the scheme and others have until \u201cat least\u201d December next year. It said those with \u201creasonable grounds\u201d for missing the date would be granted an extension to apply for the right to live and work in the UK. Here\u2019s a recording of Leo Varadkar\u2019s remarks after his meeting with Johnson today. Varadkar on today\u2019s discussions and his objectives Possible ramifications for DUP after today\u2019s talks between Johnson and Varadkar Varadkar added if an agreement works for the people of Ireland it means avoiding a hard border between north and south. \u201cThat\u2019s always been our primary objective: ensuring the all island economy can continue to develop and that north south co-operation as envisaged by the Good Friday Agreement can resume and those are our objectives. \u201cThis has always been about achieving those objectives and I think today they can be achieved,\u201d he said. More from my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll who is at the Varadkar briefing: He said he hoped there would be the outline of a deal next week and he believed the \u201cobjectives\u201d of the backstop could be achieved after today\u2019s talks. \u201cI can\u2019t predict that with any certainty but I think all sides would like there to be an agreement next week at the council if possible and obviously there is a further deadline after that which is 31 October, so I would say a short pathway rather than a long pathway.\u201d He indicated a cautious optimism and a hope that talks could now take place away from the glare of the media and acrimony of anonymous briefings. Varadkar said the two prime ministers had agreed not to disclose any new proposals that might have been put on the table but that talks would now move to Brussels where Brexit secretary Steve Barclay is meeting Michel Barnier tomorrow. Speaking prior to a flight back home, a coy Taoiseach said it would be wrong to comment on whether one side or the other had made any concessions during the meeting. He said: \u201cIn terms of concessions, I don\u2019t think this should be seen in the context of who\u2019s making concessions or who the winners or losers are, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the game any of us want to play. \u201cWhat this is about is securing an agreement that works for the people of Ireland and for the people of Britain and Europe.\u201d Moving away from the Brexit drama for one moment, Labour MP Chris Williamson has lost his High Court bid to be reinstated to the party after he was suspended over allegations of anti-Semitism. The Derby North MP was suspended in February after he claimed Labour had been \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d in response to criticism of its handling of anti-Semitism allegations. He was readmitted to the party and issued with a formal warning following a hearing of a National Executive Committee (NEC) anti-Semitism panel in June. But he was suspended again in July after a second panel reviewed the decision to reinstate him and found it \u201ccannot safely stand\u201d. Labour also imposed a separate suspension last month over additional allegations of misconduct. A Labour Party spokeswoman said: \u201cThe court has upheld Chris Williamson\u2019s suspension from the party and has said his disciplinary case must run its course.\u201d From my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll, Varadkar on his thoughts about his discussions with the prime minister. \u201cI had a very good meeting today with the prime minister and our teams together. It was very positive and very promising. I am now absolutely convinced that both Ireland and Britain want there to be an agreement that\u2019s in the interests of Ireland and UK and the EU as a whole,\u201d he said. The meeting lasted significantly longer than expected, with the two prime ministers agreeing that there had been enough movement to form a basis for substantive negotiations. Varadkar said he believed the outline of a deal would be possible in time for the crunch summit of EU leaders next Thursday although \u201cthere was many a slip between cup and lip\u201d and challenges remained ahead. \u201cWhat I would hope that what happened today will be sufficient to allow negotiations to resume in Brussels,\u201d he added. \u201cI do see a pathway towards an agreement in the coming weeks. \u201cThere are of course issues yet to be fully resolved, the first is the issue of consent and democracy ensuring that any long term arrangement that applies to Northern Ireland has the consent of the people of Northern Ireland, the second is the whole issue of customs ensuring that there is no customs border between north and the south. \u201cAlso we had a good discussion looking forward to how relationships might look after Brexit, how we can strengthen co-operation north and south economically and politically and also between Britain and Ireland.\u201d Lisa adds a note of caution from Varadkar. This is from my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll. That is all from me for today. From Brexit to parents\u2019 evening ... My colleague Nadeem Badshah is now taking over. These are from Mujtaba Rahman, the former European commission official who produces well-regarded Brexit analysis for the Eurasia consultancy. The MP Chris Williamson has lost his high court bid to be reinstated to the Labour party after he was suspended over allegations of anti-Semitism, the Press Association reports. It story goes on: The Derby North MP was suspended in February after he claimed that Labour had been \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d in response to criticism of its handling of antisemitism allegations. He was readmitted to the party and issued with a formal warning following a hearing of a national executive committee (NEC) antisemitism panel in June - prompting an outcry from MPs, peers and Jewish groups. But he was suspended again in July after a second panel reviewed the decision to reinstate him and found it \u201ccannot safely stand\u201d. Labour also imposed a separate suspension on September 3 over additional allegations of misconduct. At a hearing in September, Williamson\u2019s lawyers argued that his treatment had been \u201cmanifestly unfair\u201d and asked the high court to declare his suspension from the party was void. Giving judgment this afternoon, Mr Justice Pepperall ruled that \u201cthe Labour party acted unfairly in that there was no proper reason for reopening the case against Mr Williamson\u201d. However, the judge found that there was \u201cnothing in the new allegations, the timing of the letter of 3 September or the decision to suspend that entitles me to take the view upon the papers that the Labour party is acting either unfairly or other than in good faith\u201d. He added: \u201cI therefore refuse relief in respect of Mr Williamson\u2019s recent re-suspension. The new disciplinary case must run its course.\u201d Williamson himself has posted a thread on Twitter about the case. It starts here. From the Irish Times\u2019 political editor Pat Leahy From my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll Given that Leo Varadkar spent a lot of time talking to Boris Johnson one-to-one, some of us are wondering if his experience of a Johnson negotiation will end up similar to Damian Green\u2019s. (See 10.30am.) And these are from RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly. These are from journalists from Irish news organisations, who seem to have had some briefing. From the Irish Daily Mail\u2019s Emma Jane Hade From the Irish Times\u2019 Denis Staunton From the Irish Independent\u2019s Hugh O\u2019Connell From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg From the Irish Independent\u2019s Hugh O\u2019Connell (20 minutes ago) Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar have agreed they can see a \u201cpathway to a possible Brexit deal\u201d but warned there were still challenges ahead if an agreement was to be struck at next week\u2019s EU summit, my colleagues Lisa O\u2019Carroll and Rowena Mason report. Since all we\u2019ve got to go on at the moment is the joint statement from No 10 and the Irish government, let\u2019s try and subject it to some analysis. Each paragraph from the statement is in quotes. My take on each passage is below. The prime minister and taoiseach have had a detailed and constructive discussion. \u201cDetailed\u201d and \u201cconstructive\u201d are the key words, and both are positive. Both continue to believe that a deal is in everybody\u2019s interest. They agreed that they could see a pathway to a possible deal. The first sentence does not amount to much, because it is what all sides have always said from the moment the Brexit talks started. The second sentence is the most significant, and the one that has sent the pound moving up. (See 3.25pm.) It is more positive than people were expecting, and it implies that the Brexit talks are now at least off their deathbed. But does it mean much more than that? We don\u2019t know. It is worth noting that there are two qualifiers in this sentence: \u201cThey agreed that they could see a pathway to a possible deal.\u201d And does it mean they are both looking the same pathway? No one has ever had problems imagining a possible deal, or a pathway to it. The trouble has been finding one acceptable to all veto players in this process: the EU, Dublin, parliament, the Conservative party, the ERG and the DUP. Their discussion concentrated on the challenges of customs and consent. That is no surprise, because these are the two main features of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan identified as unacceptable by Dublin and Brussels. They also discussed the potential to strengthen bilateral relations, including on Northern Ireland. It is not clear what this refers to, although the UK government quite often talks about the desirability of improving bilateral relations with Dublin, particularly when they are under strain. They agreed to reflect further on their discussions and that officials would continue to engage intensively on them. This sentence is moderately positive: \u201creflect further\u201d means no one will be pulling the plug on the talks process today, and the reference to officials implies they have some new ideas to discuss. Following their discussions the taoiseach will consult with the taskforce 50 and the Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay will meet Michel Barnier tomorrow morning. Originally Barclay and Barnier were due to meet today, but that meeting got put back until Friday. There were some suggestions that, if today went badly, it would get cancelled. The fact it is going ahead means neither side wants to give up yet. From Sky\u2019s economics editor Ed Conway It is a joint statement from No 10 and from the Irish government. Leo Varadkar has tweeted it too. Here is the full text of the joint statement about the Johnson/Varadkar meeting. The prime minister and taoiseach have had a detailed and constructive discussion. Both continue to believe that a deal is in everybody\u2019s interest. They agreed that they could see a pathway to a possible deal. Their discussion concentrated on the challenges of customs and consent. They also discussed the potential to strengthen bilateral relations, including on Northern Ireland. They agreed to reflect further on their discussions and that officials would continue to engage intensively on them. Following their discussions the taoiseach will consult with the taskforce 50 and the Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay will meet Michel Barnier tomorrow morning. Here is the Number 10 statement about the talks. It is a joint statement. It says Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar \u201cagreed that they could see a pathway to a possible deal\u201d. That is a lot more positive than people were expecting - although still well short of an agreement. We have been told that we will get a statement from No 10 shortly about the Boris Johnson/Leo Varadkar talks. The prime minister has given the green light for Labour to hold talks with top civil service officials in the clearest sign yet that an election is looming, the Press Association reports. The main opposition party is traditionally given time before a polling date to speak with senior civil servants to discuss the policy changes planned if they win power. The decision n to allow shadow ministers access to the civil service - a right usually reserved solely for the government - indicates that the wheels are being oiled for a fresh trip to the polls. A Labour spokesman said the party would use the talks with Whitehall mandarins to \u201cprepare for a transformational\u201d government. This is from the Press Association\u2019s Catherine Wylie on Thornton Manor. The luxury wedding venue chosen for Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar\u2019s Brexit talks was where Coleen Rooney held her circus-themed 21st birthday party. Rooney, who caused an online sensation this week after alleging Rebekah Vardy\u2019s Instagram account was the source of leaked stories about her in the media, hosted the glamorous party at Thornton Manor in 2007. The venue is a Grade II listed building that was once the home of the soap magnate William Hesketh Lever in the village of Thornton Hough on the Wirral. Thornton Manor, which hails itself as a \u201ctruly unique\u201d wedding venue that \u201cexudes historic enchantment and charm\u201d, is the setting of a political showdown this week between two men talking about a separation and a union of a different kind. But it is not the first event relating to a significant milestone and involving familiar faces that has taken place here. Back on March 31 2007, stilt walkers dressed as swans and jugglers in sailor suits greeted guests as they arrived to celebrate the 21st birthday of Rooney, then the fiancee of footballer Wayne Rooney who she went on to marry. These are from my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels. You can read the full text of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech - Labour\u2019s alternative Queen\u2019s speech, as he put it - here. In policy terms it did not really contain anything new, but what it did do was summarise, clearly and comprehensively, Labour\u2019s policy offer to the voters in an election. As is often the case, the more newsy comments came in the Q&amp;A. Here is a summary. Corbyn strongly condemned President Trump for remarks that appeared to defend the American diplomat\u2019s wife who was driving on the wrong side of the road when involved in a collision with the British teenager, Harry Dunn, who was killed. Speaking about the case yesterday, Trump said: The woman was driving on the wrong side of the road, and that can happen. You know, those are the opposite roads, that happens. I won\u2019t say it ever happened to me, but it did. When you get used to driving on our system and then you\u2019re all of a sudden on the other system where you\u2019re driving - it happens. You have to be careful, very careful. Asked for his reaction to what Trump said, Corbyn said: \u201cThat is the most crass, insensitive comment anyone could ever make.\u201d Corbyn strongly criticised the US decision to allow the diplomat\u2019s wife, Anne Sacoolas, to claim diplomatic immunity in this case. He said: I\u2019m alarmed about [the use of diplomatic immunity]. For somebody to be killed in our country and the person who did it to flee to the United States and then claim diplomatic immunity is completely unacceptable. I know the family went to see Dominic Raab yesterday. We would put every bit of possible pressure we could on the United states. If we could mount legal action in the United States, we would do so because it is simply not acceptable for someone to seek diplomatic immunity when somebody - a wholly innocent individual - has been killed by the behaviour of somebody else. Corbyn restated his determination to have a general election before holding a referendum on Brexit. As Kate Devlin reports in today\u2019s Times (paywall), some Labour MPs want the party to unite with other opposition parties and insist on a referendum first, not least because current polling suggests Labour would lose the election. Tony Blair has been making this argument strongly too. In her story Devlin says: Many Labour MPs are desperate to avoid an election during a delay to Brexit and lobbied Mr Corbyn directly over the issue last week. Members of his shadow cabinet are also pressing him to wait until Brexit had been fully settled. Last night Labour MPs predicted that Mr Corbyn would face a revolt within his own party if he tried to whip them to vote for an election. One said: \u201cOpposition to a general election is widespread among Labour MPs.\u201d Another questioned whether Mr Corbyn read the opinion polls, saying: \u201cWe are far behind in the polls, Jeremy is a liability and our Brexit position is a mess.\u201d But in his speech Corbyn said that the party was \u201cchamping at the bit for an election\u201d and would agree to one as soon as a no-deal Brexit on 31 October was taken off the tabled. (See 11.11am.) Asked in the Q&amp;A about Labour MPs pushing for referendum first, Corbyn just restated his determination to hold a referendum after a Labour victory in the election. (See 11.44am.) Corbyn said that he would want EU reform to be part of any proposal for the UK to remain in the EU. Labour\u2019s plan is to negotiate a deal for a soft Brexit with the EU, and to then offer voters a choice between that option and remain. But, speaking in the Q&amp;A, he said: After an election a Labour government would introduce legislation to ensure a referendum takes place between the agreement that we would reach with the European Union and remain. I have to say, in remain I would also want to see some reforms to the European Union. It is hard to know what this would mean in practice, but it is not likely to enthuse any EU leaders hoping for a Labour government and the possibility of the UK voting to stay in. EU leaders spent months negotiating a package of reform measures with David Cameron, but voters took little notice and Cameron lost the referendum in 2016 anyway, even though the EU was offering the UK different terms of membership. Corbyn said that the first task of a Labour government would be to \u201cget Brexit sorted\u201d. He said: The first task of a Labour government will be to finally get Brexit sorted. After three years of Tory failure, it\u2019s time to take the decision out of the hands of politicians and let the people have the final say. This is interesting because \u201cget Brexit sorted\u201d is very similar to the Tories\u2019 slogan, \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. Obviously, the policies are different; the Tories want to settle the matter by delivering Brexit, and Labour wants to settle the matter by having a referendum that could result in a vote to remain. But Corbyn\u2019s use of this phrase may indicate that Labour wants to neutralise a slogan that the Tories clearly believe will work very well for them. Corbyn confirmed that Labour would introduce a \u00a310 an hour minimum wage for all workers over 16 immediately. (See 11.17am.) The \u00a310 an hour minimum wage has been Labour policy for some time, but the party has not always been clear how quickly it would be introduced. But Corbyn is now saying the policy would be introduced immediately. This is in response to Sajid Javid\u2019s announcement at the Tory conference that his party would increase the national living wage to \u00a310.50 an hour - but only by 2024. Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (PM), has tweeted some pictures from his meeting with Boris Johnson. Here is the full text of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech. A summary of the highlights is coming soon. Some anti-Brexit protesters have arrived outside Thornton Manor, the Liverpool Echo\u2019s Liam Thorp reports. And now the gates are shut, my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll reports. Leo Varadkar arrived at Thornton Manor 22 minutes after Boris Johnson, according to the Irish Daily Mail\u2019s Emma Jane Hade. Thornton Manor is also a \u201cdream wedding\u201d venue, my colleague Paul Johnson points out. This is form MLex\u2019s Matthew Holehouse on the venue for the Johnson/Varadkar talks. Turning away from the Corbyn Q&amp;A for a moment, Boris Johnson has lost his game of hide and seek with the media. This is from the Liverpool Echo\u2019s Liam Thorp. Q: How hard will it be to win an election when the Tories are also promising a big increase in public spending? And if you lose, will you stand down? Corbyn says he never comments on opinion polls. He does not study them. But the 2017 election was called in an emergency manner, and Labour went into it with the most radical, transformative manifesto that had been put to the people. He got the biggest increase in the Labour vote since 1945. He thinks he opened the eyes of people to how things could be different. He says he has spent a lot of time since then touring the country, and listening to people. A lot of people feel depressed and angry. The levels of mental health problem reflect the anxiety being generated by what is going wrong. What this country cannot afford is the level of inequality it has. He says, when the election is called, he will be out there, with hundreds of thousands of Labour members sending the message that things can be different. Do you want the country run by a party that has cut and sliced public services? Or do you want more of the same? He says he is very fit, and determined to win an election. Q: What is your plan for the backstop? Corbyn says the best solution would be to maintain a customs union relationship with the EU. Q: What is your response to what Donald Trump said about how anyone could drive on the wrong side of the road? That is the most crass, insensitive comment anyone could ever make. He says a man died. Let\u2019s have some humanity and justice, he says. Q: Some Labour MPs want a referendum before an election. Are you committed to an election first? And when should it be? Corbyn says he is proposing a second referendum when a Labour government is elected. People would have a choice between remain and a deal. We are in for a few days of shadowing boxing by Boris Johnson. Corbyn says he hopes the decision comes back to parliament. He says a deal does not look likely. He says the opposition parties want as a priority to take no deal off the table. He says he is very confident that he could get a deal with the EU. But, with the remain option, he says he would also want to see some reforms from the EU. Q: Should the Americans waive diplomatic immunity in the Anne Sacoolas case. Corbyn says he is \u201calarmed and very concerned\u201d by this case. It is not appropriate to seek diplomatic immunity when someone has been killed, he says. Q: Would you give into Extinction Rebellion\u2019s demands? Corbyn says he has met many of these protesters. Their right to protest must be defended, he says. He says people should think where protest can lead. He refers to the 19th century Northampton MP Charles Bradlaugh, who ensured atheists could stand for parliament, and the suffragettes. Corbyn is on his peroration. The alternative Queen\u2019s Speech I\u2019ve set out today is the most transformative, radical and exciting programme ever put before the British electorate. This is Labour\u2019s plan to change our country, it\u2019s the real thing not the pale imitation offered by Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party. It\u2019s a path to a future where the economy is run for the people, not the privileged, and the government works for you not the vested interests. A future where we tackle the climate emergency and Britain is a force for peace and international justice in the world. That future is within our grasp. Together we can build a country fit for the next generation. The future is ours to make It\u2019s time for real change. Turning to foreign affairs, Corbyn says the invasion of Northern Syria by Turkey is \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. He says Labour would pass legislation to ensure the PM cannot go to war without parliament\u2019s approval. Currently the prime minister has the power under the royal prerogative to launch military action without recourse to parliament. Boris Johnson \u2013 a prime minister without a majority \u2013 has talked about sending troops to Saudi Arabia to confront Iran: another disaster in the making. I will be a very different kind of prime minister, one who is prepared to limit my own power in the public interest. So that\u2019s why a Labour government will introduce a War Powers Bill to ensure no prime minister can bypass parliament to take the country to war. Corbyn confirms Labour would ban fracking. Labour will ban fracking, roll out a street-by-street insulation programme and fit solar panels on 1.75 million roofs, double large-scale solar, remove barriers to onshore wind and ensure every single new house built is a zero carbon home. Corbyn praises groups like Extinction Rebellion. To have any hope of keeping global temperature rises to a manageable level we need immediate and radical action. I\u2019d like to thank groups like the Climate Strikers and Extinction Rebellion for educating us and pushing the issue to the top of the agenda. The government\u2019s target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 is too late and the Tories are doing little to meet it \u2013 in fact investment in clean energy has fallen for three years running. A Labour government is fully signed up to a Green New Deal. We are already working closely with trade unions and the scientific community to develop the most radical climate targets in the world. Corbyn says Labour would fund councils properly. And services have not been funded properly either, he says. The same goes for vital basic services we all rely on, which have been carved up and fleeced by their private owners. The privatisation of our utilities, which are natural monopolies, has been a failure. People are sick of paying through the nose for a poor service while billions are handed over to shareholders. So Labour will bring rail, mail, water and the energy grid into public ownership, run by and for the public, not for profit. And a Labour government will take the railways back into public ownership too. We\u2019ll invest in public transport including Crossrail for the North, from Liverpool to Hull and up to Newcastle. We\u2019ll reinstate bus routes and establish municipal companies making free bus travel available to the under-25s while maintaining the pensioner bus pass. Our public transport network is falling apart just when the climate emergency means we need it most. Corbyn says Labour will \u201cguarantee every young person access to youth services in their community\u201d. Women will be at the heart of Labour\u2019s programme for government, he says. Labour is the Party of equality. We\u2019ll bear down on sexism, racism, homophobia and all forms of discrimination wherever they exist in our economy and society. He says yesterday\u2019s antisemitic attack in Germany was \u201csickening\u201d and a Labour government would oppose all forms of racism, including antisemitism. Corbyn confirms that Labour would increase the number of uniformed police officers. But the reduction in police numbers is not the only reason why violent crime has doubled, he says. It\u2019s also the wider impact of austerity \u2013 including the closure of youth services. 750 youth centres have closed their doors since 2012. Too many young people today are growing up with nowhere to go and no one to speak to about their lives. Labour would deliver justice for Grenfell, Corbyn says. After the horror of Grenfell it\u2019s astonishing that the Tories are still failing to make tower blocks safe. Nine out of ten private blocks with Grenfell-style cladding haven\u2019t had it replaced. Labour will ensure people aren\u2019t living in death traps. And we will deliver justice for Grenfell. Corbyn says today is world homelessness day. And let me say this on World Homeless Day: in the fifth richest country in the world no one should be sleeping rough. We all know it\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s Labour that will end rough sleeping. Corbyn quotes from the report (pdf) from the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty. If I told you that our social security system has been \u201cdeliberately removed and replaced with a harsh and uncaring ethos\u201d you might think, \u2018Well, he would say that.\u2019 But if I told you those aren\u2019t my words but the damning verdict of the United Nations, no less, you get a sense of the damage wrought by nine years of Tory austerity. Turning to welfare, he says: A Labour government will change the whole culture of the DWP. It will become the Department for Social Security to give people dignity and respect. Social security shouldn\u2019t be about forcing women into the indignity of having to fill out a four-page form to prove their child was born as a result of rape as 500 women had to do last year. Labour will scrap Universal Credit and introduce an emergency package to immediately end its worst aspects. Ending the benefit cap and the two child limit, which alone will stop up to 300,000 children being pushed into poverty. And, yes, that means the end of the disgusting rape clause. We\u2019ll end the five week wait for the first payment, end the Tories\u2019 vicious sanctions regime, end the bedroom tax and - because we\u2019re committed to reducing poverty - we\u2019ll end the benefit freeze. We\u2019ll control welfare spending by tackling low pay and insecure work ... and rip-off rents. Social security shouldn\u2019t be subsidising bad employers and greedy landlords. Turning to adult social care, Corbyn says the current system is \u201ca disgrace\u201d. Nearly \u00a38 billion has been taken from councils\u2019 social care budgets since 2010. 87 people die every day while waiting for the care they need. It\u2019s a disgrace, frankly, that we treat our older people in this way. A Labour government will introduce free personal care providing help with daily tasks like bathing, washing, and preparing meals. This will be the first step to creating a National Care Service, easing the fear of getting older. Turning to education, Corbyn confirms Labour would scrap university tuition fees, end SATS for 7 and 11-year-olds and rebuild Sure Start. Turning to health, he says: For a decade our NHS has been run down, carved up, and prepared for privatisation. A Labour government will reverse this. We\u2019ll repeal the Tory-Lib Dem privatisation Act of 2012. We\u2019ll give our NHS the resources, equipment and staff it needs. That means more GPs and nurses and reduced waiting times. And under Labour prescriptions in England will be free. And he restates the policy he announced at conference - big drug companies would no longer be allowed to \u201chold our NHS to ransom\u201d, he says. Corbyn says Labour would raise the minimum wage to \u00a310 an hour for all workers over 16 immediately. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, has said the minimum wage will not rise above \u00a310 an hour until 2024, and only for those aged 21 and over. So a Labour government will immediately raise the minimum wage to \u00a310 an hour for all workers from the age of 16. And Corbyn runs through some of the party\u2019s other flagship policies for workers. We\u2019ll create a new Ministry of Employment Rights to give workers a seat at the Cabinet table and strengthen the democratic voice of the workforce through collective bargaining. Every worker will have full rights on day one of a new job; entitling them to sick pay, holiday pay, parental leave and protection against unfair dismissal. A new Workers\u2019 Protection Agency will ensure all these rights are properly enforced. And we\u2019ll create a Working Time Commission \u2026 to reduce the average full time working hours to 32 a week within ten years. But to truly rebalance power in people\u2019s daily lives we need to go further. So Labour will give workers a say and a stake in their workplace \u2026 by ensuring a third of the seats on company boards are reserved for worker directors ... elected by the workforce. Corbyn says Labour wants an economy that works for the many, not the few. A Labour government will rebuild communities across Britain with investment on a scale our country has never known bringing new jobs and fresh growth to every town, city, region and nation. We\u2019ll upgrade our creaking infrastructure with \u00a3250 billion of public investment into energy, housing and transport through a National Transformation Fund and establish a National Investment Bank to make a further \u00a3250 billion available through loans to businesses and co-ops to get our economy moving. Grotesque inequality isn\u2019t inevitable. It\u2019s the result of a deliberate effort to tip the balance of power away from workers towards the privileged elite that Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives represent. Corbyn says the first task of a Labour government would be to get Brexit sorted. The first task of a Labour government will be to finally get Brexit sorted. After three years of Tory failure, it\u2019s time to take the decision out of the hands of politicians and let the people have the final say. So a Labour government will immediately legislate for a referendum. And he sums up the Brexit position confirmed at Labour\u2019s conference. Within six months of being elected we will put that deal to a public vote alongside remain. And as prime minister I will carry out whatever the people decide. There\u2019s nothing complicated about that position. It\u2019s really very simple: Labour trusts the people to decide. Corbyn sums up Labour\u2019s election offer. We might be just weeks away from the first Queen\u2019s Speech of a Labour government. And in that Queen\u2019s Speech, Labour will put forward the most radical, hopeful, people-focused programme in modern times: a once-in-a-generation chance to rebuild and transform our country. It will: Let the people decide on Brexit Build an economy that works for all Change government so that it works for you Tackle the climate emergency \u2026 Reset our global role to one based on peace and human rights. Corbyn says Labour will back an election once a no-deal Brexit has been taken off the table. It wasn\u2019t long ago that Johnson was pretending not to want an election. Now he\u2019s pretending that it\u2019s Labour that doesn\u2019t want one. So let me address this directly: Prime minister, we can\u2019t trust you not to break the law because you\u2019ve got form. We can\u2019t trust you not to use the period of an election campaign to drive our country off a No Deal cliff edge that will crash our economy, destroy jobs and industries, cause shortages of medicine and food and endanger peace in Northern Ireland. So it\u2019s simple: obey the law, take No Deal off the table and then let\u2019s have the election. Corbyn starts by describing next week\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech as a \u201ccynical stunt\u201d. On Monday, we will be treated to the farce of Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservative government, amid full pomp and ceremony, setting out an agenda to parliament that it has no intention and no means of delivering. Because this government isn\u2019t going to put any legislation before parliament. It has a majority of minus 45, a 100 per cent record of defeat in the Commons and is seeking a general election which will rapidly end the parliamentary session the Queen is about to open. Holding a Queen\u2019s Speech before an election is a cynical stunt. Johnson is using the Queen to deliver a pre-election party political broadcast for the Conservative Party. Jeremy Corbyn has just started his speech now on Labour\u2019s radical agenda. Germany believes the peace process in Northern Ireland is so important that it will not budge in its opposition to Boris Johnson\u2019s current Brexit proposal, the country\u2019s ambassador to Ireland has told Irish border communities. Deike Potzel spent more than an hour with representatives from border communities in Dublin on Wednesday night and they said they came away reassured that Germany was supporting their interests. Damian McGenity, the coordinator of the campaign group Border Communities Against Brexit, said: She said Germany was completely behind the belief that the peace process is the priority. She said they will not budge on this. They know from their own experience in Germany that the peace process is incredibly important and while they are very much of the view they want a deal, she said they were prepared for no deal. She said the peace process trumps all other considerations in Brexit She also said that Germany was not coming under any pressure to abandon the Irish, not from business, from car manufacturers. They are watching the situation quite closely but think that people do not understand the border issue. In an interview in the Daily Telegraph (paywall) Philip Hammond, the former Tory chancellor who had the whip withdrawn last month after rebelling over Brexit, has revived his call for a soft Brexit as an acceptable compromise. He is suggesting that the UK should stay in the customs union, and in the single market for goods, with the UK having a 12-month \u201cbreak clause\u201d that would allow it to leave this arrangement with a year\u2019s notice. This would mean the UK would not be able to negotiate its own trade deals. But in the Telegraph Hammond argues that the values of these have been over-estimated. He says: We all know these trade deals are of very limited potential value and likely to be very hard to negotiate without serious domestic economic and political consequences. Speaking on the Today programme, Hammond also said he thought the Conservative party was in danger of losing its reputation for economic competence. He said: The economy is slowing down and the government has made a number of very significant spending commitments and I do worry that the Conservative Party\u2019s core message for many, many years - whether people like us or loathe us - has been that we are a responsible party with the economy and the public finances ... And I do worry about a strategy which is reckless about our economic future in terms of advocating no-deal Brexit and reckless about our public finances in terms of spending money that, frankly, at this point in the Brexit negotiation, we cannot be sure we have available. Some 50 Scottish cultural figures have published a \u2018declaration for independence\u2019 this morning, setting out a series of \u2018guiding principles for a new and better Scotland\u2019. The timing itself is interesting: just after what organisers claim was the biggest ever march for independence in Edinburgh last Saturday, and ahead of the SNP conference in Aberdeen this Sunday. The signatories, from across the arts and academia, include writers A. L. Kennedy, Andrew O\u2019Hagan and Jenni Fagan, actor Brian Cox, historian Tom Devine and musicians Stuart Braithwaite and Karine Polwart. No doubt with the recent arguments at Edinburgh\u2019s court of session in mind, the declaration itself calls for a written constitution, separation of powers between parliament and government and affirms judicial independence, as well as committing to human rights, transparency of land ownership, and the rejection of nuclear weapons. As this latest clamjamfry gears up, it\u2019s worth remembering the key role that Scottish artists and cultural figures played in the last independence referendum, on both sides, although more noisily for yes. We\u2019ll find out at the weekend whether this piles extra pressure on SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon - who drew some criticism for not attending last weekend\u2019s march, as many of her party colleagues did. She has declared her desire to hold a second independence referendum by the end of 2020, but activists are well aware that time is running out to get the necessary legislation and legal powers in place to meet that timetable. Yesterday Damian Green, head of the One Nation group of Tory MPs, had a meeting with Boris Johnson to raise concerns about claims that, if Brexit gets delayed beyond 31 October (as many people expect), the Conservative party would fight the next election on a no-deal platform. As we reported (see below), Green came out of the meeting thinking he had an assurance from Johnson that this would not happen. We also said that some No 10 insiders were saying that Green may have \u201coverinterpreted\u201d what he had been told by the PM. Emilio Casalicchio has heard the same, and his story on the meeting includes this clarification from Downing Street. A senior Downing Street official pushed back on [Green\u2019s claim], telling POLITICO that no manifesto position has been agreed so far. \u201cIt may have to be straight no deal or it may not depending on the situation,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe are keeping our options open. I suspect Green has over-interpreted the meeting. There are many cards left to play in the game before we get to a manifesto.\u201d Two MPs are taking the government to court to demand an independent inquiry into the UK\u2019s complicity in torture after \u201cyears of dither and delay\u201d, the Press Association reports. Labour\u2019s Dan Jarvis and Conservative David Davis are bringing legal action alongside the campaigning justice charity Reprieve, seeking a full judge-led inquiry into \u201cthe truth of the UK\u2019s role in post 9/11 abuses\u201d. It is alleged the refusal to hold a hearing is contrary to article three of the European convention on human rights, which requires governments to fully investigate credible torture allegations, and also violates the common law prohibition of torture. Britain\u2019s economy contracted by 0.1% in August, according to the Office for National Statistics\u2019 latest growth report. My colleague Graeme Wearden has full coverage in his business live blog. In an interview on ITV\u2019s Peston last night Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, suggested that, if Boris Johnson has to write a letter to the EU requesting a Brexit extension - which is what the Benn Act says he will have to do, if there is no deal - he might also send a second letter, making points intended to persuade EU leaders against granting an extension. There has been speculation for some time that this might be the loophole Johnson intends to use to ensure the UK leaves the EU on 31 October, as he has promised, and that he obeys the Benn Act, as he has also promised. Asked about this possible tactic, Leadsom said that it would be \u201cperfectly reasonable\u201d to act in this way. But there is a problem; lawyers say that doing this would be not only not reasonable, but unlawful too. This is what Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, tweeted last night. He\u2019s a QC. This is from Joanna Cherry, the SNP\u2019s justice and home affairs spokeswoman, who is also a QC. In a blog yesterday for the UK Constitutional Law Association, Jeff King, a law professor, specifically said that the plan floated by Leadsom would be \u201cpatently unlawful\u201d. An option mooted in the Daily Telegraph suggests that the PM might send two letters, the second asking the European council to disregard the one required by the Benn Act. It would be absurd as well as patently unlawful. The European council would seek clarification and the matter would end up before a UK judge, who would make short work of it. The statutory request is required by a law whose aim is clear, and the second letter would seek to frustrate the operation of that law. The correct authority for that proposition is Miller v SS for Exiting the EU [2017] UKSC 5 (Miller No.1): there exists no foreign affairs prerogative power that would operate to frustrate the purpose of a statute. A court would be required to declare that the second letter was issued without lawful authority. The European council would be instructed that that there is only one valid letter. The FT\u2019s legal commentator David Allen Green says it\u2019s the Padfield case that explains why the Leadsom gambit would be illegal. And it is worth quoting what the advocate general for Scotland, Lord Keen, told the Scottish court in the case referred to by Cherry. Keen said the PM accepted that he \u201ccannot frustrate\u201d the purpose of the Benn Act. The full quotes are in the judgment (pdf). On the Today programme this morning Kwasi Kwarteng, a business minister, ducked a question about whether a two-letters strategy would be an option. He said that he was not a lawyer, and so could not comment on the rights or wrongs of this issue, but he did say the government would obey the law. As the Liverpool Echo reports, there is speculation that the Boris Johnson/Leo Varadkar meeting will take place in the city. This would be another reason why No 10 might want to keep the location of the talks secret, because Johnson is still unpopular in the city because of an editorial he published when he was editor of the Spectator 15 years ago that was offensive to Liverpudlians. Yesterday Steve Rotheram, the metro mayor for the Liverpool city region, posted these on Twitter. In fact, Johnson has apologised for the Spectator article. The most important event today will almost certainly be Boris Johnson\u2019s private meeting with Leo Varadkar, his Irish opposite number, where the two leaders will make one final attempt to reach agreement on an alternative to the backstop, which is the key that would unlock a Brexit deal. But it is also the event that may be hardest to report. Yesterday No 10 just said the meeting would place at lunchtime somewhere in the north west of England. \u201cThere are no media opportunities and this will not be open to the media or the pool,\u201d the Downing Street operational note said. Obviously that won\u2019t stop journalists trying to find out where the meeting is taking place, and doorstepping the two PMs, but they may not succeed. In the meantime, we had a fresh warning about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit this morning. As the Evening Standard\u2019s Joe Murphy has pointed out, in the Commons last month the Labour MP Tracy Brabin asked Michael Gove if he could give her an assurance that \u201cno one in this country will suffer in their health because of a no-deal Brexit\u201d. Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no-deal planning, replied with a single word: \u201cYes.\u201d This morning Prof Dame Sally Davies, who has only just stood down as chief medical officer, gave a very different assessment. Speaking on the Today programme, she said that if there were a no-deal Brexit at the end of this month, people could die as a result. The health service and everyone has worked very hard to prepare. But I say what I\u2019ve said before - that we cannot guarantee that there will not be shortages, not only in medicines but technology and gadgets and things. And there may be deaths, we can\u2019t guarantee there won\u2019t. Asked if lives were at risk, she replied firmly: \u201cThey are at risk.\u201d Here is the agenda for the day. 11am: Jeremy Corbyn delivers a speech on Northampton on Labour\u2019s radical agenda for transforming Britain. As Kate Proctor reports, he will criticise Boris Johnson for using the Queen\u2019s speech next week as a \u201cparty political broadcast\u201d before the expected general election. Around lunchtime: Boris Johnson meets Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (PM) for private talks on Brexit. 12.30pm: The Institute for Government hosts a hustings for candidates for the post of Commons Speaker. 3.15pm: The joint ministerial council, which comprises ministers from the UK government and the devolved administration, meets in Edinburgh. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on Brexit and on Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Prost, and come on Scotland!\u201d</p> <p>What I love about this new, easy-to-understand qualifying system is that Scotland could turn up tonight with a midfield of Rab C Nesbitt and the lads from Still Game, and they\u2019d still be guaranteed a play-off place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fbeacc2103e9cb9e050ae92836a9ec8aa7c875f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fbeacc2103e9cb9e050ae92836a9ec8aa7c875f/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Come on the Scots.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Come on the Scots.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steven Paston/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-10T18:44:50.727Z\">at 7.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d9f77168f083d8b3b9d9aae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-10T18:25:09.116Z\">7.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>You don\u2019t<em> have </em>to be a Football Manager addict </strong>to love this feature...</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/oct/10/next-generation-2019-60-of-the-best-young-talents-in-world-football\">Next Generation 2019: 60 of the best young talents in world football</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d9f75e38f083d8b3b9d9a97\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-10T18:18:49.728Z\">7.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>\u201cRob, </strong>I\u2019m enjoying the first night of my holiday in Spain,\u201d says Wales fan Matt Dony, getting the enjoyment out the way before the football starts. \u201cThat Welsh side looks more-than-useful on paper.

Northern Ireland (who are away to the Netherlands) and Wales (away to Slovakia) still have a decent chance of automatic qualification. Scotland don\u2019t, for reasons that should be self-explanatory, but they are guaranteed a play-off place because of their Nations League exploits. </p> <p>These are tonight\u2019s fixtures (all 7.45pm BST unless stated).</p> <p><strong>Group C</strong></p> <ul> <li>Belarus 0-0 Estonia (5pm)</li> <li>Netherlands v Northern Ireland</li> </ul> <p><strong>Group E</strong></p> <ul> <li>Slovakia v Wales</li> <li>Croatia v Hungary</li> </ul> <p><strong>Group G</strong></p> <ul> <li>Latvia v Poland</li> <li>North Macedonia v Slovenia</li> <li>Austria v Israel</li> </ul> <p><strong>Group I</strong></p> <ul> <li>Kazakhstan 1-2 Cyprus (final score)</li> <li>Russia v Scotland</li> <li>Belgium v San Marino </li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-10T18:30:08.754Z\">at 7.30pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

Wales took a useful point from their match in Slovakia, with the surprise selection Kieffer Moore scoring his first international goal. I\u2019ve probably got this wrong, because I\u2019m not the permutations man I used to be, but I suspect Wales will be okay if they win two of their three remaining games - Croatia and Hungary at home, Azerbaijan away. They need three wins to be absolutely certain. I think. Northern Ireland were 11 minutes away from a famous victory and minus one minute from a famous draw, but those late Netherlands goals mean qualification for Euro 2020 is out of their hands. It was one of the more nobler defeats, not that this will be any consolation. Final scores Group C Belarus 0-0 Estonia Netherlands 3-1 Northern Ireland Group E Slovakia 1-1 Wales Croatia 3-0 Hungary Group G Latvia 0-3 Poland North Macedonia 2-1 Slovenia Austria 3-1 Israel Group I Kazakhstan 1-2 Cyprus Russia 4-0 Scotland Belgium 9-0 San Marino Peep peep! It has finished Slovakia 1-1 Wales, Netherlands 3-1 Northern Ireland and Russia 4-0 Scotland. Slovakia 1-1 Wales Dan James misses a decent chance for Wales inthe last minute of added time, slicing wide from 12 yards after a good break. Memphis Depay seals victory with a tender, precise finish from a very tight angle. Northern Ireland don\u2019t deserve that. The substitute Luuk de Jong scores a strange goal from 0.1 yards after a nifty bit of footwork. It looked like he might have been a fraction offside, though we haven\u2019t seen a replay. There\u2019s no VAR anyway. Football, bugger off. That is so cruel. Netherlands 1-1 Northern Ireland Four minutes of added time. Northern Ireland have been immense. Slovakia 1-1 Wales We\u2019re into six minutes of added time in Trnava. Gareth Bale should have been sent off just now, apparently, though I\u2019m not sure exactly what happened because I\u2019m glued to events in Rotterdam. For the first time in their history (I think), Scotland are facing consecutive 4-0 defeats. Netherlands 1-1 Northern Ireland The in-form substitute Donyell Malen has missed a sitter, heading wide from six yards. There are six minutes remaining. Slovakia 1-1 Wales Six minutes remaining in Trnava. A draw isn\u2019t a bad result for Wales, especially as it would mean they have a superior head-to-head record against Slovakia. That could be decisive. \u201cFor the bad-weather-wanting Matt Dony, here\u2019s my Hurricane XI,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cOnly 8, because three got struck by lightning: David de Hail Cyclone Mings Fitz Squall Gust Poyet Wally Downespour Tornado Andre Flo Howard Gayle Hurry Kane. Memphis Depay shatters the fairytale, toebunging past Peacock-Farrell from eight yards. That was a really good finish, because he took the shot much earlier than expected. The substitute Josh Magennis has given Northern Ireland the lead! The goal came from some absurd defending from the Netherlands, with miskicks in the penalty box from first de Ligt and then Blind. Dallas picked up the loose ball on the right of the area, held off Blind and stood up a good cross towards the six-yard line. Magennis towered above everyone and steered a header into the corner. Oh my days!!!!

Russia 3-0 Scotland (Dzyuba 70) The play-offs it is for Scotland. \u201cHi again, Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cOf course the best, and longest running (since 1872) Scottish comedy of all is \u2026 ach, you know the rest. It\u2019s just as well we can laugh at ourselves, we get enough practice, eh?\u201d At least Willie Miller and Alan Hansen didn\u2019t run into each other the night. Netherlands 0-0 Northern Ireland Jonny Evans heads off the line from Wijnaldum! Nineteen minutes remaining, and for the first time it feels like a goal is imminent. \u201cContinuing the Radiohead theme, Rob \u2014 in the mid-2000s, I went home to Inverness,\u201d says Simon Sylvester. \u201cWalking home from the pub, I became aware of a large group of beery men at the far end of the high street, propping each other up and bellowing what I first assumed to be a football chant. I crossed the road to avoid them and went about my way. Halfway home, I caught myself humming the same tune, and realised that the drunken mob weren\u2019t howling out some tribal statement, but were in fact singing Idioteque. Come on Scotland, by the way.\u201d Slovakia 1-1 Wales Every time I check on this game, Slovakia are in possession just outside the Wales area. But it\u2019s still 1-1, and that would be a useful result for Wales. Netherlands 0-0 Northern Ireland There are 25 minutes remaining in Rotterdam. Northern Ireland are looking a bit tired, but they have defended with outstanding endeavour and intelligence. Two in three minutes in Moscow. That was a screamer from Magomed Ozdoev, launched past David Marshall from 25 yards. Scotland were having a good spell, but now they\u2019re behind to a goal from the hulking Artem Dzyuba. Latest scores Group C Belarus 0-0 Estonia (full time) Netherlands 0-0 Northern Ireland Group E Slovakia 1-1 Wales Croatia 3-0 Hungary Group G Latvia 0-2 Poland North Macedonia 1-0 Slovenia Austria 2-1 Israel Group I Kazakhstan 1-2 Cyprus (full time) Russia 0-0 Scotland Belgium 6-0 San Marino Netherlands 0-0 Northern Ireland The pressure is increasing in Rotterdam, with Northern Ireland looking a bit frazzled for the first time. Slovakia 1-1 Wales \u201cAre there any typhoons near Slovakia?\u201d pleads Wales fan Matt Dony. \u201cI once played a lovely acoustic arrangement of Everything In Its Right Place at a folk night. It went down exactly as well as you\u2019re imagining.\u201d One for the therapist, I\u2019m sensing. GOAL! Austria 2-1 Israel (Hinteregger 56) GOAL! North Macedonia 1-0 Slovenia (Elmas 50) One-nil! That\u2019s put the \u2018ach\u2019 in Slovakia. Wales have been pegged back in Trnava, with Juraj Kucka hitting a cracking 20-yard volley past Wayne Hennessey. Scottish comedy department \u201cI want to thank you and everyone else for your recommendations,\u201d says Matt Burtz. \u201cAs an enormous Frasier fan, Brian Cox will first and foremost be Daphne\u2019s father in my eyes. The less said about Jane Leeves\u2019 non-Mancunian accent, however, the better.\u201d At least Simon\u2019s accent was perfect, eh? Oh. Netherlands 0-0 Northern Ireland There\u2019s a long way to go - 43 minutes plus added time - but a draw would be an immense result for Northern Ireland, and mean that victory s in the return match at Windsor Park next month would guarantee qualification. \u201cForget The National Anthem, Rob: Holland\u2019s forwards have presumably been listening to How to Disappear Completely in the big earphones pre-game,\u201d says Woolie Madden. Peep peep! The second halves are under way. \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Gerry Scott. \u201cA word of recommendation for Bob Servant, a Broughty Ferry-set sitcom starring the great Brian Cox, an actor who seems able to do anything he puts his mind to.\u201d Can he play centre-forward? (See United, Manchester.) Half-time reading Half-time scores Group C Netherlands 0-0 Northern Ireland Group E Slovakia 0-1 Wales Croatia 3-0 Hungary Group G Latvia 0-2 Poland North Macedonia 0-0 Slovenia Austria 1-1 Israel Group I Russia 0-0 Scotland Belgium 6-0 San Marino \u201cBob,\u201d writes my colleague Tom Lutz. \u201cBy my calculations, that is Zahavi\u2019s 10th goal in seven games for Israel in qualifying. And he has scored 26 goals in 22 club games. Conclusion: he is good at scoring goals.\u201d Three months at Old Trafford would cure him of that. Half time: Netherlands 0-0 Northern Ireland A brilliant 45 minutes for Northern Ireland. Bailey Peacock-Farrell barely had a save to make, and although the Netherlands had all of the ball, they played with a surprising listlessness. GOAL! Belgium 6-0 San Marino (Tielemans 45+1) There are no easy games in international football. GOAL! Croatia 3-0 Hungary (Petkovic 42) Bryan Petkovic\u2019s second goal has sealed victory for Croatia, already. GOAL! Belgium 5-0 San Marino (Alderweireld 43) It\u2019s safe to say, without tempting fate, that Belgium have qualified for Euro 2020. GOALS! Austria 1-1 Israel (Lazaro 41) Belgium 4-0 San Marino (Lukaku 41) Slovakia 0-1 Wales A big appeal for a penalty is turned down after a tackle on Jonny Williams in the Slovakia area. That could have gone either way. Netherlands 0-0 Northern Ireland This is like a training exercise: attack and defence, invasion and repulsion. So far Northern Ireland are winning, because they\u2019re drawing. \u201cGiven Azerbaijan\u2019s draw against Croatia during the last international break, every single team in this group is Wales\u2019s rival for second place,\u201d says Jonny Bull. \u201cFirst might well be up for grabs by the end of the weekend too. If Croatia and Hungary could both lose, with Croatia losing their entire squad ready for Sunday, that would be ideal.\u201d GOALS! Group G Austria 0-1 Israel (Zahavi 34) Group I Belgium 3-0 San Marino (Brolli og 35) Netherlands 0-0 Northern Ireland The Netherlands are not playing particularly well. Their tempo has been too slow, and I suppose it\u2019s not beyond the realms that there might be a soup\u00e7on of complacency. GOAL! Belgium 2-0 San Marino (Lukaku 28, Chadli 31) Belgium are heading to ... somewhere. \u201cI was at a Limmy show earlier this year which was fantastic, and I would recommend his book too,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cHe told some brilliant stories about working with Charlie Brooker for Screenwipe and Black Mirror in particular. The sketch show Burnistoun is in a similar vein, and I enjoyed Two Doors Down as well.\u201d Netherlands 0-0 Northern Ireland Stuart Dallas makes a vital block from Gini Wijnaldum\u2019s blooter, and Daley Blind slashes the rebound wide. GOAL! Croatia 2-0 Hungary (Petkovic 24) Wales have grabbed the lead! Daniel James stands up a nice cross from the left, and Kieffer Moore hangs in the air for an age before planting a fine header into the corner. That\u2019s quite a story: it\u2019s his first goal for Wales, on his competitive debut. Russia 0-0 Scotland Not too much to report. Russia have been the better side, though David Marshall\u2019s gloves are not dirty. Slovakia 0-0 Wales It\u2019s been a slightly nervous start from Wales. Ethan Ampadu made one brilliant, goal-saving block, it says here, while Gareth Bale has been booked. Netherlands 0-0 Northern Ireland We\u2019ve had 18 minutes in Rotterdam, and the Netherlands still haven\u2019t created anything of note. It\u2019s been a fine start for Northern Ireland. Latest scores Group C Belarus 0-0 Estonia (full time) Netherlands 0-0 Northern Ireland Group E Slovakia 0-0 Wales Croatia 1-0 Hungary Group G Latvia 0-2 Poland North Macedonia 0-0 Slovenia Austria 0-0 Israel Group I Kazakhstan 1-2 Cyprus (full time) Russia 0-0 Scotland Belgium 0-0 San Marino \u201cI count six players from the Championship and three top-flight bench warmers in that starting XI for Wales, plus Bale and James,\u201d says Phil Grey. \u201cMaybe the future looks bright, but I want Euro 16 all over again please, except for the Portugal result of course.\u201d GOAL! Latvia 0-2 Lewandowski (Lewandowski 13) A win tonight would keep Robert Lewandowski well on course for qualification. Slovakia 0-0 Wales \u201cI\u2019d rather see Harry Wilson start,\u201d says Matt Dony, \u201cbut he\u2019s a useful option from the bench if things aren\u2019t working out after 60 mins. (Spoiler alert: They won\u2019t be.) I love him because a) he\u2019s owned by Liverpool; b) he LOVES a 25 yarder; and c) he looks incredibly like Torres. As an \u2018amusing\u2019 side point, I was also in Spain this time last year, when Spain comprehensively outplayed Wales. I watched it in a bar, along with Master Dony (six at the time), who loudly declared \u2018I HATE Sergio Ramos.\u2019 Is there a word that means proud-but-scared?\u201d Parent? Netherlands 0-0 Northern Ireland It\u2019s been a reasonably good start for Northern Ireland. They\u2019ve barely had a kick, but their defence has looked solid. There\u2019s always a danger, in games like this, that you can be down 2-0 down after 10 minutes. GOAL! Latvia 0-1 Poland I shan\u2019t insult your intelligence by naming the goalscorer. GOAL! Croatia 1-0 Hungary (Modric 5) An early goal in Wales\u2019 group. It\u2019s good news for Wales, in fact, as Hungary are among their rivals for the second qualifying spot. Netherlands 0-0 Northern Ireland Paddy McNair is doing a man-to-man marking job on Frenkie de Jong. It\u2019s been a fairly quiet start. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Matt Burtz. I think the best part of this new qualifying system is being introduced to British TV comedies that this American has never heard of. If you have any others with a Scottish flavour to recommend, I\u2019m all ears.\u201d Limmy isn\u2019t to all tastes, but he\u2019s a twisted genius. Netherlands 0-0 Northern Ireland Virgil van Dijk\u2019s 25-yard volley goes approximately 25 yards wide. \u201cYou mean to say that\u2019s not Scotland\u2019s midfield?!\u201d sniffs Simon McMahon. It\u2019s time for the national anthems at the various grounds. My dream of some flunky getting the wrong end of the stick and blasting out the pervy saxophone of The National Anthem by Radiohead has not yet come true. \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cNearly choked on my schnitzel when I saw that Cyprus have won 2-1 away to Kazakhstan. That\u2019ll be the same Kazakhstan that embarrassed Scotland 3-0 earlier this year? In Vienna for a few days where the Austrian fans appear buoyant ahead of their qualifier against Israel, and I can confirm that the Welsh fans in Bratislava have been sampling the local hospitality since early this morning. Excitably drinking in expectation, I remember that. Now Scotland fans just drink to forget. Anyway, Dundee United\u2019s Lawrence Shankland is on the bench for us tonight. Prost, and come on Scotland!\u201d What I love about this new, easy-to-understand qualifying system is that Scotland could turn up tonight with a midfield of Rab C Nesbitt and the lads from Still Game, and they\u2019d still be guaranteed a play-off place. You don\u2019t have to be a Football Manager addict to love this feature... \u201cRob, I\u2019m enjoying the first night of my holiday in Spain,\u201d says Wales fan Matt Dony, getting the enjoyment out the way before the football starts. \u201cThat Welsh side looks more-than-useful on paper. Please do everything you can to influence a positive result. If there\u2019s even a hint of a wisp of an ephemeral idea of suspicion of the ol\u2019 commentator\u2019s curse, I will be forced to visit pain upon you with maximum prejudice. And that\u2019s a horrible thought, as I\u2019m generally a very nice guy. \u201cAh, this Welsh side. So much potential. What with my club loyalties lying the other end of the M62, I\u2019m obviously divided on Giggs(y), but I was happy to give him the benefit of the doubt as Welsh manager. Something\u2019s just not working, though. Something is not clicking. And time is running out. I really, really, REALLY don\u2019t want 2016 to have been a flash in the pan. I\u2019m not the first to say it (I rarely am...) but four points from these two games is an absolute minimum requirement.\u201d I know it\u2019s not an easy fit, given Bale\u2019s role, but surely Harry Wilson is good enough to get in that team? Pre-match reading (and listening) \u201cGreetings from Trvana, Rob,\u201d says Alun Pugh. \u201cAs a Newcastle fan I was disappointed to see a Sports Direct shop at the stadium this evening. Do any other long-suffering fans know of any other far-flung stadia where there\u2019s a Sports Direct?\u201d If there\u2019s one at the Maracan\u00e3, football\u2019s dead to me. Russia v Scotland team news Michael Devlin and John Fleck will make their Scotland debuts in Russia. The pair have been handed starting places for the European Championship qualifier in Moscow. Aberdeen centre-back Devlin features in a back four that also has the surprise inclusion of Sheffield Wednesday right-back Liam Palmer in favour of Stephen O\u2019Donnell. Fleck is joined by Callum McGregor and John McGinn in midfield with Robert Snodgrass and Ryan Fraser out wide. Oliver Burke starts up front. Russia (4-3-3) Guilherme; Fernandes, Semenov, Dzhikija, Kudryashov; Ozdoev, Barinov, Zhirkov; Ionov, Dzyuba, Golovin. Subs: Dzanaev, Petrov, Chistyakov, Lunev, Ignatiev, Kuzyaev, Bakaev, Cheryshev, Komlichenko, Belyaev, Karavaev, Akhmetov. Scotland (4-3-3) Marshall; Palmer, Mulgrew, Devlin, Robertson; Fleck, McGregor, McGinn; Snodgrass, Burke, Fraser. Subs: Russell, MacGillivray, Shankland, Forrest, Christie, O\u2019Donnell, McLaughlin, Taylor, Armstrong, Gallagher, Findlay. Full time: Belarus 0-0 Estonia Great stuff. Slovakia v Wales team news Tom Lockyer and Kieffer Moore were handed their first competitive Wales starts as manager Ryan Giggs made four changes for the Euro 2020 qualifier against Slovakia in Trnava. Ben Davies and Jonathan Williams were also recalled after the 2-1 win over Azerbaijan, with Chris Mepham, Neil Taylor, Harry Lawrence and Tom Lawrence dropping out. Slovakia (4-3-3) Dubravka; Pekarik, Gyomber, Skriniar, Hancko; Kucka, Lobotka, Hamsik; Rusnak, Bozenik, Mak.

Subs: Matondo, Lawrence, Vokes, Ward, Morrell, Gunter, Tyler Roberts, Vaulks, Wilson, Adam Davies, Taylor, Ashley Williams. Netherlands v Northern Ireland team news Kyle Lafferty will lead the line for Northern Ireland in their Euro 2020 qualifier against the Netherlands in Rotterdam. Lafferty, who is yet to score for Norwegian club Sarpsborg since joining in August, faces the considerable task of breaking down a Dutch defence anchored by Virgil Van Dijk and Matthijs De Ligt. Northern Ireland boss Michael O\u2019Neill named Shane Ferguson at left-back in the absence of the injured Jamal Lewis, while Michael Smith returned at right-back with Stuart Dallas deployed on the left wing. Netherlands (4-3-3) Cillessen; Dumfries, de Ligt, van Dijk, Blind; Wijnaldum, de Roon, Frenkie de Jong; Bergwijn, Depay, Babel. Subs: Berghuis, van de Beek, Bizot, Ake, Promes, Malen, Strootman, Veltman, van Aanholt, Luuk de Jong, Vermeer, de Vrij.

Subs: Lavery, McGinn, Thompson, Carson, Kennedy, Whyte, Donnelly, Flanagan, Magennis, McGovern, McLaughlin, Boyce. Hello and welcome to coverage of Matchday 7 (sic) in the Euro 2020 qualifiers. It\u2019s all very straightforward: nobody has a clue how qualification works, but winning is better than losing. What we do know, thanks to the wonders of the information superhighway, is that Belgium will reach next summer\u2019s finals if they win at home to San Marino tonight. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye - several, ideally - on all the games, with particular focus on the home nations. Northern Ireland (who are away to the Netherlands) and Wales (away to Slovakia) still have a decent chance of automatic qualification. Scotland don\u2019t, for reasons that should be self-explanatory, but they are guaranteed a play-off place because of their Nations League exploits. These are tonight\u2019s fixtures (all 7.45pm BST unless stated). Group C Belarus 0-0 Estonia (5pm) Netherlands v Northern Ireland Group E Slovakia v Wales Croatia v Hungary Group G Latvia v Poland North Macedonia v Slovenia Austria v Israel Group I Kazakhstan 1-2 Cyprus (final score) Russia v Scotland Belgium v San Marino",

Almost before World Rugby had confirmed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/10/rugby-world-cup-england-game-cancelled-with-decision-pending-on-scotland-as-typhoon-looms\" title=\"\">cancellation of their final pool game against France</a> they were away to the airport and heading south to Miyazaki, safely out of the path of the onrushing typhoon and back to the same beachfront training base where they spent the tournament\u2019s opening days.</p> \n<p>Given England were up and out of their central Tokyo hotel in less time than it takes to say \u201cthis suits us fine mate\u201d, it was an interesting moment for the tournament organisers to be flagging up the logistical difficulties of moving rugby teams around Japan. Jones, looking as upbeat as he has done since arriving, appears rather less than broken-hearted to be fleeing the typhoon zone and sidestepping the France game.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/10/losing-by-default-to-a-typhoon-scotland-rugby-fans-braced-for-worst\">'Losing by default to a typhoon': Scotland rugby fans braced for worst</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>His good humour may also have had something to do with the latest headlines out of Australia, poised to be England\u2019s quarter-final opponents next week if the remaining pool results unfold as anticipated. It has emerged that the Canberra Raiders rugby league coach and former Kangaroos halfback Ricky Stuart will be in England\u2019s camp before the Oita game \u2013 an invitation which will not amuse the Wallabies head coach Michael Cheika, also a friend of Stuart\u2019s.</p> \n<p>Jones has previous form in this area having invited Andrew \u201cJoey\u201d Johns along to training during England\u2019s tour of Australia in 2016. Only last week Stuart was coaching the Raiders in the National Rugby League grand final against the Sydney Roosters and his knowledge of knockout rugby is sure to be among the areas of mutual discussion during a fact-finding mission which was apparently teed up a couple of months ago.</p> \n<p>England\u2019s players, either way, now have no preparation worries having been given some helpful extra leeway by the cancellation. With Billy Vunipola, Jack Nowell and Joe Marler all hoping to be back in quarter\u2011final contention, Jones clearly views this free weekend as a handy bonus and, unlike all those unfortunate supporters who have flown to Japan to find their match tickets redundant, he is not weeping into his beer.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e60fb94cee5fd6c05a64f71069706546b7b4f450\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e60fb94cee5fd6c05a64f71069706546b7b4f450/0_153_1928_1156/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Marler could feature in the quarter-final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Marler could feature in the quarter-final.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rogers/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIt is a great opportunity for us to regenerate, refocus and put a bit more petrol in the tank, so we\u2019re really happy with it,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe had an idea before we came that it could happen and therefore, in case it does, you have to accumulate points in your games to put yourself in the right position. We\u2019ve been talking about it all the time, about the possibility this was going to happen.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/typhoon1010-zip/giv-3902TVYIQGfhmAqa\" data-alt=\"Hagibis\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/typhoon1010-zip/giv-3902TVYIQGfhmAqa\">Hagibis</a> \n <figcaption>\n  Hagibis\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In other words, Jones is shedding no tears for those teams whose qualification chances have been \u2013 or could be \u2013 wrecked by the weather. Aside from an ill-judged quip about unforeseen travel chaos he would have been much better avoiding \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s typhoon season; you go somewhere else and it\u2019s terrorist season\u201d \u2013 the former Japan coach also has personal experience of how damaging typhoons can be when they strike Japanese cities.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve probably been here for about 30 typhoons,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them are just like a big thunderstorm but I can remember driving in one in Tokyo in 1996. A sign from a 7-11 convenience store flew off and landed just in front of the car. At one stage I was looking pretty dodgy if it had kept coming.

      "bodyText": "An ill wind may be blowing for some but for Eddie Jones and England life is suddenly unexpectedly calm. Almost before World Rugby had confirmed the cancellation of their final pool game against France they were away to the airport and heading south to Miyazaki, safely out of the path of the onrushing typhoon and back to the same beachfront training base where they spent the tournament\u2019s opening days. Given England were up and out of their central Tokyo hotel in less time than it takes to say \u201cthis suits us fine mate\u201d, it was an interesting moment for the tournament organisers to be flagging up the logistical difficulties of moving rugby teams around Japan. Jones, looking as upbeat as he has done since arriving, appears rather less than broken-hearted to be fleeing the typhoon zone and sidestepping the France game. His good humour may also have had something to do with the latest headlines out of Australia, poised to be England\u2019s quarter-final opponents next week if the remaining pool results unfold as anticipated. It has emerged that the Canberra Raiders rugby league coach and former Kangaroos halfback Ricky Stuart will be in England\u2019s camp before the Oita game \u2013 an invitation which will not amuse the Wallabies head coach Michael Cheika, also a friend of Stuart\u2019s. Jones has previous form in this area having invited Andrew \u201cJoey\u201d Johns along to training during England\u2019s tour of Australia in 2016. Only last week Stuart was coaching the Raiders in the National Rugby League grand final against the Sydney Roosters and his knowledge of knockout rugby is sure to be among the areas of mutual discussion during a fact-finding mission which was apparently teed up a couple of months ago. England\u2019s players, either way, now have no preparation worries having been given some helpful extra leeway by the cancellation. With Billy Vunipola, Jack Nowell and Joe Marler all hoping to be back in quarter\u2011final contention, Jones clearly views this free weekend as a handy bonus and, unlike all those unfortunate supporters who have flown to Japan to find their match tickets redundant, he is not weeping into his beer. \u201cIt is a great opportunity for us to regenerate, refocus and put a bit more petrol in the tank, so we\u2019re really happy with it,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe had an idea before we came that it could happen and therefore, in case it does, you have to accumulate points in your games to put yourself in the right position. We\u2019ve been talking about it all the time, about the possibility this was going to happen.\u201d In other words, Jones is shedding no tears for those teams whose qualification chances have been \u2013 or could be \u2013 wrecked by the weather. Aside from an ill-judged quip about unforeseen travel chaos he would have been much better avoiding \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s typhoon season; you go somewhere else and it\u2019s terrorist season\u201d \u2013 the former Japan coach also has personal experience of how damaging typhoons can be when they strike Japanese cities. \u201cI\u2019ve probably been here for about 30 typhoons,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them are just like a big thunderstorm but I can remember driving in one in Tokyo in 1996. A sign from a 7-11 convenience store flew off and landed just in front of the car. At one stage I was looking pretty dodgy if it had kept coming. I can still remember it clearly.\u201d For that reason he insists the organisers had little choice but to call off the France game on safety grounds. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why everything shuts down when typhoons come because it can be particularly dangerous. This one\u2019s supposed to be a big typhoon, so I don\u2019t see any other option that the organisers had. We think it\u2019s the right decision.\u201d Yes, but what about the potential damage to the integrity of the competition? \u201cThat is the way the laws are. All I can be happy with is my situation, I can\u2019t compare [it] to someone else\u2019s situation.\u201d As Tokyo braces itself for potentially its biggest storm of the year, Jones also believes the weather should not be allowed to obscure all the positives of staging the World Cup in Asia for the first time. \u201cWe are in the midst of a great tournament and we shouldn\u2019t let this cast a shadow over it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you never try anything new, you never know anything new. We need rugby to grow and you\u2019ve seen the growth in Japanese rugby here. We have got another major player in world rugby and it wouldn\u2019t happen unless you had the World Cup here.\u201d It will take more than an ominous looking weather forecast to persuade Jones this tournament should have been staged elsewhere.",

      "bodyText": "Tim Cook has written to Apple employees defending the company\u2019s decision to remove an app used by Hong Kong protesters to coordinate movements and avoid concentrations of police. But the chief executive has been criticised for \u201ctaking at face value\u201d the claims of the Hong Kong police, which don\u2019t chime with the experiences of international observers on the ground. Cook wrote today to all Apple employees, defending the removal of HKmap.live from the iOS App Store. In the letter, a copy of which has been seen by the Guardian, Cook says \u201cthese decisions are never easy, and it is harder still to discuss these topics during moments of furious public debate. It\u2019s out of my great respect for the work you do every day that I want to share the way we went about making this decision. \u201cIt is no secret that technology can be used for good or for ill. This case is no different. The app in question allowed for the crowdsourced reporting and mapping of police checkpoints, protest hotspots and other information. On its own, this information is benign. \u201cHowever, over the past several days we received credible information, from the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau, as well as from users in Hong Kong, that the app was being used maliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimise individuals and property where no police are present. This use put the app in violation of Hong Kong law.\u201d But Cook\u2019s claims have been disputed by those on the ground, who argue the violations described don\u2019t match up with what the app displays. Individual officers are not displayed on the map, an online version of which is still live: only large concentrations of police are shown, with the stated intention of allowing protesters to avoid rather than confront law enforcement. Similarly, the app does not display areas where \u201cno police are present\u201d, since it only focuses on police concentrations that are large enough to affect protests. Charles Mok, a member of Hong Kong\u2019s legislative council, wrote to Cook saying he was \u201cdeeply disappointed with Apple\u2019s decision to ban the app, and would like to contest the claims made by Hong Kong police force. \u201cHKmap.live helps HK residents, journalists, tourists, etc \u2026 avoid being hurt by teargas, rubber bullets, baton, beanbag round and water cannon that the Hong Kong police claims to be \u2018minimum force\u2019, and get real-time updates of public transport.

But now visitors will see works from different eras, places and mediums displayed side by side.</p> <p>Although the galleries are still ordered according to loose time periods, and some rooms follow a particular theme such as action painting, there is far greater scope for placing works alongside one another that would not ordinarily be seen together.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e2458d71dc49a5ad160c579b8acebebf50ee0f7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2458d71dc49a5ad160c579b8acebebf50ee0f7e/0_0_4245_2547/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A MoMA allery during a press preview on 10 October.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A MoMA gallery during a press preview on 10 October.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This new approach is perhaps best exemplified on the fifth floor where Picasso\u2019s 1907 painting Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon is hung close to Louise Bourgeois\u2019s 1947-53 sculpture Quarantania, I and Faith Ringgold\u2019s 1967 work American People Series #20: Die, depicting a scene from a race riot.</p> <p>Lowry said part of the purpose of this is to connect the past and present.</p> <p>Presenting Picasso alongside Ringgold, it \u201creframes\u201d the artist, he said. \u201cIntroducing Faith Ringgold\u2019s painting, which is violent, introduces issues around race but it also talks about the impact of colonisation and decolonisation. It reframes Picasso differently. It doesn\u2019t diminish Picasso, it simply means that there\u2019s another conversation you can have around Picasso.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThroughout the building we have tried to identify moments where unexpected relationships suddenly change the way we see something \u2026 You can take works of art that are roughly contemporaneous but from different parts of the world and they spark conversations with each other that are unexpected.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"815065864b5c95a5abee74fd35f218de044c3628\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/815065864b5c95a5abee74fd35f218de044c3628/0_68_5805_3484/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A member of the media looks at the work of Rivane Neuenschwander titled Work of Days during a press preview on 10 October.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A member of the media looks at the work of Rivane Neuenschwander titled Work of Days during a press preview on 10 October.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It also reflects the way people in 2019 consume a wide variety of images in a digital world where they are often shown out of context and in untraditional settings.</p> <p>\u201cWe all live now with screens and we\u2019re used to this kind of lateral projection of imagery,\u201d said Lowry. \u201cYou tap here, you get this, you connect this. There\u2019s a kind of seamlessness to the way we absorb both images in the virtual world and images in the physical world. And so I think part of what we wanted to do was to clearly recognise that our audiences, not just our younger audiences, all of our audiences, are experiencing imagery in new and different ways.\u201d</p> <p>There is greater diversity among the artists behind the works, which will be on regular rotation so that every six months a third of the works will be different.</p> <p>The museum said that works by women have increased fivefold since the early 2000s, although 59% of artists across their collection are still male, with 28% female and 13% are people who are not gender-specific or are not single entities but groups, collectives and companies. They have also increased works from outside North America and Europe.</p> <p>Lowry said: \u201cIn the last 20 years we\u2019ve made a very big push to ensure that representation of women, of African Americans and of course artists from elsewhere in the world was even more robust than before.\u201d</p> <p>The museum has also tried to make itself more approachable to people outside of the art world by avoiding art-specific terminology in their signs.</p> <p>Among the opening works on display are Rainforest V (Variation 1) by David Tudor and Composers Inside Electronics, an installation in the new studio, Richard Serra\u2019s Equal and a new site-specific work by Yoko Ono, Peace is Power.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4cd05c57825a3cb0ec303b4cde83e4a973cac401\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cd05c57825a3cb0ec303b4cde83e4a973cac401/0_124_5163_3098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman walks past Campbell\u2019s Soup Cans by Andy Warhol during a press preview on 10 October.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman walks past Campbell\u2019s Soup Cans by Andy Warhol during a press preview on 10 October.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Exhibitions include Betye Saar: The Legends of Black Girl\u2019s Window, Sur moderno: Journeys of Abstraction \u2013 The Patricia Phelps de Cisneros Gift and member: Pope.L, 1978-2001.</p> <p>The museum, the 90th anniversary of which falls this year, is also partnering with the Studio Museum in Harlem.</p> <p>The extension was designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro with Gensler.</p> <p>The architect Elizabeth Diller said she wanted to make the museum more comfortable and inviting and to enable visitors to have \u201cmore agency\u201d moving around the building. \u201cFor people to have options, I think that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Diller, who recently also worked on New York\u2019s new arts venue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/apr/05/shed-new-york-inside-arts-complex-hudson-yards\">the Shed at Hudson Yards</a> and previously the High Line and refurbished the Lincoln Center, said it is a positive time for New York arts buildings.</p> <p>\u201cOh it\u2019s an amazing time.

      "bodyText": "New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) unveiled its new $450m expansion on Thursday in a revamp of the gallery \u2013 including a radical \u201cremix\u201d of its permanent collection, which will see famous works exhibited alongside those of lesser-known artists. The popular Manhattan museum, which attracts 3 million visitors a year, has been closed since June for the renovation and rehang but will reopen to the public on 21 October with an additional 47,000 sq ft of space \u2013 an increase of nearly 30% \u2013 after the installation of a new glass and blackened steel extension. New features include a studio space for performance, process and time-based art, which MoMA says is the first of its kind in a major museum in the world, where visitors can experience the artistic process firsthand and watch rehearsals. For the first time, an entire floor of the six-floor gallery \u2013 including the sculpture garden and ground floor galleries \u2013 will be free, opening up access to those who cannot afford the $25 entry fee. MoMA\u2019s director, Glenn Lowry, said the museum\u2019s aim was threefold: to make more space for the collection, reorganise the gallery and to bring more of the city into the space. \u201cOften museums feel like sealed boxes and we wanted to get away from that and to take advantage of the fact that we\u2019re located in this fascinating part of New York city,\u201d he said at a preview of the space. Historically, the museum has always hung works in chronological order with different mediums separately. But now visitors will see works from different eras, places and mediums displayed side by side. Although the galleries are still ordered according to loose time periods, and some rooms follow a particular theme such as action painting, there is far greater scope for placing works alongside one another that would not ordinarily be seen together. This new approach is perhaps best exemplified on the fifth floor where Picasso\u2019s 1907 painting Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon is hung close to Louise Bourgeois\u2019s 1947-53 sculpture Quarantania, I and Faith Ringgold\u2019s 1967 work American People Series #20: Die, depicting a scene from a race riot. Lowry said part of the purpose of this is to connect the past and present. Presenting Picasso alongside Ringgold, it \u201creframes\u201d the artist, he said. \u201cIntroducing Faith Ringgold\u2019s painting, which is violent, introduces issues around race but it also talks about the impact of colonisation and decolonisation. It reframes Picasso differently. It doesn\u2019t diminish Picasso, it simply means that there\u2019s another conversation you can have around Picasso.\u201d He added: \u201cThroughout the building we have tried to identify moments where unexpected relationships suddenly change the way we see something \u2026 You can take works of art that are roughly contemporaneous but from different parts of the world and they spark conversations with each other that are unexpected.\u201d It also reflects the way people in 2019 consume a wide variety of images in a digital world where they are often shown out of context and in untraditional settings. \u201cWe all live now with screens and we\u2019re used to this kind of lateral projection of imagery,\u201d said Lowry. \u201cYou tap here, you get this, you connect this. There\u2019s a kind of seamlessness to the way we absorb both images in the virtual world and images in the physical world. And so I think part of what we wanted to do was to clearly recognise that our audiences, not just our younger audiences, all of our audiences, are experiencing imagery in new and different ways.\u201d There is greater diversity among the artists behind the works, which will be on regular rotation so that every six months a third of the works will be different. The museum said that works by women have increased fivefold since the early 2000s, although 59% of artists across their collection are still male, with 28% female and 13% are people who are not gender-specific or are not single entities but groups, collectives and companies. They have also increased works from outside North America and Europe. Lowry said: \u201cIn the last 20 years we\u2019ve made a very big push to ensure that representation of women, of African Americans and of course artists from elsewhere in the world was even more robust than before.\u201d The museum has also tried to make itself more approachable to people outside of the art world by avoiding art-specific terminology in their signs. Among the opening works on display are Rainforest V (Variation 1) by David Tudor and Composers Inside Electronics, an installation in the new studio, Richard Serra\u2019s Equal and a new site-specific work by Yoko Ono, Peace is Power. Exhibitions include Betye Saar: The Legends of Black Girl\u2019s Window, Sur moderno: Journeys of Abstraction \u2013 The Patricia Phelps de Cisneros Gift and member: Pope.L, 1978-2001. The museum, the 90th anniversary of which falls this year, is also partnering with the Studio Museum in Harlem. The extension was designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro with Gensler. The architect Elizabeth Diller said she wanted to make the museum more comfortable and inviting and to enable visitors to have \u201cmore agency\u201d moving around the building. \u201cFor people to have options, I think that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d she added. Diller, who recently also worked on New York\u2019s new arts venue the Shed at Hudson Yards and previously the High Line and refurbished the Lincoln Center, said it is a positive time for New York arts buildings. \u201cOh it\u2019s an amazing time. For my studio especially because we were involved in two amazing projects in New York and both iconic and they couldn\u2019t be more different from each other.\u201d",

Opinion and analysis Studies show that the rate of anxiety, stress and burnout for teachers is higher than the national average. \u201cWith 80% of teachers in Australian schools reporting to have experienced bullying or harassment from students and parents, it\u2019s not surprising our teachers are exhausted,\u201d writes Jane Mueller. \u201cWe\u2019ve evolved into a society that focuses more on our rights than our responsibilities. When future generations do not perform as we think they should, it\u2019s easiest to lay blame on teachers \u2026 Teachers are expected to do much more than their vocation originally called for.\u201d Whoever hacked Rebekah Vardy\u2019s Instagram was obviously never at Baden-Baden, writes Marina Hyde of the football wives drama that has dazzled the internet this week. \u201cThe 2006 World Cup was the \u2019Nam of It-bags and hair extensions, and every true Wag succubus was forged in its fires. It was where I saw Victoria Beckham wearing high heels IN a swimming pool. It was where I watched Elen Rives dance on a bar table singing I Will Survive. It was where a slightly delayed flight forced Victoria to observe to the FA: \u2018A dog gets better treatment than this.\u2019 It was where Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson was still giving players \u2013 billeted in another hotel \u2013 what was known in tabloid terms as a \u2018nookie pass\u2019. THAT is heritage. You can\u2019t buy it, even if \u2013 as Rebekah\u2019s denial put it \u2013 \u2018not being funny but I don\u2019t need the money\u2019.\u201d Sport The Socceroos thrashed Nepal 5-0 on Thursday night but they still left their World Cup qualifier frustrated. The Wallabies\u2019 final World Cup game against Georgia tonight is a good opportunity to hone their attacking and defensive structures for the looming quarter-final. Cricket Australia has announced a \u201cgame-changing\u201d parental leave policy that aims to support pregnant players and their families. Thinking time: Kortney Olson is crushing it A woman in activewear crosses the street towards a car with blacked-out windows and no licence plates and says to the man inside, \u201cDid you just catcall me?\u201d When he reluctantly confirms that he did, she says cheerfully, \u201cI\u2019m just going to tell you right now, a lot of women get intimidated when you do that \u2026 Most women are like, this motherfucker\u2019s going to throw me in the back of the car, you know what I mean? I dress like this because it\u2019s hot as fuck and I work out really hard. Pow. I\u2019m strong and powerful and I\u2019d fuck you up. But what I\u2019m saying is, a lot of women get really intimidated by catcalling. You got me? So that\u2019s what\u2019s up. What\u2019s your name?\u201d She fist-bumps him. \u201cJason, I\u2019m Kortney. It\u2019s nice to meet you. Take care.\u201d Jason probably didn\u2019t know he\u2019d chosen Kortney Olson to hiss at. She\u2019s the bodybuilder who smashes watermelons between her thighs and is an Australian women\u2019s armwrestling champion. Her Instagram page is full of powerlifting feats \u2013 and the occasional candid video like her meeting with Jason. Olson benchpresses men like Jason. Media roundup The ABC reports that a university academic who spoke out about international student admission standards and welfare is being counter-sued for damages by his employer after appearing on a Four Corners program. Tools down if workers hot, sticky is the Australian\u2019s front-page headline this morning, on a story about a reported CFMEU-backed policy \u201callowing Brisbane construction workers to stop work when the temperature hits 28C and humidity reaches 75 percent.\u201d The Australian Financial Review reports that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission head, Rod Sims, \u201chas suggested big electricity companies are deliberately delaying investment in new fast-start gas power stations to defend their own profits\u201d. Coming up Scott Morrison will hold discussions with the Fijian leader, Frank Bainimarama, in Suva and attend the prime minister\u2019s XIII rugby league matches. The federal court in Melbourne will deliver a judgment on the lawfulness of police raids on two Australian Workers\u2019 Union offices.

I\u2019d encourage the BA management team to get involved.\u201d The pilots union Balpa said it was still hoping to meet BA management for talks at the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service, but that it reserved the right to set more strike dates. The union has a mandate for further action until January. Balpa has sought a profit-sharing scheme rather than the 11.5% pay increase over three years in a deal offered by BA. Pilots argue that they should be compensated for cuts to pay and pensions accepted when BA was struggling. Walsh said: \u201cI can understand the argument; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily accurate.\u201d He said that unions had agreed to pay cuts rather than redundancies. Walsh added that he did not believe the third runway at Heathrow, where IAG operates more than half of all flights, would now be built. \u201cThey now have two major issues that I struggle now to see how they can overcome, the cost of expansion and the environmental impact,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Chris Williamson, the Derby North MP, has lost a high court bid to be reinstated in the Labour party after he was suspended in a row over antisemitism. A ruling released on Thursday said the party acted \u201cin good faith\u201d by launching an investigation into claims by Williamson that loyal members accused of antisemitism were being demonised for political reasons. The ruling means the one-time ally of Jeremy Corbyn must still face an internal inquiry and could struggle to stand as an MP for the party were a general election called this year. Union sources said they would trigger a selection battle against Williamson even if he were subsequently cleared. Williamson was suspended in February after video footage showed him telling a meeting of Momentum that Labour\u2019s reaction to antisemitism allegations had led to the party being \u201cdemonised\u201d and claiming he had celebrated the resignation of the MP Joan Ryan, who quit Labour in protest over the handling of antisemitism complaints. He was readmitted to the party and issued with a formal warning after a hearing of a national executive committee (NEC) antisemitism panel in June \u2013 prompting an outcry from MPs, peers and Jewish groups. Jon Lansman, the founder of Momentum, said at the time that Williamson had not shown \u201cone iota of contrition\u201d after saying the party had been \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d in the face of criticism of how it dealt with antisemitism within its ranks. Almost 70 Labour staff members wrote to express their anger at Williamson\u2019s readmission. Days later, he was suspended again after a second panel reviewed the decision to reinstate him and found it \u201ccannot safely stand\u201d. Following fresh claims that he undermined the party\u2019s ability to campaign against antisemitism by publicly characterising the disciplinary processes against racism as \u201cpolitically motivated and/or not genuine\u201d, Labour then imposed a separate additional suspension in September. The party also alleged he had publicly legitimised or endorsed misconduct of former members. Williamson\u2019s lawyers argued that his treatment had been \u201cmanifestly unfair\u201d and asked the court to declare his suspension from the party void. Ruling on Thursday, Justice Pepperall said Labour\u2019s decision in July to suspend Williamson was unlawful because the party failed to follow the rules and questioned the party\u2019s evidence that claimed Keith Vaz was unfit to be involved in the judgment. The Leicester East MP had sat on the three-member panel that agreed to let Williamson back into the party in June and had called for the decision to suspend him again shortly afterwards to be reviewed. However, the judge found there was \u201cnothing in the new allegations, the timing of the letter of 3 September or the decision to suspend that entitles me to take the view upon the papers that the Labour party is acting either unfairly or other than in good faith\u201d. He added: \u201cWhile the Labour party is no longer able lawfully to pursue the original disciplinary case against Mr Williamson, that does not afford him immunity from any subsequent disciplinary action.\u201d Williamson tweeted after the ruling: \u201cThe battle is won. The war rages on. The high court has today judged that the Labour party acted unlawfully in re-suspending me and \u2018that there was no proper reason\u2019 for doing so.

      "bodyText": "A popular Syrian restaurant in Toronto which had been due to close after its owners received a wave of death threats will stay open after an outpouring of support from neighbours and local businesses, in the latest twist of saga that has exposed the steady polarization of Canadian politics. Soon after the Al-Soufi family emigrated to Canada in 2015, they launched a restaurant, Soufi\u2019s, in downtown Toronto, which won international acclaim not only for its menu, but also its commitment to help newly arrived Syrian refugees adapt to life in Canada. In a glowing profile, the New York Times held up the restaurant as an emblem of \u201cCanada\u2019s embrace of the Syrian refugees\u201d. Earlier this week, however, the family announced the restaurant would permanently close following a barrage of death threats after the owners\u2019 son was involved in an altercation outside a far-right politician\u2019s campaign event. \u201cOur decision is made with a heavy heart in effort to maintain our family and staff\u2019s safety,\u201d the owners said. The announcement prompted despair among fellow Syrian immigrants, said Bayan Khatib, executive director at the Syrian Canadian Foundation. \u201cThey were a success story for all of us. They were an example of successful integration and of giving back,\u201d she said. The threats against the family were linked to a decision by the owner\u2019s son Alaa to attend a political protest in September. Alaa had travelled to the city of Hamilton to join a demonstration outside a rally for a far-right populist candidate, Maxime Bernier, whose fringe People\u2019s Party of Canada has been described as xenophobic and racist. But the protesters came under criticism after several of them were filmed blocking an elderly couple from crossing the street to attend the rally. Footage of the incident, which was viewed online more than 7 million times, showed one of the protesters shouting \u201cNazi scum, off our streets!\u201d at the couple. Dorothy Marston, 81, and her husband, were only able to enter the rally with the help of police. \u201cThey were \u2026 treating me like I\u2019m a criminal,\u201d she told CBC News. One of the protesters, wearing a black ski-mask and orange T-shirt, was identified as Alaa Al-Soufi \u2013 the son of the restaurant owners. He does not join in the abuse but can seen standing in Marston\u2019s path. Supporters of Bernier \u201cdoxxed\u201d Alaa, releasing his personal information online \u2013 and his family\u2019s restaurant became the target of a wave of hate messages. The family said in a statement earlier this week that Alaa \u201cdid not in any way verbally or physically assault the elderly woman and has nonetheless offered to apologize personally for not doing more\u201d. By then, however, the posts about the family, including the address and telephone numbers, were being widely shared on far-right and anti-immigrant Facebook groups. On Tuesday, the family announced that they were permanently closing their business, adding: \u201cThe magnitude of hate we are facing is overwhelming.\u201d The Syrian Canadian Foundation, where Alaa had volunteered, was also targeted with \u201cviolent and disgusting\u201d hate mail, said Khatib. But the family\u2019s plight also prompted an outpouring of support, and on Thursday they announced the would reopen. At a press conference outside the restaurant, Husam Al-Soufi told reporters that the decision to close \u201ccame from a place of fear\u201d \u2013 but the outpouring of support had inspired the family to continue serving the city. Mohamed Fakih, a Toronto-based businessman who has made a high-profile effort to hire Syrian staff at his restaurant chain, pledged to support the family\u2019s business. \u201cWe\u2019re going to send a message that hate will never win in Canada,\u201d he said. Police have now opened an investigation into the threats, the family has said. The family felt like they had the strength to come back because of all the love and support they got,\u201d said Khatib. \u201cIn this case, the good is bigger than the bad.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Jewish community leaders in Germany have criticised the police\u2019s \u201cscandalously\u201d slow response to the terror attack on a synagogue in eastern Germany. A gunman in military outfit went on a rampage in the city of Halle, killing two people, with further bloodshed averted only because the attacker\u2019s homemade firearms malfunctioned. The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany said the police had been slow to come to the rescue of 60-70 people inside the synagogue in the city\u2019s Paulus quarter, after the attacker tried to shoot open the gates. \u201cIt\u2019s scandalous that a synagogue in Halle isn\u2019t being protected by police on a holy day like Yom Kippur,\u201d said Josef Schuster. In response to the attack, Germany\u2019s interior minister announced his ministry would permanently improve security measures at synagogues across the country. \u201cThis government will do everything to make sure that Jews can live in this country without threats, without fear,\u201d said Horst Seehofer. Footage broadcast on a livestreaming platform suggests the deadly attack would have ended with many more victims if the gunman\u2019s homemade firearms had not malfunctioned. The suspect, named by media as a 27-year-old German citizen, Stephan Balliet, broadcast his rampage on the Twitch platform. The footage shows the suspect becoming increasingly frustrated as his homemade weapons repeatedly malfunction. In at least three instances the video shows the suspect pointing a gun directly at a victim only for the weapon to jam. Calling himself a \u201closer\u201d, at one point he says: \u201cI have certainly managed to prove how absurd improvised weapons are.\u201d Germany\u2019s chief federal prosecutor, Peter Frank, said on Thursday that the suspect wanted to carry out a \u201cmassacre\u201d and had about 4kg of explosives in his car. Balliet, who lived with his mother in the municipality of Helbra, about 40km from the site of the attack, has been described in German media reports as a loner with few close friends, who spent a lot of time in front of his computer. A mission statement that was first uploaded on the obscure meguca.org imageboard and then reposted on a number of forums, where it was later found by researchers at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King\u2019s College, London, appears to confirm the use of homemade firearms built according to plans released by a British pro-gun activist from West Yorkshire. Philip Luty, who believed British gun control laws were \u201cfascist\u201d, devoted his life to publicising blueprints for making firearms from easy to obtain materials, with the goal of allowing private citizens around the world to flout gun restrictions by building weapons at home. When he died of cancer in 2011, Luty, 46, was facing three terrorism charges for manuals he had published explaining how to build firearms, including a 9mm submachine gun, according to the Yorkshire Evening Post. The Halle suspect appears to have used one of these homemade Luty submachine guns, as well as other homemade guns and hand grenades, according to the Kohlchan documents. The documents suggest he used homemade guns intentionally, with the goal of \u201cshowing the viability of improvised guns\u201d for people who want to carry out terror attacks but who do not have access to commercially made weapons. The footage of the shooting suggests the homemade guns malfunctioned, which may have helped prevent more murders. After attacks on both a synagogue and a kebab shop, according to the livestreamed footage, the gunman said: \u201cSorry, guys, the fucking Luty is shit!\u201d Both the documents and the livestreamed footage suggest the gunman was a white nationalist, and that he hoped his attack would inspire other white people to kill more Jewish people, as well as other people he perceived as enemies of the white race, including Muslim people, black people, anti-fascists, and communists. The mission statement also shows that he deliberately chose to carry out his rampage on Yom Kippur but was wary of the synagogue being heavily secured, and considered attacking a mosque or an \u201cantifa culture centre\u201d. Germany has strict gun laws and rigorous procedures for buying weapons, but it also has very high rates of private gun ownership. While German authorities have not yet confirmed the types of weapons used in the attack, some arms experts online said it was clear from images of the weapons used in the attack that at least one of the guns was built from a distinctive Luty submachine blueprint. Luty, described as a \u201cloner\u201d who lived with his parents, was sentenced to four years in prison in 1998 for building a prohibited weapon, a submachine gun, and for illegal possession of ammunition, the Sunday Telegraph reported. But he continued what he called his \u201cno compromise stance on gun rights issues\u201d, and went on to publish multiple books with an American publisher describing how to make homemade guns. In 2009, firearms officers arrested Luty and searched his home. He faced new terrorism charges related to \u201cmaking a record of information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism\u201d, according to a spokesperson for the counter-terrorism policing unit in West Yorkshire. He died before the case went to trial. The Metropolitan police declined to comment on Wednesday evening. The Twitch video, seen by the Guardian, suggests that the attacker was on the street outside the synagogue for more than five minutes, during which time he shot and killed a passerby, without being approached by law enforcement. After a visit to the synagogue on Thursday, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Germans needed to united against extremism. \u201cToday is a day of shame and disgrace,\u201d Steinmeier said. \u201cI\u2019m very sure the overwhelming majority of this society in Germany wants Jewish life to be part of this country \u2026 We must stand together long term against violence like we experienced here yesterday.

      "bodyText": "Ever since reports of a telephone call with Donald Trump emerged last month, the news has been bad for the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. In the space of a few weeks, he has faced protests over a controversial peace deal in Ukraine\u2019s south-east, a lacklustre visit from the IMF and the resignation of a reformist cabinet member. What was needed, his administration decided, was a grand gesture to recapture the narrative of a young, outsider president with a 70 per cent approval rating. That gesture came on Thursday, as Ukraine\u2019s president held what his office called a \u201cmarathon\u201d press conference lasting more than 14 hours, with 300 journalists in attendance, which looked more like a forced march by the end. Zelenskiy took questions at Kyiv food market in the refurbished Arsenal weapons factory, where he sat at a broad table next to a stall advertising \u201coysters and sparkling\u201d. The venue was carefully chosen to signal the administration\u2019s openness. Eight hours into the event, a man in a vest bearing the word \u201cexpert\u201d presented Zelenskiy with an award for holding the world\u2019s longest press conference, an honour previously held by the leader of Belarus.

A White House summary of the call showed Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate business dealings by the family of his political rival Joe Biden in Ukraine, as well as claims the former vice-president had a Ukrainian prosecutor fired for looking into a company where his son worked.

But Zelenskiy\u2019s main message to the US was: leave us out of it. \u201cChoose your own president yourself,\u201d Zelenskiy told American reporters in an attempt to stake neutral ground in a Democratic impeachment inquiry. \u201cAnd if possible, we ask you not to influence elections in a free Ukraine.\u201d Down below, journalists ate lunch at stalls with names such as Bali Bowl and Milk Bar as protesters and petitioners occasionally shouted up to Zelenskiy. One, the mother of a Ukrainian lawyer stabbed to death in 2017, demanded a proper investigation into the murder, and justice for her daughter. Over the hours of questioning, Zelenskiy dodged queries about his relationship with the billionaire Ihor Kolomoisky, and called ending the war with Russian-backed separatists in south-east Ukraine the most important goal of his presidency. The spectacle recalled a hallmark of another politician: Vladimir Putin\u2019s marathon press conferences and Q&amp;A sessions, controlled but flashy affairs primarily designed to show the Russian president\u2019s transparency without putting him in danger of embarrassing himself. Zelenskiy also said he would have to meet Putin face to face to end the war, which would be deeply controversial in political circles in Kyiv. \u201cNo one talks about the meeting in person because everyone is against it,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, the meeting must be held if we want the war to end.\u201d No date had been discussed, Zelenskiy added.

      "bodyText": "Former Barclays bosses were worried that a side deal to pay Qatar \u00a3322m was one of the most dangerous parts of the bank\u2019s emergency fundraising in 2008 and risked landing them in jail where \u201cthe food sucks and the sex is worse\u201d, a court has heard. Prosecutors for the Serious Fraud Office told the Old Bailey in London that phone calls and transcripts proved the bankers were trying to disguise the payments, which were demanded by Qatari investors in exchange for their participation in the \u00a311bn fundraising. Edward Brown QC, prosecuting, claimed the three defendants knew the arrangement may be illegal and wanted lawyers to sign off on the deal. In a June 2008 phone call Richard Boath, then Barclays\u2019 investment banking chief, told fellow defendant Thomas Kalaris, then head of its wealth division: \u201cFrankly we all know that whatever we enter into we are entering into in exchange for the subscription agreement. So, you know, it is, he\u2019s [the lawyer has] got to get his head round it.\u201d \u201cYeah that\u2019s right,\u201d replied Kalaris. \u201cNone of us wants to go to jail here \u2026 the food sucks and the sex is worse.\u201d Boath later referred to the deal, as \u201cone of the most dangerous aspects of this whole transaction\u201d. Brown said the bankers were under pressure to secure the funding from Qatar, and otherwise risked Barclays being nationalised through a government bailout as the financial crisis took hold. One of Boath\u2019s colleagues lamented that the Qataris \u201chad them by the balls\u201d in negotiations. \u201cWhat he doesn\u2019t realise is that if he doesn\u2019t come through with his money we\u2019re fucked,\u201d Boath was later heard saying. Boath, Kalaris and Barclays\u2019 former investment banking chief Roger Jenkins are accused of lying to the stock market and other investors about how the \u00a3322m was paid to Qatar, in exchange for a \u00a34bn investment. The SFO alleges the trio used two fraudulent \u201cadvisory services agreements\u201d to hide the payments. The defendant are accused of fraud, well as conspiracy to commit fraud. All three deny the charges. A previous trial involving all three executives came to a close in April, when the jury was discharged. This trial is expected to last four to five months.",

In a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ISePLL1wcw\" title=\"\">characteristically bullying interview</a> with one of the founders of XR, Piers Morgan repeatedly demanded an answer to the question: \u201cDo you have a television?\u201d The presenter\u2019s insistence that a personal carbon footprint of close to zero should be a prerequisite for joining the protests is a little silly. Far-reaching structural solutions are required to limit global heating to the 1.5C threshold identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; it is not necessary to forgo Match of the Day or Strictly Come Dancing to have the right to call for them.</p> <p>More troubling is the strain of opinion that holds that, though sincere and well-intentioned, XR\u2019s supporters <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-times-view-on-extinction-rebellion-a-change-in-the-climate-ssfkqsbvn\" title=\"\">fail to supply adequate or practical answers</a> to a crisis they describe in hyperbolic terms. The protests, it is suggested, are self-indulgent theatre. Overstating the problem with banners stating \u201cWe\u2019re f****d\u201d, while failing to offer realistic solutions, may even harm the cause the protesters wish to promote.</p> <p>It is true that XR needs to think carefully about the level, frequency and targets of the chaos it imposes on the public. But a radical social movement pursuing a strategy of civil disobedience is not trying to be some kind of government-in-waiting. The job of a movement such as XR is to be well organised, innovative and eye-catching and keep the climate crisis looming large in the imagination of the public and politicians. On those criteria, it is succeeding. The carnivalesque quality of its activities \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7556209/Send-clowns-Circus-group-unleashes-Red-Brigade-Extinction-Rebellion.html\" title=\"\">the performance art; the yoga on a London bridge; the raves and breastfeeding sit-ins</a> \u2013 may be derided by some, but is part of the reason for its success.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/08/what-are-extinction-rebellion-key-demands-climate-emergency\" title=\"\">movement\u2019s three demands</a> in these October protests are that the government does more to communicate the urgency of the climate crisis; that it legally commits to net zero carbon emissions by 2025; and that a citizens\u2019 assembly be convened to oversee the changes. The last idea has already been adopted by President Emmanuel Macron in France and deserves serious consideration. XR claims, with justification, that the adversarial nature of parliamentary politics inhibits the radical risk-taking that the climate crisis requires. The damning failure to achieve <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201719/ldselect/ldeconaf/392/392.pdf\" title=\"\">cross-party reform of a social care system</a> acknowledged to be broken proves the point. Zero emissions by 2025 is surely an unrealistic goal. So what? The aim is to provoke and chivvy politicians and businesses, in the hope that the previously inconceivable becomes the far horizon of the possible.</p> <p>It is more or less a year since Extinction Rebellion first hit the streets, blockading five London bridges last November, and Greta Thunberg began her school strike. Since then, Britain has declared a climate emergency and committed to a 2050 target for emissions. Last month, the Labour party conference adopted 2030 as the date to aim for. Ipsos Mori reports that its latest poll <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/07/extinction-rebellion-climate-change-deniers\" title=\"\">found that 78% of Britons</a> believe the planet is \u201cheading for disaster\u201d, up from 59% in 2013. On Thursday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/10/british-airways-offset-domestic-flight-emissions-from-next-year\" title=\"\">British Airways announced</a> it would offset emissions from domestic flights from next year. Some, at least, are finally treating the crisis as on a par with the economy in terms of importance. The frame of the debate has palpably shifted, as it must, and XR deserve much of the credit.</p>",

Politicians have moaned that the police are being too passive, and Boris Johnson, Britain\u2019s prime minister, labelled the protesters \u2013 who include a former Metropolitan police detective \u2013 \u201cuncooperative crusties\u201d. In a characteristically bullying interview with one of the founders of XR, Piers Morgan repeatedly demanded an answer to the question: \u201cDo you have a television?\u201d The presenter\u2019s insistence that a personal carbon footprint of close to zero should be a prerequisite for joining the protests is a little silly. Far-reaching structural solutions are required to limit global heating to the 1.5C threshold identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; it is not necessary to forgo Match of the Day or Strictly Come Dancing to have the right to call for them. More troubling is the strain of opinion that holds that, though sincere and well-intentioned, XR\u2019s supporters fail to supply adequate or practical answers to a crisis they describe in hyperbolic terms. The protests, it is suggested, are self-indulgent theatre. Overstating the problem with banners stating \u201cWe\u2019re f****d\u201d, while failing to offer realistic solutions, may even harm the cause the protesters wish to promote. It is true that XR needs to think carefully about the level, frequency and targets of the chaos it imposes on the public. But a radical social movement pursuing a strategy of civil disobedience is not trying to be some kind of government-in-waiting. The job of a movement such as XR is to be well organised, innovative and eye-catching and keep the climate crisis looming large in the imagination of the public and politicians. On those criteria, it is succeeding. The carnivalesque quality of its activities \u2013 the performance art; the yoga on a London bridge; the raves and breastfeeding sit-ins \u2013 may be derided by some, but is part of the reason for its success. The movement\u2019s three demands in these October protests are that the government does more to communicate the urgency of the climate crisis; that it legally commits to net zero carbon emissions by 2025; and that a citizens\u2019 assembly be convened to oversee the changes. The last idea has already been adopted by President Emmanuel Macron in France and deserves serious consideration. XR claims, with justification, that the adversarial nature of parliamentary politics inhibits the radical risk-taking that the climate crisis requires. The damning failure to achieve cross-party reform of a social care system acknowledged to be broken proves the point. Zero emissions by 2025 is surely an unrealistic goal. So what? The aim is to provoke and chivvy politicians and businesses, in the hope that the previously inconceivable becomes the far horizon of the possible. It is more or less a year since Extinction Rebellion first hit the streets, blockading five London bridges last November, and Greta Thunberg began her school strike. Since then, Britain has declared a climate emergency and committed to a 2050 target for emissions. Last month, the Labour party conference adopted 2030 as the date to aim for. Ipsos Mori reports that its latest poll found that 78% of Britons believe the planet is \u201cheading for disaster\u201d, up from 59% in 2013. On Thursday British Airways announced it would offset emissions from domestic flights from next year. Some, at least, are finally treating the crisis as on a par with the economy in terms of importance. The frame of the debate has palpably shifted, as it must, and XR deserve much of the credit.",

They have also consistently blocked the introduction of portaloos and waste disposal systems at Trafalgar Square.\u201d</p> \n<p>One protester at the airport, Val Saunders, 65, from Stroud in Gloucestershire, said: \u201cWe got off the coach today, we looked around, it\u2019s like HG Wells. All this infrastructure, all these airports, they are just spreading out more and more. It\u2019s just encouraging people to fly more. It\u2019s going in the wrong direction, this government.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so angry. If we keep going with expansions, there is no future. [The protest is] a way of telling people: yeah, this is the right thing to do, this is the way to go, we need more and more. No, we need less, we need to stock-take what we have. We need to reassess. We need to use some of the money, those billions that go into expansions, put that into alternative energy.\u201d</p> \n<p>Police attempted to clear journalists from the scene before leading and carrying people away one by one.</p> \n<p>One officer said authorities wanted to create a \u201csterile area\u201d. He said he had the power to order journalists to leave because the area was private property covered by bylaws governing access.</p> \n<p>One man appeared in pain as he was moved by officers towards a staircase. Among those carried down the steps was Frank Benatt, 78, from Totnes in Devon. Minutes earlier, asked if he was afraid to be arrested, he said: \u201cI think really this is minimal.

While the bulk of activists failed to penetrate security and get inside airport terminals, as they had hoped, protests were staged at the airport\u2019s Docklands Light Railway station, outside its main entrance and on roads leading to the site. Protesters at the exit of the DLR station sat down and superglued themselves to the floor, chanting \u201cfly today, gone tomorrow\u201d, as they were surrounded by police. At about the same time, a second group of protesters who had travelled to the airport by coach staged protests outside the main entrance. Responding to the arrest figures, a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion said: it was \u201can astonishing number\u201d. They added: \u201cBut also it\u2019s really worrying that it takes this to get the media to notice and pay attention to this as a news story \u2013 people are having to put their bodies on the line for this.\u201d The police were asked to respond to footage on social media showing an officer instructing colleagues to \u201cuse pain and compliance\u201d as they grappled with protesters on the ground outside of the airport. The Met\u2019s deputy assistant commissioner, Laurence Taylor, said officers would always try to use the least force possible but added: \u201cIf that level of resistance then increases to passive resistance \u2013 so refusing to be lifted \u2013 we would then use what we call pain and compliance, which is not what it might sound. \u201cIt\u2019s using some compliance techniques just to allow us to get control so that we can lift somebody up,\u201d said Taylor, who also revealed that police would now be carrying out a review of the general security situation at the airport. Speaking outside the airport terminal, the Extinction Rebellion co-founder Gail Bradbrook said: \u201cI think the most important thing is that we are alerting the British people to the crisis that we\u2019re in and the threat to all the forms of business-as-usual.\u201d Asked whether the remaining protesters should go home, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I think we\u2019ve made our point, but I\u2019m not making that decision for other people.\u201d Elsewhere in London, Scotland Yard said officers had cleared all Extinction Rebellion sites as early evening approached, apart from a \u201cfairly sizable\u201d number of people in Trafalgar Square and a small number in St James\u2019s Park. Those activists cleared from the park planned to move their camp across the Thames to Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens. In Westminster, protesters said they felt police had become increasingly heavy-handed, and were policing the demonstrations much more aggressively than they had in April. Commenting on the police move to clear protesters from St James\u2019s Park, the Extinction Rebellion police liaison Paolo Enock said: \u201cI\u2019m deeply frustrated that while police at the chief superintendent level \u2013 who we are communicating with on the ground \u2013 are interested in compromise, in relation to moving our site at St James\u2019s Park to ensure a safer space for protesters, twice today we\u2019ve had offers ignored or rebuffed at the command team level. \u201cIt is becoming clear that there is no desire from the higher levels to facilitate the right to protest. They have also consistently blocked the introduction of portaloos and waste disposal systems at Trafalgar Square.\u201d One protester at the airport, Val Saunders, 65, from Stroud in Gloucestershire, said: \u201cWe got off the coach today, we looked around, it\u2019s like HG Wells. All this infrastructure, all these airports, they are just spreading out more and more. It\u2019s just encouraging people to fly more. It\u2019s going in the wrong direction, this government. \u201cI\u2019m so angry. If we keep going with expansions, there is no future. [The protest is] a way of telling people: yeah, this is the right thing to do, this is the way to go, we need more and more. No, we need less, we need to stock-take what we have. We need to reassess. We need to use some of the money, those billions that go into expansions, put that into alternative energy.\u201d Police attempted to clear journalists from the scene before leading and carrying people away one by one. One officer said authorities wanted to create a \u201csterile area\u201d. He said he had the power to order journalists to leave because the area was private property covered by bylaws governing access. One man appeared in pain as he was moved by officers towards a staircase. Among those carried down the steps was Frank Benatt, 78, from Totnes in Devon. Minutes earlier, asked if he was afraid to be arrested, he said: \u201cI think really this is minimal. I\u2019m approaching 80 and I\u2019m disposable and I\u2019ve had a very good life. Unlike lots of young people, I haven\u2019t got commitments. Benatt added: \u201cI\u2019ve been campaigning about [the environment] for 30 years and nobody has taken a blind bit of notice. XR is a last-ditch hope to actually take some action.\u201d Also among those arrested at the City airport protest was 84-year-old Phil Kingston, a veteran of the movement who has been arrested many times, including in April for supergluing himself to a DLR train. \u201c[I\u2019m here] for my grandchildren and all their generation,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m also here for the poorest people who have done the least to cause climate breakdown and are suffering the most and are predicted to suffer dreadfully in the coming year, as eventually we all will, unless we do the most enormous turnaround.\u201d A spokesperson for London City airport said it remained \u201cfully open and operational\u201d. Police also revealed that the last person from the Extinction Rebellion protests in London in April had been charged. Nearly 900 charges had now been levelled and 250 people had been convicted at court. \u201cWe will go through the same process with the people who have been arrested on this occasion,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cIt definitely places a burden on the criminal justice system but the system is agile and is able to cope with the volumes that we have seen in April and I think the figures probably speak for themselves.\u201d",

Traffic is not banned but demoted. The estate is high-density and among the most energy-efficient in the country. Even letterboxes stand detached to prevent draughts. The architects, <a href=\"http://www.mikhailriches.com/\" title=\"\">Mikhail Riches</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cathyhawley.co.uk/about.php\" title=\"\">Cathy Hawley</a>, stress the social impact of their design, such as \u201cplacing front doors opposite front doors\u201d, aligning facades with street views and having private yards and balconies overlooking public spaces.

She meticulously analysed the streets of Greenwich Village in New York, noting how their layouts enabled them to be \u201cself-policing\u201d and secure. They were overlooked from end to end by front rooms, doorsteps and stoops, \u201csemi-private domains\u201d. People were thus empowered and responsible for their surroundings. The built form itself created a sense of community.</p> <p>If Jacobs had been a medical expert, her analysis would have translated into professional practice. Architects knew better and treated it as nostalgic rubbish. Her message ran counter to Corbusian orthodoxy, in which public architecture was about scale and social control. Jacobs relegated architects to virtual conservationists. Students were duly taught to evict neighbourhoods, demolish streets and stack people high, where they would be dependent on a distant council. Public-sector architecture was about social disruption. It has been that way for half a century.</p> <p>The resulting devastation of British cities has long been charted, from 1950s east London, studied by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/apr/25/communities.britishidentityandsociety\" title=\"\">Willmott and Young</a>, to Lynsey Hanley\u2019s masterful \u201cintimate history\u201d of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jan/06/communities.housing\" title=\"\">Birmingham\u2019s estates</a>. By the early 70s, high-rise towers were out of favour, following the collapse of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/from-the-archive-blog/gallery/2018/may/16/ronan-point-tower-collapse-may-1968\" title=\"\">Ronan Point</a> in Canning Town, east London. But council architecture\u2019s response was a new grandiosity, with slab estates such as London\u2019s now-demolished <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/08/heygate-estate-housing-gentrification\" title=\"\">Heygate</a>. Crime-ridden balconies and corridors replaced broken-down lifts. Jacobs\u2019 role of a street as policed space, promoting friendship and easing loneliness, was simply denied. Architecture was about slamming concrete on steel with a glib metaphor about a \u201cstreets in the sky\u201d \u2013 the quickest way to a Stirling prize.</p> <p>The return of the street is exciting. In Liverpool, a council long dedicated to demolishing its historic legacy was recently forced to retain the Victorian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/14/community-liverpool-residents-granby\" title=\"\">Welsh streets</a> area \u2013 so run down it was used as a film set \u2013 and restore it to its original purpose: housing local people. Streets are returning to life in Birmingham\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/best-of-birmingham/2015/sep/09/where-should-i-live-in-birmingham-find-your-part-of-town\" title=\"\">Jewellery quarter</a>, Manchester\u2019s northern quarter and London\u2019s Hackney, Bow and Bermondsey. Leeds\u2019 remarkable back-to-backs are also being restored.</p> <p>New, as opposed to reinstated, streets have so far been hard to come by. The consultancy <a href=\"http://www.createstreets.com/\" title=\"\">Create Streets</a> has been leading the charge. It proposed a traditional grid for the Mount Pleasant site in Islington, north London, but was inexcusably blocked by Boris Johnson as mayor, in favour of conventional blocks of flats, actually at lower residential densities. The Olympic legacy authority at Stratford rejected extending the streets of Hackney Wick across their site in favour of towers set round a park. It preferred vanity to community.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jul/16/norwich-goldsmith-street-social-housing-green-design\">I've seen the future and it's Norwich: the energy-saving, social housing revolution</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The customary claim that cities need to build high to cram in more people is simply untrue. Except at Hong Kong densities, towers rarely house more people than \u201chigh-density low-rise\u201d. London\u2019s new council estates in the 1960 and 70s housed fewer, not more, people than what they replaced. Most of London\u2019s highest densities remain in the Victorian seven-storey terraces of Kensington and Bayswater. But planning should never pursue density at the expense of community. Community should be the sole arbiter of urban renewal. Without it, cities default to Blade Runner.</p> <p>The fashion for high-rise urban living has passed from public housing to towers of luxury flats. These are sold not to families \u2013 let along neighbourhoods \u2013 but to transient single people and overseas investors seeking anonymous bolt-holes. Such ugly structures do nothing to house people or promote communities. They are social excrescences.</p> <p>Norwich offers what the Create Streets chief, Nicholas Boys Smith, hails as \u201cwalkable, gentle density\u201d. Its message is not just that the public sector can, at last, take some initiative in local housing. It is that an age of architectural brutalism is at long last passing. One more civilised and sensitive to the stress of urban living is taking its place.</p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist.

      "bodyText": "Wonders never cease. The Royal Institute of British Architects has just given a prize to a street. Not to a vainglorious skyscraper, or an \u201ciconic\u201d bunker museum or a luxury pad in a field, but a living, breathing street. This street is not just a street but a \u201ccouncil street\u201d. Norwich council\u2019s chief executive, Laura McGillivray, claims no higher ambition than that \u201cnew social housing should be a fabulous place to live\u201d. She did not seek some architectural \u201cstatement\u201d, just a neighbourhood like the thousands that \u2013 at least in the private sector \u2013 have retained their popularity among Britons who have had choice in the matter for some three centuries. I have championed streets all my life and find it painful to hear Goldsmith Street\u2019s new residents say why they so like it. \u201cThe place just seems safe \u2026 To see my little girl playing outside the front door made me cry \u2026 We made instant friends across the street \u2026 I feel like I don\u2019t rent it, I own it.\u201d Why should such sentiments be surprising from council tenants? Goldsmith Street is composed of 105 flats and houses, with no visible separation between the public and the limited number of private-tenure properties. Traffic is not banned but demoted. The estate is high-density and among the most energy-efficient in the country. Even letterboxes stand detached to prevent draughts. The architects, Mikhail Riches and Cathy Hawley, stress the social impact of their design, such as \u201cplacing front doors opposite front doors\u201d, aligning facades with street views and having private yards and balconies overlooking public spaces. This was hailed by the Stirling prize chair Julia Barfield as a \u201cmodest masterpiece\u201d \u2013 as if it was new. The language used by Riches and Hawley comes straight from the 1960s American sociologist Jane Jacobs, and her epic The Death and Life of Great American Cities. She meticulously analysed the streets of Greenwich Village in New York, noting how their layouts enabled them to be \u201cself-policing\u201d and secure. They were overlooked from end to end by front rooms, doorsteps and stoops, \u201csemi-private domains\u201d. People were thus empowered and responsible for their surroundings. The built form itself created a sense of community. If Jacobs had been a medical expert, her analysis would have translated into professional practice. Architects knew better and treated it as nostalgic rubbish. Her message ran counter to Corbusian orthodoxy, in which public architecture was about scale and social control. Jacobs relegated architects to virtual conservationists. Students were duly taught to evict neighbourhoods, demolish streets and stack people high, where they would be dependent on a distant council. Public-sector architecture was about social disruption. It has been that way for half a century. The resulting devastation of British cities has long been charted, from 1950s east London, studied by Willmott and Young, to Lynsey Hanley\u2019s masterful \u201cintimate history\u201d of Birmingham\u2019s estates. By the early 70s, high-rise towers were out of favour, following the collapse of Ronan Point in Canning Town, east London. But council architecture\u2019s response was a new grandiosity, with slab estates such as London\u2019s now-demolished Heygate. Crime-ridden balconies and corridors replaced broken-down lifts. Jacobs\u2019 role of a street as policed space, promoting friendship and easing loneliness, was simply denied. Architecture was about slamming concrete on steel with a glib metaphor about a \u201cstreets in the sky\u201d \u2013 the quickest way to a Stirling prize. The return of the street is exciting. In Liverpool, a council long dedicated to demolishing its historic legacy was recently forced to retain the Victorian Welsh streets area \u2013 so run down it was used as a film set \u2013 and restore it to its original purpose: housing local people. Streets are returning to life in Birmingham\u2019s Jewellery quarter, Manchester\u2019s northern quarter and London\u2019s Hackney, Bow and Bermondsey. Leeds\u2019 remarkable back-to-backs are also being restored. New, as opposed to reinstated, streets have so far been hard to come by. The consultancy Create Streets has been leading the charge. It proposed a traditional grid for the Mount Pleasant site in Islington, north London, but was inexcusably blocked by Boris Johnson as mayor, in favour of conventional blocks of flats, actually at lower residential densities. The Olympic legacy authority at Stratford rejected extending the streets of Hackney Wick across their site in favour of towers set round a park. It preferred vanity to community. The customary claim that cities need to build high to cram in more people is simply untrue. Except at Hong Kong densities, towers rarely house more people than \u201chigh-density low-rise\u201d. London\u2019s new council estates in the 1960 and 70s housed fewer, not more, people than what they replaced. Most of London\u2019s highest densities remain in the Victorian seven-storey terraces of Kensington and Bayswater. But planning should never pursue density at the expense of community. Community should be the sole arbiter of urban renewal. Without it, cities default to Blade Runner. The fashion for high-rise urban living has passed from public housing to towers of luxury flats. These are sold not to families \u2013 let along neighbourhoods \u2013 but to transient single people and overseas investors seeking anonymous bolt-holes. Such ugly structures do nothing to house people or promote communities. They are social excrescences. Norwich offers what the Create Streets chief, Nicholas Boys Smith, hails as \u201cwalkable, gentle density\u201d. Its message is not just that the public sector can, at last, take some initiative in local housing. It is that an age of architectural brutalism is at long last passing. One more civilised and sensitive to the stress of urban living is taking its place. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist.

On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a>&nbsp;and its allies.

The following week, on 22 October, Erdo\u011fan and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/22/turkey-and-russia-agree-deal-over-buffer-zone-in-northern-syria\">agreed on the parameters of the proposed Turkish \u201csafe zone\u201d</a> in Syria.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the SDF come to control the region?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Before the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In late 2014, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/turkey-iraqi-kurds-kobani-isis-fighters-us-air-drops-arms\">Kurds were struggling</a>&nbsp;to fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobane, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why does Turkey oppose the Kurds?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a>.</p>\n    <p>Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF\u2019s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are Turkey\u2019s objectives on its southern border?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/07/us-withdrawal-from-syria-leaves-fate-of-isis-fighters-and-families-in-detention-uncertain\">recent announcement</a>&nbsp;that American soldiers would withdraw from the region.</p>\n    <p>Erdo\u011fan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this \u201csafe zone\u201d, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How would a Turkish incursion impact on Isis?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria.</p>\n    <p>SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey. They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.<br></p>\n    <p>On 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region. Two days later, 750 foreign women affiliated to Isis and their children managed to break out of a secure annex in the Ain Issa camp for displaced people, according to SDF officials.</p>\n    <p>It is unclear which detention sites the SDF still controls and the status of the prisoners inside.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/09/turkey-trump-isis-fight-in-syria-offensive-looms\">Trump\u2019s decision was widely criticised</a> as a betrayal of a US ally which lost 11,000 men and women in the fight against Isis that threatens to open a new front in the complex Syrian war.</p> \n<p>While the US president has attempted to walk back the move, telling Turkey shortly after the start of the offensive that the attack is a \u201cbad idea\u201d, it is now too late to undo the damage.</p> \n<p>On the other side of the border, the second day of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/09/on-the-edge-of-a-humanitarian-catastrophe-turkish-offensive-begins\">Turkish assault continued at a fierce pace</a>.

She\u2019s the bodybuilder who smashes watermelons between her thighs and is an Australian women\u2019s armwrestling champion. Her Instagram page is full of powerlifting feats \u2013 and the occasional candid video like her meeting with Jason.</p> <p>Olson benchpresses men like Jason.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/31/fit-in-my-40s-conans-wheel-viking-press-zoe-williams\">Fit in my 40s: can I become a strongwoman?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Go into any gym these days and you\u2019ll notice a migration of women from treadmills and cardio classes to the weights section. Back gains and abs are the new aesthetic, thanks in part to the rise of CrossFit, Bodypump and F45, and gym noticeboards are more concerned with strength competitions \u2013 heaviest leg press, squat etc \u2013 than scale measurements. Mega-ripped fitness models such as Gracyanne Barbosa have millions following their workouts on Instagram, and the US-founded STRONG Fitness Magazine launches in Australia this month, aimed at women.</p> <p>\u201cI love muscle. That\u2019s just my thing,\u201d says Olson, whose website delivers training programs that promise to add an inch to arms and legs: \u201cNot so much on dudes \u2013 it\u2019s not a prerequisite \u2013 but on women it\u2019s outstanding.\u201d</p> <p>Olson was fascinated by the idea of having a six-pack from an early age, partly from idolising her older brother and partly, she says, because she was molested as a seven-year-old.</p> <p>\u201cFrom that point on, I created this image of myself being ripped in order to feel protected and worthy and safe,\u201d she says. \u201cI have found that most of the women that get into bodybuilding or strength training or powerlifting have had some kind of trauma.\u201d</p> <p>But there\u2019s also that cultural swing. Kettlebell athlete Eilish Kidd competes on an international level, performing competition lifts such as the snatch, jerk and the long cycle over as many reps as possible in 10 minutes. She\u2019s noticed that while bigger glutes are still a priority for many women, so too is all-over muscle as an aesthetic.</p> <p>When Kidd first started working out in her 20s, she was too ashamed to let her boozy art school mates know about this extracurricular activity and would sneak off to train with a female bodybuilder she\u2019d met. The boutique Hobart gym, Artgym, that she went on to open has a 1980s Memphis look and aims to attract those who are put off by corporate environments.</p> <p>Kidd was drawn to kettlebell as it\u2019s the ideal sport for introverts. She started late, in her mid-30s, but age wasn\u2019t as significant a number to her as the reps or kilos. Her weekly regime now involves two kettlebell training sessions, a mobility session, a light Olympic weightlifting session, a strength-conditioning session, and some cardio.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"14c5460cfaf5e9cc1276b9f1ef834cc798900d3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14c5460cfaf5e9cc1276b9f1ef834cc798900d3b/0_0_4130_5163/800.jpg\" alt=\"Kettlebell athlete and gym owner Eilish Kidd.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kettlebell athlete and gym owner Eilish Kidd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cKettlebell is really technical, so you build up all of these elements and then when they all come together you feel powerful,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a feeling of happiness, even when it\u2019s painful.\u201d</p> <p>Kellyanne Salter\u2019s idea of happiness comes from finishing off opponents with a cannonball or a missile dropkick. The Melbourne pro-wrestler says she\u2019s never wanted to be skinny. \u201cObviously I have to look aesthetically pleasing so I watch what I eat,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m always trying to increase my strength.\u201d</p> <p>From the age of eight, Salter idolised the pro-wrestler Lita. In an era when female wrestlers tended to be cheerleader types, Lita was strong, tattooed and had the technical skills.<br><br>\u201cAll I wanted to do was wrestle and I didn\u2019t care about how I looked, but all the female wrestlers on TV were eye candy,\u201d says Salter, who lied about her age when asking to join a local promotion and started training at 14. \u201cThat led me to believe at that age that I had to get a boob job.\u201d <br><br>Salter fobbed off that idea but she reckons having her distinctive look has held her back from a career with WWE, for whom she had a tryout in 2016. \u201cThey want blank canvases so they\u2019re not able to mould me,\u201d she says. Instead she saves her money and spends stints wrestling in Mexico, Europe and the US. She frequently takes part in intergender matches and can\u2019t understand resistance to the idea of women fighting men.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a53946280eae0145aad29fea861243f62e3ab3af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a53946280eae0145aad29fea861243f62e3ab3af/260_510_4007_2405/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Australian pro-wrestler Kellyanne Salter competing for Impact Pro Wrestling\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Australian pro-wrestler Kellyanne Salter competing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Digital Beard/Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI was usually the only girl at training, so it was normal for me to wrestle men,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Now Salter trains in the gym four days a week, isolating body parts \u2013 back, legs, arms. Another day she\u2019ll train in the ring and she\u2019ll usually wrestle for real on a Saturday night. She\u2019s the current impact pro-wrestling New Zealand women\u2019s champion, and on October 11-12 she\u2019ll compete in a <a href=\"http://melbournecitywrestling.com.au/2019/09/01/mcw-nine-event-ticket-information/?fbclid=IwAR3_gFfJEBtysJH147FHLPJcLgVfRHg3bCjkJ3vPmEDhbwkKjykFUzIkeJA\">Melbourne city wrestling invitational tournament</a> that will result in the promotion\u2019s first women\u2019s champion being crowned.</p> <p>Some men are threatened by strong women, as one marine found out when she tweeted a video of herself doing squats with a man in a firefighter\u2019s lift across her shoulders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dani_g_3/status/1172013361736765441\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">When I was 12, I remember my friends stepdad (who was a firefighter) comment on how he felt women didn\u2019t belong in the fire department because \u201cno girl could ever lift a grown man\u201d lol anyways, fuck you Craig. <a href=\"https://t.co/C4dU0MOtW5\">pic.twitter.com/C4dU0MOtW5</a></p>&mdash; Dani (@dani_g_3) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dani_g_3/status/1172013361736765441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 12, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The video got 10.2m views and plenty of butt-hurt comments. But for others, female strength is a fetish.</p> <p>Salter gets lots of DMs from men offering her big bucks to crush them with her thighs, or for her used gear. Heads up: it\u2019s not going to happen. \u201cI\u2019ve actually seen some of my wrestling matches uploaded on to Pornhub, with people time-stamping when my legs are open,\u201d she says. \u201cI choose not to get offended by it.\u201d<br><br>Olson knows all about that. A few years back she made headlines when Australian tabloids uncovered her \u201cporn\u201d past, which was actually clothed videos of her crushing men, or of them worshipping her calves. \u201cI don\u2019t like to hurt people,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I can. It\u2019s more about them experiencing true female strength, and that\u2019s breaking the societal norm.\u201d<br><br>The tabloid interest arose because Olson is married to David May, who was chief executive of the Gold Coast Titans at the time. She also volunteered as the Titans\u2019 under-20s strength and conditioning coach.

      "bodyText": "A woman in activewear crosses the street towards a car with blacked-out windows and no licence plates and says to the man inside, \u201cDid you just catcall me?\u201d When he reluctantly confirms that he did, she says cheerfully, \u201cI\u2019m just going to tell you right now, a lot of women get intimidated when you do that \u2026 Most women are like, this motherfucker\u2019s going to throw me in the back of the car, you know what I mean? I dress like this because it\u2019s hot as fuck and I work out really hard. Pow. I\u2019m strong and powerful and I\u2019d fuck you up. But what I\u2019m saying is, a lot of women get really intimidated by catcalling. You got me? So that\u2019s what\u2019s up. What\u2019s your name?\u201d She fist-bumps him. \u201cJason, I\u2019m Kortney. It\u2019s nice to meet you. Take care.\u201d Jason likely didn\u2019t know he\u2019d chosen Kortney Olson to hiss at. She\u2019s the bodybuilder who smashes watermelons between her thighs and is an Australian women\u2019s armwrestling champion. Her Instagram page is full of powerlifting feats \u2013 and the occasional candid video like her meeting with Jason. Olson benchpresses men like Jason. Go into any gym these days and you\u2019ll notice a migration of women from treadmills and cardio classes to the weights section. Back gains and abs are the new aesthetic, thanks in part to the rise of CrossFit, Bodypump and F45, and gym noticeboards are more concerned with strength competitions \u2013 heaviest leg press, squat etc \u2013 than scale measurements. Mega-ripped fitness models such as Gracyanne Barbosa have millions following their workouts on Instagram, and the US-founded STRONG Fitness Magazine launches in Australia this month, aimed at women. \u201cI love muscle. That\u2019s just my thing,\u201d says Olson, whose website delivers training programs that promise to add an inch to arms and legs: \u201cNot so much on dudes \u2013 it\u2019s not a prerequisite \u2013 but on women it\u2019s outstanding.\u201d Olson was fascinated by the idea of having a six-pack from an early age, partly from idolising her older brother and partly, she says, because she was molested as a seven-year-old. \u201cFrom that point on, I created this image of myself being ripped in order to feel protected and worthy and safe,\u201d she says. \u201cI have found that most of the women that get into bodybuilding or strength training or powerlifting have had some kind of trauma.\u201d But there\u2019s also that cultural swing. Kettlebell athlete Eilish Kidd competes on an international level, performing competition lifts such as the snatch, jerk and the long cycle over as many reps as possible in 10 minutes. She\u2019s noticed that while bigger glutes are still a priority for many women, so too is all-over muscle as an aesthetic. When Kidd first started working out in her 20s, she was too ashamed to let her boozy art school mates know about this extracurricular activity and would sneak off to train with a female bodybuilder she\u2019d met. The boutique Hobart gym, Artgym, that she went on to open has a 1980s Memphis look and aims to attract those who are put off by corporate environments. Kidd was drawn to kettlebell as it\u2019s the ideal sport for introverts. She started late, in her mid-30s, but age wasn\u2019t as significant a number to her as the reps or kilos. Her weekly regime now involves two kettlebell training sessions, a mobility session, a light Olympic weightlifting session, a strength-conditioning session, and some cardio. \u201cKettlebell is really technical, so you build up all of these elements and then when they all come together you feel powerful,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a feeling of happiness, even when it\u2019s painful.\u201d Kellyanne Salter\u2019s idea of happiness comes from finishing off opponents with a cannonball or a missile dropkick. The Melbourne pro-wrestler says she\u2019s never wanted to be skinny. \u201cObviously I have to look aesthetically pleasing so I watch what I eat,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m always trying to increase my strength.\u201d From the age of eight, Salter idolised the pro-wrestler Lita. In an era when female wrestlers tended to be cheerleader types, Lita was strong, tattooed and had the technical skills. \u201cAll I wanted to do was wrestle and I didn\u2019t care about how I looked, but all the female wrestlers on TV were eye candy,\u201d says Salter, who lied about her age when asking to join a local promotion and started training at 14. \u201cThat led me to believe at that age that I had to get a boob job.\u201d Salter fobbed off that idea but she reckons having her distinctive look has held her back from a career with WWE, for whom she had a tryout in 2016. \u201cThey want blank canvases so they\u2019re not able to mould me,\u201d she says. Instead she saves her money and spends stints wrestling in Mexico, Europe and the US. She frequently takes part in intergender matches and can\u2019t understand resistance to the idea of women fighting men. \u201cI was usually the only girl at training, so it was normal for me to wrestle men,\u201d she says. Now Salter trains in the gym four days a week, isolating body parts \u2013 back, legs, arms. Another day she\u2019ll train in the ring and she\u2019ll usually wrestle for real on a Saturday night. She\u2019s the current impact pro-wrestling New Zealand women\u2019s champion, and on October 11-12 she\u2019ll compete in a Melbourne city wrestling invitational tournament that will result in the promotion\u2019s first women\u2019s champion being crowned. Some men are threatened by strong women, as one marine found out when she tweeted a video of herself doing squats with a man in a firefighter\u2019s lift across her shoulders. The video got 10.2m views and plenty of butt-hurt comments. But for others, female strength is a fetish. Salter gets lots of DMs from men offering her big bucks to crush them with her thighs, or for her used gear. Heads up: it\u2019s not going to happen. \u201cI\u2019ve actually seen some of my wrestling matches uploaded on to Pornhub, with people time-stamping when my legs are open,\u201d she says. \u201cI choose not to get offended by it.\u201d Olson knows all about that. A few years back she made headlines when Australian tabloids uncovered her \u201cporn\u201d past, which was actually clothed videos of her crushing men, or of them worshipping her calves. \u201cI don\u2019t like to hurt people,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I can. It\u2019s more about them experiencing true female strength, and that\u2019s breaking the societal norm.\u201d The tabloid interest arose because Olson is married to David May, who was chief executive of the Gold Coast Titans at the time. She also volunteered as the Titans\u2019 under-20s strength and conditioning coach. As far away as England there were headlines such as \u201cEx-porn star helps with \u2018cor\u2019 strength\u201d. It got her down for a while, particularly because she had applied to be a mentor for young women and didn\u2019t get that gig as a result of the media attention. Instead she wrote a program for marginalised teenagers, Kamp Konfidence, and ran it in the Gold Coast hinterland. When that became too unwieldy, she set up activewear brand GRRRL Clothing and runs it with a team of five from her new base of Las Vegas. Taking a gamble, she dumped traditional sizing in favour of GRRRL sizing \u2013 customers pick one of eight athletes who have vastly different body shapes by comparing their own measurements.

The announcement comes after three years of consultation between CA and the players\u2019 union, the Australian Cricketers\u2019 Association. The policy aims to keep women cricketers in the game longer by allowing pregnant players to transfer to a non-playing role until they give birth.

      "body": "<p>Having been given the all-clear by tournament organisers, the Wallabies will enter their final World Cup Pool D game against Georgia at Shizuoka Stadium on Friday night in the knowledge they are safe from inclement weather, but without knowing their best team. </p> <p>Or do they? Michael Cheika, along with co-selectors Scott Johnson and Michael O\u2019Connor, appeared to have a stark choice between naming a full-strength team to play Georgia and continuing to experiment. Somehow they managed to go close to achieving both objectives.</p> <p>With the exception of tight-head prop Allan Alaalatoa, who is being rested, and suspended outside back Reece Hodge, the 23-man squad chosen for the Georgia game is nearly the best the Wallabies can field with a couple of experimental selections thrown into the mix. Most of the players were involved in the two key pool games against Fiji and Wales. All the players down the pecking order of the squad are missing from the team list.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/10/david-pocock-and-wallabies-teammates-lead-sporting-charge-on-carbon-emissions\">David Pocock and Wallabies teammates lead sporting charge on carbon emissions | Andrew Stafford</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Importantly, this means the majority of the Wallabies\u2019 top players will receive a final hit-out before their quarter-final against France or, most likely, England. It will also allow the selectors to determine one or two contentious positions, if they have not already done so.</p> <p>So much of what the Wallabies have done at this World Cup appears to have been part of Cheika\u2019s master plan, a preordained blueprint, irrespective of form or formula. The most controversial example of the horses-for-courses selection policy was the choice of halves Will Genia and Bernard Foley ahead of the apparent first-choice pairing of Nic White and Christian Lealiifano against Wales, which backfired spectacularly.</p> <p>The Wallabies will now field their third halves combination in four Tests \u2013 White and Matt To\u2019omua \u2013 and with a sudden-death quarter-final around the corner \u2013 an unheard of situation which only adds to the perception that Australia\u2019s campaign is somewhat chaotic.</p> <p>Cheika conceded the Wallabies started poorly in all three of their pool games against Fiji, Wales and Uruguay and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/08/taller-players-more-exposed-to-high-shot-penalties-at-world-cup-says-david-pocock\">the selection of To\u2019omua at five-eighth</a> against Georgia is an attempt to turn that around. To\u2019omua has been the Wallabies\u2019 best-performed five-eighth, coming off the bench against Fiji and Wales, and has been given an opportunity to try to make the same impact as a starter in the gold No 10 jersey.</p> <p>It is doubtful that was part of Cheika\u2019s pre-planning, but To\u2019omua\u2019s form has forced the selectors to at least consider him as a five-eighth option, a Hobson\u2019s choice perhaps. Ultimately, the choice of five-eighth for the quarter-final may come down to how much the Wallabies intend to play direct by taking \u201croute one\u201d in attack or play with more variety and width. No doubt they will test both approaches against Georgia.</p> <p>Back-rower Jack Dempsey and outside back Jordan Petaia were unavailable for Fiji and Wales because of injury, but after their impressive performances against Uruguay they both have real opportunities to secure places for the quarter-final, if not as starters, then as finishers. It is unlikely Dempsey, who is starting at blindside flanker against Georgia, would win a place in the run on side ahead of Michael Hooper, David Pocock or Isi Naisarani, but he might beat Lukhan Salakaia-Loto for a spot on the bench.</p> <p>Dempsey (1.91m) is not as tall as Naisarani (1.95m) or Salakaia-Loto (1.98m), but that may be an advantage if the Wallabies look to reduce the overall height of the forward pack to minimise the risk of penalties and cards for high tackles. After the Wallabies\u2019 issues with attacks to the head earlier in the tournament it was reassuring to hear Cheika say the Australians needed to improve their discipline and lower their tackling technique. A shorter back-row may help to solve the problem.</p> <p>Instead of complaining about the refereeing, the Wallabies are now looking to adapt to the officiating and in a big match that could be decisive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/08/taller-players-more-exposed-to-high-shot-penalties-at-world-cup-says-david-pocock\">Matt To\u2019omua handed World Cup chance as Wallabies ring changes again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Petaia, 19, has only played one Test and must compete with the likes of Hodge, Dane Haylett-Petty and Adam Ashley-Cooper, but he is something new, something different, almost a secret weapon. A lot may depend on what the selectors decide to do with Kurtley Beale, who will start at fullback against Georgia. Whether Beale starts or comes off the bench in the quarter-final would have a flow-on effect. </p> <p>It is difficult to genuinely assess the form of players against a team which they should beat comfortably.

      "bodyText": "Having been given the all-clear by tournament organisers, the Wallabies will enter their final World Cup Pool D game against Georgia at Shizuoka Stadium on Friday night in the knowledge they are safe from inclement weather, but without knowing their best team. Or do they? Michael Cheika, along with co-selectors Scott Johnson and Michael O\u2019Connor, appeared to have a stark choice between naming a full-strength team to play Georgia and continuing to experiment. Somehow they managed to go close to achieving both objectives. With the exception of tight-head prop Allan Alaalatoa, who is being rested, and suspended outside back Reece Hodge, the 23-man squad chosen for the Georgia game is nearly the best the Wallabies can field with a couple of experimental selections thrown into the mix. Most of the players were involved in the two key pool games against Fiji and Wales. All the players down the pecking order of the squad are missing from the team list. Importantly, this means the majority of the Wallabies\u2019 top players will receive a final hit-out before their quarter-final against France or, most likely, England. It will also allow the selectors to determine one or two contentious positions, if they have not already done so. So much of what the Wallabies have done at this World Cup appears to have been part of Cheika\u2019s master plan, a preordained blueprint, irrespective of form or formula. The most controversial example of the horses-for-courses selection policy was the choice of halves Will Genia and Bernard Foley ahead of the apparent first-choice pairing of Nic White and Christian Lealiifano against Wales, which backfired spectacularly. The Wallabies will now field their third halves combination in four Tests \u2013 White and Matt To\u2019omua \u2013 and with a sudden-death quarter-final around the corner \u2013 an unheard of situation which only adds to the perception that Australia\u2019s campaign is somewhat chaotic. Cheika conceded the Wallabies started poorly in all three of their pool games against Fiji, Wales and Uruguay and the selection of To\u2019omua at five-eighth against Georgia is an attempt to turn that around. To\u2019omua has been the Wallabies\u2019 best-performed five-eighth, coming off the bench against Fiji and Wales, and has been given an opportunity to try to make the same impact as a starter in the gold No 10 jersey. It is doubtful that was part of Cheika\u2019s pre-planning, but To\u2019omua\u2019s form has forced the selectors to at least consider him as a five-eighth option, a Hobson\u2019s choice perhaps. Ultimately, the choice of five-eighth for the quarter-final may come down to how much the Wallabies intend to play direct by taking \u201croute one\u201d in attack or play with more variety and width. No doubt they will test both approaches against Georgia. Back-rower Jack Dempsey and outside back Jordan Petaia were unavailable for Fiji and Wales because of injury, but after their impressive performances against Uruguay they both have real opportunities to secure places for the quarter-final, if not as starters, then as finishers. It is unlikely Dempsey, who is starting at blindside flanker against Georgia, would win a place in the run on side ahead of Michael Hooper, David Pocock or Isi Naisarani, but he might beat Lukhan Salakaia-Loto for a spot on the bench. Dempsey (1.91m) is not as tall as Naisarani (1.95m) or Salakaia-Loto (1.98m), but that may be an advantage if the Wallabies look to reduce the overall height of the forward pack to minimise the risk of penalties and cards for high tackles. After the Wallabies\u2019 issues with attacks to the head earlier in the tournament it was reassuring to hear Cheika say the Australians needed to improve their discipline and lower their tackling technique. A shorter back-row may help to solve the problem. Instead of complaining about the refereeing, the Wallabies are now looking to adapt to the officiating and in a big match that could be decisive. Petaia, 19, has only played one Test and must compete with the likes of Hodge, Dane Haylett-Petty and Adam Ashley-Cooper, but he is something new, something different, almost a secret weapon. A lot may depend on what the selectors decide to do with Kurtley Beale, who will start at fullback against Georgia. Whether Beale starts or comes off the bench in the quarter-final would have a flow-on effect. It is difficult to genuinely assess the form of players against a team which they should beat comfortably. Playing well against Uruguay and Georgia is not the same as playing well against the All Blacks. Outside of the scrum where the Georgians are particularly strong, the Wallabies should not find themselves seriously challenged, but they will know they have been in a game against the physical eastern Europeans. It will be a good opportunity for the Wallabies to hone both their attacking and defensive structures for the looming quarter-final. As mad as the Wallaby selection process may seem, the pieces to the puzzle are virtually all there. It\u2019s just a matter of putting them in the right spaces.",

At a press conference on Thursday the skills and employment minister said Cam\u2019s pay for the 15-month role was \u201ccommercial in confidence\u201d but suggested spending was \u201cabout outcomes\u201d and reflected the fact the government had secured \u201cone of the highest profile people in Australia\u201d. Labor and the unions suggested the Coalition should stop hiring \u201ccelebrities\u201d and properly fund Tafe and apprentices instead, claiming $3bn has been cut from vocational education since it came to office. Cash said the government is \u201cdetermined to shine a light on how fantastic vocational education and training is\u201d and described Cam\u2019s role as \u201cto work with us to really get that message out\u201d, explaining she would be \u201cout and about with Scott attending high-profile events\u201d to do so. Cash described Cam as a \u201cformer apprentice around 40 years ago now\u201d and \u201cliterally a household name in Australia\u201d, citing the fact he ran his own business and had employed apprentices as qualifications for the role. Cam did a three-year carpentry apprenticeship at age 17 and has worked as a television presenter since 2000 when he first appeared on Backyard Blitz. He won a gold Logie award in 2014 for hosting renovation reality television show The Block. Cam told reporters he was \u201cvery privileged\u201d to have the role, adding he is \u201cnot taking it lightly\u201d. Cam said the National Careers Institute provides a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for people to get information about vocational education and careers pathways and \u201cmy role is to get the information out there, to let them know that it\u2019s there\u201d. Contracts on AusTender show in 2009 the Labor government paid $74,250 to SWC Contractors for \u201crepresentational services by Mr Scott Cam at Centrelink Job Expos\u201d. A separate contract published in 2011 suggests the same company was paid $76,500 for \u201csponsorship of event or celebrity\u201d for a \u201crepresentative for job expo\u201d. In February 2013 Treasury officials told Senate estimates the Australian Taxation Office paid $77,962 to Media Heads to create a series of YouTube videos called \u2018Build a better business \u2013 lodge online\u2019 featuring Cam, although it did not say what part of the fee was paid to Cam. \u201cMr Cam was used because he is a well-recognised celebrity with broad demographic appeal and credibility with small business,\u201d Treasury said in an answer to a question on notice. In November 2016 Cam featured in an education department advertisement with Karen Andrews, then the assistant minister for vocational education and skills. The video has 866 views despite almost three years online. On Thursday Labor\u2019s shadow education minister, Tanya Plibersek, responded that Scott Cam is \u201ca good bloke, but if the Liberals were serious about fixing the skills crisis they\u2019ve created, they\u2019d stop hiring celebrities [and] start funding TAFE and apprentices\u201d.

      "bodyText": "WaterNSW has objected to the expansion of a coalmine under Sydney\u2019s drinking water catchment because the project would cause unacceptable impacts, including the loss of 3.3bn litres of water a year. The government-owned water corporation has also warned that mining company South32\u2019s proposal to extend the mining operations at its Dendrobium coking coalmine could cause cracking in the walls of two dams that supply water to the Illawarra and Macarthur regions, and may harm 26 endangered coastal swamps. In a submission to the New South Wales Department of Planning, Industry and Environment, WaterNSW says the extension of the mine in the Illawarra region should not proceed in its current form. \u201cWaterNSW strongly objects to the project (as currently proposed),\u201d the submission says. The South32 proposal is the first to be lodged for coalmining in the NSW special areas in more than a decade. It is also the first in the special areas to be subject to a test that requires developments in the Sydney drinking water catchment to have either a neutral or beneficial effect on water quality. Sydney\u2019s dam storage levels are currently sitting below 50% after they dropped to that level in August, the first time in more than a decade. WaterNSW\u2019s submission says the predicted impacts on both water and ecology are \u201cunacceptable\u201d because they would affect the corporation\u2019s ability to deliver on its core function to \u201cprotect and enhance the quality and quantity of water\u201d in the Sydney drinking water catchment. The submission raises concerns about several environmental impacts, including potential subsidence that would be \u201chigher than recorded figures at any other mine in the Southern Coalfield\u201d. It warns that the project would cause an \u201cunprecedented level of surface-to-seam fracturing and groundwater depressurisation, which would result in a range of significant predicted impacts\u201d. As examples, WaterNSW said the project would cause 3.3bn litres of catchment water loss a year, would increase the volume of metals in streams above the mining area, and affect 26 endangered coastal upland swamps. It said South32\u2019s environmental impact statement predicted that, in a dry year, there would be a 100% reduction in stream flow to the Avon Reservoir within the catchments over the proposed mining area. \u201cWaterNSW has calculated this may reduce the catchment yield of the Avon Reservoir by up to 3.9%,\u201d the submission says. WaterNSW said there was also the potential for mining activity to cause cracking in the walls of the Avon and Cordeaux dams. A spokesman said WaterNSW had concerns about this and more information was required from South32. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cWaterNSW has expressed strong concerns about the impacts of the proposal on water quantity and quality, swamps and dam infrastructure,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cIn particular, the mine design (as currently proposed) is predicted to cause surface-to-seam fracturing across the entire mining area, which would result in substantial groundwater depressurisation.\u201d The corporation has asked for the proposal to be referred to an independent expert panel that is reviewing mining projects in the greater Sydney water catchment.

A spokeswoman for South32 said the company takes its \u201cenvironmental responsibilities seriously and understand(s) the sensitivities of working within the Metropolitan Special Area\u201d. \u201cThe EIS reflects that we will not mine under water supply reservoirs, named watercourses and key stream features,\u201d she said. \u201cApproval of the project will sustain the employment of around 400 people, create an additional 100 jobs and ensure the supply of metallurgical coal to local and overseas customers until 2048.\u201d But Carmel Flint, the national coordinator of Lock the Gate, said the advice from WaterNSW should be treated seriously by the state government. \u201cOur view is this is quite an extraordinary and scathing analysis by WaterNSW,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve rarely seen an agency or department put in such a strongly-worded objection to a mining proposal. \u201c3.3 billion litres per year of surface water take is incredibly significant, particularly given the time we\u2019re in now during such a serious drought.\u201d The NSW planning minister, Rob Stokes, said \u201cSydney\u2019s drinking water catchment is of paramount importance to the future of our city and state\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve established an independent panel with world leading experts to provide advice on mining in Sydney\u2019s drinking water catchment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe panel\u2019s report will inform the future of mining in the catchment.\u201d A spokesman for the NSW planning, industry and environment department said it had requested a \u201cdetailed response\u201d from South32 to all public submissions on the development, including WaterNSW\u2019s submission. \u201cThe department will then rigorously assess the merits of the proposal taking into consideration advice from water experts, government agencies and the community before making its recommendation,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Less than two months out from Bougainville\u2019s historic referendum, observers are warning of a \u201cmajor security challenge\u201d and regional instability if Papua New Guinea refuses to recognise a vote for independence. In a research paper by the Lowy Institute, Australia has been urged to prepare for the aftermath of the vote, a culmination of a 20-year peace process which brought to an end the most intense Pacific conflict since the second world war. The paper said that while Bougainville itself was not ready for independence, most Bougainvilleans saw no other alternative, and so the focus must be on how the transition would occur and avoiding another serious security crisis. Bougainville is currently an autonomous region of Papua New Guinea and home to almost 300,000 people, most of whom are gearing up to vote for either total independence or greater autonomy within PNG. In 2001 the Bougainville Peace Agreement formally ended a decade-long war and blockade in which an estimated 10,000-15,000 people died, mostly due to preventable diseases and medication shortages. It established the Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG) in 2005, mandated weapons disposal, and set a 2020 deadline for an independence referendum. The referendum has been pushed back twice this year already, after delays in funding and concerns that more time was needed for voters to register, but is now scheduled for 23 November. Polling will run until 7 December and around three quarters of Bougainvilleans are expected to vote in favour of independence, the Lowy report, written by the analyst and journalist Ben Bohane, said. The result must then be ratified by the PNG parliament, but Bohane said it was unclear whether it would do so within an acceptable timeframe, or even at all. The report noted the previous Peter O\u2019Neill-led government had withheld promised funds from the ABG, but said the new government led by James Marape had been more supportive, releasing funds within its first week of power. The appointment of the veteran politician Sir Puka Temu as the minister for Bougainville affairs was also welcomed initially, but comments earlier this month that the new country would cost about 300m kina ($130m) a year to run were taken disparagingly and prompted rebuke. Bohane warned that any refusal by the PNG government to ratify could lead to unrest, while a total rejection of the vote or delay in settlement could lead to another unilateral declaration of independence by Bougainville, which some Pacific countries \u2013 and an increasingly Pacific-focused China \u2013 may recognise. \u201cIn that scenario, the potential for another serious security crisis in the region is real,\u201d he said. Eyes are also on Indonesia, which the paper says will be concerned about what regional precedent a successful referendum might set for the long-running independence struggle in West Papua. Australia, without being seen to influence the outcome, had to prepare for \u201ca substantial deterioration in the security situation, which could potentially require the deployment of another regional peacekeeping force or peace enforcement operation\u201d, the paper said. Australia is a key protagonist in Bougainville\u2019s history, including as a colonial administrator for 60 years and during the conflict and blockade. It was also a partner in New Zealand-led peace negotiations and peacekeeping operations from 1998. \u201cAustralia has a responsibility \u2013 and an interest \u2013 to see that peace is maintained, a credible referendum held, and a negotiated outcome achieved to ensure a lasting peace so that Bougainville does not become a source of regional instability again,\u201d the paper said. Central to the Bougainville conflict was the Panguna copper mine, operated by Rio Tinto-owned Bougainville Copper Ltd (BCL). Landowner protests against environmental damage by the mine and poor economic benefits for locals escalated into violence, and the mine was forced to close in 1989. In recent years talk of its reopening \u2013 either before or after independence \u2013 has sparked hostilities, prompting the ABG to enact a moratorium in early 2018. The ABG, which had a large stake in the mine, had previously maintained reopening Panguna was essential for an independent Bougainville\u2019s economic self-sufficiency. Bohane found the island\u2019s prospects for self-sufficiency to be unclear, saying the most recent estimates showed that it had reached just 56% of the internally generated revenue required. It said fiscal self-reliance would require substantial support from PNG and other stakeholders, including Australia, which is already the biggest aid partner, providing $50m a year. Writing in the Interpreter, Annmaree O\u2019Keeffe said on Wednesday the young population \u2013 40% are under the age of 15 \u2013 had an enormous health and educational development challenge ahead of itself. O\u2019Keeffe noted an independent Bougainville would begin with one hospital, 11 health centres, and a health expenditure of 1% of its budget. This compared to 3.5% of a much larger budget in Vanuatu, and 8% in the Solomon Islands, which has a budget 10 times larger. \u201cThese comparisons between two comparative Melanesian countries show that for a newly independent Bougainville to sustain its independent future, it would need to dedicate much more of its budget to building the human capacity and associated infrastructure,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time, it would need in its budget new items such as defence, immigration, and all the other administrative paraphernalia of sovereign countries.\u201d O\u2019Keeffe assessed Bougainville would need two to three times its current budget, and the scale of the challenge \u2013 including realising the potential of its natural resources \u2013 couldn\u2019t be underestimated.

An Acnc spokesman said: \u201cThe Acnc takes all concerns seriously and will investigate if there is evidence that a charity has failed to comply with its obligations.\u201d</p> <p>The charity has held various names since its registration in 2012 including the Misty Mountain Aboriginal Healing Place and the Misty Mountain Health and Education Institute. Australian Securities and Investments Commission documents show that in 2017 Michael O\u2019Neill changed the name from Misty Mountain Health and Education Institute to the Misty Mountain Health Retreat because the charity \u201coffers welfare services rather than education services\u201d and therefore should apply to the Australian Taxation Office and Acnc for status as a public benevolent institution, a subtype of charity that can register as deductible gift recipients.</p> <p>Guardian Australia sent O\u2019Neill a list of questions asking about the welfare services provided by the retreat, and how vulnerable clients including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients paid for these services, with prices ranging from $2,450 for a one-week stay for one person to $8,800 for a two-week stay for two people. Clients can pay for additional treatments including an $85 facial or $100 per hour colonic irrigation.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill did not respond to the questions, and instead sent a screenshot of a letter from an Aboriginal woman, who Guardian Australia has not named, from Port Macquarie who said she did casual work at the retreat. \u201cMichael O\u2019Neill has shown me your email questions where you are trying to put Misty Mountain Health Retreat in a bad light,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThere are many in our community that owe there [sic] improved health to Misty and Barbara [O\u2019Neill]. Don\u2019t use our people to do your dirty work.\u201d</p> <p>The charity\u2019s expenses listed in financial documents include a Hyundai excavator loan of $23,830 and an Isuzu truck loan for $28,472. At one point, the charity also offered clients helicopter rides. The O\u2019Neills did not respond to questions on how these purchases were used by the charity. Its 2018 financial report states profits dropped from $120,278 in 2017 to $5,045 in 2018, and that the charity received $400 in government grants. Their annual statements for 2014-2017 list government grants totalling $6,440.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Health Care Complaints Commission said the activities of Barbara O\u2019Neill were being monitored closely. \u201cPresenting health education in any form or delivering health services, would be a breach of her prohibition order,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prohibition order applies in NSW, Vic, Qld and SA. In general, if the material is accessible in [those jurisdictions] online, then it is considered to be delivering a health service.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/11/homeopathy-not-effective-for-treating-any-condition-australian-report-finds\">Homeopathy not effective for treating any condition, Australian report finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Barbara O\u2019Neill issued a statement published by an online petition that has been launched in support of her work. \u201cThank you all for the wonderful love and support that you have given through this challenging time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt looks a bit dark now, but the Great God of the Universe will not let His wonderful health truth to be eliminated, regardless of how men and women may try.\u201d</p> <p>Later in October she will deliver a wellness program at the Living Springs Retreat in the US, with the retreat promoting her as \u201ca qualified naturopath, nutritionist, lecturer, and author\u201d. The program costs US$2,350 [AU$3,500]. Ken McLeod, a spokesman for the Stop the Australian (Anti)Vaccination Network, alerted Living Springs to the Health Care Complaints Commission findings.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s charities watchdog is investigating the activities of an exclusive health retreat run by the disgraced wellness coach Barbara O\u2019Neill, who has been banned from practising for life after giving potentially fatal health advice to vulnerable clients. Earlier in October the Health Care Complaints Commission found O\u2019Neill told people the debunked theory that their cancer was a fungus that could be cured with bicarbonate soda rather than through conventional medical treatment, and gave misleading and dangerous pregnancy and child-rearing advice through her seminars, website, online lectures and consultations with clients. The commission\u2019s investigation found O\u2019Neill never held any membership with any accredited professional health organisation and had failed to obtain any relevant health-related degrees or diplomas. She has been permanently barred from providing any health services either voluntarily or in a paid capacity, including giving lectures. But the Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission [Acnc] has received numerous complaints about the Misty Mountain Health Retreat charity affiliated with O\u2019Neill and which her husband, Michael O\u2019Neill, chairs. As an Acnc-registered health promotion charity, Misty Mountain Health Retreat receives government grants and various tax concessions. Its most recent financial report states that the charity operates live-in health centres in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and people with chronic and terminal illnesses receive diet, exercise and health advice. Michael O\u2019Neill was the founder and Senate candidate for the Involuntary Medication Objectors (Vaccination/Fluoride) party in the May 2019 federal election. The party is anti-vaccination and is sceptical of conventional, evidence-based medicine. A complaint made to Acnc investigators and seen by Guardian Australia alleges the Misty Mountain Health Retreat\u2019s activities are outside the legal requirements for a health promotion charity, given it \u201coperates what is effectively a wellness holiday resort\u201d. \u201cMisty Mountain Health Retreat\u2019s unqualified staff give its clients erroneous advice,\u201d the complaint, made by the dietician and nutritionist Mandy-Lee Noble, alleges. \u201cThe clients are at risk if they act on it.\u201d The Acnc website states the legal meaning of \u2018health promotion charity\u2019 is a charitable institution whose principal activity is to promote the prevention or the control of diseases in humans. As examples of activities that align with this definition, the Acnc lists raising public awareness of a disease, undertaking medical research, developing or providing aids or equipment, and providing clients and carers with evidence-based health education. The Misty Mountain Health Retreat does not appear to engage in any of those activities. The Health Care Complaints Commission investigation into Barbara O\u2019Neill found health lectures given by her, which are promoted by the Misty Mountain Health Retreat, include recommendations not to vaccinate, to use alternative therapies in the place of conventional treatments for cancer and to follow alternative feeding guidelines for infants that are known to be harmful and potentially fatal. Noble\u2019s complaint alleges that Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s involvement with an anti-vaccination political party was a conflict of interest with health promotion. An Acnc spokesman said: \u201cThe Acnc takes all concerns seriously and will investigate if there is evidence that a charity has failed to comply with its obligations.\u201d The charity has held various names since its registration in 2012 including the Misty Mountain Aboriginal Healing Place and the Misty Mountain Health and Education Institute. Australian Securities and Investments Commission documents show that in 2017 Michael O\u2019Neill changed the name from Misty Mountain Health and Education Institute to the Misty Mountain Health Retreat because the charity \u201coffers welfare services rather than education services\u201d and therefore should apply to the Australian Taxation Office and Acnc for status as a public benevolent institution, a subtype of charity that can register as deductible gift recipients. Guardian Australia sent O\u2019Neill a list of questions asking about the welfare services provided by the retreat, and how vulnerable clients including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients paid for these services, with prices ranging from $2,450 for a one-week stay for one person to $8,800 for a two-week stay for two people. Clients can pay for additional treatments including an $85 facial or $100 per hour colonic irrigation. O\u2019Neill did not respond to the questions, and instead sent a screenshot of a letter from an Aboriginal woman, who Guardian Australia has not named, from Port Macquarie who said she did casual work at the retreat. \u201cMichael O\u2019Neill has shown me your email questions where you are trying to put Misty Mountain Health Retreat in a bad light,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThere are many in our community that owe there [sic] improved health to Misty and Barbara [O\u2019Neill]. Don\u2019t use our people to do your dirty work.\u201d The charity\u2019s expenses listed in financial documents include a Hyundai excavator loan of $23,830 and an Isuzu truck loan for $28,472. At one point, the charity also offered clients helicopter rides. The O\u2019Neills did not respond to questions on how these purchases were used by the charity. Its 2018 financial report states profits dropped from $120,278 in 2017 to $5,045 in 2018, and that the charity received $400 in government grants. Their annual statements for 2014-2017 list government grants totalling $6,440. A spokesman for the Health Care Complaints Commission said the activities of Barbara O\u2019Neill were being monitored closely. \u201cPresenting health education in any form or delivering health services, would be a breach of her prohibition order,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prohibition order applies in NSW, Vic, Qld and SA. In general, if the material is accessible in [those jurisdictions] online, then it is considered to be delivering a health service.\u201d Barbara O\u2019Neill issued a statement published by an online petition that has been launched in support of her work. \u201cThank you all for the wonderful love and support that you have given through this challenging time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt looks a bit dark now, but the Great God of the Universe will not let His wonderful health truth to be eliminated, regardless of how men and women may try.\u201d Later in October she will deliver a wellness program at the Living Springs Retreat in the US, with the retreat promoting her as \u201ca qualified naturopath, nutritionist, lecturer, and author\u201d. The program costs US$2,350 [AU$3,500]. Ken McLeod, a spokesman for the Stop the Australian (Anti)Vaccination Network, alerted Living Springs to the Health Care Complaints Commission findings. In a response seen by Guardian Australia, the retreat told McLeod \u201cthe whole story is not being told to the public\u201d. \u201cMany things have been taken out of context,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe will not be responding to any other negative messages.\u201d McLeod described the response as \u201cunconscionable\u201d. \u201cHow could Living Springs continue to provide O\u2019Neill\u2019s seminars in light of their knowledge of the Health Care Complaints Commission findings. Clearly there should be a thorough investigation into their holding of tax deductibility and exemptions and that investigation should uncover how they got charity status in the first place.\u201d Do you know more? melissa.davey@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "Britain will be able to keep its lights on and homes warm through the winter even if imports of European electricity and gas come to a halt, according to National Grid. The energy system operator said the UK\u2019s first winter outside of the European Union would pose no extra challenges to securing the UK\u2019s gas and power supply. Brexit is not expected to completely disrupt UK-Europe energy trading, but even if no imports are possible from continental Europe the UK will have more gas and electricity than it needs. But National Grid\u2019s annual winter forecast revealed that weaning the UK off European imports would come at a price to energy bill payers. The system operator said it expects the wholesale price of electricity to be higher in the UK market than in Europe this winter, so importing less electricity via mega-cables to France, the Netherlands and Belgium would lead to higher prices overall. The UK will be more exposed to steep gas price hikes on global energy market costs if it needs to compete with energy-hungry Asian countries for regular shipments of liquified natural gas (LNG). The cargoes are bought and sold on the international market which is well supplied, but a cold snap in Japan could mean higher energy bills in Britain, even during a mild UK winter. A report commissioned by National Grid before the 2016 referendum predicted that energy bills could climb by \u00a3500m every year by the 2020s if the UK left the EU\u2019s internal energy market. Its latest findings come following the government\u2019s leaked no-deal planning report, Operation Yellowhammer, which predicted a marked increase in energy prices for homes and businesses if the UK crashes out without a deal. Other sources of gas for the UK include North Sea reserves and Norwegian gas imports. The UK will need more gas this winter than last year, despite using more renewable electricity in place of gas-fired power plants, in part because homes are using more gas for heating. National Grid expects the UK to burn 11.7bn cubic metres (bcm) of gas to generate electricity this winter, compared to 12.3 bcm last winter. Meanwhile, homes will need 30.6 bcm of gas, compared to 28.7 bcm last year. National Grid blamed a slowdown in the UK\u2019s home energy efficiency efforts for the growing demand for gas to heat houses. It findings come ahead of fresh calls from 30 companies, including energy suppliers, green groups and the CBI, to make home energy efficiency a national infrastructure priority. Jonathan Marshall, head of analysis at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: \u201cAction on cutting energy waste at home has slowed, while the approval of more gas-fired power stations would drag the UK further off track.\u201d He added: \u201cWith British gas reserves dwindling, now would be the time to crack on with reducing reliance on fossil fuels in general, bringing in a cleaner, cheaper future.\u201d",

In a vote that spells trouble for the incoming European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, MEPs emphatically rejected the French commissioner candidate, former MEP and defence minister Sylvie Goulard. The centrist politician, who had been offered the high-profile job of leading the EU\u2019s internal market policy, was voted down after a difficult encounter with MEPs on Thursday. At a second hearing with MEPs, Goulard expressed regret for a lucrative job she held with a US thinktank while she was an MEP.

She became his defence minister but resigned after a month when a magistrate launched a preliminary investigation into allegations her party misused European parliament funds. Nominated as France\u2019s EU commissioner, she faced hostile questions from MEPs over those allegations and her work for the Los Angeles-based Berggruen Institute from October 2013 to the end of 2015, when she was paid more than \u20ac10,000 a month while working as an MEP. On Thursday, she said she deserved the presumption of innocence over the allegations, which have never been tested in court. But she voiced regret for the thinktank job which she said had cast a doubt over her integrity and independence, values that she said were of \u201cthe utmost importance\u201d to her. Goulard\u2019s vulnerabilities were heightened because MEPs have already rejected a centre-right commissioner candidate (from Hungary), as well as a socialist (a Romanian), meaning the parliament\u2019s two biggest groups were looking for the weak points in her liberal group. Some in the parliament suggested the outcome was \u201cWeber\u2019s revenge\u201d, as Macron had crushed the hopes of Manfred Weber, a German centre-right MEP leader who aspired to lead the European commission but who was blocked by the French president. In a statement, the liberal group (Renew Europe) said it deeply regretted the vote against \u201can excellent, skilled and committed pro-European commissioner\u201d adding that she had \u201cpaid the price of European and domestic petty politics over an objective assessment of the commissioner candidates\u201d. The defeat is likely to trigger recriminations in the group over how they managed to lose Goulard in such a decisive way: 82 of the 112 MEPs eligible to vote on her appointment voted against her. Goulard\u2019s critics said the case showed the problems with the current system for assessing conflicts of interests. \u201cWe obviously did not vote for Goulard,\u201d said Manon Aubry of the radical left Unbowed France party. \u201cEU citizens won\u2019t put their trust in their institutions when a commissioner sees absolutely no problem in making \u20ac10,000 a month from a private lobby in addition to her MEP salary.\u201d The debacle has raised questions about whether the current European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, will be asked to extend his mandate beyond 1 November.

      "bodyText": "And you can read a full report from today\u2019s championships here: Simone Biles speaks: \u201cIt means the world to me,\u201d she said. \u201cFor my fifth, that\u2019s kind of unheard of so it was really exciting. But we finished strong and we gave it our all. It\u2019s super exciting that we had the opportunity to do this.\u201d And there it is. Simone Biles becomes the first and only woman to win five all-around world titles. She goes out of bounds on both her triple double and double double, but still manages to win by 2.100 points (same as Rio) to break her own women\u2019s record for margin of victory at a world championships under the Code of Points. China\u2019s Tang Xijing wins the silver (56.899), while Russia\u2019s Angelina Melnikova takes bronze (56.399). A wonderful floor routine by Suni Lee earns a score of 14.200. Her overall tally of 55.632 moves her into seventh with Biles still to go. And here comes Simone, who needs only 12.300 to win a fifth world all-around title. Oh no. Canada\u2019s Ellie Black came down hard on her Rudi landing and appears to have injured her right foot. She limps off the floor with assistance. A gutsy decision to go for her more difficult vault in her only chance for the podium. She\u2019s fighting back tears as she\u2019s treated by a trainer. Her score of 13.533 puts her into third place overall (56.232) with Biles and Lee to go. Tang Xijing, an injury replacement for Liu Tingting, has made the most of her opportunity today. She\u2019s just finished a gorgeous floor routine \u2013 clean with gorgeous leaps and fantastic landings \u2013 for an overall score of 56.899. That means Biles will need better than 12.310 to win the title, which, er, shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Biles is in total command with one rotation to go, but the race for the other two podium spots is wide open on an unexpected afternoon. (You can see the full standings here.) 1 Simone Biles USA 44.599 2 Tang Xijing CHN 43.299 3 Nina Derwael BEL 42.433 4 Angelina Melnikova RUS 42.333 5 Li Shijia CHN 41.799 6 Ellie Black CAN 41.666 7 Sunisa Lee USA 41.432 8 Elisabeth Seitz GER 41.399 Suni Lee hits her beam routine for a score of 13.833. NBC makes the mystifying decision to not show it, climbing back into seventh place with only her floor exercise to go. China\u2019s Tang Xijing scores a 14.600 on beam with a nearly flawless set, only 0.033 off Biles\u2019 score. She will be in play for the podium if she can match her 13.500 on floor from Tuesday\u2019s team finals. Also in medal contention is Russia\u2019s Angelina Melnikova, who scores 14.000 with one of her finest beam routines. Yet another remarkable set from Simone Biles on the beam. She scores a 14.633 even without her the double-twisting double dismount, left in the quiver thanks to the FIG. She\u2019s doubled her lead to 2.166 points and can eclipse the 60-point plateau with a 15.401 on floor (having posted a 15.333 in Tuesday\u2019s team final). Derwael stays on pace for the second with a 13.500 on floor. We\u2019re halfway home and Biles leads by more than a full point over Belgium\u2019s Nina Derwael. Suni Lee is down to ninth (27.599), Giorgia Villa to 11th (26.966) and M\u00e9lanie de Jesus dos Santos to 16th (26.566) after their mistakes in the second rotation.

Hard to believe it was once considered a weakness. She gets incredible height and nails the double double dismount. Simply breathtaking work from the GOAT. She scores a 14.733 ... ... and the undying pride of her boyfriend. Canada\u2019s Ellie Black kicks off the second rotation with a rock-solid beam routine, scoring a 14.000. Moments after, USA\u2019s Suni Lee goes a bit too far on release and comes off the bars, where she\u2019s been so excellent this year. She finishes the routine but it\u2019s a big hit on her score: a 13.133 will hurt her chances at the podium. Here are your leaders after the first rotation (and another dazzling floor routine by Canada\u2019s Brooklyn Moors). 1 Simone Biles USA 15.233 2 Nina Derwael BEL 15.200 3 Elisabeth Seitz GER 14.866 4 Melanie De Jesus Dos Santos FRA 14.633 5 Sunisa Lee USA 14.466 6 Li Shijia CHN 14.433 -- Angelina Melnikova RUS 14.433 8 Giorgia Villa ITA 14.333 And here\u2019s Simone Biles.

Meanwhile, Belgium\u2019s Nina Derwael, last year\u2019s world champion in the uneven bars, scores a 15.200 in her signature event with a gorgeous routine. And we\u2019re off!

She\u2019s off to an excellent start with a 14.466 on her vault after a small hop back at the end. Here are your start times for today. Biles will start on the vault, with bars, beam and floor to follow. Biles beat the field in qualifying by 2.266 points, a margin of victory greater than any in competition history. But scores are reset to zero for today\u2019s final. Hello and welcome to Stuttgart for today\u2019s women\u2019s individual all-around final at the world gymnastics championships.

      "bodyText": "Former directors of Thomas Cook will face questions from MPs next week about their pay and stewardship of the company , as an inquiry into the tour operator\u2019s dramatic implosion gets under way. Five executives who were at Thomas Cook when it failed, including the chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, will appear in the first evidence session before the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) select committee on Tuesday. The committee, chaired by the Labour MP Rachel Reeves, is expected to focus on executive pay levels, corporate governance, the firm\u2019s high debts and the role of its auditors. The head of Thomas Cook\u2019s remuneration committee, Warren Tucker, who is also a non-executive director at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, is likely to face questions about the company\u2019s pay policies. The three chief executives who were at the helm of the tour operator in the 12 years leading up to its collapse have attracted criticism for accepting pay packets worth a combined \u00a335m. Fankhauser\u2019s predecessors, Harriet Green and Manny Fontenla-Novoa, who were paid nearly \u00a328m between them over seven years, will appear at future evidence sessions. EY, Thomas Cook\u2019s auditor at the time of its collapse, and PwC, its auditor until 2017, will give evidence, as will the Financial Reporting Council and the government\u2019s Insolvency Service, which is managing the company\u2019s liquidation. Manuel Cortes, the general secretary of the transport workers\u2019 union TSSA, will also take part in the inquiry. Thomas Cook collapsed under the weight of its debts last month in one of the most high-profile corporate failures in UK history. Its demise put 9,000 jobs at risk and left 150,000 British holidaymakers stranded overseas, triggering a repatriation effort expected to cost more than \u00a3100m. MPs are also expected to examine the failed attempts to devise a plan to keep Thomas Cook afloat. The government has faced criticism for refusing to offer financial support as investors and executives scrambled to put a financial rescue together. Ministers have said a taxpayer-funded bailout would have been throwing good money after bad. Earlier this week, Hays Travel vowed to save 2,500 jobs after agreeing to buy Thomas Cook\u2019s 555 high street agencies.",

He apologised at the time and again in 2012, saying: \u201cI was very, very sorry in 2004 that the Spectator did carry an editorial that partially repeated those allegations, I apologised then and I apologise now.\u201d</p> <p>The article repeated the allegation made by the Sun, which is still boycotted in the city, that \u201cdrunken fans\u201d might also have been to blame for the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 people lost their lives.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson should have faced his critics in Liverpool instead of \u201cskulking in and out\u201d of the area for his meeting with Irish PM Leo Varadkar, the city\u2019s mayor has said. Joe Anderson was not the only one offended that the prime minister swept into a country hotel half an hour from Liverpool as a \u201cneutral\u201d venue for crunch Brexit talks with the Irish PM, Leo Varadkar. Johnson\u2019s standing in Liverpool was shredded 15 years ago when he was blamed for writings in the Spectator magazine, which he edited, suggesting Liverpool was a self-pitying city that thrived on victimhood in the wake of Hillsborough and other disasters. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty cowardly to skulk in and skulk out again,\u201d said Anderson, Labour\u2019s mayor since 2012. \u201cAs prime minister, he can\u2019t stay away from Liverpool. I think he should man up and accept the fact that if you do something wrong, that you should apologise then make amends.\u201d Johnson prompted widespread indignation in the city in 2004 when the Spectator accused the city of wallowing in \u201cvictim status\u201d over the murder of\u201d Ken Bigley in Iraq and the 1989 Hillsborough football stadium disaster. He apologised at the time and again in 2012, saying: \u201cI was very, very sorry in 2004 that the Spectator did carry an editorial that partially repeated those allegations, I apologised then and I apologise now.\u201d The article repeated the allegation made by the Sun, which is still boycotted in the city, that \u201cdrunken fans\u201d might also have been to blame for the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 people lost their lives. While Johnson did not write the piece, he was held responsible for its publication as editor. Anderson said people in Liverpool had suffered terribly under austerity, with one in four children living in poverty, child mortality rising and food banks increasingly being relied upon. \u201cWe are not looking for a bigger slice of the cake,\u201d he said, \u201cwe just want the ingredients to grow, just like the south of the country. We have lost 64% of central government funding, \u00a3540m in austerity cuts. I will whinge until I have no breath left until we have equality for the city.\u201d His anger with Johnson is reflected among voters, but as Anderson said, not shared by all. Graeme Burnley, a 42-year-old teacher, said he was offended at Johnson\u2019s presence. He said: \u201cHe has insulted this city on so many occasions and he is not a fit person to be running the country. He is offensive, he has insulted us. We are not the only ones he has insulted, but he should stay away from Liverpool.\u201d Heidi, 71, said: \u201cDo you really want to hear what I think of Boris Johnson? He\u2019s a horrible man, a Trump double, promising everything but delivering nothing.\u201d But not everyone agreed. Norma Hall, a retired civil servant who voted to leave, said: \u201cI quite like him.

      "bodyText": "Finally, the Dow Jones industrial average closed a neat 150 points higher tonight, following the news that Donald Trump would meet with China\u2019s trade envoy on Friday. And the president is getting the market pumped again in after hours trading, saying the talks with China\u2019s delegation in Washington went \u201cvery well\u201d. That could just be spin, on a tricky day for the president, but it\u2019s pushing the futures market higher.... Goodnight! GW America\u2019s Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), which represents the tech sector, has called on president Trump to end the trade war by dropping tariffs on Chinese goods. TI President and CEO Jason Oxman issued this statement: On Friday, President Trump has another opportunity to end this unnecessary and costly trade war with China when he meets with Vice Premier Liu He. ITI and our members support a trade agreement that puts an end to China\u2019s unfair trade policies and costly tariffs that are hurting American consumers, already struggling with growing economic disparities and stifling business large and small. As this trade war has raged on for over a year, we believe there are tools to address China\u2019s unfair behavior without tariffs and we strongly encourage the U.S. and China to address these long-standing issues. Failure to come to an agreement will be costly to the global economy and detrimental to the future of emerging innovation within the tech industry.\u201d Wall Street is holding onto its earlier gains, as traders cling onto hopes of progress at the trade talks in Washington. The main indices are up around 0.4% in late trading. Trade war optimism had also pushed the Dow Jones industrial average up by 214 points right now. That\u2019s a gain of 0.8%, to 26,560 points, at noon New York time. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has closed 19 points higher at 7,186, up 0.3%. Optimism over the trade talks lifted shares, although the strengthening pound held back multinational with large overseas earnings. David Madden of CMC Markets says: Traders are a little more hopeful about the US-China trade talks after President Trump tweeted he will meet Liu He, China\u2019s Vice Premier, tomorrow. In a continuation of the back and forth on the trade front, Mr Trump tweeted China \u2018wants to make a deal, but do I?\u2019. The fact Mr Trump will meet with Liu He sends a positive message, which is why we have seen an uptick in sentiment. The gulf between the two sides is wide, but a willingness to sit down and negotiate has injected some hope in the markets. Donald Trump\u2019s trade tweet came as two Republican donors with links to the president\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani were reportedly arrested on campaign-finance charges. Our US Politics Live blog is tracking all the action. On trade, my colleague Joan E Greve explains: Meanwhile, Trump announced over Twitter that he would meet tomorrow with the Chinese vice premier to engage in trade talks. The vice premier, Liu He, is leading China\u2019s negotiating team as the two countries attempt to wind down the tit-for-tat sanctions that have escalated in recent months. Trump has shown little willingness to end his trade war, but US stocks still surged following his announcement that he would sit down with Liu. More here: Never underestimate the power of a Donald Trump tweet. All the main US stock indices, and nearly every European market, are solidly higher since the president tweeted that he\u2019ll meet Chinese vice-premier Liu He tomorrow. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says has lifted optimism in the markets: Despite a gloomy start to the week, there have been enough titbits in the last couple of days to keep hopes of trade progress alive. First there was Wednesday\u2019s claim from a Chinese official that Beijing is open to a \u2018partial trade deal\u2019 in order to limit the negative impact to the country\u2019s economy. And then, this Thursday, Donald Trump tweeted that he would be meeting with Vice Premier Liu He at the White House on Friday \u2013 a step up from Washington\u2019s usual high level negotiating team of Robert Lighthizer and Stephen Mnuchin, and perhaps a sign that something more substantial could come out of the talks. Sterling is pushing higher, after Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar issued a joint statement they can see a pathway to a possible Brexit deal. The leaders of the UK and the Republic of Ireland have spent several hours talking today, at a manor house in Merseyside. And while there\u2019s no breakthrough, the two leaders say they had a \u201cdetailed and comprehensive discussion\u201d, and officials will continue to work towards a breakthrough. Sterling has gained half a cent against the US dollar to $1.2264, its highest level of the day. Andy Sparrow\u2019s Politics Live blog has more details: Here\u2019s my colleague Richard Partington on today\u2019s GDP report: Britain looks on track to avoid a recession despite mounting Brexit uncertainty after official figures showed an unexpectedly strong jump in economic growth over the summer. The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product (GDP) had risen by 0.3% in the three months to August, beating the forecasts of City economists, helped by the strength of the services sector and a boom in TV and film production across the country. Against a backdrop of mounting political chaos, economists said the latest snapshot showed that economic growth remained weak but that Britain was on track to avoid sliding into the first recession since the financial crisis. Ian Stewart, chief economist at the accountancy firm Deloitte, said: \u201cThe economy has regained some momentum but the underlying trend is towards softer growth. The headwinds from a major global slowdown and uncertainty at home point to weaker growth ahead.\u201d In a sign of weakness in the economy, GDP contracted by 0.1% in August as activity in the dominant service sector stalled and factory output plunged as the Brexit deadline nears with little sign of a deal with Brussels. More here: The news that Donald Trump and Liu He will (apparently) meet at the White House tomorrow is pushing shares higher. Investors see it as a positive development, which could lead to at least a \u2018partial trade deal\u2019 (one that leaves trickier issues unresolved). The US stock market is now up around 0.5%, after its earlier underwhelming start. Donald Trump has just tweeted that he\u2019ll meet Liu He on Friday at the White House. That could be an encouraging sign, suggesting that the Chinese delegation won\u2019t be leaving early (as sources had hinted earlier this week). The New York stock exchange has opened very cautiously, as investors await developments from the US-China trade talks. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained just 3 points, or 0.012%, to 26,349. The S&amp;P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq index are equally subdued. Edward Moya of trading firm OANDA says the talks between Liu He, Stephen Mnuchin and Robert Lighthizer are crucial for the markets: If we don\u2019t see a complete collapse in trade talks, the bullish case for US stocks remains in place as the US economy is still likely to see modest growth and the Fed is unlikely to raise rates over the next couple of years as inflation will probably not rise above their target over the next year. European markets are also quiet, with the FTSE 100 up 13 points or 0.2% at 7179. Over in Washington, Chinese and US officials are sitting down for a new round of negotiations over the trade war. China\u2019s vice-premier Liu He has been just greeted by US trade representative Robert Lighthizer and treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin. All three men cracked a cheery smile, but investors aren\u2019t optimistic of a breakthrough this week. Beijing remains unhappy that the US has blacklisted 28 Chinese firms earlier this week, citing human rights violations in China\u2019s Xinjiang province. Just in: US inflation was weaker than expected last month, potentially bolstering the case for an interest rate cut next month. American consumer prices were unchanged month-on-month in September, below the 0.1% expected. On an annual basis, prices rose by 1.7%, below the 1.8% expected. Separately, fewer Americans filed new unemployment claims than expected last week. The Initial Jobless Claims total rose by 210,000, down from 220,000. That suggests US firms aren\u2019t rushing to lay off staff, despite signs that the economy is slowing. Brexit uncertainty may not prevent a bidding war for perhaps the most famous hotel in the world - The Ritz. According to The Times, the Ritz\u2019s owners are canvassing potential bids which could value the hotel at \u00a3800m - or more than \u00a36m a bedroom. That\u2019s a remarkable price, even for such a prestigious property on Piccadilly. It had a turnover of \u00a347m in 2018, yielding operating profits of \u00a315m. But Paul Olliff, legal director at law firm Ashfords, suspects the Barclay family won\u2019t struggle to find interest. \u201dA hotel of this size and prominence being for sale will not only attract significant attention in the UK but also worldwide. You would expect a pool of 10 or so ultra-high net worth individuals entering a bidding process. Whether \u00a3800m is a true reflection of the asset\u2019s value will be a potential hurdle to the sale and achieving that sale price - each bidder will carry out a rigorous financial due diligence process. However, given it will be classed as a \u2018trophy asset\u2019, buyers might not be put off by a financial performance that doesn\u2019t reflect the sale price. Whether it\u2019s an inflated price or not, this should not be seen as an indication of the buoyant hotel market in the UK in a wider context, primarily because the Ritz is almost a \u201cone-off\u201d\u201d Newsflash: The European boss of Japanese carmaker Nissan has warned that a no-deal Brexit would threaten the future of its entire EU operations. Speaking at Nissan\u2019s car plant in Sunderland, Gianluca de Ficchy said that moving to WTO tariffs would be \u201cunsustainable\u201d for the company, as it would make its vehicles uncompetitive. My colleague Josh Halliday is there: The NIESR thinktank has crunched today\u2019s GDP data, and concluded that Britain will indeed avoid a recession this year. They expect the UK post growth of 0.5% in the third quarter of 2019. That would reverse the 0.2% slump recorded in April-June, avoiding two consecutive quarters of contraction (a technical recession). NIESR says this morning\u2019s data, showing 0.3% growth in the three months to August, is a little stronger than forecast. But Dr Garry Young, NIESR\u2019s director of macroeconomic modelling and forecasting, points out that productivity is still poor. \u201cDespite better than expected GDP data, the underlying pace of growth in the United Kingdom is slow. The strongest source of private sector demand is household consumption, driven by real wage growth, but this is not sustainable without a pick-up in productivity growth, and this seems unlikely in the near term.\u201d My colleague Sean Farrell is at the unveiling of the Turner \u00a320 note -- and reports that Mark Carney fielded questions on the UK economy, the outlook for inflation and interest rates, and his own future. State of economy Asked about today\u2019s GDP data, Carney says Brexit stockiling has distorted GDP data in recent months. \u201cThe data is fairly volatile at the moment influenced by a number of Brexit related effects. \u201cIf you cast your mind back to our August report we expected 0.2% for Q3. We have one month to go. The underlying pace of growth is a bit softer than that.\u201d Succession. The governor didn\u2019t rule out staying on beyond 31 January 2020 if asked. \u201cThat is a question for the government. As the chancellor indicated in the past few days \u2026 they felt they would be on track. We will await the decision of the government at the appropriate time. The government is focused on a couple of big issues. There is no reason that question would necessarily be asked \u2026 There is no need to speculate. There is plenty of time.\u201d Inflation and monetary policy. Carney said: \u201cAs you know, inflation has just come down below 2% and the currency remains more volatile than usual because of the relatively wide range of Brexit outcomes that could transpire. The MPC will manage policy to balance the need to bring inflation back to target either from below or above by supporting this economy. In more dramatic Brexit outcomes we will do whatever we can to support growth but I would remind in that regard that much of the flexibility that the bank has is the responsibility of other committees within the Bank, [especially] the FPC.\u201d Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, says today\u2019s GDP report is consistent with a picture of \u201csoft underlying growth\u201d. Carney also warned that the pound is more volatile than usual due to Brexit uncertainty, adding that the Bank will do whatever it can to support growth if there is a disorderly Brexit. He was speaking in Margate, at the unveiling of the new \u00a320 note. It features British romantic artist JMW Turner, and his famous painting The Fighting Temeraire. As well as looking quite lovely, the new note is also packed with security features to thwart forgers. Here\u2019s a video from the BoE: Brexit uncertainty and the US-China trade war are both hurting British industry. Fhaheen Kahn, economist at Make UK, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, explains: \u201cWe are 21 days away from the UK leaving the EU and today\u2019s data shows that manufacturing is right in the eye of continued economic uncertainty. There is now a potent cocktail facing the sector of trade wars, a synchronised global downturn in major markets and political chaos which shows no signs of ending. \u201cThe majority of sectors declined with pharmaceuticals and electrical equipment being hit especially hard and vacancies in the sector are also falling rapidly. So long as the current uncertainty persists manufacturing looks as far away as ever from returning to pre-financial crisis levels.\u201d This chart, from today\u2019s GDP report, shows the damage: A new round of Brexit stockpiling by nervous businesses and consumers should keep the UK out of recession. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, says: \u201cDespite the contraction in GDP in August, the risk of the UK economy falling into a technical recession is still remote, due to strong growth in July. Also a potential new round of stockpiling will likely help boost GDP growth in September and October. The latest figures are still a cause for concern however, especially as most of the fall comes from the manufacturing sector, which is particularly vulnerable to an adverse Brexit outcome.\u201d ING economist James Smith predicts that Britain will probably avoid recession in 2019 despite a gloomy August. He writes: UK GDP contracted by 0.1% in August, suggesting there is very little to cheer about in the UK economy at the moment..... That said, the economy will most likely avoid a near-term technical recession. Consumer activity is continuing to grow, even if confidence remains fairly depressed. Shoppers appear to have been less fazed by the ups-and-downs of the Brexit process than businesses. But even so, economic growth is likely to remain fairly modest for the rest of this year, averaging around 0.2-0.3% per quarter. This means that the Bank of England is likely to remain cautious, although we still feel its probably too early to be pencilling in UK rate cuts. Sky News\u2019 economics editor, Ed Conway, agrees that Britain appears to be dodging a recession - but we\u2019ll only know for sure in a month\u2019s time. Economist Rupert Seggins has shown how manufacturing is struggling: Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics suggests there\u2019s no justification for the Bank of England to cut interest rates soon (as policymakers have been hinting). At least TV and film production is boosting the economy, points out the BBC\u2019s Dharhini David. I\u2019ve dug through today\u2019s growth report to find the main charts showing how the UK economy will probably avoid a Brexit recession, despite stumbling in August. This shows how rolling three-month growth took a nasty tumble at the start of the summer, but has since recovered: Britain is officially half-way into recession, having contracted by 0.2% in April-June. But to be an official recession, it needs to also contract in July-September. That looks unlikely, given we now know GDP rose by 0.3% in June-August. But August wasn\u2019t a happy time for the economy. This charts shows how industry and agriculture both contracted, while service sector firms stalled: Britain\u2019s film and TV production industry boosted growth in the last three months The Office for National Statistics\u2019 head of GDP, Rob Kent-Smith, explains: \u201cGrowth increased in the latest three months, despite a weak performance across manufacturing, with TV and film production helping to boost the services sector.\u201d According to the ONS, Britain\u2019s motion picture industry has grown output by a quarter since 2017, thanks to big box office productions including Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Paddington 2. Britain\u2019s services sector provided the bulk of the growth, as usual. The ONS reports that services GDP grew by 0.4% over the last quarter, driven by the \u201cprofessional, scientific and technical sector\u201d. But in August, the service sector was flat. Manufacturing had a worse time of it, though, shrinking by 0.7% in August. That\u2019s despite car factories working more than usual, having shifted their summer shutdown forward to April (in preparation for Brexit at the end of March). Although August was weak, July and June were stronger than expected. The ONS has revised July\u2019s growth up, from 0.3% to 0.4%. June has also been nudged up to +0.1%, from zero. That\u2019s why the three-month/three-month growth rate hit 0.3%, stronger than expected. It also means September\u2019s GDP, due in a month\u2019s time, would need to be pretty weak to put Britain into recession. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u2019s economy contracted by 0.1% in August, according to the Office for National Statistics\u2019 latest growth report. That\u2019s a little weaker than expected, and the first monthly contraction since April. But over the last three months the UK economy grew by 0.3%, the ONS says. That\u2019s a little better than forecast, and could ease fears of a Brexit recession. More to follow! Former UK chancellor Philip Hammond has warned Brexiteers that their dreams of striking new free trade deals once Britain has left the EU don\u2019t add up. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Hammond explains that such deals would have \u201cvery limited\u201d economic value, and certainly wouldn\u2019t compensate for the loss of tariff-free, frictionless trade with the EU. He\u2019s arguing for a \u201crapid-fire zero-tariff trade deal with Europe\u201d, even though it would restrict the UK from striking similar deals with other countries. The Telegraph\u2019s Peter Foster has tweeted the key points: European stock markets have just dropped smartly into the red, after China launched another broadside at America. Beijing\u2019s foreign ministry accused Washington of \u2018smearing China\u2019 over its crackdown in Xinjiang, by blacklisting companies and refusing to issue visas to officials. Reuters has the details: Beijing said on Thursday that comments by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accusing China of human rights violations in its treatment of Muslims constituted a smear against China. Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang made the comments at a daily briefing Thursday. He did not mention Pompeo in particular. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a television interview on Wednesday that China\u2019s treatment of Muslims, including the Uighurs, in western China was an \u201cenormous human rights violation\u201d and Washington will continue to raise the issue. This has further dampened hopes of a trade deal breakthrough at this week\u2019s talks in Washington, and knocked 0.4% off the pan-European Stoxx 600 index. Slowing economic growth and weak trade haven\u2019t stopped the rich spend-spend-spending, if the latest results from Mo\u00ebt Hennessy \u2013 Louis Vuitton are any guide. The luxury goods brand, also known as LVMH, grew its sales by 11% in the third quarter of 2019, beating forecasts. Fashion and leather goods sales grew by 19%, led by its largest brands Louis Vuitton and Dior. LVMH said it had shaken off \u201cthe difficult context in Hong Kong\u201d -- clearly demand for expensive handbags and coats falls when protesters and police are clashing in the streets. LVMH\u2019s shares have jumped 3.8%, this morning, and lifted shares across the luxury sector with Christian Dior up 4.1% and Burberry gaining 1%. That FT story about divisions at the European Central Bank over QE just lifted the euro to a two-week high. Sterling just slipped to a one-month low against the euro. It touched \u20ac1.1105 for the first time since early September, meaning it has lost 2.3% against the euro in the last three weeks. Much of those losses have been driven by worries about a no-deal Brexit. Today, though, is more about the euro itself. It\u2019s rallying, after the Financial Times reported that the European Central Bank ignored advice from its own officials not to relaunch its stimulus programme last week. These divisions could make it harder for the ECB to loosen monetary policy even further. Germany\u2019s economy is also struggling, compounding the risks to the UK economy. New data show that German exports slumped by 3.9% year-on-year in August, the worst performance this year, with imports falling by 3.1%. This increases the risk that Europe\u2019s largest economy has fallen into recession this autumn, buffeted by the US-China trade war. Germany, like the UK, suffered a small contraction in April-June. https://twitter.com/destatis_news/status/1182176725318459392 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Two of the City\u2019s big fears - a Brexit-induced recession and a full-blown trade war - are in the spotlight today. The latest UK GDP report, due at 9.30am, is expected to show that growth fizzled out in August. Economists predict GDP was unchanged during the month, after rising 0.3% in July. And over the last three months, GDP is expected to have only risen by 0.1% -- much slower than usual. Given the economy actually shrank in April-June, there\u2019s clearly a risk that Britain\u2019s economy stagnates. It could even slide into a full-blown recession later this year as Brexit uncertainty continues to hit business investment. The economy may have got one Brexit boost -- car factories stayed open in August, having brought their usual summer shutdown forwards to April. That should have boosted manufacturing output during the month. But with the eurozone also looking weak, and global trade slowing, there\u2019s not much optimism about today\u2019s August GDP report. Here\u2019s what the City\u2019s expecting: Monthly GDP: unchanged in August compared with July Growth in June-August: Up just 0.1% compared with March-May. Manufacturing production: Down 0.4% compared with September 2018, but up 0.2% month-on-month Services output: flat in August. We\u2019ll also get UK trade data, expected to show Britain\u2019s goods deficit with the rest of the world widened in August. But the big trade story is happening in Washington today, where a Chinese delegation led by vice-premier Liu He will meet US counterparts later today. Hopes of a breakthrough in the ongoing trade war aren\u2019t high, as the US has just blacklisted 28 Chinese companies over human rights abuses against Muslim groups in Xinjiang province. China has briefed that Liu He will offer to buy more US agricultural goods in an attempt to break the deadlock, but they\u2019ve also hinted that the two-day talks could end early. The agenda 9.30am BST: UK monthly GDP report for August - expected to show GDP was flat month-on-month 9.30am BST: UK visible trade balance for August - expected to show a deficit of \u00a310bn, up from \u00a39.1bn in July 1.30pm BST: US consumer price inflation for September - expected to show prices rose 0.1% in the month 3pm BST: IMF to publish its latest Global Financial Stability Report 3.30pm BST: IMF to publish its latest Fiscal Monitor",

      "bodyText": "\u201cTo infinity and beyond\u201d is the catchphrase that defined my younger years. I was 10 years old when I first watched Toy Story and my little brother had just turned three. Up until that point, my 12-year-old sister and I were the Disney obsessives in the family, reenacting scenes from Beauty and the Beast to an audience of two disinterested parents \u2013 but Buzz, Woody and co changed all that. From the tiny green soldiers that made my dad swear every time he trod on one, to the slinky dog who permanently teetered on the edge of the staircase and the Mr Potato Head who was constantly one piece short of a full face, our entire house became Andy\u2019s bedroom. Luckily for me, when my brother got a little older and was also obsessed with the toy cowboy, my parents finally relented and granted my one true wish: a trip to Disney World in Florida. I only need to look at our slightly faded photo album from those seven humid days to immediately transport back to 10-year-old me. There is my bright red brother wearing a giant Winnie-the-Pooh hat \u2013 which he refused to take off despite the 30C heat \u2013 crying as he hugged his idol, Buzz Lightyear. My sister and I in matching \u201cI have been chosen\u201d alien T-shirts with newly purchased Reebok Classics from the outlet mall. My poncho-clad mum reaching for my brother in the pouring tropical rain as he tried to chase Woody in the parade, and there is the lasting memory of my youngest sibling shouting: \u201cTo infinity and beyond\u201d every single time he jumped in our motel swimming pool. I\u2019ve kept up with every Toy Story film since \u2013 in fact, I still own my talking, light-up alien from that very holiday, and I may have even bought myself a Lots-o\u2019-Huggin\u2019 cuddly bear a few years ago after watching Toy Story 3, despite being well into my 20s.

My mum started it with a brand new Mr Potato Head, which she insists she just so happened to \u201cfind\u201d at work. She hid him in the top of her wardrobe (the same place Father Christmas used to hide our presents), and could not hide her delight when my nephew finally spotted it. My dad continued it when we went on our first family holiday in years this summer to Mallorca \u2013 minus my brother who was on a lads\u2019 holiday to \u201cMarbs\u201d \u2013 and he shouted out that familiar line the first time his grandson jumped in the mosaic-bottomed pool: \u201cTo infinity and beyond!\u201d I\u2019m just as bad.

Work began on the world\u2019s first fully computer-generated feature film in 1991, and at the company\u2019s core was a \u201cbrain trust\u201d that included future legends: director John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, who would later direct Finding Nemo and Wall-E, Pete Docter, who made Monsters, Inc and Up, and all-rounder Joe Ranft. The old ways were binned. Their film would not be based on a fairytale. It would not be a musical. And rather than leading with pristine do-gooders flanked by quirky sidekicks, Pixar wanted the heroes themselves to be flawed \u2013 and interesting. \u201cWhy do they name these movies after the most boring characters in the film?\u201d Stanton later commented, referencing the animated blockbusters of yore.</p> <p>Character was key, and in making the toys adults, the writers and animators infused themselves into them. There were hiccups \u2013 an attempt to make it \u201cedgier\u201d at Disney\u2019s request resulted in a film that just felt mean, and a cowboy so charmless that Tom Hanks, in a voice session, said Woody was a jerk. Everybody knew it was a disaster, and the team were given free rein to fix it. \u201cIf we\u2019re gonna go down,\u201d Docter later remembered them thinking, \u201clet\u2019s at least go down doing what we believe in.\u201d Pixar\u2019s retooled script sparkled with the joy and hope it was always meant to have.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a26589036c431e36385e876bf0a52d53169fde93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a26589036c431e36385e876bf0a52d53169fde93/0_0_1884_1059/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pixar introduced an inspiring new yardstick in filmmaking\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pixar introduced an inspiring new yardstick in filmmaking</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Client Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/toy-story-4-sporktacular-adventure/2019/oct/10/be-more-bo-peep-and-always-recycle-seven-life-lessons-to-learn-from-toy-story\">Be more Bo Peep and always recycle: seven life lessons to learn from Toy Story</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The end result is timeless because it speaks to ever-present concerns. Existential ones at that. This wasn\u2019t a kids\u2019 film that adults could also enjoy \u2013 its creators imbuing it with mature characterisation, it is unabashedly for all ages, and not in a cynical, multiplex-baiting manner. It\u2019s just honest. We relate to Woody and Buzz because they are all of us. Similarly, Pixar refused to steal cheap laughs by throwing in topical pop culture references, which are guaranteed to age a film within months. If anything ages Toy Story, it\u2019s the animation, and only because technology progressed at lightning speed.</p> <p>Pixar knew what it was up against \u2013 the whole toy conceit was because the early 1990s rendering systems were more primitive. \u201cEverything tended to look like plastic, or more plasticky,\u201d Lasseter later said. So they made plastic characters. Not that it mattered \u2013 once you were in, you were in, that toy space ranger is as real as the rest of us. And in 1995, when Toy Story was released, it was a real revolution. Opposition sprang up in its wake, the other studios steadily piling in on the CGI action. For years, though, none could match the appeal of what Pixar was pumping out. None of Pixar\u2019s competitors, it seemed, knew how to harness that magic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ebd60a01d6084dd90d916007ca8415179c92580\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ebd60a01d6084dd90d916007ca8415179c92580/0_0_1877_1055/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Allen, left, voiced the character of Buzz Lightyear\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Allen, left, voiced the character of Buzz Lightyear</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Client Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Toy Story also opened the doors for A-list actors to storm the voiceover booths. Give or take some musical stalwarts, until the early 1990s specialist voice actors did the honours for animated characters. Disney changed the game when they hired Robin Williams to voice the Genie in Aladdin, but many stars still saw such business as second-tier until Toy Story came along. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, as Woody and Buzz, acted their pants off, their performances no different than if they\u2019d been filmed for real. In part thanks to that cast, it was the first animated film to be nominated for best original screenplay.</p> <p>The Toy Story films have never scrimped on standards. With each one the animation is pioneered, the storytelling treasured, the tears guaranteed. The heroes look the same, but grow within themselves, Pixar consistently plumbing new depths to emotionally exhaust us. Nothing lasts forever, we\u2019re told, as characters make their self-discoveries and learn, change, and move on. The films, however, will.</p> <p><em>Toy Story 4 is available on digital download (</em><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Toy-Story-Tom-Hanks-Woody/dp/B07TK1Y4PC/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Toy+Story+4&amp;\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prime Video</a>, <a href=\"https://www.skystore.com/boxset/movies/toy-story-4/b087a119-27f8-4d1a-acef-56f41603db27\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sky Store</a>, <a href=\"https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/toy-story-4/id1467478378?mt=6&amp;at=10lt9W\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apple TV</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=Toy%20Story%204&amp;c=movies\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Play</a>) from 14 October</em></p>",

Work began on the world\u2019s first fully computer-generated feature film in 1991, and at the company\u2019s core was a \u201cbrain trust\u201d that included future legends: director John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, who would later direct Finding Nemo and Wall-E, Pete Docter, who made Monsters, Inc and Up, and all-rounder Joe Ranft. The old ways were binned. Their film would not be based on a fairytale. It would not be a musical. And rather than leading with pristine do-gooders flanked by quirky sidekicks, Pixar wanted the heroes themselves to be flawed \u2013 and interesting. \u201cWhy do they name these movies after the most boring characters in the film?\u201d Stanton later commented, referencing the animated blockbusters of yore. Character was key, and in making the toys adults, the writers and animators infused themselves into them. There were hiccups \u2013 an attempt to make it \u201cedgier\u201d at Disney\u2019s request resulted in a film that just felt mean, and a cowboy so charmless that Tom Hanks, in a voice session, said Woody was a jerk. Everybody knew it was a disaster, and the team were given free rein to fix it. \u201cIf we\u2019re gonna go down,\u201d Docter later remembered them thinking, \u201clet\u2019s at least go down doing what we believe in.\u201d Pixar\u2019s retooled script sparkled with the joy and hope it was always meant to have. The end result is timeless because it speaks to ever-present concerns. Existential ones at that. This wasn\u2019t a kids\u2019 film that adults could also enjoy \u2013 its creators imbuing it with mature characterisation, it is unabashedly for all ages, and not in a cynical, multiplex-baiting manner. It\u2019s just honest. We relate to Woody and Buzz because they are all of us. Similarly, Pixar refused to steal cheap laughs by throwing in topical pop culture references, which are guaranteed to age a film within months. If anything ages Toy Story, it\u2019s the animation, and only because technology progressed at lightning speed. Pixar knew what it was up against \u2013 the whole toy conceit was because the early 1990s rendering systems were more primitive. \u201cEverything tended to look like plastic, or more plasticky,\u201d Lasseter later said. So they made plastic characters. Not that it mattered \u2013 once you were in, you were in, that toy space ranger is as real as the rest of us. And in 1995, when Toy Story was released, it was a real revolution. Opposition sprang up in its wake, the other studios steadily piling in on the CGI action. For years, though, none could match the appeal of what Pixar was pumping out. None of Pixar\u2019s competitors, it seemed, knew how to harness that magic. Toy Story also opened the doors for A-list actors to storm the voiceover booths. Give or take some musical stalwarts, until the early 1990s specialist voice actors did the honours for animated characters. Disney changed the game when they hired Robin Williams to voice the Genie in Aladdin, but many stars still saw such business as second-tier until Toy Story came along. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, as Woody and Buzz, acted their pants off, their performances no different than if they\u2019d been filmed for real. In part thanks to that cast, it was the first animated film to be nominated for best original screenplay. The Toy Story films have never scrimped on standards. With each one the animation is pioneered, the storytelling treasured, the tears guaranteed. The heroes look the same, but grow within themselves, Pixar consistently plumbing new depths to emotionally exhaust us. Nothing lasts forever, we\u2019re told, as characters make their self-discoveries and learn, change, and move on. The films, however, will. Toy Story 4 is available on digital download (Prime Video, Sky Store, Apple TV and Google Play) from 14 October",

Just ask Bo Peep. A classic character case of the undeveloped love interest, with less than 10 minutes\u2019 total airtime in the first two movies, in which she pretty much acts solely as Woody\u2019s therapist, talking him off the toy shelf when he\u2019s ranting about rejection, and then what thanks does she get? She gets written out of Toy Story 3 entirely. Jeez, give the girl a break. But, like a phoenix from the flames, in Toy Story 4, she\u2019s back! She\u2019s independent, she\u2019s brave, she\u2019s a leader, she\u2019s the only toy to ever make Woody question his allegiance to a kid. As far as toys go, she\u2019s basically blossomed into Beyonc\u00e9.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0556ee74dda75d84112e4e391681dddb29107f3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0556ee74dda75d84112e4e391681dddb29107f3e/0_0_2048_857/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Forky\" width=\"1000\" height=\"418\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Forky rose from the trash to give us character development to treasure</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pixar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Recycling is your friend<br></strong>Forky\u2019s existential crisis on the journey from trash to treasure is an excellent lesson for all of us who live in fear of the council rejecting our recycling efforts. Is it plastic? Is it not? For the love of God, why is it so hard? But, you see, recycling doesn\u2019t just mean a trip to the green bin, it means upcycling too. It means getting all Blue Peter with a bit of sticky-back plastic and a marker pen, and turning sporks into Forkies. An excellent lesson in materialism while we\u2019re at it, and a pertinent reminder to all of us who have ever bought a child a toy they wanted for months, only to find it\u2019s the box that holds the greatest joy, that sometimes the best things in life really are free.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e139d2b85e02214cfab517c9eb9667bcc568c78c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e139d2b85e02214cfab517c9eb9667bcc568c78c/0_0_2048_857/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Buzz Lightyear\" width=\"1000\" height=\"418\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Buzz Lightyear takes to the skies when he finds the hero inside him</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pixar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Listen to yourself. And Mariah Carey<br></strong>The truth is out there. Well, more specifically, the truth is <em>in</em> there. As in, inside you, you just have to ask yourself the right questions to find it. Like Buzz does. What with Woody having proved himself to be the natural team leader in the toy box, Buzz hasn\u2019t really ever had to think like a boss, has he? He\u2019s been a great sidekick, a kickass friend, but a captain? Nah, not so much. But in Toy Story 4, being the boss is exactly what he needs to do. He needs to take control and be the spaceman we all know he can be. And so, under the advice of Woody, he listens to his inner voice. He accesses his conscience and he finds himself able. The lesson? It\u2019s a good one. Leadership may not come naturally to all of us, but if you really search inside yourself, you\u2019ll find it. It\u2019s probably best we hand over to Mariah Carey to wrap this one up. \u201cWhen you feel like hope is gone, look inside you and be strong, and you\u2019ll finally see the truth, that a hero lies in you.\u201d Preach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1093fea4d69e46b4d7a6e968d973444cfce753b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1093fea4d69e46b4d7a6e968d973444cfce753b/0_0_2048_857/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Duke Caboom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"418\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Duke Caboom, Canada\u2019s greatest stuntman, has trouble believing in himself</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pixar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You are more than your social media presence<br></strong>OK, so we can\u2019t really use the Instagram v Reality conundrum here, because Duke Caboom is a toy, and toys don\u2019t have social media, silly, but bear with us. Duke Caboom, Canada\u2019s greatest stuntman, has trouble believing he actually is Canada\u2019s greatest stuntman after his own reality fails to live up to the Duke Caboom reality presented in his TV advert (AKA a toy\u2019s version of living your best life on social media). What\u2019s presented to the public is not what he sees in himself. He can\u2019t jump that high \u2026 He can\u2019t do those tricks \u2026 But after a swift talking to from his friends, a bit of self-belief, and a shedding of his innermost fears, Duke Caboom proves who he is really <em>is</em> good enough.<strong> </strong>Side note: character likeability definitely improves when voiced by the internet\u2019s boyfriend, Keanu Reeves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aece2d85233f969ff8d6473a660808a2caf26a95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aece2d85233f969ff8d6473a660808a2caf26a95/0_0_2048_857/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ducky and Bunny\" width=\"1000\" height=\"418\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A life at the fairground is a tough gig, so it\u2019s no wonder that Ducky and Bunny are so angry</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pixar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Violence is not the answer<br></strong>A life at the fairground is not for everybody, granted, but for Ducky and Bunny, it\u2019s a particularly tough gig.

A bit of talking, a bit of reassuring, and it\u2019s on to the next pressing issue. And guess what, guys? Nobody loves him any less.

It is. At some point in our lives, we\u2019ll all get looked over, we\u2019ll get moved on from, we\u2019ll get knocked down, and we\u2019ll get up again. Let\u2019s take Woody as our case study. His fear of abandonment by Andy is so all-consuming in the original Toy Story, it nearly becomes his undoing. Fast forward to the fourth film, and he\u2019s actively embracing the usurper \u2013 giving Bonnie the tools she needs to make Forky, and giving Forky the tools he needs to be Bonnie\u2019s favourite, embracing a life on the open road, eschewing the trappings of ownership to lead an existence unhindered by the societal norms he\u2019s been so reliant upon. In essence, he is free. So yes, abandonment is inevitable, and it may be what breaks us but, as Woody so valiantly shows us in his journey through all four films, it\u2019s really also what makes us.</p> <p><em>Toy Story 4 is available on digital download (</em><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Toy-Story-Tom-Hanks-Woody/dp/B07TK1Y4PC/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Toy+Story+4&amp;\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prime Video</a>, <a href=\"https://www.skystore.com/boxset/movies/toy-story-4/b087a119-27f8-4d1a-acef-56f41603db27\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sky Store</a>, <a href=\"https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/toy-story-4/id1467478378?mt=6&amp;at=10lt9W\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apple TV</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=Toy%20Story%204&amp;c=movies\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Play</a>) from 14 October</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "School offers fundamental lessons \u2013 for example, how would you function as an adult if you weren\u2019t taught to use a compass to draw a perfect circle in your maths class? But it\u2019s the lessons that come from unexpected places that often have the most impact. So as Toy Story 4 is released on digital download, we look at what this beloved film series has taught us over the years. Good things come to those who wait They really do. Just ask Bo Peep. A classic character case of the undeveloped love interest, with less than 10 minutes\u2019 total airtime in the first two movies, in which she pretty much acts solely as Woody\u2019s therapist, talking him off the toy shelf when he\u2019s ranting about rejection, and then what thanks does she get? She gets written out of Toy Story 3 entirely. Jeez, give the girl a break. But, like a phoenix from the flames, in Toy Story 4, she\u2019s back! She\u2019s independent, she\u2019s brave, she\u2019s a leader, she\u2019s the only toy to ever make Woody question his allegiance to a kid. As far as toys go, she\u2019s basically blossomed into Beyonc\u00e9. Recycling is your friend Forky\u2019s existential crisis on the journey from trash to treasure is an excellent lesson for all of us who live in fear of the council rejecting our recycling efforts. Is it plastic? Is it not? For the love of God, why is it so hard? But, you see, recycling doesn\u2019t just mean a trip to the green bin, it means upcycling too. It means getting all Blue Peter with a bit of sticky-back plastic and a marker pen, and turning sporks into Forkies. An excellent lesson in materialism while we\u2019re at it, and a pertinent reminder to all of us who have ever bought a child a toy they wanted for months, only to find it\u2019s the box that holds the greatest joy, that sometimes the best things in life really are free. Listen to yourself. And Mariah Carey The truth is out there. Well, more specifically, the truth is in there. As in, inside you, you just have to ask yourself the right questions to find it. Like Buzz does. What with Woody having proved himself to be the natural team leader in the toy box, Buzz hasn\u2019t really ever had to think like a boss, has he? He\u2019s been a great sidekick, a kickass friend, but a captain? Nah, not so much. But in Toy Story 4, being the boss is exactly what he needs to do. He needs to take control and be the spaceman we all know he can be. And so, under the advice of Woody, he listens to his inner voice. He accesses his conscience and he finds himself able. The lesson? It\u2019s a good one. Leadership may not come naturally to all of us, but if you really search inside yourself, you\u2019ll find it. It\u2019s probably best we hand over to Mariah Carey to wrap this one up. \u201cWhen you feel like hope is gone, look inside you and be strong, and you\u2019ll finally see the truth, that a hero lies in you.\u201d Preach. You are more than your social media presence OK, so we can\u2019t really use the Instagram v Reality conundrum here, because Duke Caboom is a toy, and toys don\u2019t have social media, silly, but bear with us. Duke Caboom, Canada\u2019s greatest stuntman, has trouble believing he actually is Canada\u2019s greatest stuntman after his own reality fails to live up to the Duke Caboom reality presented in his TV advert (AKA a toy\u2019s version of living your best life on social media). What\u2019s presented to the public is not what he sees in himself. He can\u2019t jump that high \u2026 He can\u2019t do those tricks \u2026 But after a swift talking to from his friends, a bit of self-belief, and a shedding of his innermost fears, Duke Caboom proves who he is really is good enough. Side note: character likeability definitely improves when voiced by the internet\u2019s boyfriend, Keanu Reeves. Violence is not the answer A life at the fairground is not for everybody, granted, but for Ducky and Bunny, it\u2019s a particularly tough gig. A petri dish of jealousy, and a constant culture of competition, where the top spot is the only spot to even slightly guarantee your way into a kid\u2019s life, it\u2019s no wonder that Ducky and Bunny\u2019s go-to reaction is aggression. But, namaste, little pals, let\u2019s all do a little deep breathing and remember that friendships are the ships that never sink. Let those other toys into your life and, well, do you actually even need a kid after all? It\u2019s good to talk Neuroses, huh? We\u2019ve all got them. Anxieties that won\u2019t be quashed, no matter how much mindfulness you practise. But, the truth is, a problem\u2019s only going to get bigger unless you share it. Look at Rex. I mean, it\u2019s no wonder the big guy\u2019s paranoid \u2013 his whole race became extinct and now those climate change deniers are going to take us all down a second time, but Rex knows it\u2019s not going to get any better if he bottles it all up. A bit of talking, a bit of reassuring, and it\u2019s on to the next pressing issue. And guess what, guys? Nobody loves him any less. The toys are still his biggest cheerleaders, the viewers still root for him every film. So next time you have an issue burning you up inside, don\u2019t bottle it up, talk it through. Be more Rex. Abandonment is inevitable Yeah, that\u2019s a pretty dark way to end a feature about what is ostensibly a children\u2019s franchise but, dear reader, it\u2019s a necessary truth. It is. At some point in our lives, we\u2019ll all get looked over, we\u2019ll get moved on from, we\u2019ll get knocked down, and we\u2019ll get up again. Let\u2019s take Woody as our case study. His fear of abandonment by Andy is so all-consuming in the original Toy Story, it nearly becomes his undoing. Fast forward to the fourth film, and he\u2019s actively embracing the usurper \u2013 giving Bonnie the tools she needs to make Forky, and giving Forky the tools he needs to be Bonnie\u2019s favourite, embracing a life on the open road, eschewing the trappings of ownership to lead an existence unhindered by the societal norms he\u2019s been so reliant upon. In essence, he is free. So yes, abandonment is inevitable, and it may be what breaks us but, as Woody so valiantly shows us in his journey through all four films, it\u2019s really also what makes us. Toy Story 4 is available on digital download (Prime Video, Sky Store, Apple TV and Google Play) from 14 October",

The Eritrean was supposed to be the first human trafficker to be extradited from Africa and was regarded as an \u201cAl Capone of the desert\u201d by the authorities.</p> <p>But within a few hours of the arrest being announced, hundreds of Mered\u2019s victims were claiming the wrong man had been detained. Far from being a notorious people smuggler, Berhe earned his living working on a dairy farm and occasionally as a carpenter. What\u2019s more, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/19/not-my-brother-italian-court-told-defendant-is-not-eritrean-smuggler\">Berhe did not even resemble the trafficker Mered</a>, whose picture the prosecutors had released to the press.</p> <p>The judges at the court of assizes highlighted \u201cserious neglect\u201d on the part of investigators, with reference in particular to a Facebook chat between Mered\u2019s wife, Lidya Tesfu, and Berhe.</p> <p>Although the two never met, Berhe once flirted with her via Facebook. Tesfu told him she was married, but when Berhe continued to contact her she said: \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone but my husband\u201d.</p> <p>However, when the prosecutors filed the chat into evidence, they neglected everything except Tesfu\u2019s final message, which created the impression she was married to Berhe and was missing him.</p> <p>In their judicial report, the judges stressed that the chat \u201cemphasised by the prosecutors since the beginning of this trial, represents, on the contrary, a clear sign on the part of the woman to decline the man\u2019s attempts to flirt with her\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFailing to produce the rest of the chat except the line \u2018I don\u2019t need anyone but my husband\u2019 was, according to the judges, a serious neglect,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>The Guardian investigated the case, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/nov/22/people-smuggling-suspect-sends-facebook-message-that-man-on-trial-is-not-him\">uncovering new witnesses and documents</a> which were partially produced on Wednesday by the judges.

      "bodyText": "Italian investigators who pursued a case against an Eritrean man accused of being one of the world\u2019s most-wanted human traffickers in a case of mistaken identity were guilty of \u201cserious neglect\u201d, judges in Sicily have said. In a 400-page judicial report, the court of assizes traced the three-year ordeal of Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe, a 30-year-old refugee released from an Italian jail in July. According to the judges, the prosecutors\u2019 accusations \u201cappeared patently inconsistent and inadequate\u2019\u2019, adding that, in some instances, the accusations against Berhe were \u201cdubious on a logical and conceptual level\u201d. The arrest of Berhe in 2016 was presented to the press as a brilliant coup by Italian and British authorities, who mistook him for Medhanie Yehdego Mered, AKA \u201cthe General\u201d, a smuggling kingpin. The Eritrean was supposed to be the first human trafficker to be extradited from Africa and was regarded as an \u201cAl Capone of the desert\u201d by the authorities. But within a few hours of the arrest being announced, hundreds of Mered\u2019s victims were claiming the wrong man had been detained. Far from being a notorious people smuggler, Berhe earned his living working on a dairy farm and occasionally as a carpenter. What\u2019s more, Berhe did not even resemble the trafficker Mered, whose picture the prosecutors had released to the press. The judges at the court of assizes highlighted \u201cserious neglect\u201d on the part of investigators, with reference in particular to a Facebook chat between Mered\u2019s wife, Lidya Tesfu, and Berhe. Although the two never met, Berhe once flirted with her via Facebook. Tesfu told him she was married, but when Berhe continued to contact her she said: \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone but my husband\u201d. However, when the prosecutors filed the chat into evidence, they neglected everything except Tesfu\u2019s final message, which created the impression she was married to Berhe and was missing him. In their judicial report, the judges stressed that the chat \u201cemphasised by the prosecutors since the beginning of this trial, represents, on the contrary, a clear sign on the part of the woman to decline the man\u2019s attempts to flirt with her\u201d. \u201cFailing to produce the rest of the chat except the line \u2018I don\u2019t need anyone but my husband\u2019 was, according to the judges, a serious neglect,\u201d the report said. The Guardian investigated the case, uncovering new witnesses and documents which were partially produced on Wednesday by the judges. They included private messages sent from the real trafficker\u2019s Facebook account, in which Mered, still at large, said another Eritrean man \u2013 Berhe \u2013 had been arrested in his place. Berhe spent more than three years in jail and was granted refugee status one month after his release in July. Michele Calantropo, Berhe\u2019s lawyer, told the Guardian: \u201cFinally, after three years, the court has undeniably recognised the case of mistaken identity, but this story won\u2019t be over until they clear Berhe\u2019s name.\u201d Berhe was cleared of trafficking but found guilty of the lesser charge of aiding illegal immigration, for having helped his cousins reach Libya. Because he had already spent three years in jail, the judge ordered his immediate release. Berhe\u2019s defence lawyer has said he will appeal against the conviction. \u201cHelping family members during the desert trip is perfectly normal in Africa,\u201d said Calantropo. \u201cPlus, my client did not receive a penny for this help offered to his cousins.\u201d To date, the prosecutors and the British National Crime Agency have never admitted their responsibilities in the mistaken identity case.",

And you know what, she did it at the same time as raising four boys under the age of 10. Clint Eastwood, Charles Bronson \u2013 absolute amateurs. Take a look at <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059578/\" title=\"\">For a Few Dollars More</a>. I don\u2019t see Lee Van Cleef having to find everyone\u2019s school shoes and bags and inhalers and Vikings projects and spare pants before he even has two minutes to himself, four hours after he got up, to think about hunting down the man responsible for his sister\u2019s death. For Lee, it\u2019s just a stiff drink at the saloon, then off to work. Essentially, it\u2019s a movie about not being able to multi-task.</p> <p>So, Coleen: what a swashbuckler. Her killer payoff recalls the bit in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/nov/09/favourite-film-princess-bride\" title=\"\">The Princess Bride</a> where Mandy Patinkin\u2019s character finally meets the six-fingered man who killed his father, and utters the line he has been preparing for years. \u201cMy name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\u201d Then again. \u201cMy name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\u201d And so on and so on, as vengeance is his. Only instead of that, I picture Coleen winking her eyelash extensions at Rebekah, drawing her sword and smiling: \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u2026.. Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account. It\u2019s\u2026..\u2026.

I don\u2019t care if Rebekah is four years older than Coleen: if she wasn\u2019t in Baden-Baden she\u2019ll never really understand. The 2006 World Cup was the \u2019Nam of It-bags and hair extensions, and every true Wag succubus was forged in its fires. It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/jun/23/fashion.worldcup2006\" title=\"\">where I saw Victoria Beckham wearing high heels IN a swimming pool</a>. It was where I watched Elen Rives dance on a bar table singing I Will Survive. It was where a slightly delayed flight forced Victoria to observe to the FA: \u201cA dog gets better treatment than this.\u201d It was where Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson was still giving players \u2013 billeted in another hotel \u2013 what was known in tabloid terms as a \u201cnookie pass\u201d. THAT is heritage. You can\u2019t buy it, even if \u2013 as Rebekah\u2019s denial put it \u2013 \u201cnot being funny but I don\u2019t need the money\u201d. Fast-forward to the present day, and the Baden-Baden Wag fellowship \u2013 though dispersed \u2013 remain bonded by their shared experience. You\u2019ll know the trash is really being taken out when Alex Gerrard flings open the door of her Overfinch Range Rover in Glasgow, where Stevie G now manages, to reveal vintage Juicy Couture tracksuit bottoms and a tiny T-shirt reading: \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u2026. Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u201d</p> <p>As for Rebekah\u2026. well, it\u2019s not looking great, let\u2019s be honest. <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/nicola-mclean-says-rebekah-vardy-20550878\" title=\"\">She\u2019s got Nicola McLean batting for her</a>, though seasoned Wag-watchers would class Nicola as \u201ca complete \u2018who?\u2019\u201d. But Rebekah denies it utterly, so we\u2019ll see what the crack team of IT experts turn up. My guess is that we might learn of some assistant \u2013 since departed \u2013 who must be behind it all. Then again it does feel hugely remiss that no one has yet suggested Russian interference. In so many ways, Putin getting all up in Wag Instagram would be the highest level of his troll strategy \u2013 the surest indication yet that he truly means to destroy our way of life. If I were Rebekah, I would feel inclined to suggest that the choice of platform lends significant weight to that theory. Only this week, the US Senate investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/russias-disinformation-war-is-just-getting-started/\" title=\"\">released the second volume of its report</a>, which said: \u201cOn the basis of engagement and audience following measures, the Instagram social media platform was the most effective tool used by the [Russian-backed] Internet Research Agency to conduct its information operations campaign.\u201d</p> <p>On the other hand, it would be the only disinformation campaign to sow unity as opposed to discord. Not that this has been noticed by Truss, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-49997189/colleen-rooney-rebekah-vardy-instagram-row-makes-it-into-liz-truss-speech\" title=\"\">who brought up the story in a speech on Wednesday night</a>. \u201cThere\u2019s been a massive fallout between some very influential figures in our country,\u201d the trade secretary told her audience, \u201cthat has divided the nation.\u201d It has united it, but go on. \u201cThere\u2019s been finger-pointing, there\u2019s been blame-shifting, and there has been denials. But enough about Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy. Now for those of you who don\u2019t know, those are footballers\u2019 wives \u2013 \u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/09/coleen-rooney-rebekah-vardy-twitter-wag-wars\">How Coleen Rooney created the best day on Twitter of all time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve got to draw a veil there.

Do you remember this one? Following Leicester\u2019s miracle Premier League-winning season in 2016, there was a whole series of stories which claimed there was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/entertainment-arts-36918488/jamie-vardy-movie-taking-shape\" title=\"\">going to be a Hollywood movie about Jamie Vardy</a>. (I do hope they originated on Coleen\u2019s private Instagram account, but I accept you can\u2019t have it all.) At the time, it was being described as a Jamie Vardy biopic, which had \u201cGary Barlow investment vehicle\u201d written all over it. But now \u2013 well!</p> <p>Surely it has to be back on \u2013 and it has to be directed by Oliver Stone. Sources tell me Oliver was on the phone late into last night, pacing his Californian study, having obviously sided with Rebekah. \u201cRight?! Right?! It\u2019s her \u2018account\u2019. ANYONE COULD HAVE HAD ACCESS. I don\u2019t buy the official story at all. This REEKS of Langley\u2026.. and you know, that\u2019s just the start of the conspiracy\u2026..\u201d</p>",

I don\u2019t see Lee Van Cleef having to find everyone\u2019s school shoes and bags and inhalers and Vikings projects and spare pants before he even has two minutes to himself, four hours after he got up, to think about hunting down the man responsible for his sister\u2019s death. For Lee, it\u2019s just a stiff drink at the saloon, then off to work. Essentially, it\u2019s a movie about not being able to multi-task. So, Coleen: what a swashbuckler. Her killer payoff recalls the bit in The Princess Bride where Mandy Patinkin\u2019s character finally meets the six-fingered man who killed his father, and utters the line he has been preparing for years. \u201cMy name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\u201d Then again. \u201cMy name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\u201d And so on and so on, as vengeance is his. Only instead of that, I picture Coleen winking her eyelash extensions at Rebekah, drawing her sword and smiling: \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u2026.. Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account. It\u2019s\u2026..\u2026. Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account. It\u2019s\u2026\u2026.. Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account. It\u2019s\u2026\u2026. Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u201d As for the wider cultural context, let me be super clear: this is about heritage Wags coming together and closing ranks against second-gen interlopers. I don\u2019t care if Rebekah is four years older than Coleen: if she wasn\u2019t in Baden-Baden she\u2019ll never really understand. The 2006 World Cup was the \u2019Nam of It-bags and hair extensions, and every true Wag succubus was forged in its fires. It was where I saw Victoria Beckham wearing high heels IN a swimming pool. It was where I watched Elen Rives dance on a bar table singing I Will Survive. It was where a slightly delayed flight forced Victoria to observe to the FA: \u201cA dog gets better treatment than this.\u201d It was where Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson was still giving players \u2013 billeted in another hotel \u2013 what was known in tabloid terms as a \u201cnookie pass\u201d. THAT is heritage. You can\u2019t buy it, even if \u2013 as Rebekah\u2019s denial put it \u2013 \u201cnot being funny but I don\u2019t need the money\u201d. Fast-forward to the present day, and the Baden-Baden Wag fellowship \u2013 though dispersed \u2013 remain bonded by their shared experience. You\u2019ll know the trash is really being taken out when Alex Gerrard flings open the door of her Overfinch Range Rover in Glasgow, where Stevie G now manages, to reveal vintage Juicy Couture tracksuit bottoms and a tiny T-shirt reading: \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u2026. Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u201d As for Rebekah\u2026. well, it\u2019s not looking great, let\u2019s be honest. She\u2019s got Nicola McLean batting for her, though seasoned Wag-watchers would class Nicola as \u201ca complete \u2018who?\u2019\u201d. But Rebekah denies it utterly, so we\u2019ll see what the crack team of IT experts turn up. My guess is that we might learn of some assistant \u2013 since departed \u2013 who must be behind it all. Then again it does feel hugely remiss that no one has yet suggested Russian interference. In so many ways, Putin getting all up in Wag Instagram would be the highest level of his troll strategy \u2013 the surest indication yet that he truly means to destroy our way of life. If I were Rebekah, I would feel inclined to suggest that the choice of platform lends significant weight to that theory. Only this week, the US Senate investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election released the second volume of its report, which said: \u201cOn the basis of engagement and audience following measures, the Instagram social media platform was the most effective tool used by the [Russian-backed] Internet Research Agency to conduct its information operations campaign.\u201d On the other hand, it would be the only disinformation campaign to sow unity as opposed to discord. Not that this has been noticed by Truss, who brought up the story in a speech on Wednesday night. \u201cThere\u2019s been a massive fallout between some very influential figures in our country,\u201d the trade secretary told her audience, \u201cthat has divided the nation.\u201d It has united it, but go on. \u201cThere\u2019s been finger-pointing, there\u2019s been blame-shifting, and there has been denials. But enough about Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy. Now for those of you who don\u2019t know, those are footballers\u2019 wives \u2013 \u201d I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve got to draw a veil there. HOW DID SHE MISS??? Literally the worst use of an open goal since Diana Ross\u2019s spot kick in the 1994 World Cup opening ceremony. The only positive for Liz is that international media, from the New York Times to far beyond, have covered the Coleen/Rebekah story. So when all the rest of our trade goes tits-up, Liz can at least bank on the fact we export beef. In terms of other cultural exports, let\u2019s hope all this means the Jamie Vardy movie has legs again. Do you remember this one? Following Leicester\u2019s miracle Premier League-winning season in 2016, there was a whole series of stories which claimed there was going to be a Hollywood movie about Jamie Vardy. (I do hope they originated on Coleen\u2019s private Instagram account, but I accept you can\u2019t have it all.) At the time, it was being described as a Jamie Vardy biopic, which had \u201cGary Barlow investment vehicle\u201d written all over it. But now \u2013 well! Surely it has to be back on \u2013 and it has to be directed by Oliver Stone. Sources tell me Oliver was on the phone late into last night, pacing his Californian study, having obviously sided with Rebekah. \u201cRight?! Right?! It\u2019s her \u2018account\u2019. ANYONE COULD HAVE HAD ACCESS. I don\u2019t buy the official story at all. This REEKS of Langley\u2026.. and you know, that\u2019s just the start of the conspiracy\u2026..\u201d",

But the vast majority of it is either not recycled, unrecyclable, or doesn't get reused once it's been recycled. Volumes ending up in the natural environment are surging. Plastic can take as much as 500 years to decompose.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the implications?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Plastic is ubiquitous \u2013 and often deadly. It kills sea creatures that eat it but cannot digest it. It gets into the human food chain by contaminating the fish that we eat. It is even in our tap water. There is no science about the long-term impact of humans ingesting plastic.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is to be done?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Taxing plastic bags \u2013 or even banning them outright as Kenya has done \u2013 has changed consumer and producer behaviour. But what next? Deposit return schemes for plastic bottles work well in several countries. Charging for one-time coffee cups also seems to be on the agenda. But the real solutions may not be top down but ...<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>... bottom up?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Yes. Grassroots movements led the way on plastic bags, and have spawned others such as Refill, which emphasises reusing bottles, and A Plastic Planet, which urges plastic-free aisles in supermarkets. Popular culture remains hugely important: it's just possible that the British series The Blue Planet has changed attitudes overnight.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Plastic is also heavily polluting Italy\u2019s lakes. \u201cI was in Lake Como recently and discovered the lake is the most polluted in Europe with microplastic,\u201d said Pellegrino. \u201cPlastic is a real problem and needs to be addressed very soon.\u201d </p> \n<p>Pollution is another major issue, especially in Italy\u2019s northern cities.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar have emerged from their meeting saying \u201cthey could see a pathway to a possible deal\u201d. Here we take a look at what their joint statement said, and what it might mean. The prime minister and taoiseach have had a detailed and constructive discussion. \u201cDetailed\u201d and \u201cconstructive\u201d are the key words, and are positive. Both continue to believe that a deal is in everybody\u2019s interest. They agreed that they could see a pathway to a possible deal. The first sentence does not amount to much, because it is what all sides have always said from the moment the Brexit talks started. The second sentence is the most significant, and the one that has sent the pound upwards. It is more positive than people were expecting, and implies that the Brexit talks are now at least off their deathbed. Does it mean much more than that? We don\u2019t know. It is worth noting that there are two qualifiers in this sentence: \u201cThey agreed that they could see a pathway to a possible deal.\u201d Does it mean they are both looking at the same path? No one has ever had problems imagining a possible deal, or a pathway to it. The trouble has been finding one acceptable to all veto players in this process: the EU, Ireland, parliament, the Conservative party, the European Research Group of hardline Tory Brexiters and the Democratic Unionist party. Their discussion concentrated on the challenges of customs and consent. That is no surprise, because these are the two main features of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan identified as unacceptable by Dublin and Brussels. They also discussed the potential to strengthen bilateral relations, including on Northern Ireland. It is not clear what this refers to, although the UK government quite often talks about the desirability of improving bilateral relations with Dublin, particularly when they are under strain. They agreed to reflect further on their discussions and that officials would continue to engage intensively on them. This sentence is positive: \u201creflect further\u201d means no one will be pulling the plug on the talks process today, and the reference to officials implies they have some new ideas to discuss. Following their discussions the taoiseach will consult with the taskforce 50, and the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, will meet [the EU\u2019s chief negotiator] Michel Barnier tomorrow morning. Barclay and Barnier were originally due to meet on Thursday, but that meeting got put back until Friday. There were some suggestions that, if today went badly, it would be cancelled. The fact it is going ahead means neither side wants to give up yet.",

Sir Henry Nelthorpe and his Second Wife Elizabeth, painted by the young Stubbs in about 1748, look waxy and dead.

      "bodyText": "The two British Isis members accused of involvement in the beheading of western hostages are being taken to Iraq by the US military as the Turkish offensive in north-east Syria enters its second day. Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh were members of a British group of Isis militants known as \u201cthe Beatles\u201d. They were seized overnight, with lawyers predicting that their transfer to Iraq would be a precursor to them being taken to the United States. Details remain sketchy, but western officials confirmed that the two Britons have been taken across the border, after previously being held in detention by Syrian Kurdish forces, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Overnight, Donald Trump announced that the two had been moved, tweeting: The two are understood to be part of a larger group moved by the US, with some reports saying it numbered around 40 Isis fighters. Earlier, Trump had said the US had \u201ctaken a certain number of Isis fighters that are particularly bad, and we\u2019ve wanted to make sure that nothing happened with them with respect to getting out\u201d. The duo were part of a group of four who are accused of being involved in the apparently filmed beheadings of British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning and US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. James Foley\u2019s mother, Diane, said on Thursday she hoped that they would face prosecution in the US. \u201cWe need some semblance of justice for the horrific execution and torture of the Americans,\u201d Foley told the Associated Press. Clive Stafford Smith, a human rights lawyer, said: \u201cI think Iraq is a stopping point, and they are heading for Virginia in the United States, where they will very likely face a death penalty trial.\u201d The UK does not normally allows its citizens to be extradited if they will face a death penalty charge, but when he was home secretary, Sajid Javid said he would not longer seek such assurances from the US in the cases of Kotey and Elsheikh. Elsheikh\u2019s mother challenged that decision, taking her case to the supreme court in London, to try to prevent the two men being extradited to the US and instead put on trial in their home country. Judgment in that case is awaited. Stafford Smith said that taking prisoners across a border without due process amounted to an illegal rendition, but the lawyer, who has acted in a string of Guant\u00e1namo Bay cases, said he believed the US would allow a trial to go ahead. \u201cKidnapping people is illegal, but the question is whether that will be enforceable in the US courts,\u201d he said. Overnight Trump said that he had spoken to the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, on the subject of Isis prisoners, but did not say whether he was referring to Kotey and Elsheikh. There were also indications that the UK had been briefed in advance of the US operation, although a Home Office spokesperson said on Thursday: \u201cIt would be inappropriate to comment whilst legal proceedings are ongoing.\u201d The other members of the \u201cBeatles\u201d group included its leader, Mohammed Emwazi, who was killed in a US drone strike in 2015, and Aine Davis, who was caught in Turkey and jailed for seven and half years in 2017 for being a member of a terrorist organisation. Estimates vary about the number of foreign Isis fighters held by the SDF, but there are at least 1,000 and potentially double that. There are also an estimated 10,000 or so Isis fighters from Syria and Iraq being held. Many of the jails are near the border, although SDF sources denied reports that the prisons had been hit by Turkish shells. Attacks had taken place in the immediate vicinity, they said. Security sources estimate there are around 30 Britons held in Isis jails, and the UK has largely pursued a policy of ignoring them. It argues that they travelled at their own risk to Syria, a country where there has been no consular support since the start of the civil war in 2011. One of those held is Jack Letts, who was raised in Oxfordshire and fled to join Isis before he was picked up in 2017. His British citizenship was stripped by the UK government over the summer, leaving him with his Canadian nationality inherited from his father. His situation is unclear. Turkey\u2019s ambassador to the UK, \u00dcmit Yal\u00e7\u0131n, said that Turkey was committed to the fight against what he described as the terrorists of Isis and the Syrian Kurds, and said that if Turkish forces were to take control of Isis prisoners, Ankara would seek to return them to their country of origin. \u201cWe need a sustainable solution for all foreign fighters. Nobody can wash their hands of them,\u201d he added. Some of the prisons, such as in the administrative centre of Qamishli are close to the Turkish border and well within any 50 mile exclusion zone. Former MI6 chief Sir John Sawers said the British government had allowed the situation to fester, and the two \u2018Beatles\u2019 should be put on trial in the UK, rather than be taken to the US. \u201cFrankly, it was only ever a temporary solution to leave them in a camp in the desert in Syria. I think, ultimately, they ought really to be brought back to their home countries to face justice here,\u201d the ex spy chief said. There had been repeated warnings that the Turkish invasion meant Isis fighters could end up being released by one of the parties to the looming conflict, but Trump\u2019s words suggest that the US intends to mitigate some of that risk.

      "bodyText": "Labour has failed to increase its vote share in two dozen council byelections across the country stretching back more than two months, a polling analyst has said, indicating the potentially difficult task ahead for the party at the next general election. The last time Labour\u2019s vote share rose was on 8 August, and since then the party has failed to match this in 24 other seats, including key marginals such as Worcester, Ipswich, Canterbury and Crawley, according to the analysis by Robert Hayward. Hayward, who is a Conservative peer but also a well-known elections analyst, said that while local factors often skewed individual council byelections, the number of seats and the range of locations \u2013 in Scotland and Wales as well as England \u2013 seemed to point to a pattern. \u201cIt is an indication of the scale of the problem that they are facing,\u201d Hayward said. \u201cWe know about the Tories. All the attention has been on the Tories, but I think these figures highlight the sheer volatility of the voters in relation to Labour support.\u201d In recent national polling, Labour has tended to be behind the Conservatives by some way, on about 24% or slightly more. The party was also polling weakly before the 2017 general election, but recovered to deny Theresa May a majority. Hayward\u2019s analysis showed there had been 28 council byelections since 8 August, when Labour last increased its vote share, in a Northamptonshire district council seat. Of these 28, Labour did not contest two, and in two more had not contested the previous time. But of the other 24, the party\u2019s vote share dropped compared with the previous time the councillor who created the vacancy was elected, the standard metric Hayward uses. Areas where the Labour vote dropped included seats the party won in 2017 and would hope to hold, such as Canterbury, Ipswich and Cardiff North, and Labour target seats such as Crawley and Worcester. In one byelection in Cambridge, the swing to the Liberal Democrats was so big that if replicated in the parliamentary constituency, the Lib Dems would take it from Labour, despite the current 12,000-plus Labour majority. During this run, Labour gained a council seat from the Conservatives, in Luton, but only because the Tory vote dropped even more than that of Labour. Overall, in the same period, the Conservatives contested 28 seats, with the party\u2019s vote share increasing in 14 and dropping in 14. Hayward said: \u201cIt\u2019s come as a surprise to me, the extent of the challenge, that there should have been all these byelections in the last two months, and in not one of the places has the Labour party actually gone up from their previous contestation percentage. \u201cOf course, Labour entered 2017 in a very bad position and had done even worse in the local elections, and then did remarkably well in the general election.

Channon was, I think, harping on about a system England should employ. \u2018The Irish have done it,\u2019 he declared, \u2018the French do it, the Germans do it \u2026\u2019 Then Brian Clough interjected: \u2018Even educated bees do it.\u2019 And, yes, it should have been \u2018fleas\u2019, but for an impromptu line, give the great man a break\u201d \u2013 Jay Soffe. \u201cI was interested to read Des McManus about Joe Mercer\u2019s pronunciations (yesterday\u2019s letters). I remember from the 1960s that Joe used to pronounce Pel\u00e9\u2019s name as \u2018Peelee\u2019. Heaven knows what he would do with the most recent addition to Arsenal\u2019s midfield\u201d \u2013 Tony Timms. \u201cIf memory serves, Teddy Sheringham once pulled off a rare triple whammy of lazy punditry when discussing the Dutch midfielder Jan Wouters. He opted for \u2018Jan Waaa\u2019ers\u2019 in broad C0ckney, impressively managing to misprounounce the J, W, and T in one swoop\u201d \u2013 Mike Hopkin. \u201cSurely there can be only one winner. The award simply must go to a man who, while managing Newcastle, couldn\u2019t even get his own players\u2019 names right, including \u2018Ben Afri\u2019 and the belting \u2018Yohan Kebab\u2019.

Scotland boss Steve Clarke reckons Russia offer the ideal blueprint for his team to follow. \u201cThere was a time when there was a disconnect between the Russian fans and the Russian team and now they have that togetherness,\u201d he cheered. \u201cHopefully we can build that with the Scottish fans and find ourselves taking part in a tournament that some part of it is going to be in Scotland.\u201d And Cambridge United striker Jabo Ibehre faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines after an infected cut resulted in knee surgery.

Vardy, who was on holiday in Dubai with her footballer husband, Jamie, when the story broke, has denied claims that she provided the stories to the newspaper \u2013 despite apparently being caught in an elaborate sting operation that involved Rooney posting fake updates to see which appeared in the media. She denies involvement, although her Instagram account already followed two of the Sun journalists who authored the disputed articles. The Sun has run dozens of stories about Vardy in recent months, many of them exclusive and some of which were bylined by the same reporters who wrote the stories about Rooney, which were allegedly based on false information. The paper has not officially commented on the stories, although it covered the row on its front page on Thursday and has emphasised that it followed standard journalistic practice in putting all the apparently fake stories to Rooney\u2019s representatives before publication with a request for comment. One source at the newspaper insisted they had not paid Vardy for stories about Coleen Rooney, although this does not rule out the possibility of another arrangement. The dispute shines a light on tabloid practices at an unwelcome time for the Sun, which is already having to deal with its publisher, News Group Newspapers, being sued by Prince Harry for alleged phone-hacking offences. It also highlights how celebrities are increasingly able \u2013 and willing \u2013 to circumvent traditional media outlets and take them on directly. Rooney, the wife of footballer Wayne, has been dubbed \u201cWAGatha Christie\u201d for her role in the investigation, after the \u201cwives and girlfriends\u201d moniker that was given to the partners of England footballers at the 2006 World Cup.

As the messages from the party and its allies in the media and clergy become ever stronger in tone, it runs a greater risk of alienating more moderate voters.</p> <p>With figures such as the party president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/05/family-faith-flag-catholic-religious-right-battle-polands-soul\" title=\"\">Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski</a>, reminding us that his party exclusively recognises families as \u201cone man, one woman and children\u201d, it is clearly not aiming to soften its rhetoric yet. But then, it has never pretended to be a party that works for everyone: instead it has identified a specific base of supporters and cornered their vote through smart, if occasionally cynical, campaigning and largely delivering on electoral pledges. Schemes such as the <a href=\"https://www.pap.pl/en/news/news%2C438289%2Cgovt-passes-draft-law-payment-500-benefit-first-child.html\" title=\"\">500 Plus child benefit package</a>, offering 500 z\u0142oty (\u00a3103) each month for every child after the family\u2019s first, have genuinely improved the lives of people in parts of the country that previous Polish governments had stopped even paying lip service to, and have begun to more evenly distribute the country\u2019s growing wealth for the first time since EU accession in 2004.</p> <p>For the last four years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/20/poland-opposition-europe-macron-eu\" title=\"\">Civic Platform</a> (PO) \u2013 the mainstream opposition party, which governed between 2007 and 2015 \u2013 has had a clear strategy for re-election. It has poured its energy into attacking Law and Justice\u2019s judicial and constitutional reforms, leading the Campaign to Defend Democracy in order to underline the supposed dangers of these changes. Yet that approach has had little success beyond PO\u2019s natural base. Cabinet ministers and pro-government outlets have pointed out, quite accurately, that actions such as appointing sympathetic judges are perfectly in keeping with the behaviour of every previous government. The opposition\u2019s subsequent campaigning has similarly failed to win much support: it has preferred to point out the government\u2019s faults, rather than underlining what it would do to improve the country if given the chance.</p> <p>Law and Justice, for its part, seems happy to campaign on LGBT issues. Just as the 2015 election was marked by strong rhetoric against the EU\u2019s refugee quotas for individual countries \u2013 and indeed, Law and Justice later limited Poland\u2019s resettlement obligation to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6edfdd30-472a-11e5-b3b2-1672f710807b\" title=\"\">just 150, mostly Christian, Syrians </a>\u2013 the government\u2019s determination to promote the family values of the Christian right has encouraged deeper divisions between liberal and conservative-minded people. Some local councils have declared \u201cLGBT-free zones\u201d, which have no real legal implications but have received explicit support from various government figures, and it is hard to escape the sense that many on Poland\u2019s right feel that some citizens just don\u2019t fit into the society they are building.</p> <p>By contrast, a great deal of energy and positivity has been generated by the resurgent left, following campaigns by both the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/21/womens-march-protests-history-suffragettes-iceland-poland\" title=\"\">women\u2019s rights movement</a> against a tightening of abortion laws and, more recently, the LGBT equality marches.

      "bodyText": "In the decades since the end of Communism, Poland has rarely been a country of mass demonstrations. It has never had its equivalent of Ukraine\u2019s Euromaidan, for instance. But the four years since the Law and Justice party (PiS) came to power have been marked by public demonstrations \u2013 from nationalist commemorations of independence day and Catholic-run \u201cmarches for life and family\u201d to LGBT rights parades, pro-choice protests and the Campaign to Defend Democracy\u2019s [KOD] fight against the government\u2019s perceived weakening of the constitution. Sunday\u2019s parliamentary election can be viewed as a test of the relative success of these different campaigns. Despite polling that suggests Law and Justice will secure the best results of any single party in the post-1989 period, there is much to suggest the country is increasingly divided. Law and Justice\u2019s platform is to provide a strong Catholic moral foundation to a programme of social benefits, and it has clearly paid off over the past four years. As the messages from the party and its allies in the media and clergy become ever stronger in tone, it runs a greater risk of alienating more moderate voters. With figures such as the party president, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, reminding us that his party exclusively recognises families as \u201cone man, one woman and children\u201d, it is clearly not aiming to soften its rhetoric yet. But then, it has never pretended to be a party that works for everyone: instead it has identified a specific base of supporters and cornered their vote through smart, if occasionally cynical, campaigning and largely delivering on electoral pledges. Schemes such as the 500 Plus child benefit package, offering 500 z\u0142oty (\u00a3103) each month for every child after the family\u2019s first, have genuinely improved the lives of people in parts of the country that previous Polish governments had stopped even paying lip service to, and have begun to more evenly distribute the country\u2019s growing wealth for the first time since EU accession in 2004. For the last four years, Civic Platform (PO) \u2013 the mainstream opposition party, which governed between 2007 and 2015 \u2013 has had a clear strategy for re-election. It has poured its energy into attacking Law and Justice\u2019s judicial and constitutional reforms, leading the Campaign to Defend Democracy in order to underline the supposed dangers of these changes. Yet that approach has had little success beyond PO\u2019s natural base. Cabinet ministers and pro-government outlets have pointed out, quite accurately, that actions such as appointing sympathetic judges are perfectly in keeping with the behaviour of every previous government. The opposition\u2019s subsequent campaigning has similarly failed to win much support: it has preferred to point out the government\u2019s faults, rather than underlining what it would do to improve the country if given the chance. Law and Justice, for its part, seems happy to campaign on LGBT issues. Just as the 2015 election was marked by strong rhetoric against the EU\u2019s refugee quotas for individual countries \u2013 and indeed, Law and Justice later limited Poland\u2019s resettlement obligation to just 150, mostly Christian, Syrians \u2013 the government\u2019s determination to promote the family values of the Christian right has encouraged deeper divisions between liberal and conservative-minded people. Some local councils have declared \u201cLGBT-free zones\u201d, which have no real legal implications but have received explicit support from various government figures, and it is hard to escape the sense that many on Poland\u2019s right feel that some citizens just don\u2019t fit into the society they are building. By contrast, a great deal of energy and positivity has been generated by the resurgent left, following campaigns by both the women\u2019s rights movement against a tightening of abortion laws and, more recently, the LGBT equality marches. A new party, Spring (Wiosna), has made its name through its tireless campaigning for LGBT rights. It serves as a front for the likable (if slightly bland) Robert Biedro\u0144, Poland\u2019s first openly gay politician, who rose to prominence as the popular mayor of the small northern city of S\u0142upsk. The party\u2019s work deserves respect in a country where far-right Christian terrorists were recently arrested for planning bomb attacks on Lublin\u2019s equality march, and where Biedro\u0144 himself has experienced various acts of homophobic violence. The most effective electoral campaign on the left, however, has been run by Together (Razem), which was founded four years ago in frustration at the conservatism and complacency of the once-governing Left Democratic Alliance [SLD]. A mixture of seasoned campaigners and younger activists energised by this new wave of protest, Together failed to secure the 5% of votes necessary to have representation in the Sejm (the lower house) in 2015. But it still passed the 3% threshold to receive funding from the state, under Poland\u2019s electoral rules, which it has used to build its platform as the country\u2019s first truly modern centre-left party. Now it has formed an electoral alliance with Spring, as well as the somewhat stagnant SLD. Between Together\u2019s campaigning strength and Biedro\u0144\u2019s charisma, the group is increasingly confident that the left will return to the Sejm after a four-year absence. Not that Law and Justice will be worried: it seems almost certain it will be returned to government on Sunday. But therein may lie its ultimate downfall. The party\u2019s enormous success risks instilling the same kind of complacency that brought down its opposition four years ago. Nowhere can a party rule democratically for several terms while making enemies of significant blocs of the population. And the number of Poles declaring themselves atheist is steadily rising; anyone who has joined one of those pro-LGBT marches that took place around the country this summer will have noticed just how young its participants were. Large numbers of these marchers won\u2019t be eligible to vote until the elections in 2024, but that hasn\u2019t stopped them from campaigning and signalling that the country they will inherit will be more open and welcoming. Poland is conservative and Catholic, but also queer, atheist, Jewish, progressive, and many things besides.

Her harp opens every episode of The Simpsons, one of several hundred scores she has worked on including Titanic, Lost and Grease. She has played alongside Judy Garland, spent 22 years in the orchestra for the Academy Awards, and worked on records with Frank Sinatra, Paul McCartney, Joni Mitchell, the Carpenters, Michael Jackson, Lady Gaga and more.

It turns out that Levant has the same Californian heart that beats under Del Rey\u2019s latest record. Brought up in LA, her talent was first spotted when she was three years old and overheard her father \u2013 a concertmaster violinist to several LA studios \u2013 practising at home. When Levant ran to tell her mother that \u201cDaddy played a wrong note!\u201d her parents quickly arranged her first lessons.</p> <p>\u201cMy aspirations were not to be a symphony harpist, but to be a studio recording harpist,\u201d says Levant, who fell in love with the instrument after mastering the piano. \u201cThe wonderful thing about doing studio work is it\u2019s always fresh and new.\u201d She spent her teenage years driving around Hollywood with her six-foot harp on the back seat and recorded her first commercial aged 17. In 1961, she got a phone call that <a href=\"https://mentalfloss.com/article/79531/13-fabulous-facts-about-liberace\" title=\"\">Liberace</a> needed a harpist. \u201cLee loves beautiful dresses,\u201d said Liberace\u2019s musical director Gordon Robinson. \u201cDo you have any formal gowns?\u201d Levant showed up with half a dozen and bagged the job.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ray Charles said: Oh mama, let me hear that harp. I thought I was gonna pass out</p> <footer> <cite>Gayle Levant</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The work started to stack up, including sessions with Ray Charles. \u201cListening to a playback, he says: \u2018Oh mama, let me hear that harp.\u2019 I thought I was gonna pass out.\u201d Pitch-perfect notes are still a must, but Levant has a rarer quality that keeps her phone ringing. \u201cWhen I go into the studio, it\u2019s all about my heart,\u201d she says. \u201cHow can I help? How can I make it better?\u201d</p> <p>At a 1963 Liberace show in Las Vegas, \u201che had a protege that he was introducing and this girl came on the stage in a long, very simple grey dress,\u201d says Levant. \u201cShe opened up her mouth and sang Happy Days Are Here Again. And that was it.\u201d It was Levant\u2019s first impression of Barbra Streisand. Since 1969, she has worked on all of Streisand\u2019s recording projects. During one session, Levant remembers that \u201cBarbra was trying to get a certain feel from the rhythm section. Everybody took a break because she wasn\u2019t hearing what she wanted. I went over to her and I said: \u2018Barb, can I play something for you?\u2019 I went over to play the Fender Rhodes [electric piano] and I said: \u2018Is that the feel you\u2019re looking for?\u2019 She looked at me, threw her hands up and said: \u2018Why does it take a woman to understand me?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Streisand is just one artist who recorded in the studio that Levant opened in 1979 with composer Charles Fox and her former husband, music arranger <a href=\"https://artiebutler.com/\" title=\"\">Artie Butler</a>. Soundtracks recorded within the walls of <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/label/277122-Evergreen-Studios\" title=\"\">Evergreen Studios</a> include Beauty and the Beast, Platoon, and perhaps most fittingly for Levant, The Little Mermaid.</p> <p>In the eyes of Groban, however, Levant isn\u2019t a mermaid, but his orchestra\u2019s very own guardian angel. \u201cGayle has played on almost every album I\u2019ve ever done because it\u2019s never just a gig to her,\u201d he tells me. \u201cBut beyond that, she was one of my first friends in a very intimidating world.

      "bodyText": "In 1965, Cary Grant flew across the Las Vegas desert to dine with a mermaid. It was the opening night for a restaurant named Dome of the Sea, and Grant and his fellow guests were welcomed by a young blonde playing a golden harp as she sailed a seashell boat through a pool of water. There is indeed magic in the strings of Gayle Levant\u2019s harp, but it has reached far beyond her brief stint as a mermaid and into a 60-year career. Her harp opens every episode of The Simpsons, one of several hundred scores she has worked on including Titanic, Lost and Grease. She has played alongside Judy Garland, spent 22 years in the orchestra for the Academy Awards, and worked on records with Frank Sinatra, Paul McCartney, Joni Mitchell, the Carpenters, Michael Jackson, Lady Gaga and more. When a legend needs a harpist, it is Levant they call. \u201cShe plays what you want in a way you never knew you wanted,\u201d says multi-platinum symphonic pop singer Josh Groban. \u201cShe brings a mastery, and outside-the-box creativity, that elevates every session. She\u2019s also an incredible improviser and some songs have been crafted around her playing.\u201d The woman that Nat King Cole nicknamed \u201cLittle Bit\u201d is now 77 and lives in Los Angeles with her husband John Richards, a retired Hollywood sound engineer. \u201cI really am singing through my fingers,\u201d she says, audibly smiling. \u201cIf you breathe in love and play from your heart, you feel satisfaction.\u201d I first contacted Levant when I wondered who was playing the harp in Lana Del Rey\u2019s recent song Doin\u2019 Time \u2013 a moment that wakes a sleeping, 50-foot-tall Del Rey in the video. It turns out that Levant has the same Californian heart that beats under Del Rey\u2019s latest record. Brought up in LA, her talent was first spotted when she was three years old and overheard her father \u2013 a concertmaster violinist to several LA studios \u2013 practising at home. When Levant ran to tell her mother that \u201cDaddy played a wrong note!\u201d her parents quickly arranged her first lessons. \u201cMy aspirations were not to be a symphony harpist, but to be a studio recording harpist,\u201d says Levant, who fell in love with the instrument after mastering the piano. \u201cThe wonderful thing about doing studio work is it\u2019s always fresh and new.\u201d She spent her teenage years driving around Hollywood with her six-foot harp on the back seat and recorded her first commercial aged 17. In 1961, she got a phone call that Liberace needed a harpist. \u201cLee loves beautiful dresses,\u201d said Liberace\u2019s musical director Gordon Robinson. \u201cDo you have any formal gowns?\u201d Levant showed up with half a dozen and bagged the job. The work started to stack up, including sessions with Ray Charles. \u201cListening to a playback, he says: \u2018Oh mama, let me hear that harp.\u2019 I thought I was gonna pass out.\u201d Pitch-perfect notes are still a must, but Levant has a rarer quality that keeps her phone ringing. \u201cWhen I go into the studio, it\u2019s all about my heart,\u201d she says. \u201cHow can I help? How can I make it better?\u201d At a 1963 Liberace show in Las Vegas, \u201che had a protege that he was introducing and this girl came on the stage in a long, very simple grey dress,\u201d says Levant. \u201cShe opened up her mouth and sang Happy Days Are Here Again. And that was it.\u201d It was Levant\u2019s first impression of Barbra Streisand. Since 1969, she has worked on all of Streisand\u2019s recording projects. During one session, Levant remembers that \u201cBarbra was trying to get a certain feel from the rhythm section. Everybody took a break because she wasn\u2019t hearing what she wanted. I went over to her and I said: \u2018Barb, can I play something for you?\u2019 I went over to play the Fender Rhodes [electric piano] and I said: \u2018Is that the feel you\u2019re looking for?\u2019 She looked at me, threw her hands up and said: \u2018Why does it take a woman to understand me?\u2019\u201d Streisand is just one artist who recorded in the studio that Levant opened in 1979 with composer Charles Fox and her former husband, music arranger Artie Butler. Soundtracks recorded within the walls of Evergreen Studios include Beauty and the Beast, Platoon, and perhaps most fittingly for Levant, The Little Mermaid. In the eyes of Groban, however, Levant isn\u2019t a mermaid, but his orchestra\u2019s very own guardian angel. \u201cGayle has played on almost every album I\u2019ve ever done because it\u2019s never just a gig to her,\u201d he tells me. \u201cBut beyond that, she was one of my first friends in a very intimidating world. I\u2019ll never forget her kindness to me, that smile and hug and welcoming, when I was scared to death in those first orchestra sessions. It never gets less intimidating but if I peer over to the corner and see Gayle sitting there, I know there\u2019s love.\u201d Levant can\u2019t imagine working any other way. \u201cI try to share my heart with everybody, whether they need me as a friend or they just they want me musically,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m just living in gratitude. I\u2019d love for future generations, when they look back on their lives, to have their hearts so full.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>James Cellan Jones, who has died aged 88, was one of the outstanding directors and producers of British television drama during the postwar era. His single plays, series and serials, from the 1960s to the late 90s, included seven of the 26 episodes of The Forsyte Saga, televised by the BBC in 1967 and watched by audiences of up to 18 million each Sunday night.</p> <p>The show was also an international success, viewed by around 100 million people in 26 countries, and set the stage for a long line of period TV dramas to follow, including Jim\u2019s own seven-hour production of Olivia Manning\u2019s Fortunes of War (1987), which made international stars of Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson.</p> <p>For three fruitful years in the late 70s Jim was head of the BBC\u2019s television play output, sponsoring and commissioning various notable dramas and series, including Dennis Potter\u2019s Pennies from Heaven, before returning to the fray to direct many more TV films, series and even a sitcom.</p> <p>Born in Swansea, Jim was the son of Cecil Cellan Jones, a surgeon, and his wife, Lavinia (nee Dailey), a hospital matron. After boarding at the Dragon school in Oxford and then Charterhouse, he went to St John\u2019s College, Cambridge, to study natural sciences, with a view to a career in medicine. There he joined the amateur dramatic club and appeared in the Footlights of 1951. It was not, as he recalled, an outstanding performance, but he caught the bug, and when it came to deciding on a career he applied to join the BBC as a call boy, lowliest of the drama department\u2019s ranks. </p> <p>After national service in Korea with the Royal Engineers, where he enjoyed blowing things up, a skill transferable to period drama, he returned to his call boy role, which was to prove an invaluable apprenticeship in the drama production crafts. Having worked his way up to become an assistant director, his first break came when, in 1963, having moved to BBC Bristol, he was asked to help direct a serialisation of RD Blackmore\u2019s romantic Exmoor saga Lorna Doone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1037c201e1f1c097aafd3fb554c273ada9e2ffbc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1037c201e1f1c097aafd3fb554c273ada9e2ffbc/0_52_4146_2487/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Susan Hampshire with Martin Jarvis, left, and Eric Porter in The Forsyte Saga, BBC, 1967.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Susan Hampshire with Martin Jarvis, left, and Eric Porter in The Forsyte Saga (BBC, 1967).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the series had a lukewarm reception, the scenes for which Jim was responsible were well received, and other work was soon coming the young director\u2019s way.

It was adapted from John Galsworthy\u2019s series of novels about the fortunes of three generations of an upper-class English family. Jim had at first thought the books second-rate and unworthy of a series, but afterwards acknowledged that \u201csecond-rate novels often make first-rate television\u201d. </p> <p>His name made, Jim followed up with a series based on an adaptation of a Henry James novel, The Portrait of a Lady (1968), and with Anthony Trollope\u2019s The Way We Live Now (1969).

However, political tensions were frequently near the surface, notably in relation to Scum, written by Roy Minton, a film about a juvenile prison deemed so violent, despite adjustments suggested by Jim, that Bill Cotton, the BBC One controller, refused to show it. In the ensuing public row (which enabled its creative team to raise the money to reshoot it for a successful cinema run in 1979 as \u201cthe film the BBC tried to ban\u201d), Jim went public against the BBC\u2019s \u201cdisgraceful\u201d decision \u2013 and became a hero of the left.

      "bodyText": "The Brexit blame game has moved centre stage. The strange thing, however, is that the game is already up. The British government, as the champions of the Brexit project, understandably attach increasing importance to this blame game. Fearful of being caught red-handed as the foolish project increasingly runs into reality, their aim is to shift the focus on to others. As the immense damage to the UK\u2019s interests, influence and wellbeing becomes clearer, their search for Brexit culprits is vital. The risk of a no-deal departure from the EU, which would maximise the national and international damage, intensifies this frantic hunt further. The blame game has become so important that few people are able to assess the real intention of Johnson\u2019s latest Brexit proposals, which in their present form could never form the basis for agreement. It is impossible to be sure whether they represent a genuine attempt to negotiate an agreement or are rather designed to provide further ammunition for blaming others for the collapse of negotiations. The EU still hopes the proposals are sincere and remains open to working towards a deal. Johnson and Leo Varadkar\u2019s meeting in Liverpool today in principle has been convened to find a compromise over the Northern Irish backstop \u2013 but the ultimate hope for the prime minister may be to point an accusatory finger at the taoiseach in the event of failure. It matters little to the Johnson government who is at fault, as long as the finger is not pointed at Downing Street. The accusation that Ireland is manipulating Brussels has been interchangeable with the directly conflicting assertion that Brussels is manipulating Ireland. Preposterously, the EU has been compared to the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. Personal targets also abound. Jean-Claude Juncker, Michel Barnier, Emmanuel Macron and Varadkar are just some of those randomly included in the identity parade of the innocent. There are also plenty of domestic British scapegoats. Britain\u2019s courts and judges have been vilified. Its civil service has been pilloried. Its parliament is falsely portrayed as being in opposition to the people, and parliamentarians tarred with the brush of surrender and collaboration. The funny thing is that despite all the huffing and puffing, the outcome of the Brexit blame game is already known. The clue to the real culprit was given by Johnson himself on the day he took office as prime minister. Standing outside Downing Street, referring explicitly to Brexit and the backstop, he pronounced with admirable candour that the \u201cbuck stops here\u201d. Rarely has a truer word been spoken. But there is another reason why the blame game has become a very limited one \u2013 almost everywhere outside Britain, the issue of whom to blame has already been pretty well resolved. All around the EU, including in Ireland, the responsibility for Brexit and for where the negotiations now stand, is correctly attributed to the British government. There is a shared awareness \u2013 apart from some on the European hard right \u2013 that the EU has bent over backwards to accommodate British concerns. It agreed a compromise agreement with May\u2019s government that fully respected every British red line. Now, three years and three months after the initial referendum, Johnson has tabled new proposals laced with a variety of unconvincing and smudged red lines. In Northern Ireland, the majority is against Brexit itself and many oppose the new proposals. It is remarkable that the strongest criticism of Johnson\u2019s plan has come neither from Brussels nor Dublin but from the Northern Ireland business community, transcending traditional political differences. Across the world also, there is bewilderment about Brexit \u2013 as well as an appreciation of the delicacy of the Good Friday agreement. In the Commonwealth, for example, although friendship with Britain will presumably remain strong, there is an awareness of the history of British-Irish relations and an empathy for the Irish experience.

Now, he's in danger of losing their support | Geoffrey Kabaservice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Discussing whether to allow White House aides to testify before the Senate Watergate committee, Nixon <a href=\"https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/trial/exhibit_16.pdf\">said on tape</a> in 1973: \u201cI want you all to stonewall it, let them plead the fifth amendment, cover-up or anything else, if it\u2019ll save it \u2013 save the plan.\u201d</p> <p>But compared with Donald Trump, Nixon was a piker. In fact, a strong case can be made that the secret mission of the Trump presidency has been to restore Nixon\u2019s reputation.</p> <p>When the US supreme court in a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/watergate/articles/072574-1.htm\">unanimous 1974 decision</a> directed the president to hand over the White House tapes, Nixon complied even though it sealed his fate. In a similar situation, Trump would be burning the tapes on the White House lawn while shouting: \u201cCome and get me, copper.\u201d</p> <p>Taking time from selling out the Kurds, Trump followed that strategy to the hilt as he turned Tuesday into <a href=\"https://s2.washingtonpost.com/camp-rw/?e=d3NoYXBpcm9AbWluZHNwcmluZy5jb20%3D&amp;s=5d9df218fe1ff64b0d23a1f3&amp;linknum=0&amp;linktot=126\">Stonewall the Constitution Day</a>.</p> <p>His defiance began with a last-minute decision to block the testimony of ambassador Gordon Sondland, a key figure in pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son. Then Rudy Giuliani \u2013 the president\u2019s malaprop mouthpiece \u2013 gave a Bronx cheer (\u201cLet them hold me in contempt\u201d) to a congressional demand for documents. Finally, the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, sent House Democrats a foam-at-the-mouth <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/08/us/politics/white-house-letter-impeachment.html\">eight-page letter</a> stonewalling cooperation with the impeachment inquiry because \u2026 well \u2026 Trump wants to.</p> <p>The phrase \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d has been used loosely throughout the Trump presidency whenever a law professor appears on MSNBC. But this time, Trump\u2019s scorched-earth defiance of Congress as a coequal branch of government qualifies as a true time of testing for American democracy.</p> <p>The practical problem facing the House Democrats is that turning to the federal courts to uphold subpoenas is a time-consuming process that makes Freudian analysis seem fleet-footed in comparison. The justice department offers no salvation since the attorney general, William Barr, has transformed it into another branch of Trump Worldwide Kleptocracy.</p> <p>House Democrats are tempted by the notion of simply powering through \u2013 and turning Trump\u2019s rejection of subpoenas into another article of impeachment. That was the essence of <a href=\"https://watergate.info/impeachment/articles-of-impeachment\">Article Three</a> of the 1974 impeachment case against Nixon contending that the president \u201chas failed \u2026 to produce papers and things as directed by duly authorized subpoenas\u201d.</p> <p>Such an approach has legal merit. And, it would mesh with Nancy Pelosi\u2019s reported desire to hold an impeachment vote in the House by Thanksgiving. But the danger in such a rush to judgment is that it would deprive the House impeachment hearings of much of their inherent drama.</p> <p>It is easy to forget that Nixon\u2019s downfall was a play with two distinct acts.</p> <p>The first act was the 1973 Senate Watergate hearings that riveted the nation with witnesses such as <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Wesley-Dean-III\">John Dean</a> talking about \u201ca cancer growing on the presidency\u201d. That was when Nixon\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/25/how-the-watergate-crisis-eroded-public-support-for-richard-nixon/\">approval ratings collapsed</a> from 68% in the Gallup poll in January 1973 to less than half by that August.</p> <p>The curtain rose on the second act a year later as the <a href=\"https://watergate.info/impeachment/analysis-judiciary-committee-impeachment-votes\">House </a><a href=\"https://watergate.info/impeachment/analysis-judiciary-committee-impeachment-votes\">judiciary </a><a href=\"https://watergate.info/impeachment/analysis-judiciary-committee-impeachment-votes\">committee</a> approved impeachment with seven Republicans supporting at least one of the articles. Nixon\u2019s determination to never give in crumpled with the release of the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/05/watergate-smoking-gun-tape-released-aug-5-1974-753086\">\u201csmoking gun\u201d tape</a> in early August 1974 that prompted Republican leaders such as Barry Goldwater to ask him to resign.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Awash in advice from constitutional scholars, House Democrats desperately need to hear from top theatrical directors</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In contrast, House Democrats are rushing forward with impeachment without the equivalent of the Senate Watergate hearings. Neither the showboating House intelligence committee chairman, Adam Schiff, nor the uninspiring judiciary chairman, Jerry Nadler, has displayed the skill to orchestrate a compelling public hearing.</p> <p>Awash in advice from constitutional scholars, House Democrats desperately need to hear from top theatrical directors. Because the only way that Trump\u2019s impeachment will be more than a Democrats-only quest is if the dramatic arc becomes as compelling as Watergate. And that means that the target audience now should be wavering Republican voters appalled by Trump\u2019s conduct and Republican legislators who are privately ashamed of their timidity.</p> <p>The Democrats should not rush impeachment with artificial deadlines. Instead, the hope is that a few troubled Trump insiders will resign in protest in order to testify honestly before the House. The moral decision that John Dean made in 1973 is just as applicable in 2019.</p> <p>In the end, it should be remembered that <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Stonewall-Jackson\">Stonewall Jackson</a> was a general on the losing side of the civil war.

      "bodyText": "One of Richard Nixon\u2019s lasting gifts to the language was to popularize the American use of \u201cstonewall\u201d as a verb. Discussing whether to allow White House aides to testify before the Senate Watergate committee, Nixon said on tape in 1973: \u201cI want you all to stonewall it, let them plead the fifth amendment, cover-up or anything else, if it\u2019ll save it \u2013 save the plan.\u201d But compared with Donald Trump, Nixon was a piker. In fact, a strong case can be made that the secret mission of the Trump presidency has been to restore Nixon\u2019s reputation. When the US supreme court in a unanimous 1974 decision directed the president to hand over the White House tapes, Nixon complied even though it sealed his fate. In a similar situation, Trump would be burning the tapes on the White House lawn while shouting: \u201cCome and get me, copper.\u201d Taking time from selling out the Kurds, Trump followed that strategy to the hilt as he turned Tuesday into Stonewall the Constitution Day. His defiance began with a last-minute decision to block the testimony of ambassador Gordon Sondland, a key figure in pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son. Then Rudy Giuliani \u2013 the president\u2019s malaprop mouthpiece \u2013 gave a Bronx cheer (\u201cLet them hold me in contempt\u201d) to a congressional demand for documents. Finally, the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, sent House Democrats a foam-at-the-mouth eight-page letter stonewalling cooperation with the impeachment inquiry because \u2026 well \u2026 Trump wants to. The phrase \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d has been used loosely throughout the Trump presidency whenever a law professor appears on MSNBC. But this time, Trump\u2019s scorched-earth defiance of Congress as a coequal branch of government qualifies as a true time of testing for American democracy. The practical problem facing the House Democrats is that turning to the federal courts to uphold subpoenas is a time-consuming process that makes Freudian analysis seem fleet-footed in comparison. The justice department offers no salvation since the attorney general, William Barr, has transformed it into another branch of Trump Worldwide Kleptocracy. House Democrats are tempted by the notion of simply powering through \u2013 and turning Trump\u2019s rejection of subpoenas into another article of impeachment. That was the essence of Article Three of the 1974 impeachment case against Nixon contending that the president \u201chas failed \u2026 to produce papers and things as directed by duly authorized subpoenas\u201d. Such an approach has legal merit. And, it would mesh with Nancy Pelosi\u2019s reported desire to hold an impeachment vote in the House by Thanksgiving. But the danger in such a rush to judgment is that it would deprive the House impeachment hearings of much of their inherent drama. It is easy to forget that Nixon\u2019s downfall was a play with two distinct acts. The first act was the 1973 Senate Watergate hearings that riveted the nation with witnesses such as John Dean talking about \u201ca cancer growing on the presidency\u201d. That was when Nixon\u2019s approval ratings collapsed from 68% in the Gallup poll in January 1973 to less than half by that August. The curtain rose on the second act a year later as the House judiciary committee approved impeachment with seven Republicans supporting at least one of the articles. Nixon\u2019s determination to never give in crumpled with the release of the \u201csmoking gun\u201d tape in early August 1974 that prompted Republican leaders such as Barry Goldwater to ask him to resign. In contrast, House Democrats are rushing forward with impeachment without the equivalent of the Senate Watergate hearings. Neither the showboating House intelligence committee chairman, Adam Schiff, nor the uninspiring judiciary chairman, Jerry Nadler, has displayed the skill to orchestrate a compelling public hearing. Awash in advice from constitutional scholars, House Democrats desperately need to hear from top theatrical directors. Because the only way that Trump\u2019s impeachment will be more than a Democrats-only quest is if the dramatic arc becomes as compelling as Watergate. And that means that the target audience now should be wavering Republican voters appalled by Trump\u2019s conduct and Republican legislators who are privately ashamed of their timidity. The Democrats should not rush impeachment with artificial deadlines. Instead, the hope is that a few troubled Trump insiders will resign in protest in order to testify honestly before the House. The moral decision that John Dean made in 1973 is just as applicable in 2019. In the end, it should be remembered that Stonewall Jackson was a general on the losing side of the civil war. And Nixon\u2019s stonewall saved neither the plan nor his presidency. For to update Robert Frost, \u201cSomething there is that doesn\u2019t love a stonewall.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "As Scottish rugby fans contemplate the prospect of \u201closing by default to a typhoon\u201d, initial anger and frustration at the threat of cancellation and lack of contingency planning is giving way to pragmatism. Tom Moore, who arrived in Tokyo on Thursday from the Scottish Lowlands village of Lochwinnoch, told the Guardian that he would be \u201cimmensely disappointed\u201d if Scotland\u2019s match were cancelled, as has happened with the England v France game at the same venue in Yokohama on Saturday. But Moore, who has packed his uniform of a Loch Ness monster hat and kilt for watching the game, added: \u201cIf you follow Scottish sport, you\u2019re used to saying the best thing is to get there early so you can have a good time before you lose. We\u2019ve written the book on how to lose sportingly, but there\u2019s not been a chapter yet on losing by default to a typhoon.\u201d Moore, who is hoping still to get to the match with his son, questioned the fairness of drawing certain fixtures that can\u2019t be played and what effect that will have on the overall integrity of the competition, saying: \u201cIt is a long tournament, and you would have thought there would be enough flexibility to delay until the weather improved.\u201d Scottish Rugby has said that it fully expects contingency plans to be put in place to enable Scotland to contest for a place in the quarter-finals on the pitch, but online fans have vented their frustration at what they see as a lack of planning. Those watching from Scotland are also debating the different outcomes of cancellation versus playing. Craig Shearer, a Murrayfield season ticket holder from Dundee, explained: \u201cWe\u2019re all being pragmatic here. I think the organisers have good procedures in place. Decisions are being taken in good time so fans are in no doubt as to what\u2019s happening. When it comes down to it, this is about public safety and these guys are the experts.\u201d But Shearer went on to raise a point that is being made by many: \u201cThe decision of World Rugby to give the World Cup to Japan in typhoon season is one to consider. The development of the Japanese (and tier two in general) is a big thing and this decision was taken as a very positive move. The risks of this happening must have been assessed.\u201d Other fans also queried why World Rugby agreed to the rule that cancellation would be marked as a draw when it was likely to cause controversy. Meanwhile, the Scottish Rugby Union is advising supporters who are already in Japan to heed the advice of the Foreign Office, which is \u201cto follow all official advice, stay indoors and do not attempt to travel on Saturday\u201d. There is an official warning for a continuous risk of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis across the country, which may well also affect the qualifying for the F1 Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, which is also due to take place on Saturday. Cammy Black, the deputy editor of the Scottish Rugby Blog, said that the fans he is in touch with are keeping the drama in perspective. \u201cMost fans have huge sympathy for Japan, it\u2019s a massive tournament for them and they have really embraced the Scottish team. If it is cancelled it will be hugely disappointing for the players having worked up to this for four years, and the fans who have paid money to go out there. But we need to be level-headed when there\u2019s a huge storm coming that\u2019s going to affect lots of people\u2019s lives and this is a game of rugby.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Being introduced to Netflix\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/03/big-mouth-netflix-sex-education-comedy\">Big Mouth</a> has been such a thrill. My girlfriend\u2019s 16-year-old daughter sold it to me, promising a talking vulva voiced by Kristen Wiig, a sassy hormone \u2018monstress\u2019 (Maya Rudolph) and a whole world of inclusive, body-positive bits about the messy reality of growing up. It is clever, pleasingly surreal and an absolute hoot. I was sold from the first watch.</p> <p>The new series focuses on the obstacle-strewn path young women tread when exploring their sexuality in adolescence. To me, it is the best yet. Watching episode six, How to Have an Orgasm, feels quietly revolutionary. In it, Jessi \u2013 a droll, whip-smart girl you wish had befriended you at school \u2013 learns how to come for the first time. Watching it feels new, exciting and radical because the business of female pleasure is rarely dealt with so centrally and without shame.</p> <p>It begins with Jessi\u2019s vulva \u2013 a separate, talking entity \u2013 holding a microphone and hosting a game called \u201cDo the Thing!\u201d Connie (Rudolph\u2019s hormone monstress) cheers her along with a rallying cry of \u201clet\u2019s touch our genitals\u201d as she experiments under the covers with her hand. Pleasure is elusive. Her vulva offers continuous feedback: \u201cThat\u2019s a little pokey, you\u2019re not trying to squash a bug.\u201d</p> <p>Turning to porn for inspiration, Jessi comes across a video called Bethany\u2019s First Orgasm, in which Bethany uses a vibrator. Jessi goes to a shop with her friend Missy (Jenny Slate) to see what\u2019s available. A talking Harry Potter vibrator falls off the shelf and buzzes across the floor. She doesn\u2019t buy anything but the conversation between the two friends, in which Missy plainly states that \u201ca glow worm and a bath faucet really gets the job done\u201d, is striking, considering how much shame still exists around how women experience pleasure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35caa0eb19e97c3b296889098badbc7a3bfff73b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35caa0eb19e97c3b296889098badbc7a3bfff73b/27_0_3768_2261/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wanderlust.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The first woman to have an orgasm on the BBC? ... Wanderlust.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Drama Republic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indeed, whether it\u2019s humping a pillow, angling a shower head or using a vibrator, the idea of women young or mature putting their pleasure first has been historically controversial. I remember my heart sinking when Sally Draper was carted off to a psychotherapist for masturbating in Mad Men, but such was the pervasive attitude of the era. Women were pleasure-givers, not receivers; or, if pleasure was received, it was incidental. Luckily, contemporary TV writers are now centralising female pleasure in both celebratory and matter-of-fact ways.</p> <p>Last year, Toni Collette claimed to be the first woman to have an orgasm on the BBC with Wanderlust; a show that ruffled feathers with its scene involving her masturbating, screwed-up face and all, in front of her partner. We had Phoebe Waller-Bridge wanking over a Barack Obama speech on her laptop while her boyfriend sleeps in Fleabag. In Broad City, Ilana Glazer makes a meal out of masturbation with extensive \u2018self-seduction\u2019 rituals that include lighting candles, putting on lipstick and eating oysters. Bumping back to reality, Insecure saw Issa (Issa Rae) scramble round the house looking for batteries for her vibrator while, ironically, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the word \u2018hump\u2019.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5541fdb89e1108e10b1eee892fee3fc3b0efdfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5541fdb89e1108e10b1eee892fee3fc3b0efdfc/38_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Issa Rae in Insecure\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The scramble for vibrator batteries ...

I remember being taken aback watching the first series of Top of the Lake, in which Robyn\u2019s boyfriend pulls her into a pub toilet to go down on her, because it is usually the other way around. It is telling that all these shows have female writers or directors.</p> <p>All these instances carry a little revolutionary spark because it has always seemed that when women come on-screen (if indeed they do) it is a quick, smooth and penis-centric affair involving penetration. This does not reflect most women\u2019s realities. (At least two-thirds of women having heterosexual sex <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/neepb8/the-science-of-female-pleasure-still-needs-more-attention\">cannot come this way</a>; fingers, tongues and vibrators are much more effective.) </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76d4c554ae93dc2277aa451731c51e708aeab2b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76d4c554ae93dc2277aa451731c51e708aeab2b7/0_258_4296_2578/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gentleman Jack.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quite thrilling ...

      "bodyText": "Being introduced to Netflix\u2019s Big Mouth has been such a thrill. My girlfriend\u2019s 16-year-old daughter sold it to me, promising a talking vulva voiced by Kristen Wiig, a sassy hormone \u2018monstress\u2019 (Maya Rudolph) and a whole world of inclusive, body-positive bits about the messy reality of growing up. It is clever, pleasingly surreal and an absolute hoot. I was sold from the first watch. The new series focuses on the obstacle-strewn path young women tread when exploring their sexuality in adolescence. To me, it is the best yet. Watching episode six, How to Have an Orgasm, feels quietly revolutionary. In it, Jessi \u2013 a droll, whip-smart girl you wish had befriended you at school \u2013 learns how to come for the first time. Watching it feels new, exciting and radical because the business of female pleasure is rarely dealt with so centrally and without shame. It begins with Jessi\u2019s vulva \u2013 a separate, talking entity \u2013 holding a microphone and hosting a game called \u201cDo the Thing!\u201d Connie (Rudolph\u2019s hormone monstress) cheers her along with a rallying cry of \u201clet\u2019s touch our genitals\u201d as she experiments under the covers with her hand. Pleasure is elusive. Her vulva offers continuous feedback: \u201cThat\u2019s a little pokey, you\u2019re not trying to squash a bug.\u201d Turning to porn for inspiration, Jessi comes across a video called Bethany\u2019s First Orgasm, in which Bethany uses a vibrator. Jessi goes to a shop with her friend Missy (Jenny Slate) to see what\u2019s available. A talking Harry Potter vibrator falls off the shelf and buzzes across the floor. She doesn\u2019t buy anything but the conversation between the two friends, in which Missy plainly states that \u201ca glow worm and a bath faucet really gets the job done\u201d, is striking, considering how much shame still exists around how women experience pleasure. Indeed, whether it\u2019s humping a pillow, angling a shower head or using a vibrator, the idea of women young or mature putting their pleasure first has been historically controversial. I remember my heart sinking when Sally Draper was carted off to a psychotherapist for masturbating in Mad Men, but such was the pervasive attitude of the era. Women were pleasure-givers, not receivers; or, if pleasure was received, it was incidental. Luckily, contemporary TV writers are now centralising female pleasure in both celebratory and matter-of-fact ways. Last year, Toni Collette claimed to be the first woman to have an orgasm on the BBC with Wanderlust; a show that ruffled feathers with its scene involving her masturbating, screwed-up face and all, in front of her partner. We had Phoebe Waller-Bridge wanking over a Barack Obama speech on her laptop while her boyfriend sleeps in Fleabag. In Broad City, Ilana Glazer makes a meal out of masturbation with extensive \u2018self-seduction\u2019 rituals that include lighting candles, putting on lipstick and eating oysters. Bumping back to reality, Insecure saw Issa (Issa Rae) scramble round the house looking for batteries for her vibrator while, ironically, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the word \u2018hump\u2019. In Gentleman Jack, though nowhere near as racy a series as one hoped, it was quite thrilling to watch Suranne Jones\u2019 Anne Lister timing and recording her lovers\u2019 orgasms. I remember being taken aback watching the first series of Top of the Lake, in which Robyn\u2019s boyfriend pulls her into a pub toilet to go down on her, because it is usually the other way around. It is telling that all these shows have female writers or directors. All these instances carry a little revolutionary spark because it has always seemed that when women come on-screen (if indeed they do) it is a quick, smooth and penis-centric affair involving penetration. This does not reflect most women\u2019s realities. (At least two-thirds of women having heterosexual sex cannot come this way; fingers, tongues and vibrators are much more effective.) We need to do more to educate young people about female pleasure. Jess Phillips was absolutely right when she said it was vital to discuss female pleasure in compulsory sex education to break down the culture of power imbalance between men and women. Heterosexual women orgasm less with a partner than any other demographic. The reasons for this orgasm gap are multifaceted. It is not down to biology, rather any combination of lack of anatomical knowledge, the indifference of a partner, not feeling safe enough to \u2018let go\u2019 or confident enough to self-advocate. Much of our confidence in sex will come from experimenting privately and, hopefully, being with a partner who wants to learn the language. We need to encourage this through awareness from a young age. As Phillips has said, we\u2019re not teaching kids to masturbate \u2013 we\u2019re talking to them about what they\u2019re already doing.

Gianluca de Ficchy, the chairman of Nissan Europe, said the imposition of a 10% tariff on exports under World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms would threaten the future of its large Sunderland plant. \u201cIf we are in a situation in which tomorrow we have to apply 10% export duties to 70% of our sales, the entire business model for Nissan Europe will be in jeopardy,\u201d he said. The Japanese carmaker, which supports 30,000 jobs in Britain, said it could not guarantee the new Qashqai model would come to Sunderland given the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. Nissan promised in 2016 to build the new version of the car in Sunderland after receiving assurances from Theresa May\u2019s government that it would be protected from the impact of Brexit. The carmaker, which employs 6,000 people at Sunderland and supports another 24,000 jobs in the supply chain, has previously made only measured statements about the impact of the UK\u2019s departure from the EU. De Ficchy made the firm\u2019s strongest intervention yet on Thursday when he expressed frustration with the British government over the lack of clarity for businesses three weeks before the 31 October departure deadline. He said Nissan was in discussions with Boris Johnson\u2019s government about Brexit, but added: \u201cThe only frustration we have today, as before: we don\u2019t have clarity.\u201d He said two-thirds of the 160 suppliers for the new Nissan Juke, which begins production in Sunderland next week, were based in the EU and 70% of its sales would be exported to the union. \u201cIf no deal means the sudden application of WTO [terms] we know that our business model [in Europe] won\u2019t be sustainable in the future.\u201d He said the company had war-gamed the consequence of various Brexit outcomes and did not believe it could offset the impact of 10% export tariffs on the 440,000 cars produced in Sunderland each year. \u201cWe do not have a specific message to Boris Johnson \u2013 my message [is] as a business we do not have a clear understanding on the future evolution of the Brexit discussion.\u201d De Ficchy was speaking at the Sunderland plant, which last year produced its 10 millionth car and has become the UK\u2019s biggest car manufacturing site since it was opened by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government in 1986. He said a decision to end night shifts at the plant was not linked to Brexit but was aimed at optimising the two production lines for the models built there, including the new Juke. He said the workforce at Sunderland was an asset to be preserved, with a successful history of producing 10 million \u201chigh quality\u201d vehicles. \u201cWe know the workforce is concerned about that [Brexit] situation \u2013 we are also concerned. That\u2019s the reason we are here, to express our concerns.\u201d",

Mali Baden-Powell asks Who or what inspired you to become an actor? Dodesy asks What are your memories of living in Forest Gate and do you feel like it\u2019s changed a lot, particularly in the last five years? noelflantier asks Half of a Yellow Sun was halfway there, but would you ever work in Nollywood? ID8378794 asks Which other actors inspire you? Which actors and/or directors would you like to work with? TheWizeMan asks What were your favourite films when growing up as a child/teenager? The ones that you can still say are your all-time favourites? cardinal asks Have you ever been pressured or advised to change your name? Given the protest over English actors being cast in Welsh roles, and non-Jewish actors being cast in Jewish roles, to the exclusion of actors of those ethnicities, have you personally been affected by the controversy over British actors being cast as historical figures from black American history, especially since you portrayed Solomon Northup? AkumbuUche asks Congrats on making the transition into writing and directing. I love your adaptation of The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind as well as your short film Columbite Tantalite and I\u2019m eager to see what\u2019s next. What are the last 3 books you enjoyed reading? louleather asks You have a fantastic name - does it have a particular meaning? Also, any plans to return to the stage? ID9136034 asks 1. how tough was your training for Red Belt? You had some very tough guys with years of fighting experience working with you. Do you still train Brazilian jiujitsu? If so which black belt? 2. enjoyed your directorial debut \u2013 do you plan to continue directing? PennyFarting asks How was it playing Okwe in Dirty Pretty Things? It\u2019s still, to my mind, a stunning piece of work that hasn\u2019t dated. parsnipsoup asks How was it reuniting with your old Salt co-star Angelina Jolie on Maleficent? Did the film make you re-evaluate the fairytales you\u2019d read as a child \u2013 and did you feel a sense of responsibility about how much movies influence young people? Plus, I\u2019ve got to ask ... Andrew Lincoln and Keira Knightley, in Love Actually. You must have known something was going on, surely? It was obvious to the rest of us looking on. Claire Hobson asks What was Joss Whedon like to work with? #serenity CrazyCat Lady asks In which ways do you think the British movie/theatre sector will be affected by Brexit? liambenchwalsh1 asks As an in-demand working actor, how do you keep your instruments (voice, body etc) in tune while following such a busy schedule? lukecoburn asks You and Benedict Wong have fantastic onscreen chemistry (Dirty Pretty Things, The Martian). Would you consider making more movies together perhaps a show about two London cops? Chiwetel Ejiofor is with us now One of the UK\u2019s finest screen and stage performers, Chiwetel Ejiofor has \u201ctalent to take your breath away\u201d \u2013 according to the Observer\u2019s Amy Raphael, that is. Since his breakthrough role in the Stephen Frears-directed drama Dirty Pretty Things in 2002, Ejiofor has become a fixture in British cinema and Hollywood, with appearances in Love Actually, Kinky Boots, Children of Men, American Gangster and The Martian. Arguably his career high point (so far) was his Oscar-nominated performance as Solomon Northup in Steve McQueen\u2019s drama 12 Years a Slave. Ejiofor has also dipped a toe in directorial waters with the Malawi-set The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, about a villager who invents a wind turbine. And that\u2019s not even counting his stage work, which includes an acclaimed Othello at the Donmar Warehouse in 2007 and Everyman at the National Theatre in 2015. This year is a Disney one-two: we have already seen the release of The Lion King, for which Ejiofor voiced the rascally Scar in the CGI \u201clive action\u201d remake, and just about to arrive is Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, in which he plays a wise clan chieftain who counsels Angelina Jolie\u2019s Maleficent. He\u2019ll be with us for a webchat on Thursday 10 October at 1.20pm BST so send us your questions now, and we\u2019ll get as many answered as time allows.",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has pledged to pull off another general election upset and recover from poor polling to deny Boris Johnson a return to Downing Street, as he effectively kicked off Labour\u2019s campaign with a so-called alternative Queen\u2019s speech setting out key policies. Speaking to party activists in Northampton, where both parliamentary seats are held by Conservative MPs with tiny majorities over Labour \u2013 Corbyn reeled off a list of plans in areas including Brexit, inequality, education, the NHS, housing, crime and the climate emergency. He said it was \u201cthe most transformative, radical and exciting programme ever put before the British electorate\u201d. Answering questions from reporters afterwards, Corbyn declined to comment on surveys that put the party\u2019s support at as little as 25%, insisting he never looked at polling. But he did predict a similar upset to that of 2017 when Labour confounded the polls to deny Theresa May a majority. Corbyn ignored a separate question about whether he would step down if he did not win the election. In his speech he said Labour was seeking a radical transformation of the UK so that young people could \u201clook forwards to the future with hope\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, I get all of that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the one thing this country can\u2019t afford is the level of inequality that we have.\u201d He said that when an election was called, Labour would mobilise hundreds of thousands of supporters to push its message. \u201cThat atmosphere and that message that things can and will be done very differently. Do we want our country run by a party that has cut, sliced, diced and privatised our public services, or do we want the ambition, enthusiasm and imagination of the Labour party to create that different and better society?\u201d To cheers from the crowd, he concluded: \u201cI\u2019ll take that message out there. I\u2019m very fit, I\u2019m very healthy, I\u2019m very happy, and I\u2019m very, very determined.\u201d Corbyn brushed off a suggestion that the party should be pushing for a second EU referendum before an election. \u201cA second referendum is what we propose under a Labour government, which would be, as I have said, not a choice between a no-deal cliff edge but between an intelligent arrangement with the European Union and remain.\u201d Many Labour MPs are worried about going into a general election at a time when the party is trailing badly in the polls, and they would rather see the issue of Brexit put to bed, allowing them to campaign on domestic issues. Corbyn dismissed the planned Queen\u2019s speech by the government as a \u201ccynical stunt\u201d, saying it was \u201cfull pomp and ceremony, setting out an agenda to parliament that it has no intention and no means of delivering\u201d. The rest of his speech was largely a list of previously announced Labour policies, including its plans for a so-called green new deal, reshaping the economy towards skilled, sustainable jobs. Asked about the ongoing Extinction Rebellion protests in London, which Johnson and several government ministers have condemned, Corbyn praised the movement, predicting its leaders could even one day be commemorated on postage stamps, as earlier activists have been. \u201cTheir right to protest has to be upheld, that is what our democratic rights are all about,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously protests must be conducted in a peaceful way, and every time anyone condemns people for protesting they should think for a moment where protest can lead.\u201d He added: \u201cThose women who stood up for the right for women to vote, the suffragettes, were condemned mercilessly by almost every newspaper in the country. They\u2019re now on postage stamps.\u201d Asked about the case of a US diplomat\u2019s wife who left the UK after being sought in connection with a fatal road crash, Corbyn said the US should take action to return her. \u201cI am alarmed and very concerned about that,\u201d he said. \u201cFor somebody to be killed in our country and for the person who did it then to flee to the United States and then to claim diplomatic immunity is completely unacceptable.\u201d He condemned comments by Donald Trump that US citizens sometimes drove on the wrong side of the road in the UK. \u201cI just think that\u2019s the most crass, insensitive comment that anyone could ever make,\u201d Corbyn said.",

      "body": "<p>The last time Lewis Capaldi visited Times Square in New York, he was confronted by his own face: a poster for Spotify stretching the height of a building. It featured him wearing a selection from his apparently inexhaustible collection of idiotic-looking sunglasses: a white-framed women\u2019s pair, not unlike the ones Kurt Cobain <a href=\"https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/kurt-cobain-sunglasses\" title=\"\">took to wearing near the end of his life</a>. He looked at least a little more like a rock star than he usually does in promotional photos. A British poster campaign features what is supposed to be his Tinder profile: a photo of Capaldi grinning gormlessly, his hair wrapped in a towel. He is flashing a peace sign and the caption reads: \u201cOtherwise known as the Scottish Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, he took a photo of the Times Square poster and stuck it on Instagram and Facebook. In a perfect example of Capaldi\u2019s approach to social media, he listed his location as \u201cGENERAL ERECTION\u201d and counselled \u201cnyc pls don\u2019t trip over yr boners xox\u201d. The thing is, he asks, as he demolishes a burger in a Chicago restaurant, how else are you supposed to react? These ridiculous things keep happening to him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/ByyI59NhNN5/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

The next thing he knew, Cabello had covered Someone You Loved, \u201cand obviously she smashed it, doing all these vocal runs I can\u2019t do \u2013 I was like: \u2018Can\u2019t you just sing it without showing me up?\u2019\u201d The other night, there was a knock on his dressing room door and David Hasselhoff was standing outside: when Calvin Harris commented on the ensuing <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2SDmB_htY_/\" title=\"\">Instagram selfie</a>, Hasselhoff immediately nipped in and suggested the three of them make a record together, \u201cwhich would obviously be fucking excellent\u201d, Capaldi laughs. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm7jEA3frY4\" title=\"\">Jump in My Car</a>, but with Calvin Harris producing. The last time I saw David Hasselhoff in the flesh, he was playing Captain Hook in the panto at the Glasgow Armadillo. I was there with my family the day after Christmas, pished. And I\u2019ll tell you something: his performance was a revelation.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s all so weird, he says, that you have to laugh at it. \u201cYou cannot fathom some of the stuff when it is going on. It\u2019s just daft. I sometimes worry that people think I\u2019m just talking shite, and feel I\u2019m not as surprised with things: \u2018<em>Oh, he\u2019s been doing so well now that he must be used to it</em>.\u2019 But I\u2019m not. It\u2019s fucking wild.\u201d</p> <p>It is indeed. A year ago, Capaldi looked suspiciously like he could be a one-hit wonder.

Then it started selling in the US.</p> <p>The day I meet him, Someone You Loved is No 3 in the US chart, causing Capaldi to start referring to himself ironically as \u201cAmerica\u2019s sweetheart\u201d, posing for photographs in an Uncle Sam outfit while clutching a bunch of roses and plastering the slogan all over his US tour merchandise. \u201cIt started as a shite joke,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not America\u2019s sweetheart, do you know what I mean? I\u2019ve got one song. The album has only just started to move here. But then people who come to the gigs are making it a thing. They started screaming: \u2018America\u2019s sweetheart!\u2019 at me. They\u2019re making little videos about it online, so it just became: \u2018Well, how stupid can we make it?\u2019 So we rented an Uncle Sam costume, really taking the piss.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The music should be serious, and everything else should be fun because it is fun</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he deadpans, \u201cI looked absolutely tremendous in it.\u201d</p> <p>He seems baffled as to why it has happened; why he \u2013 out of the serried ranks of post-Ed Sheeran singer-songwriters \u2013 became the one who is selling millions and the first artist in history to sell out a UK arena tour before he had even released an album. \u201cI\u2019ve got no clue. \u2018What right do I have to be playing arenas?\u2019 is what goes through my head. Impostor syndrome. I\u2019m not better than any of these people, I\u2019m not better at writing songs or singing.\u201d</p> <p>The prosaic answer is that none of his peers had a song that captured audiences\u2019 imaginations the way Someone You Loved has. It is a breakup track that acts as a kind of evil twin to Adele\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/23/adele-25-record-broken-success-ballads-blockbusters-singles-album\" title=\"\">Someone Like You</a>; that song\u2019s stoic resolve replaced by wounded disbelief. It might also have something to do with Capaldi\u2019s voice \u2013 a full-throated, emotive roar that he alighted on after hearing Joe Cocker\u2019s 1969 cover of the Beatles\u2019 With a Little Help from My Friends as a teenager.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a3ba6ab91fca0c477233fc821d75ddbf9c9bc582\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3ba6ab91fca0c477233fc821d75ddbf9c9bc582/0_243_5111_3066/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Delusions of grandeur can be very, very dangerous indeed \u2026\u2019 Lewis Capaldi on stage at Thalia Hall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Delusions of grandeur can be very, very dangerous indeed \u2026\u2019 Lewis Capaldi on stage at Thalia Hall</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michelle Kanaar/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI could always sing loud because I was playing pubs when I was 11, and you\u2019ve got to sing loud there.

I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve done some irreparable damage to my voice trying to get here. I never had any lessons, but obviously now I\u2019ve had coaching to keep it going. I get really bad acid reflux, so I\u2019ve got to watch myself on tour: no spicy foods, as little alcohol as possible.\u201d He sighs. \u201cSee Mick Jagger, Elton John, all these cunts on tour in the 70s, going around doing everything, taking all these drugs, sounding great. I take one drink of Red Bull and I\u2019m choked.\u201d</p> <p>But there\u2019s something else about Capaldi\u2019s fame. He is incredibly likable in person: funny, warm, and implausibly fond of swearing (looking at the transcription of our interview, he said \u201cfuck\u201d or \u201cfucking\u201d 243 times in the space of 90 minutes). Moreover, he has proved very adept at projecting that likability on stage \u2013 where what he refers to as his \u201cblether\u201d between songs occasionally lasts as long as the songs themselves \u2013 and on social media.</p> <p>His Instagram and Twitter feeds are unfailingly hilarious and self-deprecating. In a pop world filled with artists telling audiences to be themselves while posting perfectly filtered selfies, Capaldi <em>is</em> himself, whether he is mocking his chubby physique (\u201cIt\u2019s an honour to have been <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/blessed/\" title=\"\">#blessed</a> with these abs &amp; to finally be able to give back and help others reach those <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/jacked/\" title=\"\">#jacked</a> goals is beyond a dream\u201d), parrying the insults hurled his way by Noel Gallagher or talking about his own mental health issues.

He says his record label has never suggested he employ a stylist or go to the gym. And he calls me out when I refer to his social media campaign. \u201cYou say \u2018campaign\u2019, but no one\u2019s told me to say anything. It\u2019s just me, jetlagged in a room somewhere, talking absolute shite. The self-deprecating thing \u2013 that\u2019s just how people from my home town talk. I love the comedian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/06/limmy\" title=\"\">Limmy</a> and the way he pushes things until they get more and more stupid. It always makes it funnier when everyone else has stopped laughing and you\u2019re still, like: \u2018No, this is brilliant.\u2019 The music should be serious, and everything else should be fun because it <em>is</em> fun.\u201d</p> <p>Besides, he says, you may as well enjoy it because you\u2019ve got no idea how long it\u2019s going to last.

But I think it\u2019s a good way to be. Delusions of grandeur can be very, very dangerous indeed. You have to have a word with yourself, like: shut your fucking hole, you\u2019re living your dream here. Going: \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Lewis Capaldi and you\u2019re listening to Chicago\u2019s B96,\u2019 \u2013 these people are playing your song, so just get on with it.

So saying: \u2018You\u2019re listening to my new song,\u2019 on some radio station, it\u2019s not really a hard time.\u201d</p> <p>And off he goes to get on with it. That night, Thalia Hall in Chicago is sold out: the queue starts snaking around the block hours before showtime. The audience know every word of every song, and do seem to be taking the idea of Capaldi as America\u2019s sweetheart seriously, amending chants of \u201cUSA!\u201d to: \u201cLew-is-A!\u201d Just before the closing performance of Someone You Loved, persons unknown throw a pair of stars and stripes underpants on to the stage. He pulls them on over his jeans. \u201cI hope these are XXL size,\u201d he nods. \u201cBecause I have a massive penis.\u201d Then they start chanting again.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The last time Lewis Capaldi visited Times Square in New York, he was confronted by his own face: a poster for Spotify stretching the height of a building. It featured him wearing a selection from his apparently inexhaustible collection of idiotic-looking sunglasses: a white-framed women\u2019s pair, not unlike the ones Kurt Cobain took to wearing near the end of his life. He looked at least a little more like a rock star than he usually does in promotional photos. A British poster campaign features what is supposed to be his Tinder profile: a photo of Capaldi grinning gormlessly, his hair wrapped in a towel. He is flashing a peace sign and the caption reads: \u201cOtherwise known as the Scottish Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d Of course, he took a photo of the Times Square poster and stuck it on Instagram and Facebook. In a perfect example of Capaldi\u2019s approach to social media, he listed his location as \u201cGENERAL ERECTION\u201d and counselled \u201cnyc pls don\u2019t trip over yr boners xox\u201d. The thing is, he asks, as he demolishes a burger in a Chicago restaurant, how else are you supposed to react? These ridiculous things keep happening to him. He posted a video of himself frowning while listening to Camila Cabello\u2019s new single, mock-horrified that it could outsell his single Someone You Loved in the US.

She earns the exact median income and is as green as she feels she can be: she has no children yet, her carbon footprint is negligible, and her apartment, built in the early 2000s, has been retrofitted for climate change with deep insulation, its own solar air-con and heating systems.</p> \n<p>It has a \u201cliving\u201d wall of plants and a balcony where she grows a few vegetables.

Her windows catch the breeze, and because the mayor has adapted to climate change by banning cars across the whole city centre and no fossil fuels are burned nearby, there\u2019s little air pollution. She feels healthy.</p> \n<p>Food is expensive because of the massive floods and droughts that have affected the world\u2019s main food-growing areas, but most of hers is organically grown and is delivered by drone from the nearby <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2013/04/03/farmscrapers_could_turn_future_cities_green_partner/\">20-storey \u201cfarmscraper\u201d</a> built 10 years ago.

Short-haul flights have been stopped anyway, and like everyone her age, she is allowed just one return flight a year.</p> \n<p>But she doesn\u2019t need to travel much now. The city authorities have thrown money at protecting infrastructure and helping people adapt to the higher temperatures and ever more frequent storms. The green spaces have been re-wilded. She can walk safely down the shady, tree-lined streets, cool off in the lido, or visit the urban forest, which the far-sighted city mayor started 20 years ago on wasteland.</p> \n<p>But now she really worries. She may have adapted her own life as far as possible to climate change, but so much is out of her control. The world\u2019s population has grown by 2.5 billion people since she was born in 2019, and carbon concentrations reached the 550 ppm (parts per million) milestone last year \u2013 just as the IPCC scientists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/25/extreme-sea-level-events-will-hit-once-a-year-by-2050\">had forecast they would</a>. They were just 407 ppm when she was born.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"67bc25af-d30a-4465-a1d8-320ae27b3588\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable.

That is really dangerous and means <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/rising-co2-levels-could-push-hundreds-of-millions-into-malnutrition-by-2050\">food and water will be scarcer</a>, the rains will be heavier, and even more people will flood in from rural areas to the city.</p> \n<p>Worst of all, the continuing loss of ice at the poles and in the great mountain ranges means sea levels are rising faster than most would have believed possible 30 years ago. The last great superstorm, caused by extraordinarily warm temperatures in the Arctic, flooded miles of coastal settlements and forced the permanent evacuation of dozens of expensive ocean-side apartment blocks. Waves crashed 100 metres beyond the new, higher sea walls. That\u2019s when her water started to taste salty.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the time has come for her to sell up and migrate to higher land, she thinks. She has been told that the underground water supplies to her tower block are beginning to be polluted with seawater and might only last 10 years, and that her tower could be deemed unsafe to live in within 20 years because of flooding. But it\u2019s far worse in most parts of the city. There the extremely poor don\u2019t live in strong houses, and can\u2019t build higher walls, relocate, borrow money or adapt so easily.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8a89811e1fcb75bc45cac3fa8c66bb208bf7067\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8a89811e1fcb75bc45cac3fa8c66bb208bf7067/0_46_4096_2459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A view of a flooded lower Manhattan plaza after Hurricane Sandy left most of the area without power in 2012, New York City, USA.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A view of a flooded lower Manhattan plaza after Hurricane Sandy left most of the area without power in 2012, New York City, USA.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>A view of a flooded lower Manhattan plaza after Hurricane Sandy left most of the area without power in 2012, New York City, USA.

Every year her apartment is worth less because it is so close to the ocean; property on higher ground now attracts premium prices. Her city has grown vastly in the previous 20 years, as droughts and floods have made farming less profitable and hundreds of thousands of climate-affected people have migrated in from rural areas. Many of them live with only patchy public transport, and endure dreadful air pollution and heat.</p> \n<p>This is the climate breakdown reality she was warned about at school, and why she skipped classes to join the great demonstrations of the 2030s. Back in October 2019, the <a href=\"https://www.c40.org/\">C40 group</a> of 94 global megacities had used IPCC and World Bank figures to forecast that 1.6 billion people living in over 970 world cities would be regularly exposed to extreme high temperatures by 2050.</p> \n<p>It said another 800 million people living in 570 cities would be vulnerable to sea level rise and coastal flooding, including the world\u2019s great coastal cities. And it also said that 2.5 billion people (or nearly one in four people on Earth) would be living in the over 1,600 cities where national food supplies were threatened by the climate crisis \u2013 including supposedly richer cities such as Athens, Barcelona, Istanbul and Los Angeles. These predictions proved to be accurate.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8d64565134033b8e92a08710571c426fcd2575ad\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d64565134033b8e92a08710571c426fcd2575ad/0_0_686_479/500.jpg\" alt=\"Urban Forest Strategy and Precinct Plans by City of Melbourne, winner of an award of excellence from the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects in 2016.\" width=\"500\" height=\"349\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Urban Forest Strategy and Precinct Plans by City of Melbourne, winner of an award of excellence from the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects in 2016.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: City of Melbourne</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Urban Forest Strategy and Precinct Plans by City of Melbourne, winner of an award of excellence from the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects in 2016.

But to get there we will need the full engagement of city governments combined with national action and support.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sadly, most governments did not pay much attention. It\u2019s easy to be wise in retrospect, but money spent then would have been the best investment ever made, she knows. Now the figures seem conservative.

      "bodyText": "She has barely ever been in a car, and never eaten meat or flown. Now 31, she lives on the 15th floor of a city centre tower from where she can just see the ocean 500 yards away on one side and the suburbs and informal settlements sprawling as far as the eye can see on the other. Life is OK in this megacity. She earns the exact median income and is as green as she feels she can be: she has no children yet, her carbon footprint is negligible, and her apartment, built in the early 2000s, has been retrofitted for climate change with deep insulation, its own solar air-con and heating systems. It has a \u201cliving\u201d wall of plants and a balcony where she grows a few vegetables. Waste is automatically sorted or composted. Outside it may be roasting, with temperatures often higher than 40C. Inside, she\u2019s cool. She loves where she lives, even though the water tastes slightly salty sometimes and there are often electricity outages in the summer months because of the frequent droughts affecting reservoir levels. Her windows catch the breeze, and because the mayor has adapted to climate change by banning cars across the whole city centre and no fossil fuels are burned nearby, there\u2019s little air pollution. She feels healthy. Food is expensive because of the massive floods and droughts that have affected the world\u2019s main food-growing areas, but most of hers is organically grown and is delivered by drone from the nearby 20-storey \u201cfarmscraper\u201d built 10 years ago. Most cities of this size grow as much of their own food as possible these days, as a way to reduce transport emissions. Artist\u2019s impression of \u2018farmscrapers\u2019, designed by architect firm Vincent Callebaut. Image: Solent News/REX/Shutterstock To make extra money last year, she traded in her annual government carbon and meat quotas. Short-haul flights have been stopped anyway, and like everyone her age, she is allowed just one return flight a year. But she doesn\u2019t need to travel much now. The city authorities have thrown money at protecting infrastructure and helping people adapt to the higher temperatures and ever more frequent storms. The green spaces have been re-wilded. She can walk safely down the shady, tree-lined streets, cool off in the lido, or visit the urban forest, which the far-sighted city mayor started 20 years ago on wasteland. But now she really worries. She may have adapted her own life as far as possible to climate change, but so much is out of her control. The world\u2019s population has grown by 2.5 billion people since she was born in 2019, and carbon concentrations reached the 550 ppm (parts per million) milestone last year \u2013 just as the IPCC scientists had forecast they would. They were just 407 ppm when she was born. Despite some international action on climate change, global warming passed the 1.5C mark \u2013 considered the maximum for long-term safety \u2013 in 2040 and is now heading inexorably for 3C or 3.5C, possibly within 100 years. That is really dangerous and means food and water will be scarcer, the rains will be heavier, and even more people will flood in from rural areas to the city. Worst of all, the continuing loss of ice at the poles and in the great mountain ranges means sea levels are rising faster than most would have believed possible 30 years ago. The last great superstorm, caused by extraordinarily warm temperatures in the Arctic, flooded miles of coastal settlements and forced the permanent evacuation of dozens of expensive ocean-side apartment blocks. Waves crashed 100 metres beyond the new, higher sea walls. That\u2019s when her water started to taste salty. Perhaps the time has come for her to sell up and migrate to higher land, she thinks. She has been told that the underground water supplies to her tower block are beginning to be polluted with seawater and might only last 10 years, and that her tower could be deemed unsafe to live in within 20 years because of flooding. But it\u2019s far worse in most parts of the city. There the extremely poor don\u2019t live in strong houses, and can\u2019t build higher walls, relocate, borrow money or adapt so easily.

Every year her apartment is worth less because it is so close to the ocean; property on higher ground now attracts premium prices. Her city has grown vastly in the previous 20 years, as droughts and floods have made farming less profitable and hundreds of thousands of climate-affected people have migrated in from rural areas. Many of them live with only patchy public transport, and endure dreadful air pollution and heat. This is the climate breakdown reality she was warned about at school, and why she skipped classes to join the great demonstrations of the 2030s. Back in October 2019, the C40 group of 94 global megacities had used IPCC and World Bank figures to forecast that 1.6 billion people living in over 970 world cities would be regularly exposed to extreme high temperatures by 2050. It said another 800 million people living in 570 cities would be vulnerable to sea level rise and coastal flooding, including the world\u2019s great coastal cities. And it also said that 2.5 billion people (or nearly one in four people on Earth) would be living in the over 1,600 cities where national food supplies were threatened by the climate crisis \u2013 including supposedly richer cities such as Athens, Barcelona, Istanbul and Los Angeles. These predictions proved to be accurate. Urban Forest Strategy and Precinct Plans by City of Melbourne, winner of an award of excellence from the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects in 2016. Photograph: City of Melbourne Her city did its best to adapt, inspired perhaps by a report from the Coalition for Urban Transitions, backed by some of the world\u2019s leading economists, that showed that governments that invested in low-carbon cities could not just help mitigate the effects of the climate crisis but could also massively enhance economic prosperity, attract the most talented people \u2013 and, not incidentally, make cities far better places to live. Permanently cutting 90% of urban emissions in 2019 would have cost the world $1.8tn but would have been generating annual returns of $7tn by now, it said. \u201cCities are engines of growth, innovation and prosperity,\u201d Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, then UN secretary general, had said. \u201cIt is possible and realistic to realise net-zero emissions by 2050. But to get there we will need the full engagement of city governments combined with national action and support.\u201d Sadly, most governments did not pay much attention. It\u2019s easy to be wise in retrospect, but money spent then would have been the best investment ever made, she knows. Now the figures seem conservative. Now it is a race against time. How likely is this future? By 2050, cities will be home to over 70% of the world population. The great global challenge is to adapt them to the changing climate and reduce emissions. That means conserving water, planting trees, banning fossil fuels, changing diets, adapting farming, improving soils, reducing air pollution which contributes to warming, and even painting buildings white to reflect heat. Many north European cities have started to ditch diesel and petrol, ban cars and plastic and turn to renewable power, aiming to be \u201ccarbon-zero\u201d. Seoul is planting 30m trees and expanding its green spaces vastly to create shade; Melbourne and many other Australian and British cities will benefit from ambitious street tree-planting programmes. Denmark, one of the most urban of all European countries, aims to cut emissions by 70% by 2030; its capital, Copenhagen, aims to be carbon-neutral by 2025.

Mistral was awarded for his \u201cfresh originality and true inspiration of his poetic production\u201d whereas Eizaguirre \u2013 a playwright, mathematician and engineer \u2013 won for his plays that revived \u201cthe great traditions of the Spanish drama.\u201d</li> <li><strong>1917: </strong>Danish scholar and poet Karl Adolph Gejellerup split the prize with Henrik Pontoppidan as there was no award being given the following year due to war.</li> <li><strong>1966:</strong> Nelly Sachs and Shmuel Yosef Agnon won. Collecting her award, Sachs said that Agnon represented Israel whereas \u201cI represent the tragedy of the Jewish people.\u201d</li> <li><strong>1974:</strong> Swedish writers Harry Martinson and Eyvind Johnson \u2013 who also happened to be members of the Swedish Academy \u2013 won \u201cfor writings that catch the dewdrop and reflect the cosmos\u201d.

Here is my colleague Alison Flood\u2019s news story on the prize, which will be updated throughout the day as we get reactions: The 2019 Nobel peace prize will be announced on Friday at 11am CEST (10am BST). One of Olga Tokarczuk\u2019s translators has been in touch: Jennifer Croft, who most recently translated Flights (which won the 2018 Man Booker International prize). Croft says: \u201cI\u2019m so thrilled for Olga and so excited for all the new readers who are bound to discover her delicate, powerful, beautifully nuanced novels and short stories thanks to the prize.\u201d Handke also called for the Nobel to be abolished in 2014, saying it was a \u201cfalse canonisation\u201d of literature. \u201cThe Nobel prize should finally be abolished,\u201d he told Austrian newspaper Die Presse, adding that though it delivered \u201ca moment of attention, six pages in the newspaper\u201d, he did not admire the choices. Was he just a sore loser? \u201cOf course it\u2019s [a prize] that bothers you, then you\u2019re annoying yourself because you think about it. It\u2019s so unworthy, and at the same time you\u2019re just so unworthy of it.\u201d The choice of Peter Handke seems incredibly strange, given the Nobel committee had shown so many indications of moving away from incendiary laureates. While initially left-leaning in his youth, his increasingly pro-Milosevic stance saw many writers distance themselves from him in the 1990s. After the end of the three-year Serbian siege of Sarajevo, he claimed that the Muslims had staged their own massacres in Sarajevo and had blamed this on the Serbs. Then, Alain Finkielkraut, the Paris intellectual, said Handke had become \u201can ideological monster\u201d, while Slavoj Zizek \u2013 who is Slovene \u2013 said Handke\u2019s \u201cglorification of the Serbs is cynicism\u201d. And Susan Sontag, who had spent several months in Sarajevo during the Bosnian war staging a performance of Waiting For Godot, said that Handke was now \u201cfinished\u201d in New York. The Austrian playwright and author is a more controversial decision than Tokarczuk. His selection come days after the Swedish Academy promised to move away from the \u201cmale-oriented\u201d and \u201cEurocentric\u201d past of the Nobel prize in literature. Handke doesn\u2019t change either of those directions. His bibliography contains novels, essays, note books, dramatic works and screenplays. He has lived in Paris since the 1990s, and is most famous for his play The Hour We Knew Nothing of Each Other (completely dialogue free), his screenwriting credit for Wim Wenders\u2019 Wings of Desire and particularly the novel Die Wiederholung (Repetition). Handke, who has Slovenic origins on the maternal side, famously gave a speech at the 2006 funeral of Serbian war criminal Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, a decision that was criticised widely. His nomination for the Heinrich Heine prize that same year was eventually withdrawn due to his political views. His 2014 win of the International Ibsen award was also met by protests in Oslo. The Nobel committee have ended the press conference by confirming that both authors each win 9m Swedish krona (\u00a3746,678). \u201cIt is a full prize,\u201d one judge said, slightly rattled that we haven\u2019t all got the hang of this two prize thing yet. We\u2019ve been told Tokarczuk is currently on the train in Germany. Blimey. Let\u2019s hope they have some bubbly on board. Who is Olga Tokarczuk? Torkarczuk is a surprising, but an excellent choice. The judges are describing her as \u201ca writer preoccupied by local life ... but looking at earth from above ... her work is full of wit and cunning.\u201d Aside from her novels, which are wide-ranging and brilliantly translated into English by Antonia Lloyd-Jones and Jennifer Croft, she also has political heft. As public intellectual, feminist vegetarian, she has frequently rankled the conservative edges of Poland. In a television interview after she won the Nike award (Poland\u2019s Booker equivalent), Tokarczuk outraged rightwing patriots by saying that, contrary to its self-image as a plucky survivor of oppression, Poland itself had committed \u201chorrendous acts\u201d of colonisation at times in its history. She was branded a \u201ctargowiczanin\u201d \u2013 an ancient term for traitor \u2013 and her publisher had to hire bodyguards for a while to protect her. Read a recent interview with her here. The panel have emerged to explain their decision making. This is far more open process already than previous years. The 2018 Nobel has been awarded to the Polish author Olga Tokarczuk \u2013 who won the 2018 Man Booker International prize for her novel Flights \u2013 \u201cfor a narrative imagination that with encyclopedic passion represents the crossing of boundaries as a form of life.\u201d The 2019 Nobel has been awarded to the Austrian author Peter Handke \u201cfor an influential work that with linguistic ingenuity has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience.\u201d How exciting. With the head of the Swedish Academy promising to move away from the prize\u2019s \u201cmale-oriented\u201d past, its important to remember that only 14 women have won, compared with 113 men. Only one laureate \u2013 the late Toni Morrison \u2013 is a woman of colour. The 14 women who have won are: Selma Lagerlof, 1909 Grazia Deledda, 1926 Sigrid Undset, 1928 Pearl Buck, 1938 Gabriela Mistral, 1945 Nelly Sachs, 1966 Nadine Gordimer, 1991 Toni Morrison, 1993 Wislawa Szymborska, 1996 Elfriede Jelinek, 2004 Doris Lessing, 2007 Herta Muller, 2009 Alice Munro, 2013 Svetlana Alexievich, 2015 If you need a last minute refresher as to why we have two Nobel laureates this year, Jon Henley has produced this summary: The Swedish Academy, founded in 1786, is thought likely to try to avoid any controversy as it seeks to rebuild its reputation after the scandal exposed harassment, furious infighting, conflicts of interest and a culture of secrecy among its 18 members, who are elected for life and seen as the country\u2019s guardians of culture. The poet Katarina Frostenson was among seven academy members who left the body after bitter rows over how to handle rape accusations made in 2017 against her husband, Frenchman Jean-Claude Arnault, who was also accused of leaking the names of several prize winners. The couple ran a cultural club in Stockholm that was part-funded by the academy, and several of the assaults committed by Arnault \u2013 who is now serving a prison sentence for rape \u2013 took place in academy-owned properties. The academy has since made changes that it says will improve transparency, including allowing members to voluntarily resign, which they could not previously do. It has also pledged to review its lifetime membership policy and appointed five members to its selection committee from outside the body. A late but worthy contender. You can watch it at the top of this liveblog. You can enjoy 10 minutes of nervous chatter among journalists. The Japanese novelist is a frequent frontrunner for the prize. Last year, he withdrew from the New Academy award \u2013 the one off replacement for the Nobel in 2018 \u2013 citing a wish to concentrate on his writing. Then, the New Academy said in a statement that Murakami had emailed them saying that it was a great honour to be shortlisted. But \u201cMurakami then said his preference is to concentrate on his writing, away from media attention \u2026 The New Academy regrets but respects his decision.\u201d Will he accept the Nobel if it finally comes his way this year? Fans certainly hope so. Will this be the Canadian poet\u2019s year? Bookmakers\u2019 odds aren\u2019t as reliable as they used to be, but Carson has been rising steadily for the last week. And it\u2019s not hard to see why. Writing in the Guardian about her verse-novel Red Doc&gt; in 2013 , Sarah Crown was emphatic: \u201cCarson is, simply, one of the very best.\u201d A poet, essayist, translator, librettist and classical scholar, Carson is as daring with form as she is deft with emotion. When Daphne Merkin reviewed The Beauty of the Husband, which glories in the subtitle \u201cA Fictional Essay in 29 Tangos\u201d, she recalled how Carson\u2019s writing had been unclassifiable from the start, \u201ceven by today\u2019s motley, genre-bending standards. Was she writing poetry? Prose? Prose poems? Fiction? Nonfiction? Did even her publishers know for sure?\u201d \u201cWhat her fellow poets would do well to ask themselves,\u201d Merkin concluded, \u201cis not whether what Carson is writing can or cannot be called poetry, but how has she succeeded in making it \u2013 whatever label you give it \u2013 so thrillingly new?\u201d Another annual tradition set to return with the Nobel is people posing as contenders on Twitter to catch out lazy journalists. As we said earlier, Guadeloupean novelist Maryse Cond\u00e9 is the current favourite (not that that always helps you win the Nobel). Last year, she was the first and only winner of the New Academy prize in literature, a one-off award intended to fill the void left by the cancellation of the Nobel. The author of some 20 novels, including Desirada, Segu and Crossing the Mangrove, Cond\u00e9 was praised by New Academy chair of judges Ann P\u00e5lsson as a \u201cgrand storyteller\u201d who \u201cbelongs to world literature\u201d. \u201cShe describes the ravages of colonialism and the post-colonial chaos in a language which is both precise and overwhelming,\u201d P\u00e5lsson said. \u201cThe dead live in her stories closely to the living in a \u2026 world where gender, race and class are constantly turned over in new constellations.\u201d Speaking on a video played at a ceremony in Stockholm, Cond\u00e9 said she was \u201cvery happy and proud\u201d to win the award. \u201cBut please allow me to share it with my family, my friends and above all the people of Guadeloupe, who will be thrilled and touched seeing me receive this prize,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are such a small country, only mentioned when there are hurricanes or earthquakes and things like that. Now we are so happy to be recognised for something else.\u201d The average age of a Nobel literature laureate is 67. As the 87-year-old Doris Lessing famously remarked, on being told of her win as she emerged from a London taxi in 2007: \u201cOh Christ. It\u2019s been going on for 30 years. One can get more excited.\u201d No matter who wins today, no one will ever top that reaction. One writer whose name has been thrown around as a possible winner is British fantasy author Neil Gaiman. Gaiman is unconvinced. \u201c I think the odds are slightly higher that I will wake up to find myself transformed into a giant cockroach,\u201d he said on Twitter last night. The son of perennial contender Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong\u2019o is more hopeful. \u201cI am so confident that my father will win The Nobel Prize in Literature this year that the only question I have is where he will hang the medal!\u201d Mukoma wa Ng\u0169g\u0129 wrote on Twitter earlier this week. The 79-year-old French writer is the author of several acclaimed works of \u201cauto-fiction\u201d \u2013 a blend of autobiographical detail and novelistic storytelling. Her most recent works translated in English are The Years (translated by Alison L Strayer), which tells the story of France from 1941 to the present day through the thread of one woman\u2019s life; and Happening (translated by Tanya Leslie), the harrowing story of her illegal abortion as a student in Rouen in 1963. In France, she is regarded as perhaps the greatest chronicler of French society in the last 50 years, and is one of the few women on France\u2019s male-dominated high school literature syllabuses. In a recent interview with the Guardian, she explained her work thusly: \u201cIn the autobiographical tradition we speak about ourselves and the events are the background. I have reversed this [...] The events in my book belong to everyone, to history, to sociology.\u201d Ernaux has stacked up awards in recent years, winning the Marguerite Yourcenar award, the Premio Hemingway and the Prix Formentor, and landing a shortlist spot on this year\u2019s Man Booker International prize. With only 14 women having triumphed so far in a prize whose history stretches back almost 120 years, the award is still a long way off from gender parity. Even the chair of the Nobel committee, Anders Olsson, admits the jury needs to \u201cwiden our perspective\u201d. \u201cPreviously it was much more male-oriented,\u201d Olsson said. \u201cNow we have so many female writers who are really great, so we hope the prize and the whole process of the prize has been intensified and is much broader in its scope.\u201d But maybe we shouldn\u2019t expect too much. Putting aside the troubling implication that only \u201cnow\u201d do we have \u201cfemale writers who are really great\u201d, it\u2019s not the first time the Swedish Academy has declared they may be able to find one or two authors who might not be blokes. Rewind to 2011, when Peter Englund \u2013 then permanent secretary of the Nobel Academy \u2013 admitted on the Guardian Books podcast that the fact Herta M\u00fcller was only the 12th female laureate weighed on his shoulders. Like Olsson, Englund proclaimed that the Academy must \u201creach out\u201d. But he rejected any suggestion of positive discrimination, claiming it would be \u201cdisastrous for the prize and it would really be disastrous for the one who got the prize\u201d. After all his talk about the need for the Academy to open up, who did the panel select in 2011? Tomas Transtr\u00f6mer. Two Nobel literature laureates have been named on four previous occasions: 1904: France\u2019s Frederic Mistral and Spain\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Echegaray y Eizaguirre. Mistral was awarded for his \u201cfresh originality and true inspiration of his poetic production\u201d whereas Eizaguirre \u2013 a playwright, mathematician and engineer \u2013 won for his plays that revived \u201cthe great traditions of the Spanish drama.\u201d 1917: Danish scholar and poet Karl Adolph Gejellerup split the prize with Henrik Pontoppidan as there was no award being given the following year due to war. 1966: Nelly Sachs and Shmuel Yosef Agnon won. Collecting her award, Sachs said that Agnon represented Israel whereas \u201cI represent the tragedy of the Jewish people.\u201d 1974: Swedish writers Harry Martinson and Eyvind Johnson \u2013 who also happened to be members of the Swedish Academy \u2013 won \u201cfor writings that catch the dewdrop and reflect the cosmos\u201d. This decision was widely mocked as nepotism and, four years later, Martinson killed himself. Hiatuses have usually been the result of war, like in 1914, 1918 and 1940. When it was announced that there would be no 2018 laureate, the Academy said it was merely being postponed, as it has been on seven other occasions. \u201cNothing is changed in our work except the announcement of a laureate, which is postponed until early October next year along with that year\u2019s laureate. A procedure not unusual,\u201d Nobel chairman Per W\u00e4stberg said then, recalling when another such postponement resulted in William Faulkner and Bertrand Russell rolling up together, \u201cRussell in splendid witty form, Faulkner basically drunk.\u201d The LRB is already on fine form. (No, that\u2019s not a real news story.) At Ladbrokes (as of last Friday), Guadeloupean author (and the winner of last year\u2019s, one-off New Academy award to replace the usual Nobel) Maryse Cond\u00e9 is topping the odds at 4/1. She is followed by Lyudmila Ulitskaya at 5/1, and Haruki Murakami and Margaret Atwood, both at 6/1. \u201cWith the exception of Murakami who is seemingly always the bridesmaid when it comes to Nobel literature runners and riders, the top of betting is dominated by female writers,\u201d said Jessica O\u2019Reilly of Ladbrokes. \u201cLiterary punters are convinced that at least one, if not both, awards will be won by women this time around, with Conde and Ulitskaya heavily backed for success.\u201d Other contenders include Ngugi Wa Thiong\u2019o at 8/1, Anne Carson, Ko Un and Javier Marias at 10/1, Yan Lianke at 12/1, and Amos Oz and Don DeLillo at 16/1. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that the favourite hasn\u2019t won the Nobel for at least the last few years. When Kazuo Ishiguro took the most recent prize in 2017, Thiong\u2019o and Murakami were topping the odds \u2013 as they were when Bob Dylan won in 2016. In previous years, however, last-minute favourites have gone on to take the prize: in 2008, a run on betting on Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clezio led to suspicions of a leak, in 2009, Herta M\u00fcller zoomed up the rankings on the morning of the prize, as did Tomas Transtr\u00f6mer in 2011. According to Dagens Nyheter, an internal investigation by the Swedish Academy concluded that Jean-Claude Arnault, the man at the centre of the sexual abuse and financial misconduct scandal that postponed last year\u2019s prize, may have leaked the names of at least seven laureates. Welcome to day four of the 2019 Nobel prizes! Losing steam yet? Hopefully not - as today we see the return of the Nobel prize in literature and, for the first time in more than 40 years, two laureates named due to the scandal that cancelled last year\u2019s prize. (More on that later.) We had the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine on Monday, physics on Tuesday and chemistry on Wednesday. But today is all about authors (or maybe a musician who has \u201ccreated new poetic expressions\u201d, everything is permissible now). So if you have written a cracking bunch of books (or if your wife did it for you), stay close to your phone. Everyone else, please join us for the live announcement, comment and analysis. We\u2019ll find out the winners around 12pm BST.",

      "body": "<p>For Barb Binder, the bad news arrived with a knock on the door. That\u2019s when she learned from a local activist that a patch of open public space across from her \u201cforever home\u201d in Broomfield County, the Denver suburb where she and her husband planned to retire, was about to become an industrial site.</p> \n<p>Initially, she was comforted by the thought that state officials would not possibly allow residential hydraulic fracturing \u2013 or fracking, as it is known \u2013 to begin if it was not safe.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e182ee5f-c378-4474-b7da-79f6b0a671b3\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis \u2013 some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear.<br></p>\n    <p>The investigation has involved more than 20 Guardian journalists working across the world for the past six months.</p>\n    <p>The project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965. The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the <a href=\"http://climateaccountability.org/\">Climate Accountability Institute</a>,&nbsp;calculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers. Heede said: \"The fact that consumers combust the fuels to carbon dioxide, water, heat and pollutants does not absolve the fossil fuel companies from responsibility for knowingly perpetuating the carbon era and accelerating the climate crisis toward the existential threat it has now become.\"</p>\n    <p>One aim of the project is to move the focus of debate from individual responsibilities to power structures \u2013 so our reporters also examined the financial and lobbying structures that let fossil fuel firms keep growing, and discovered which elected politicians were voting for change.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Another aim of the project is to press governments and corporations to close the gap between ambitious long-term promises and lacklustre short-term action. The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating. Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But two years on Binder feels naive for being so trusting. She believes her asthma has become worse since the construction near her home began, and blames the drilling mud that has been used on the site. And then there is the constant worry. </p> \n<p>\u201cI had to educate myself about exactly what\u2019s involved in industrial-scale fracking,\u201d she says. \u201cIt meant looking at the dangers \u2013 the fires, the explosions, the toxic releases, and recognising: \u2018Oh my God, I am going to be living right next to this.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Binder now spends most of her free time opposing the plans of Extraction Oil and Gas, the Denver-based company that has plans to construct 84 wells around her neighbourhood, 16 of them \u201cliterally\u201d \u2013 she says \u2013 in her backyard.</p> \n<p>She is not alone. Since the advent of the fracking boom in oil-rich Colorado \u2013 where there has been a fivefold increase in oil and gas production since 2008 \u2013 new wells and production sites have sprung up around residential neighbourhoods in the Front Range faster than environmental researchers can track them.</p> \n<p>There are 40,000 active and inactive wells across the Denver basin, and new permits issued every month for more.

      "bodyText": "For Barb Binder, the bad news arrived with a knock on the door. That\u2019s when she learned from a local activist that a patch of open public space across from her \u201cforever home\u201d in Broomfield County, the Denver suburb where she and her husband planned to retire, was about to become an industrial site. Initially, she was comforted by the thought that state officials would not possibly allow residential hydraulic fracturing \u2013 or fracking, as it is known \u2013 to begin if it was not safe. But two years on Binder feels naive for being so trusting. She believes her asthma has become worse since the construction near her home began, and blames the drilling mud that has been used on the site. And then there is the constant worry. \u201cI had to educate myself about exactly what\u2019s involved in industrial-scale fracking,\u201d she says. \u201cIt meant looking at the dangers \u2013 the fires, the explosions, the toxic releases, and recognising: \u2018Oh my God, I am going to be living right next to this.\u2019\u201d Binder now spends most of her free time opposing the plans of Extraction Oil and Gas, the Denver-based company that has plans to construct 84 wells around her neighbourhood, 16 of them \u201cliterally\u201d \u2013 she says \u2013 in her backyard. She is not alone. Since the advent of the fracking boom in oil-rich Colorado \u2013 where there has been a fivefold increase in oil and gas production since 2008 \u2013 new wells and production sites have sprung up around residential neighbourhoods in the Front Range faster than environmental researchers can track them. There are 40,000 active and inactive wells across the Denver basin, and new permits issued every month for more. They are built close to schools, playgrounds, and clusters of family homes. The boom has coincided with anecdotal tales of ill-effects \u2013 from children\u2019s nosebleeds to asthma \u2013 and a health study that shows more children being born with congenital heart defects in areas of Colorado with high-intensity oil and gas activity compared with areas where there is low or no activity. Extraction Oil and Gas told the Guardian it had used new technologies to \u201cminimise the impact of oil and gas development\u201d in the Front Range, compared with the way oil was extracted in previous decades. A spokesperson said the company had learned some lessons from an incident on its Livingston site, after it voluntarily switched a drilling fluid it had been using because residents complained about the odour. It said air monitoring results had found \u201cno health impact\u201d from the smell. \u201cTo date, all published air-quality monitoring results have been stellar, and conclusively show that any effects of our development on the air we breathe are negligible,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe understand that there will always be those who oppose all oil and gas development whatsoever, or want to \u2018leave it in the ground\u2019, but we will continue our endeavours to minimise impacts of developing the energy we all use each day \u2013 and we will never stop innovating for the betterment of Colorado and our state\u2019s economy.\u201d Yet the conflicts \u2013 between industry and residents, and sometimes neighbour versus neighbour \u2013 have felt, in the words of the local reporter Chase Woodruff, like a \u201ccivil war\u201d at times. And there have been accidents. In 2017, two men were killed, and a woman and child injured, after a house in Firestone, Colorado, exploded because of a leak of \u201cfugitive gas\u201d from an uncapped pipeline that was connected to a gas well near the home. Erin Martinez, who lost her husband and brother in the blast, has moved house again after a new well began construction across from her home. Environmental researchers from the not-for-profit Earthworks group travel from site to site in what sometimes seems like a game of whack-a-mole, using a special gas-finding imaging camera to track, document, and report what they describe as plumes of pollution that are being emitted from the sites, in what they claim is evidence of dangerous releases of methane and other volatile organic compounds that are not visible to the naked eye. Oil companies have claimed that the plumes are not evidence of toxic emissions. The industry has claimed the plumes are a \u201cheat signature\u201d caused by high temperature drilling mud. Dozens of complaints have been filed to state authorities, but regulators have deemed that most of those emissions are in the allowable range. One proposal that would have forced oil and gas wells to be located at least 2,500ft (760 metres) \u2013 or half a mile \u2013 from homes and other buildings was voted down on a ballot initiative last year by a vote of 58% to 42%, in a significant blow to anti-fracking activists. Oil and gas advocates argue the \u201csetback\u201d proposal would have decimated their operations in Colorado, in effect barring new drilling from the Denver suburbs where nine in 10 new wells are being constructed. Colorado Rising, one of the leading activist groups in the state, reportedly raised about $1.2m (\u00a31m) to support the initiative, but were outspent when \u2013 activists say \u2013 industry sources pumped $41m into the race. Opponents of fracking have, however, won one big victory since then. Last April, Colorado\u2019s new Democratic governor, Jared Polis, signed a new mandate into law that forced one of the state\u2019s most powerful institutions, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC), to completely upend its mission. Instead of fostering the oil and gas industry, Senate bill 181 (SB181) has forced the COGCC to regulate it, with a specific priority on public health and safety and focus on the environment. The new law has raised questions: about whether a state with deep ties to the fossil fuel industry can ever really change, and whether fears about the climate crisis, and the ill-effects of fracking, will ever make a difference. For years, the oil sector has argued that Colorado needs the multibillion-dollar industry and the hundreds of thousands of job it sustains. Sara Loflin, the executive director of the League of Oil and Gas Impacted Coloradans, a campaigning group that helped get SB181 passed, says the legislation was a product of decades of Coloradans living with oil and gas in their communities, and seeing the effect of its pollution: the industrial waste, the bad air, the noise, and the constant low thumping vibrations that have made residents physically ill. For years, Loflin told the Guardian, locals who were concerned about debris from abandoned sites, or the way soil at a local playground had changed colour, would have to make more than a dozen calls to get answers from public officials, and still be treated with hostility. Now her organisation is seeking to remind local governments, who have also been given more power under SB181, that they have \u201cthe jurisdiction, the right, and the responsibility\u201d to say no to new permits if health and safety is jeopardised. But despite its legal firepower, there is no sign of rapid change within the Colorado market. At a recent meeting of the COGCC in Thornton, on an unseasonably hot autumn day, residents\u2019 frustrations were aimed at Jeff Robbins, the director of the COGCC, who was appointed by Polis.

The 46-year-old was also born in India but became a British citizen in 2014 and has lived in the UK and worked in the NHS for 15 years.</p> <p>Warikoo has argued that because he is her only child and she is widowed and has no family in India who could look after her, she should be allowed to stay so he can take care of her.</p> <p>Warikoo has appealed directly to Boris Johnson and the home secretary, Priti Patel, to help resolve the situation. He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nwarik/status/1181120122674659328\">tweeted </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nwarik/status/1181120122674659328\"> them</a> on Monday asking for help. \u201cI am a British citizen, NHS consultant, and a researcher. Have cared for thousands of children with mental health problems, saved many young lives and helped thousands of families in distress. Now my family is forced to leave the country. Help please.\u201d</p> <p>Warikoo has resolved that if the Home Office does not decide on his mother\u2019s case by December, or if they refuse her leave to remain, he, his wife, their British-born 13-year-old daughter and his mother will leave before Christmas.</p> <p>The application for Phoola Warikoo to remain is also based on a section of <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/779598/Immigration_Rules_-_Archive_10-01-2019.pdf)\">the immigration rules </a>which says that somone can be allowed to stay if a child \u2013 in this case her granddaughter Soham \u2013 would be left in distress if they did not do so.</p> <p>\u201cHer [his mother] leaving the country would cause severe distress to a child \u2013 Soham \u2013 directly as she will be separated from her grandmother and indirectly as she [Soham] will be uprooted from her home country\u201d, added Warikoo.</p> <p>He has already been offered a job and immediate permanent residency for himself, his wife and daughter in Australia, and a visa for his mother to stay in the country.</p> <p>Warikoo told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s very stressful for us as a family. We don\u2019t want to leave the country. But we are being forced to because we are in this limbo state. The Home Office have displayed an almost callous attitude to this case.</p> <p>\u201cI need to know as soon as possible if my mother is going to be allowed to stay or not, because I can\u2019t take this any more. I have worked so hard for young people and families in Britain in my time here and now I want some support from the system for my family, for it to show a bit of flexibility.\u201d</p> <p>Last week the Home Office backtracked on a plan to deport a Taiwan-born but British-educated and NHS-funded GP trainee, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/02/home-office-in-u-turn-over-nhs-doctor-facing-deportation\">Dr Mu-Chun Chiang</a>, for making a minor error in her application for a Tier 2 working visa. Medical groups, including the Royal College of GPs, criticised its initial decision as \u201cludicrous\u201d, heavy-handed and short-sighted, given the deepening shortage of family doctors across the NHS.</p> <p>The Guardian reported this week how CAMHS services are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/07/mental-healthcare-hit-by-alarming-shortage-of-psychiatrists\">among the areas of mental healthcare that are struggling</a> with a growing lack of specialist psychiatrists.</p> <p>For years, Warikoo\u2019s mother visited him on six-month visitor\u2019s visas. However, she may no longer qualify for them because she had applied for leave to remain, he said.</p> <p>A spokesman for Sussex Partnership NHS mental health trust, where Warikoo works, said: \u201cDr Nishchint Warikoo is a valued member of our team and a highly regarded consultant psychiatrist. As his employer, we are offering every support we can during this difficult time for him and his family.\u201d</p> <p>Colleagues have voiced outrage on social media that he may leave Britain and asked the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the bosses of NHS England to help. One tweeted: \u201cThis is just unbelievable. We have a crisis with the CAMHS workforce in this country already. Can we really afford to lose dedicated consultants like Nishchint?\u201d</p> <p>Another said: \u201cThis is absolutely ridiculous. Someone needs to take action and fast. Our mental health system will cripple and lives will be at risk.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cAll visa applications are considered on their individual merits and on the basis of the evidence available. This case is under review and we will be in contact with the applicant in due course.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A leading children\u2019s psychiatrist plans to quit the NHS and move to Australia because of the Home Office\u2019s \u201calmost callous\u201d refusal to let his mother stay in Britain. Dr Nishchint Warikoo, the lead psychiatrist for child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) in Hampshire, said he and his family were being \u201cforced to leave\u201d the UK in order to stay together. Warikoo is angry and frustrated that several years of representations have failed to persuade the Home Office to allow his 71-year-old Indian-born mother, Phoola, to remain in Britain. The 46-year-old was also born in India but became a British citizen in 2014 and has lived in the UK and worked in the NHS for 15 years. Warikoo has argued that because he is her only child and she is widowed and has no family in India who could look after her, she should be allowed to stay so he can take care of her. Warikoo has appealed directly to Boris Johnson and the home secretary, Priti Patel, to help resolve the situation. He tweeted them on Monday asking for help. \u201cI am a British citizen, NHS consultant, and a researcher. Have cared for thousands of children with mental health problems, saved many young lives and helped thousands of families in distress. Now my family is forced to leave the country. Help please.\u201d Warikoo has resolved that if the Home Office does not decide on his mother\u2019s case by December, or if they refuse her leave to remain, he, his wife, their British-born 13-year-old daughter and his mother will leave before Christmas. The application for Phoola Warikoo to remain is also based on a section of the immigration rules which says that somone can be allowed to stay if a child \u2013 in this case her granddaughter Soham \u2013 would be left in distress if they did not do so. \u201cHer [his mother] leaving the country would cause severe distress to a child \u2013 Soham \u2013 directly as she will be separated from her grandmother and indirectly as she [Soham] will be uprooted from her home country\u201d, added Warikoo. He has already been offered a job and immediate permanent residency for himself, his wife and daughter in Australia, and a visa for his mother to stay in the country. Warikoo told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s very stressful for us as a family. We don\u2019t want to leave the country. But we are being forced to because we are in this limbo state. The Home Office have displayed an almost callous attitude to this case. \u201cI need to know as soon as possible if my mother is going to be allowed to stay or not, because I can\u2019t take this any more. I have worked so hard for young people and families in Britain in my time here and now I want some support from the system for my family, for it to show a bit of flexibility.\u201d Last week the Home Office backtracked on a plan to deport a Taiwan-born but British-educated and NHS-funded GP trainee, Dr Mu-Chun Chiang, for making a minor error in her application for a Tier 2 working visa. Medical groups, including the Royal College of GPs, criticised its initial decision as \u201cludicrous\u201d, heavy-handed and short-sighted, given the deepening shortage of family doctors across the NHS. The Guardian reported this week how CAMHS services are among the areas of mental healthcare that are struggling with a growing lack of specialist psychiatrists. For years, Warikoo\u2019s mother visited him on six-month visitor\u2019s visas. However, she may no longer qualify for them because she had applied for leave to remain, he said. A spokesman for Sussex Partnership NHS mental health trust, where Warikoo works, said: \u201cDr Nishchint Warikoo is a valued member of our team and a highly regarded consultant psychiatrist. As his employer, we are offering every support we can during this difficult time for him and his family.\u201d Colleagues have voiced outrage on social media that he may leave Britain and asked the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the bosses of NHS England to help. One tweeted: \u201cThis is just unbelievable. We have a crisis with the CAMHS workforce in this country already. Can we really afford to lose dedicated consultants like Nishchint?\u201d Another said: \u201cThis is absolutely ridiculous. Someone needs to take action and fast. Our mental health system will cripple and lives will be at risk.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cAll visa applications are considered on their individual merits and on the basis of the evidence available. This case is under review and we will be in contact with the applicant in due course.\u201d",

Varadkar has said he thought it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d to secure an agreement by the time EU leaders met next Thursday but all efforts were focused on doing so because the stakes were so high. He also said the UK had \u201crepudiated\u201d the previous deal negotiated with Theresa May\u2019s government to ensure no hard border re-emerged on the island of Ireland because of Brexit. The British had \u201csort of put half of that now back on the table, and are saying that\u2019s a concession. And of course it isn\u2019t, really.\u201d Potzel\u2019s remarks confirm the EU and Germany\u2019s previously stated views on Johnson\u2019s latest proposal which involves scrapping the insurance policy for the Irish border in the event of trade talks collapsing after the UK formally leaves the EU. Under the prime minister\u2019s proposal, Northern Ireland would remain in the single market for goods and agrifood but leave the customs union, thereby necessitating checks on goods crossing the border. EU diplomats have said that customs infrastructure is unacceptable and Johnson\u2019s suggestion that checks could be \u201cdecentralised\u201d via online declarations and limited intelligence-led physical checks was a smuggler\u2019s charter. Hopes of a deal have faded since an anonymous No 10 source claimed Angela Merkel had told Johnson the Irish border issue could not be resolved unless Northern Ireland remained in the customs union and permanently aligned to the EU\u2019s rules for trading of goods. The source also claimed the German chancellor had said a deal based on the Johnson proposal was \u201coverwhelmingly unlikely\u201d, prompting the EU council president, Donald Tusk, to accuse the UK of playing a \u201cstupid blame game\u201d. The comments appeared to doom negotiations when seen in the context of an earlier anonymous briefing to the Spectator magazine, threatening hostilities against EU member states that did not back Johnson\u2019s wish to leave the EU on 31 October. Some believe the leaks from Downing Street are designed to advance a narrative that Johnson has done everything he can to reach a deal but a combination of irresponsible MPs and belligerent Brussels are forcing him into seeking an extension to article 50.",

The alarming but entertaining story of how a patient was flamb\u00e9ed on the operating table was told at Cheltenham literature festival by the leading heart surgeon and Guardian crossword setter, Samer Nashef. Nashef, a cardiac surgeon at Royal Papworth hospital in Cambridge, said the operation had been a perfectly straightforward coronary bypass and they were just about to close the patient\u2019s chest when the aorta dissected. That is \u201cone of the worst things; it basically transforms a straight operation into a very long and dangerous and tedious one\u201d.

Australia looked especially lively early on (and Nepal conversely, very nervous) with early goals suggesting the game could turn into a rout. Whether Australia eased off, or Nepal became more confident, as a spectacle the game quickly ebbed away in the second half.</p> <p>For coach Graham Arnold it was an opportunity to blood some new faces - a debut handed to former Olyroos protege Harry Souttar - while fringe players also got some decent minutes. With Chinese Taipei to come in five days time, the \u2018Roos boss spoke about the importance of building depth at the international level.</p> <p>The depth is definitely growing, the concern may well be however quality. That will be for another day, however, when the Socceroos face a much more difficult opponent.</p> <p>A credit to Nepal for sticking to the task, but it was a fairly straightforward affair. Two played, two won - the long march to Qatar in 2022 continues to build nicely.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d9f11178f084862358fb6e4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-10T11:08:35.618Z\">12.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And if you missed any of the action - here\u2019s the full-time write up:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/10/jamie-maclaren-hits-hat-trick-as-socceroos-stroll-to-win-over-nepal\">Jamie Maclaren hits hat-trick as Socceroos stroll to win over Nepal</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d9f10098f083d8b3b9d9502\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-10T11:07:54.132Z\">12.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The positives:</strong></p> <p>A hat-trick for Jamie Maclaren - great for the striker, who\u2019s translated his domestic FFA Cup form onto the international stage.</p> <p>A goal on debut for Harry Souttar, who troubled Nepal no-end with his height and strength from the set piece.</p> <p>A clean sheet, no injuries, some good minutes for fringe and younger Socceroos.</p> <p><strong>The negatives:</strong></p> <p>At times it looked limited in the build up - dangerous from the set piece, Australia created very few chances of real merit from open play.</p> <p>As Nepal became more compact, Australia reverted more to the flanks. Crosses are by definition a low-percentage play - against more well-organised defences the speed of ball will need to be much quicker and greater rotations and variety will be needed, especially through the middle.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d9f0f588f084862358fb6c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-10T11:03:25.554Z\">12.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A fun stat from Australia\u2019s pre-eminent football statistician, the one-and-only Andrew Howe:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AndyHowe_statto/status/1182248390798663680\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">almost missed this: Aziz Behich with his 21st consecutive <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Socceroos?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Socceroos</a> start in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AUSvNEP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AUSvNEP</a> - this is most consecutive starts for any player since Alex Tobin 1999 (who ultimately made 22 straight starts in that streak)</p>&mdash; andrew howe (@AndyHowe_statto) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndyHowe_statto/status/1182248390798663680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 10, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a remarkable run - especially given the troubles Australia has had a left back over the past few years (or possibly ever since Scott Chipperfield hung up his boots).</p> <p>Alex Gersbach has struggled for consistent game time over the years in Europe, while Jason Davidson appears to have fallen down the pecking order.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t a five-star display from Behich, but it will do his confidence no harm to keep getting the starting nod.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d9f0e458f08b13ca7c77eac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-10T11:00:08.830Z\">12.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And with that result, Australia return to the top of Group B - two played, two won, eight scored, none conceded.</p> <p>There is of course a key group fixture taking place later today as Jordan play host to Kuwait.

      "bodyText": "Job done in Canberra, as nearly 20,000 fans go home happy as Australia secure a comfortable win against Asian minnows, Nepal. 76% possession and 36 shots at goal for the Socceroos - you can\u2019t window dress it, it was a mismatch. Australia looked especially lively early on (and Nepal conversely, very nervous) with early goals suggesting the game could turn into a rout. Whether Australia eased off, or Nepal became more confident, as a spectacle the game quickly ebbed away in the second half. For coach Graham Arnold it was an opportunity to blood some new faces - a debut handed to former Olyroos protege Harry Souttar - while fringe players also got some decent minutes. With Chinese Taipei to come in five days time, the \u2018Roos boss spoke about the importance of building depth at the international level. The depth is definitely growing, the concern may well be however quality. That will be for another day, however, when the Socceroos face a much more difficult opponent. A credit to Nepal for sticking to the task, but it was a fairly straightforward affair. Two played, two won - the long march to Qatar in 2022 continues to build nicely. And if you missed any of the action - here\u2019s the full-time write up: The positives: A hat-trick for Jamie Maclaren - great for the striker, who\u2019s translated his domestic FFA Cup form onto the international stage. A goal on debut for Harry Souttar, who troubled Nepal no-end with his height and strength from the set piece. A clean sheet, no injuries, some good minutes for fringe and younger Socceroos. The negatives: At times it looked limited in the build up - dangerous from the set piece, Australia created very few chances of real merit from open play. As Nepal became more compact, Australia reverted more to the flanks. Crosses are by definition a low-percentage play - against more well-organised defences the speed of ball will need to be much quicker and greater rotations and variety will be needed, especially through the middle. A fun stat from Australia\u2019s pre-eminent football statistician, the one-and-only Andrew Howe: It\u2019s a remarkable run - especially given the troubles Australia has had a left back over the past few years (or possibly ever since Scott Chipperfield hung up his boots). Alex Gersbach has struggled for consistent game time over the years in Europe, while Jason Davidson appears to have fallen down the pecking order. It wasn\u2019t a five-star display from Behich, but it will do his confidence no harm to keep getting the starting nod. And with that result, Australia return to the top of Group B - two played, two won, eight scored, none conceded. There is of course a key group fixture taking place later today as Jordan play host to Kuwait. They\u2019re the two stronger rivals in the pool, with Jordan the only other undefeated team at this early stage. There is of course a very preliminary feel to the Asian Football Confederation Second Round pool competition - don\u2019t forget, there\u2019s a whole another round of round robin clashes to come in the Third Round - you do however have to earn the right to participate in that, even if the quality of opposition can at times be a little less than desired. So - your thoughts on that performance, Socceroos fans? The result was of course pretty clear cut, but did Australia show enough against for when they\u2019ll face tougher opponents? Outside of an unfortunate own-goal there was very little goal threat in the second half until that 89th move involving Milligan, Irvine and Maclaren. Will that concern Graham Arnold? 90 + 1 min: Three minutes added on is the word from the touchline, and Australia push for one last goal, while Nepal for their part drop deeper yet. And there\u2019s the final whistle. Points secured, no injuries and a clean sheet. The Socceroos take one more step closer to Qatar - job done. 89 min: And there\u2019s his hat-trick! It\u2019s a clever flicked pass from Irvine off the chest, and Maclaren controls well to rifle home from close distance once again. Milligan the skipper fired the first ball in - a well-executed move from the Socceroos. 88 min: It\u2019s another freekick, and this time it\u2019s Mabil who strikes it - but it flies just over the crossbar! He\u2019s annoyed with himself, but in truth it wasn\u2019t a bad effort. 86 min: A final change, and it\u2019s the hard-working Bishal Rai that makes way, Santosh Tamang comes on. A set piece to Australia, and it\u2019s Hrustic whose standing over it. Has he got a Ronaldo-esque freekick in his locker? He hits it well, but it just clips the top of the wall. Danger averted. 85 min: All a little too static from the Socceroos, Nepal have looked increasingly comfortable this second half, channelling backwards to get plenty of bodies in the way centrally. 83 min: Mabil looks to fashion something, before it breaks for Giannou - but his driven effort is blocked. It almost leads to a good transition opportunity for Nepal, but Irvine nips in well to cut out the danger. 81 min: A fine ball into the box from Mabil, he\u2019s looked lively since coming on. It\u2019s patient from the Socceroos in build up once again, but the attempted cross-field ball is cut out. 78 min: A chance for Nepal to counter quickly, but the first-time ball wide is slightly overhit and it flies into touch. A second sub for the visitors, and it appears the striker Anjan Bista is making way for the defender Devendra Tamang. Not sure if there\u2019s a tactical adjustment, or whether personnel will shift positions to maintain the same structure. 75 min: Australia ready their third and final change, it looks like Awer Mabil is getting ready, presumably for Leckie? He\u2019s drifting deep, the Hertha Berlin man, looking to work some one-twos. And it is Leckie that makes way. 73 min: If you\u2019re the Socceroos coaching staff, would you be happy with the way play\u2019s been building up? They\u2019re reverting to a lot of crosses - obviously the aerial threat is an area of advantage - but has this come at the expense of attacks from more dangerous areas? 70 min: Some patient possession at the back for the Socceroos, Nepal are now starting to drop a little deeper. A nasty head clash, as Bailey Wright goes down. He\u2019s back on his feet, but doesn\u2019t take kindly to Gharti Magar\u2019s marginally late challenge. 68 min: 18,563 the official attendance in Canberra tonight. Not bad for a frosty eve in the nation\u2019s capital. And we could be about to see a second cap for another rising youngster, Ajdin Hrustic, who comes on to replace Goodwin. 66 min: And it\u2019s the Nepalese wonderkid - a surprise starter from the bench - Bimal Gharti Magar - who comes on. Let\u2019s see what threat he can pose the Socceroos backline. 63 min: A reminder, Australia will be in action again in five days time against Chinese Taipei, some Graham Arnold takes the opportunity to shuffle his pack. He\u2019s not looking entirely pleased on the sideline, the Socceroos coach. They\u2019ve not looked as dominant since the break, it must be said. 61 min: Ooph. Jackson Irvine just can\u2019t buy a goal tonight. They\u2019ve done well to get bodies in the way, Nepal, and it\u2019s another blocked shot, when the goal net beckoned! A first sub for Australia - it\u2019s Apostolos Giannou comes into the action, and a slight tactical adjustment, as the Socceroos switch to two up-front and the hard-working Mooy makes way. 58 min: IIt\u2019s the set piece once again that undoes Nepal - Souttar again rises highest to head goalwards. It\u2019s not the most convincing of headers, but it clips a player in blue en route to goal, and trickles agonisingly past Chemjong in goals. A heart-breaker for Nepal fans. A very sloppy and unfortunate goal to concede. 56 min: Some good scrapping in midfield, as Nepal look to contest possession. Perhaps a little more self-belief after the break? Coach Kalin might have had some inspirational words during the interval. And a corner for Australia, as Maclaren almost trickles home a clever jabbed effort. 53 min: An update on the half-time stats: Australia with over three-quarters of possession (77%), 20 shots, six on target and five corners. So pretty emphatic. SAVE! And now it\u2019s a terrific stop from the skipper - who denies Goodwin a debut goal in Socceroos colours. It was a fine header from an acute angle, but the \u2018keeper made himself big and blocked well. 50 min: And it\u2019s a corner to Nepal - to the delight of their fans inside Bruce Stadium. It\u2019s lofted nicely into the mix from Bishal Rai, but it\u2019s the skipper Milligan who clears well with the head. It\u2019s been a little brighter, this start from the visitors. Can they get a foothold into the match? 48 min: A chance for Irvine! But he can\u2019t quite fire a curling effort on target. He\u2019s had a few sighters, the midfielder. Three goals in his 31 caps for Australia - let\u2019s see if he can grab number four tonight. Second half! And we\u2019re back! Nepal get us going this half, but again it\u2019s Australia quickly onto the front foot. And a bit of half-time cross-promotion - this has just launched across the Guardian\u2019s various international sporting pages: I enjoyed speaking to Joey\u2019s coach Trevor Morgan about rising Australian prospect Noah Botic for this series. All the very best to the youngster as he looks to lead the line at the upcoming U17 World Cup in Brazil. But, that\u2019s the close of the action. More or less one-way traffic, but some fine passages of play from Australia. A few players confront the referee to argue the toss about that disallowed goal, but otherwise you\u2019d imagine they\u2019d be more or less pleased with their showing thus far, the Socceroos. 44 min: Another gorgeous cross-field ball sprayed by Mooy, and brought down nicely by Goodwin. They\u2019re certainly using the full width of the pitch, and it\u2019s had Nepal shuttling side-to-side. But Irvine can\u2019t quite get on the end of it. And is it a fourth to Leckie? Goal disallowed! Replays suggest the deflection came of a Nepalese player, not teammate Maclaren, so no grounds for a potential offside there. 42 min: A close up of the Australian bench, who are rubbing their hands and huddling like penguins. It really is deceptively cool out there in Canberra it seems. Nepals fans squeal with delight as their side cross halfway. But the move comes to nought. 39 min: A slight break in play and some concerns for the Nepalese defender who has bravely thrown himself in the way of a Mooy-humdinger. That was absolutely travelling, but deflected away from danger by the inadvertent head. He\u2019s back on his feet, thankfully, albeit a little groggily. And as the 37th minute pops up, a perhaps appropriate reference this, fired through from Ross McFarlane: Let\u2019s hope for football globally it doesn\u2019t get to that. 35 min: This is better from the skipper Chemjong. We thought he might be vital tonight and that\u2019s a great come and claim from Behich\u2019s cross. Some early handling errors, but he\u2019s settled well, and showing some of the pedigree we expect from him 32 min: And it is that man Mooy who fires in a dangerous free kick - it just clips the top of the wall and flies over. And from the follow up, a well-driven effort from Milligan, but it\u2019s well saved and held by Chemjong. In lieu of some emails, here\u2019s a text message from my mum: \u201cThis team should be called Ryan (sic) Grant and friends\u201d. Not sure if it\u2019s just the mullet, but somebody\u2019s clearly a BIG fan. Bit harsh on Mooy, imho, mum. 29 min: It\u2019s another corner, and another sense of real anxiety inside the Nepalese box. They\u2019re struggling to come to terms with Australia from set piece - the delivery has been excellent from Mooy and Goodwin, and the height and strength differential is proving very hard to defend against for Nepal. 26 min: So, in the spirit of midgame spot-quizzes - we have Harry and John Souttar, brothers playing for different nations. Can you think of another iconic Socceroo/non-Socceroo family duo? I\u2019ve got one in mind, and can happily say I was there for his debut: who needs Christian Vieri - when you\u2019ve got Max Vieri. 23 min: And would you believe it! Less than a quarter of the game gone, and it\u2019s a goal on international debut for the youngster, big Harry. It\u2019s another set piece, and the 2m centre back drifts through some paper-thin marking to nod home. His brother is a Scottish international - on this early evidence Australia might be licking their lips at securing the allegiance of this lad. Terrific start for him. An early tweet\u2019s come in re expected scoreline tonight: I was about to say don\u2019t get greedy, but as that second goal flew in, I had a sinking suspicion this might not be far off the money. 19 min: It\u2019s a double for Maclaren, but it\u2019s a goal made in two acts before it. Aziz Behich with an excellent whipped delivery to the far post, where his opposite fullback Rhyan Grant arrives late and then picks out the striker expertly with a fine header back across the box. No mistake from the Melbourne City striker, who grabs himself an early brace. 16 min: A corner to Australia, which Craig Goodwin looks to fire in, and again it\u2019s the massive centre back on debut, Souttar, that\u2019s the target. Chemjong comes and punches clear this time - that\u2019s better from the Nepalese skipper. 14 min: A rare touch for Maty Ryan in the Australian goal. Great to see the two Brighton and Hove Albion stars, Ryan and Mooy, making the long journey to Australia, before returning no doubt to Premier League action. 11 min: Some very hard passes pinging round - did somebody sneak in some Jabulanis out there? A credit to Nepal, they\u2019re looking to press Australia early, get plenty of bodies in midfield and cut out the passing lines. They haven\u2019t come to sit back - we\u2019ll find out shortly if that proves courageous or foolhardy. 8 min: Post! Not the start Nepal were hoping for, and it\u2019s again the dead ball delivery of Mooy that causes havoc - Irvine at the far post who redirects onto the far post and clear! The Nepalese defence had eyes on the 2m tall Souttar - he\u2019s really got an outrageous height advantage on some of these Nepali players. 5 min: It\u2019s another flap from the skipper in goals, calamity for Nepal! Aaron Mooy feeds in a well-weighted set piece cross, it\u2019s driven goalwards but Chemjong can only fend the initial shot, right into the path of Jamie Maclaren who was first to respond, and he tucks home from 5m out - just his second ever Socceroos goal! 4 min: SAVE! There\u2019s a crush of bodies inside the Nepalese box, as Leckie turns well to pick out a teammate. But it\u2019s only knee-ed goalwards by Jackson Irvine, before a melee ensues, and is eventually cleared. 3 min: It\u2019s a fast and furious start, as Australia look to bomb on. The ball pings round, as both sides misplace some early balls. 2 min: Oh my! Almost the worst possible beginning for Nepal, as the skipper Chemjong drove a clearance into the back of his own defender, and the ball almost ricocheted over the \u2018keeper\u2019s head! 1 min: And we\u2019re off! Australia with the ball. Almost a comical beginning as the big countdown to kickoff signed on the board, but the Nepalese team were still in a group huddle. Thankfully Australia elected to play backwards and give their opponents a chance at regathering. Ooph. The recording of the Nepalese anthem sounds like it\u2019s been played on a Casio MT 68. Not that the players appear to have minded or taken any disrespect. It\u2019s followed by a gorgeous a cappella rendition of Advance Australia Fair. Nice. The word from the touchline is that Nepal could line up in a 4-5-1, so between that and a Swedish coach, expect it to be a reasonably defensive looking approach from the visitors. A fair smattering of the distinctively shaped Nepalese flags inside Bruce Stadium. Let\u2019s hope there\u2019s something to enjoy tonight for Nepalese fans, on an otherwise chilly night in Canberra. And our players are out onto the pitch, kickoff won\u2019t be too far away. \u201cIt\u2019s an important qualify, my expectations are certainly very high\u201d coach Graham Arnold said pre-game. He\u2019s increasingly looking like a Wes Anderson character actor, the 54-cap former Socceroo, sporting a salt-coloured grey beard and increasingly weathered air. Let\u2019s hope his team don\u2019t play tonight with the sense of ennui of a retired ship\u2019s captain. So - without further ado, to team news - and the headline story is a full Socceroos debut for young defender Harry Souttar. The 6 ft 6 in centre back will partner Bailey Wright in the centre of the park. A great occasion for the 20-year-old. Jamie Maclaren gets the nod ahead of Adam Taggart up front, while skipper Mark Milligan returns to anchor the midfield, and Craig Goodwin gets an opportunity to impress from wide left. Assistant coach Rene Meulenstein told media pre-game the staff are very happy with the state of the playing surface: \u201cThe pitch is in really good condition. I expect that we can see some really good, attacking quality football tonight in these great conditions.\u201d It\u2019s a game that Graham Arnold and his staff will Expect To Win (TM). But when the opposition is relatively unknown it does always float some interesting question marks over a match. Nepal\u2019s Swedish coach Johan Kalin has an association with football in the tiny Himalayan nation going back 7-8 years, so he should know his squad and the landscape pretty well. Nepal\u2019s technical director is a man reasonably familiar with Australia n football as well - look out for some Sydney Olympic flags in the crowd tonight - hopefully Gary Phillips hasn\u2019t passed on too many intimate trade secrets. Hi all! G\u2019day and Namask\u0101r to you, from wherever around the world you\u2019re following our coverage today. If its from Canberra, get off your phones for Pete\u2019s sake, and get down to Bruce Stadium and enjoy it all, live. Although, a public service announcement for any off-duty intelligence officers, maybe don\u2019t log on the free wifi - the Five Eyes network will thank you for it later. As always we love to hear from you ahead of kick off - fire me an email or tweet with your predictions or insights ahead of this one. These two nations have never met at international men\u2019s level - we could be in for a big score tonight. But Canberra fans, don\u2019t hold your breath if you don\u2019t see six again.. (too soon?) The road to the World Cup is a journey of a thousand tiny steps. Separated by over 100 places in football\u2019s world rankings and at home in the nation\u2019s capital it\u2019s not expected that minnows Nepal should pose Australia too many questions. And yet every match against Asian opposition adds more to the Socceroos\u2019 collective knowledge of this vast and diverse continent. A first game on home soil of the 2022 campaign, Graham Arnold and his staff will be looking to impress home fans, whilst continuing to build in terms of playing style and processes and no doubt taking the opportunity to blood some new talent. On paper Nepal lack the depth of talent to seriously challenge Australia, but boast some talented individuals - who knows, maybe prodigy Bimal Gharti Magar will add to his growing reputation, or skipper Kiran Chemjong might put on a virtuoso display between the sticks to frustrate his hosts. It\u2019s still early days on the journey to Qatar. So sit back, Socceroos fans, and enjoy the game played in every corner of this remarkable planet.",

      "bodyText": "The security minister, Brandon Lewis, has threatened EU citizens with deportation from the UK if they do not apply for settled status after Brexit. Home Office figures show a million of the estimated 3 million EU citizens in the UK have yet to apply for settled status, which will allow them to stay in the UK. In an interview with the German newspaper Die Welt, Lewis said these people risked being deported if they failed to apply by the end of 2020. \u201cIf EU citizens have not registered by then without an adequate justification, the immigration rules will apply,\u201d Lewis said. Asked whether those who did not apply in the next 14 months would face deportation even if they fulfilled all legal conditions for a residence permit, Lewis said: \u201cTheoretically yes. We will apply the rules.\u201d Campaigners said the comments suggested the government was planning to renege on a promise to EU citizens. The3million, a group representing EU citizens living in Britain, said it was the first time the government had confirmed what would happen to those who did not apply for settled status. Maike Bohn, a co-founder of the campaign, said: \u201cWe have pressed the government for years on what happens to those who do not have a status in 2021. Today, after much wait, it is confirmed that hundreds and thousands of people will be punished with the threat of removal from their home. This is no way to treat people, let alone what was promised.\u201d The3million said many EU citizens in the UK were unaware of the requirement to register for settled status, while others were refusing to, as a protest against Brexit. Bohn said: \u201cThose people who miss the tight deadline will face the full force of the hostile environment. That is the grim reality of the UK government\u2019s position, no matter how many times they repeat the phrase: \u2018EU citizens and their families are our friends, neighbours and colleagues and we want them to stay.\u2019\u201d The3million is calling for changes to the EU settlement scheme to guarantee rights to EU citizens even if they do not apply for settled status. Lewis later tweeted that his remarks had been taken out of context. Until now Home Office briefings have consistently tried to stress that officials will do everything they can to grant EU nationals the right to remain, and steered away from focusing on what would happen to those who failed to apply on time. One of the civil servants leading the settled status application scheme said: \u201cThis is about trying to grant the right. This is not about trying to trip people up \u2026 We\u2019ve set this up from scratch. All this is here to try to say yes to European citizens, to try to give them their rights.\u201d The Home Office\u2019s position has consistently been to stress that if someone has a good reason to explain why they failed to apply by the deadline then they will be reasonable. The Home Office indicated that if people persistently fail to apply, then they will have no lawful status in the UK. Campaigners have asked for clarity on this point, noting that there was no clear explanation of what would be considered a \u201cgood reason\u201d for failing to apply by the deadline. There is concern from campaign groups such as The3million that there could be tens of thousands of EU nationals in the UK who will fail to apply in time; they are particularly concerned by what will happen to older and more vulnerable EU residents who may not be aware of the need to secure their rights after Brexit and who may struggle with the digital application process. As well as encountering difficulties with the Home Office, people who do not secure settled status may encounter problems applying for work or renting property, because employers and landlords will need to check that they are living in the UK legally. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cEU citizens are our friends, family and neighbours and we want them to stay. \u201cThe EU settlement scheme is a free and easy way for EU citizens to get the UK immigration status they need. \u201cWe have received 2m applications and are looking for reasons to grant status, not refuse, and EU citizens have until at least December 2020 to apply. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been clear that where they have reasonable grounds for missing the deadline, they\u2019ll be given a further opportunity to apply.\u201d",

On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a>&nbsp;and its allies. The deal effectively hands over control of huge swathes of the region to Damascus.</p>\n    <p>That leaves north-eastern&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\">Syria</a>&nbsp;divided between Syrian regime forces, Syrian opposition militia and their Turkish allies, and areas still held by the SDF \u2013 for now.</p>\n    <p>On 17 October Turkish president,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan\">Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan</a>, agreed with US vice-president Mike Pence, to suspend Ankara\u2019s operation for&nbsp; five days in order to allow Kurdish troops to withdraw. The following week, on 22 October, Erdo\u011fan and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/22/turkey-and-russia-agree-deal-over-buffer-zone-in-northern-syria\">agreed on the parameters of the proposed Turkish \u201csafe zone\u201d</a> in Syria.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the SDF come to control the region?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Before the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In late 2014, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/turkey-iraqi-kurds-kobani-isis-fighters-us-air-drops-arms\">Kurds were struggling</a>&nbsp;to fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobane, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why does Turkey oppose the Kurds?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a>.</p>\n    <p>Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF\u2019s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are Turkey\u2019s objectives on its southern border?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/07/us-withdrawal-from-syria-leaves-fate-of-isis-fighters-and-families-in-detention-uncertain\">recent announcement</a>&nbsp;that American soldiers would withdraw from the region.</p>\n    <p>Erdo\u011fan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this \u201csafe zone\u201d, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How would a Turkish incursion impact on Isis?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria.</p>\n    <p>SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey. They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.<br></p>\n    <p>On 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region. Two days later, 750 foreign women affiliated to Isis and their children managed to break out of a secure annex in the Ain Issa camp for displaced people, according to SDF officials.</p>\n    <p>It is unclear which detention sites the SDF still controls and the status of the prisoners inside.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Ever since the dispatch of Russian troops into Syria to shore up President Bashar al-Assad in 2015, Moscow has been slowly wresting the political process away from the west.

But I look. I listen. I feel. I remember. This is why I am here today, close to Yugoslavia, close to Serbia, close to Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107.\u201d After widespread criticism, he <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/pro-serbian-author-turns-down-disputed-german-prize/a-2047840-0\">turned down a nomination for the Heinrich Heine prize</a> before politicians could withdraw it over his political views. His 2014 win of the International Ibsen award was <a href=\"http://www.dagbladet.no/2014/10/15/kultur/meninger/handke/oyvind_berg/knausgard/35743556/\">met by protests in Oslo</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps more gallingly for the Nobel committee, Handke also called for the prize to be wound up in 2014. \u201cThe Nobel prize should finally be abolished,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.diepresse.com/3892843/handke-den-nobelpreis-sollte-man-endlich-abschaffen\">he told Austrian newspaper Die Presse</a>, adding that though it delivered \u201ca moment of attention, six pages in the newspaper\u201d, he did not admire the choices. Recalling that Handke had called the prize a \u201cfalse canonisation\u201d of literature, the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek said this year\u2019s award \u201cproves that he was right\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is Sweden today,\u201d \u017di\u017eek continued, \u201can apologist of war crimes gets a Nobel prize while the country fully participated in the character assassination of the true hero of our times, Julian Assange.

There\u2019s more in seeing them together than separately. The more I think about it the more I think it was a very conscious choice to pair these two writers together.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking to the Polish television channel TVN24, Tokarczuk said she believes in the novel as a \u201cdeep way of communication across borders, across languages, across cultures\u201d. She confirmed she had heard that the Polish culture minister Piotr Glinski had never read her books, adding that \u201cthere are readers for whom this can be boring or not fit their temperament.

The choice of Tokarczuk and Handke comes after the Swedish Academy promised to move away from the award\u2019s \u201cmale-oriented\u201d and \u201cEurocentric\u201d past.

The rising trend they reveal highlights how major players seem to be ignoring government promises, scientific alarms and a growing public outcry so they can pump more fossil fuels \u2013 and profits \u2013 out of the ground.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e182ee5f-c378-4474-b7da-79f6b0a671b3\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis \u2013 some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear.<br></p>\n    <p>The investigation has involved more than 20 Guardian journalists working across the world for the past six months.</p>\n    <p>The project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965. The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the <a href=\"http://climateaccountability.org/\">Climate Accountability Institute</a>,&nbsp;calculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers.

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s 50 biggest oil companies are poised to flood markets with an additional 7m barrels per day over the next decade, despite warnings from scientists that this will push global heating towards catastrophic levels. New research commissioned by the Guardian forecasts Shell and ExxonMobil will be among the leaders with a projected production increase of more than 35% between 2018 and 2030 \u2013 a sharper rise than over the previous 12 years. The acceleration is almost the opposite of the 45% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 that scientists say is necessary to have any chance of holding global heating at a relatively safe level of 1.5C. The projections are by Rystad Energy, a Norwegian consultancy regarded as the gold standard for data in the industry. The rising trend they reveal highlights how major players seem to be ignoring government promises, scientific alarms and a growing public outcry so they can pump more fossil fuels \u2013 and profits \u2013 out of the ground. Rystad bases its work on companies\u2019 assets and a long-term oil price of $65 a barrel, similar to its current level. The forecast shows an almost 8% rise in the projected output of the top 50 oil and gas companies between 2018 and 2030, which would account for almost two-fifths of the remaining 1.5C carbon budget and increase the risk of heatwaves, hurricanes, forest fires and floods. At least 14 of the 20 biggest historical carbon producers plan to pump out more hydrocarbons in 2030 than in 2018, according to the Rystad data. Its analysis shows the US is the centre of the latest global oil boom, with more than four times more new production than the next country, Canada, over the next 10 years. The expansion will primarily be in the Permian basin in Texas. BP, Chevron and ConocoPhillips will be involved, as well as smaller, faster-growing private firms that are together driving this single US state to produce more oil and gas than all of Saudi Arabia by 2030. Massive new drilling projects are also under way or planned in north-west Argentina, off the Caribbean shores of Guyana, in Kazakhstan\u2019s Kashagan oilfield, in the Yamal peninsula in Siberia and in the Barents Sea. Lorne Stockman, a senior research analyst at Oil Change International, which monitors oil companies, said: \u201cRather than planning an orderly decline in production, they are doubling down and acting like there is no climate crisis. This presents us with a simple choice: shut them down or face extreme climate disruption.\u201d Richard Heede, a researcher at the Climate Accountability Institute in the US, said the companies would be putting themselves \u2013 and human civilisation \u2013 at risk, unless they shifted to renewable energy and offset new production to net zero by mid-century. \u201cNo company that values its social licence to operate shall make a capital investment in new fossil fuel projects without offsetting or sequestering an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide so as to assure alignment with science-based targets to 1.5C and net zero emissions by 2050,\u201d he added.

This was reinforced by CEO Oliver Zipse at the Frankfurt motor show in September. By 2020, we will have reduced the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of our European vehicle fleet by 50% in comparison with the 1995 base year. The BMW Group is currently working on new targets as part of a new sustainability strategy from 2020.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur aim is to find a sustainable approach that meets all three requirements of sustainability (ecological, social, economic) in a balanced and appropriate manner. The BMW Group ultimately bears responsibility for more than 130,000 employees and their families.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe BMW Group has long been a champion of sustainability technology, encouraging its own industry and others to play their part in emissions reduction. We have been contributing ideas to decarbonise transport at multiple climate conferences worldwide since 2008 (since COP14) and through the company\u2019s membership of various national and international associations. Within these associations, members naturally hold different positions on the climate debate.

      "bodyText": "Ford Motor Company \u201cFord takes its responsibilities for the environment and communities around the globe very seriously. That was evident again recently, when Ford was one of only four automakers reaching agreement with California on higher gas-mileage standards to reduce emissions. We have said multiple times that Ford does not support a rollback of federal emission standards. Additionally, Ford supports CO2 reductions consistent with the Paris climate accord, as we\u2019ve shared publicly.\u201d A spokesperson said the company endorsed the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals, citing its heavy investment in vehicle electrification, \u201cwhich we believe will facilitate long-term reductions in CO2 emissions\u201d. The company cited the fact it was spending $11bn (\u00a39bn) on electrified vehicles globally from 2017 through 2022 and has invested a further $500m to produce a new electric vehicle. It said in Europe it had announced plans for 17 electrified vehicles by 2023 that \u201cwill provide customer choice and deliver CO2 performance\u201d. Toyota Motor Corporation \u201cWe are supportive of increasingly challenging targets to reduce vehicle greenhouse gas emissions while taking into account supportive or impeding factors such as technology capability, infrastructure development, consumer preference, fuel prices and other factors that can affect the take-up of ever cleaner technologies in the market ... \u201cIn regards to our membership in the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers in the United States, we believe it is important to take action as an industry as well as an individual manufacturer. Toyota continues to support year-over-year increases in standards but we believe adjustments are warranted to address changes in the assumptions used to establish those standards. \u201cWe will keep pushing for a sustainable agreement that sets progressive improvements in fuel economy, promotes advanced and diverse technologies and aligns with market realities and customer choice. \u201cIn Europe, thanks to our manufacturing presence in several EU countries, we are a member of the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association (ACEA) ... At ACEA, Toyota has specifically advocated for technology neutrality. We don\u2019t believe the setting of specific sales quotas for certain types of zero-emission vehicles is the best mechanism to achieve the desired CO2 reduction targets. Instead \u2026 we believe the massive electrification of fleets using a variety of technologies adapted to a variety of consumer needs will be more successful.\u201d Daimler \u201cSustainability is one of the essential elements of Daimler\u2019s corporate strategy and at the same time, it is critical to our business success. As a global company, we have a responsibility to play our part in managing the transformation of our industry to one that is increasingly focused on sustainability by keeping the balance on several, complex dimensions: evaluating economic, ecological and social aspects, for customers and investors as well as for employees, business partners and society as a whole \u2026 \u201cRegarding your question on matching the individual, worldwide CO2 regulations: it is our goal and intent to incorporate as many aspects as possible of Daimler\u2019s goals and beliefs in the positions of associations both in the US and the EU. The conditionality principle which has been advocated for by the EU auto industry in the discussion on post-2020 CO2 targets in the EU can serve as an example for this.\u201d BMW \u201cThe BMW Group welcomed the 2C goal of the Paris climate agreement and is committed to it. This was reinforced by CEO Oliver Zipse at the Frankfurt motor show in September. By 2020, we will have reduced the CO2 emissions of our European vehicle fleet by 50% in comparison with the 1995 base year. The BMW Group is currently working on new targets as part of a new sustainability strategy from 2020. \u201cOur aim is to find a sustainable approach that meets all three requirements of sustainability (ecological, social, economic) in a balanced and appropriate manner. The BMW Group ultimately bears responsibility for more than 130,000 employees and their families. \u201cThe BMW Group has long been a champion of sustainability technology, encouraging its own industry and others to play their part in emissions reduction. We have been contributing ideas to decarbonise transport at multiple climate conferences worldwide since 2008 (since COP14) and through the company\u2019s membership of various national and international associations. Within these associations, members naturally hold different positions on the climate debate. BMW plays its role in promoting electric mobility as a means to meeting the 2C goal of the Paris climate agreement. In our experience, constructive dialogue is the best way to bring about positive long-term changes.\u201d General Motors \u201cOur global commitment to improving fuel economy, reducing emissions and pursuing an all-electric zero-emissions future is unwavering, regardless of any modifications to existing emissions standards currently under review in the United States. In the US, we remain interested in working with all parties to advance American automotive technological leadership. Regardless of the standards, we are committed to a future of zero crashes, zero emissions, and zero congestion. The pathway to that vision includes continually improving fuel economy and our commitment to an all-electric future. This is why we\u2019ve called for a US national zero-emissions vehicle programme. \u201cOur zero-emissions vision extends beyond products to our manufacturing operations, where we have committed to use 100% renewable energy by 2050. \u201cWe set a new goal to reduce emissions by 31% by 2030 compared to a 2010 baseline, consistent with the level of decarbonisation required by science-based methodology.

BP\u2019s \u201cpossibilities everywhere\u201d ad campaign on Facebook was launched just weeks after it joined big oil companies to use a \u201ccommunity\u201d group to fight against a bill restricting fracking in Colorado, known as Proposition 112. Prop 112 aimed to increase the distance fracking wells are set back from houses, schools and hospitals from 500ft (about 150 metres) to 2,500ft (760 metres). It was designed to protect communities and the environment, and promote the transition from fossil fuels, according to those behind the bill. But the campaign by a \u201cgrassroots\u201d group Protect Colorado helped to defeat the bill by a margin of 200,000 votes last November. Protect Colorado\u2019s Facebook page and website list it as a community organisation. They make no mention that the organisation was given $41 million by the oil and gas industry and its trade groups between January and December 2018, according to campaign declarations to the Colorado Secretary of State. BP gave Protect Colorado $300,000 in October 2018, a month after relocating its US onshore headquarters from Houston to Denver. The move was to help it tap the state\u2019s estimated reserves of 1.3bn barrels of oil and exploit increased production, which has made Colorado the country\u2019s fifth largest oil producer. Guardian analysis of Facebook\u2019s ad disclosure platform reveals Protect Colorado had an influence reach of up to 3.3 million impressions in the weeks before the vote, in a state with a population of about 5 million people. The out-of-state fracking firms Noble Energy and Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, based in Houston, Texas, put $6m each into Protect Colorado. The oil and gas firm ConocoPhillips gave the group $1m, Denver-based Liberty Oilfield Services provided $749,000 and the Colorado Petroleum Council gave $4.5m to Protect Colorado. Anne Lee Foster, the communications director at Colorado Rising, which raised $1.2m for its campaign promoting Prop 112, said: \u201cIt felt like an attack on our democracy, where you have these corporations spending millions and millions of dollars, often out-of-state interests, fighting citizens who are simply trying to protect their families. \u201cWe lost by 200,000 votes, so yes, 100% we believe the vote was swayed by the social media push they financed. They created doubt. They exploited people\u2019s fears that the setback would mean big job losses.\u201d The Guardian contacted Protect Colorado but it failed to respond. The Guardian also contacted all the oil and gas companies involved in the campaigning. BP confirmed it had opposed Prop 112. \u201cBP is open to, and will continue to engage in, substantive discussions about regulatory efforts to address the impacts of oil and gas development. \u201cWe also remain committed to safe and reliable operations in Colorado \u2013 and everywhere we operate \u2013 as we work to meet society\u2019s demand for cleaner, better energy.\u201d At the time of going to press there were no other comments provided. The use of groups that term themselves grassroots community organisations but are funded by major companies is known as \u201castroturfing\u201d. In 2014, a leaked document from the Western States Petroleum Association \u2013 the oil and gas trade body in states including Washington, Oregon and California \u2013 detailed the use of such community groups to push back against climate campaigners and the anti-oil agenda \u2013 something WSPA described as \u201cthe worst of times\u201d. Research for The Guardian by InfluenceMap has uncovered various examples of so called astro turfing. Within the Facebook adverts, the funders tend to be disclosed as the named group behind the adverts with no information on who ultimately controls these groups. Only through further research does oil company support become more clear. In Texas a campaign opposing new regulations on oil pipelines in Senate bill 421 is led by Texans for Natural Gas, which is listed as a community group on Facebook. It describes itself as a \u201cgrassroots organisation\u201d that gives a voice to those who support Texas oil and natural gas production. The Facebook ads against SB 421 are listed as being funded directly by Texans for Natural Gas. The small print at the bottom of the group\u2019s website states: \u201cWe are supported by five of the state\u2019s leading energy companies \u2013 Apache Corp, EnerVest, EOG Resources, Kinder Morgan and XTO Energy\u201d (a subsidiary of ExxonMobil). Measure G, a bill to ban new fracking and conventional oil and gas wells in the California county of San Luis Obispo, but allow existing facilities to continue, was defeated last year after an extensive industry-funded campaign against the proposed law, which spent more than $160,000 on more than 500 Facebook adverts, according to the ad library. Major oil industry corporations donated about $8m to the No on Measure G campaign, according to local campaign finance filings. Chevron donated half that sum, while Aera Energy, a joint venture between Shell and ExxonMobil, contributed $900,000. The campaign in support of the measure raised only $243,000 in the same period. Shell said it opposed Measure G because \u201cit would have shut down a century-old industry in the county, costing hundreds of local legacy jobs, millions in taxes to local coffers and cut off critical energy to an area of the country that has long struggled to keep up with growing demand. \u201cWhile we share the view that a low-carbon economy will only be possible through a combination of more renewables and biofuels, efficiency standards, CCS [carbon capture and storage] and a carbon tax, cleaner and more convenient hydrocarbons are still needed to provide a full suite of energy products for the growing global population \u2013 especially in areas of industry and transportation that are proving difficult to abate,\u201d a Shell spokesperson said. Between September and November 2018, the No on Measure G campaign published several hundred Facebook adverts encouraging residents of San Luis Obispo to oppose the law, according to a Guardian analysis. Most of the adverts suggested the measure would cause economic damage, such as job losses, or an increased reliance on foreign oil, and suggested continued fossil fuel use was part of a \u201ctransition to a clean energy economy\u201d. Last year BP donated $13m to a campaign, also supported by Chevron, that successfully stopped a carbon tax in Washington state \u2013 $1m of which was spent on social media ads, research shows.",

      "bodyText": "The former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd says three of the world\u2019s biggest mining multinationals have run sophisticated operations to kill off climate action in Australia and continue to wield day-to-day influence over government through a vast lobbying network and an \u201cumbilical\u201d relationship with the Murdoch media. Australia\u2019s climate policy paralysis has been ongoing for more than decade, from the Rudd Labor government\u2019s doomed attempt to bring in an emissions trading scheme in 2008, to the Liberal prime minister Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s failed attempt to introduce the national energy guarantee last year. Successive attempts at serious climate action have faced fierce resistance, often led by industry lobbying, and have contributed to the downfall of three recent prime ministers: Rudd, his successor Julia Gillard and Turnbull. The mining sector\u2019s power to influence Australian politics is infamous. Separate to climate policy, it led an intense campaign against the resource super profits tax \u2013 a 40% tax on mining profits \u2013 proposed by Rudd in 2010. The industry\u2019s damaging $22m lobbying effort helped depose Rudd and gut the super profits tax, rendering it near useless. Experts and environmentalists say the industry\u2019s power is derived from political donations, gifts, advertising, paid lobbyists, frequent access and close political networks. Rudd said he felt the full brunt of that influence. \u201cGlencore, Rio [Tinto] and BHP ran sophisticated political operations against my government, both on climate change and the mining tax,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThey worked hard \u2026 to get rid of the resource super profit tax, against the interests of other mining companies and the national economy as a whole. They worked hard \u2026 in 2013 against the carbon price. They succeeded in both enterprises.\u201d Rudd attributes the day-to-day influence of the sector to two mechanisms. The first is what he describes as the vast lobbying network it uses to pressure political parties. The second is its close relationship with the Murdoch media, which owns most of the country\u2019s print media. Rudd describes the relationship as \u201cumbilical\u201d. \u201cWhen did you last see the Murdoch media critical of any of these corporations?\u201d Rudd said. \u201cRarely. If ever.\u201d BHP, Glencore and Rio Tinto, and the Murdoch-owned News Corp, all declined to comment. The Melbourne University academic George Rennie, an expert on lobbying, sees the mining sector as one of the most powerful groups in Australia. Its power, he says, manifests in an ability to get senior politicians on the phone or to meet face-to-face with relative ease. \u201cIts ability to access decision-makers is famous, and the experience of the \u2018mining tax\u2019 lobbying campaign in 2010 has made both parties afraid to take on mining interests,\u201d Rennie said. \u201cThe power of the resources sector comes from its profits \u2013 its ability to spend on donations and gifts, as well as its own political advertisements if it chooses. \u201cThere is disproportionate power, so if you want to lobby government for something that the resources sector does not want, you\u2019re very unlikely to get your way.\u201d The scant publicly available information on political access in Australia backs up Rennie\u2019s view. A Guardian analysis of ministerial diary data compiled by the Grattan Institute thinktank shows the mining and energy sector enjoys frequent access to government leaders in two of Australia\u2019s most important mining states: Queensland and New South Wales. Mining and energy industry executives met the Queensland premier, deputy premier or treasurer 44 times in 2017-18 alone.

Brendan Pearson, a former head of Australia\u2019s peak mining lobby group, the Minerals Council of Australia, recently joined the office of the Liberal prime minister, Scott Morrison, as a senior adviser. On the other side, Gary Gray, a former Labor resources minister, joined the mining industry in his post-political career, including working for the mining services company Mineral Resources Limited. Martin Ferguson, another former Labor resources minister, is now the chairman of the advisory board to the oil and gas peak industry body, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association. Cameron Milner, a Labor strategist, lobbied for the Indian mining giant Adani for five years, before eventually parting ways so he could work on the campaign of the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, in 2017. The industry also exerts influence in less obvious ways. An investigation by Guardian Australia this year revealed a covert, multimillion-dollar influence campaign being run by C|T Group, the lobbyist firm headed by Lynton Crosby, on behalf of Glencore. The campaign, known as Project Caesar, included the creation of fake online grassroots groups that spread anti-renewable, pro-coal content to unsuspecting users. It aimed to shift the emotion and tone of the energy debate in Australia to favour coal by using personally relevant messaging, centred on themes of cost, reliability and family security. Campaign teams also collected material that could be used to embarrass activist groups such as Greenpeace and 350.org. Dom Rowe, Greenpeace Australia Pacific\u2019s programme director, said Australia\u2019s lack of credible climate policy could be directly attributed to the industry\u2019s influence. \u201cConsidering the vast network of influence and direct access that fossil fuel executives and lobbyists have to senior government ministers, it is little wonder that the Coalition has yet to take any meaningful action on reducing Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, which have been rising for over four years,\u201d Rowe said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unacceptable that both major parties are abandoning their responsibility to protect Australians from the worsening impacts of the climate crisis, in favour of not biting the hand that feeds.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Some people run marathons. Others scramble up mountains before the break of dawn. For me, the peak of physical endurance came when I stood in the yard of the Globe theatre on a late summer Sunday for the guts of 10 hours, watching all three of the plays in Shakespeare\u2019s Henry VI cycle. I\u2019d been training for this day, rocking on my heels through <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jul/26/richard-iii-review-shakespeare-globe\" title=\"\">Richard III</a></em> or both parts of <em>Henry IV</em>, but this took everything I had. From mid-morning until sunset, I followed the tangled politics of the Wars of the Roses, with only the infusion of a pork pie and two medically necessary pints of bitter getting me across the finish line.</p> <p>On my feet in the theatre yard, I was reminded that the political history of later 15th-century England is thick with blood and betrayal. Thomas Penn\u2019s <em>The Brothers York</em> begins with the attempt in 1460 by Richard, Duke of York to seize the crown from the Lancastrian king Henry VI, and follows Richard\u2019s three sons \u2013 Edward, Richard and George \u2013 through the tumultuous years that followed. Two of them would become king, two would die violently, and after a quarter of a century all three would be dead and a new dynasty would hold the throne. Penn\u2019s first book, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/25/winter-king-thomas-penn-review\" title=\"\">biography of Henry VII</a> \u2013 arguably the Tudor monarch with the lowest public profile \u2013 showed that he could craft pacy and convincing accounts out of 15th-century source materials. In <em>The Brothers York</em>, he succeeds again, smoothing the period\u2019s interlocking alliances and multigenerational feuds into a narrative that is always readable and even thrilling.</p> <p>Edward IV first came to the throne in 1461, succeeding where his father had failed in pushing aside the weak, unstable and intermittently catatonic Henry VI. Edward\u2019s England was rarely settled. Threats from international rivals and internal enemies were constant, and people took some persuading of the new king\u2019s right to the crown: on the day of his coronation, one Londoner was recorded as muttering \u201cTwat and turd for him\u201d. Alliances were constantly shifting: the Earl of Warwick, who had helped make Edward king, would later become one of his most implacable enemies and the leader of a rebellion against him.</p> <p>Even when their enemies\u2019 efforts against them could be contained, relationships within the royal family were rarely smooth. One chronicler wrote that Edward and his brothers \u201cpossessed such surpassing talent that, if they had been able to avoid conflict, their triple bond could have been broken only with the utmost difficulty\u201d. Edward\u2019s surprise marriage to the widow Elizabeth Woodville brought her relatives into the royal fold, where they and their allies jockeyed for position and advancement.</p> <p>His brother George, Duke of Clarence, bristled at any challenges to his expansive influence and exalted rank, and ultimately took up arms against his brother\u2019s rule. A proclamation by Clarence and his ally in rebellion, the Earl of Warwick, declared Edward to be a \u201cusurper, oppressor, destroyer\u201d: they would drive him into exile and prop up Henry VI, whom they jolted out of the Tower of London, treated to a wash and a shave, and paraded before the people as their returned king.</p> <p>Edward\u2019s exile didn\u2019t last: the bond between Clarence and Warwick was prised apart, and by the time Edward made landfall in England again in early spring 1471, Clarence was itching to ditch the kingmaker and throw himself on his brother\u2019s mercy. It wasn\u2019t the first time the men had found themselves making \u201cfair dissimulated countenances\u201d at each other; time would lay bare the fragility of the peace between them. For now, the insurgency was smothered by Edward and his forces, the royal family seemed reconciled and, on the evening of Edward\u2019s return to London, the old Lancastrian king was quietly murdered.</p> <p>If this all seems complicated, it is \u2013 but it\u2019s a measure of Penn\u2019s skill as a narrator that he offers memorable sketches of even peripheral characters and brings a novelist\u2019s verve to his telling of events. This doesn\u2019t quite happen as convincingly with some of the book\u2019s women. Margaret of Anjou was a formidable political operator and a keystone of Henry VI\u2019s regime before his deposition. Living in exile in France for much of the period after 1461, she nonetheless continued to plot and to undermine Edward from abroad. Another Margaret, Edward\u2019s sister and Duchess of Burgundy, was a canny powerbroker on the international stage. Both deserve more attention than they receive here.</p> <p>Throughout the 1470s there was<strong> </strong>tension with France and Scotland, while at home the main drama came from the growing rift between Clarence and his brothers. He claimed that \u201cthe king intends to consume him in like wise as a candle consumes in burning\u201d, while Edward became increasingly concerned that his brother was plotting against him: in 1478, having locked him in the Tower, the king charged Clarence with treason. He never stood a chance: he was found guilty, and the rumour quickly spread that he had been drowned in a butt of sweet malmsey wine.</p> <p>If it was last orders for George, his brother Richard was far from calling it a night. Penn\u2019s Richard is a serious thinker, a pious Catholic and a profoundly ambitious politician. When Edward IV died \u2013 in April 1483, at the age of 40 \u2013 Richard moved quickly to master the situation. His men effectively kidnapped the late king\u2019s young son, who was due to succeed his father as Edward V. When the council stood in the way of Richard\u2019s seizure of full power over the boy \u2013 and, by extension, the de facto kingship of the land \u2013 he cried conspiracy and liquidated his opponents. Edward V would never be crowned: dispatched to the Tower with his brother, the pair disappeared from view. \u201cTheir faces were seen at the barred windows of their apartments with less frequency as the days went on. Finally, they were no longer seen at all.\u201d</p> <p>Narrating the two years Richard III spent on the throne, Penn gives us a kingdom in freefall. While the commons failed to warm to Richard, his enemies were circling. The French crown gave its backing to an exile group coalescing around one Henry Tudor. The new king prayed for freedom \u201cfrom every tribulation, sorrow, and from the plots of my enemies\u201d, but an August day at Bosworth Field would see his naked corpse despoiled and buried \u201cin a ditch like a dog\u201d. Richard was the last of the three brothers left standing; his death paved the way for the ascendancy of the Tudors, a dynasty that would hold the crown for more than a century.</p> <p>The Wars of the Roses were a hinge moment in English history. England\u2019s European presence had dwindled: its last remaining continental toehold was the garrison of Calais. Penn shows that behind the crown\u2019s bullish self-aggrandisement, it remained reliant for its funding on the wealth of Italian banks and German traders, while anti-migrant feeling was a common response to English economic woes. The map of political power was being redrawn within the kingdom, while the country viewed its European neighbours with mistrust or outright hostility.</p> <p>There are no simple analogies to be made between then and now, but Penn\u2019s history of betrayal, backstabbing and paranoia strikes notes that still resonate today.

      "bodyText": "Global carmakers are among the leading opponents of action on the climate crisis, according to exclusive analysis of the way major corporations frustrate or undermine initiatives to cut greenhouse gases. The research for the Guardian reveals that while the automotive industry releases public statements that support climate initiatives, such as increased electrification, it has been pouring millions of dollars through industry bodies into lobbying efforts to challenge attempts to tackle global heating in the past four years. This is despite repeated warnings that the planet is in the grip of a global climate emergency. The study was undertaken by InfluenceMap, an independent research group, as part of the polluters project. The evidence was gathered by assessing each company\u2019s size and lobbying activities. Researchers assessed tens of thousands of statements, policy announcements and lobbying campaigns by the 250 biggest investor-owned industrial corporations and trade associations. InfluenceMap used a definition of what constitutes lobbying drawn from the UN-backed Guide For Responsible Corporate Engagement in Climate Policy. The research revealed that since 2015, Fiat Chrysler, Ford, Daimler, BMW, Toyota and General Motors have been among the strongest opponents of regulations to help countries meet the 1.5C warming limit in the Paris agreement. In the four years since then, lobbying from the car industry in the US and Europe has attempted to block, delay and frustrate initiatives to regulate and reduce emissions from the transport sector \u2013 which is responsible for 15% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 and slow the move to electric vehicles, the report says. Edward Collins, author of The Carbon Policy Footprint, said: \u201cCorporations have a profound impact on the climate change agenda not only through physical emissions but through influencing of the climate change policy agendas being introduced by governments around the world. \u201cThe sector has dug in hard to dampen rising vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards. Through their lobbying, auto companies have delayed the transition of a sector that sucks up a huge proportion of oil demand globally.\u201d The Guardian contacted all the named car companies and their responses are set out here. Most said they were committed to reducing emissions and moving their fleets to lower-emission models but the transition had to take into account other factors including market realities, customer preference, and infrastructure development. Ford denied it was pushing for a rollback of emissions standards in the US. It pointed to its recent agreement with California to increase gas mileage standards and reduce emissions. InfluenceMap identified 33 corporations as the strongest opponents of action to reduce climate change. Six of them were car companies, and the rest primarily oil and gas companies as well as energy firms. The lobbying efforts are revealed as countries increasingly set targets to phase out new sales of cars with internal combustion engines \u2013 the Netherlands and Norway by 2025, Germany, India and China by 2030, and France and the UK by 2040. The influence exerted by the car companies is fronted and aided by industry groups including the US-based Automotive Alliance, as well as Europe\u2019s ACEA (European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association) and the VDA (German Association of the Automotive Industry). These groups all have senior figures from the big car companies on their boards of directors. Fiat Chrysler was ranked most oppositional to climate change regulations and initiatives, Collins said. The company is a \u201ckey player\u201d in the industry\u2019s efforts to weaken US clean car standards, known as CAFE standards, set by Barack Obama, which would almost double the fuel economy of vehicles to an average of 54 miles per gallon by 2025. Fiat Chrysler has supported a review of the CAFE standards being considered by the president, Donald Trump. Its late CEO, Sergio Marchionne, said last year he was \u201cfully supportive\u201d of the administration\u2019s efforts to revise the standards. General Motors and Ford have also been key lobbyists through the industry group pushing back against the CAFE standards, while putting out the message in public that they are signed up to the transport transformation required, the report says. The report acknowledges that Ford recently softened its stance and agreed a compromise in California, but that change of position \u2013 after a significant stretch of oppositional lobbying \u2013 only marginally impacted on its ranking, which involved analysis since the Paris agreement in 2015. The California agreement, Collins said, still constituted \u201ca diluted set of standards\u201d. A spokesperson for Ford said: \u201cWe have said multiple times that Ford does not support a rollback of federal emission standards. Additionally, Ford supports CO2 reductions consistent with the Paris climate accord, as we have shared publicly.\u201d The weakening of the CAFE standards would increase US CO2 emissions by up to 931m metric tonnes between 2022 and 2035 \u2013 a sharp rise in global heating that amounts to the annual emissions of 82% of the countries in the world in 2019, according to recent research. In Europe, the car industry, through the ACEA and the VDA, has continually pushed against new CO2 emissions standards for new vehicles by 2021, and from 2021 to 2030, under the EU clean mobility package. Average emissions of cars produced by manufacturers must be 95g/km by 2021, with penalties of \u20ac95 per g/km, per car, for companies not meeting those targets. But data from the EU environment watchdog the EEA shows that the car industry is far off the target. CO2 emissions of new cars increased in 2018 by 1.6% to 120.4g/km. This rise coincided with soaring sales in Europe of SUVs, which emit higher emissions. SUVs account for a third of new cars sold in Europe, an increase from 7% in 2008. Car industry lobbying in Europe through ACEA successfully shelved a proposed EU mandate on sales of electric cars by 2025 similar to those that operate in California and China. Julia Poliscanova, the clean vehicles director for the Transport &amp; Environment NGO, said the automotive industry was seeking to eke out the last profits of the traditional engine by frustrating emissions reduction targets and questioning every aspect of electric technology, from expressing apparent concerns about the affordability for consumers to querying if the infrastructure will be in place in time. \u201cThe car industry has always maximised its profits from its existing models and products for as long as is possible to make their money and delay and work around the regulations,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have known for years \u2013 since 2013 \u2013 the standards coming in on emissions in 2021. They have had years to prepare but they didn\u2019t. Instead they pushed their SUV market, maximised its sales reach to make profits from these high-polluting, high-margin vehicles for as long as possible and now they are scrambling to comply, claiming how difficult it is to meet the targets, but they only have themselves to blame.\u201d Unilever is ranked the most influential positive company, while Apple and Amazon are also deemed to be among the top positive corporate influencers. Collins said the majority of the world\u2019s most influential companies remained on the fence about the policies needed to address the climate crisis. While making PR-friendly comments on climate they do not engage in any way with the regulations being introduced by global governments to meet the Paris agreement, the report says.",

We have laid out in detail how these claims have been manufactured here, and some examples of how our research has been misrepresented is also here\u201d Chevron \u201cChevron is taking action to address climate change by investing in technology and low-carbon business opportunities that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions while continuing to produce affordable, reliable, and ever-cleaner energy to support social and economic progress. We support an honest conversation about how we balance energy supply for a growing world, economic development and the environment.\u201d PetroChina \u201cWe implement the low-carbon development strategy proposed by the Chinese government, and we strive to be the supplier of clean energy and the promoter of low-carbon transition of the society, and share the practices of greenhouse gas control with industry peers and all segments of society. \u201cWe proposed the 2030 target for new energy development, specifying that the revenue of the new energy sector will account for approximately 10% of our total by 2030. The company has also put forward the low-carbon development objective, targeting to reduce CO2 emissions per unit of industrial value-added by 25%, compared with 2015, by 2020. By 2030, we will continue to increase the supply of natural gas and other clean energy, make sure that domestic natural gas production accounts for 55% of the company\u2019s domestic primary energy, in order to effectively control the emission of greenhouse gases.\u201d Total \u201cTotal is fully aware of the challenges represented by climate change, has acknowledged the link between greenhouse gases and climate change publicly for several decades and has never engaged in \u2018misinformation campaigns\u2019. We would be grateful if you would therefore refrain from alleging that Total engaged in misinformation campaigns as this is an entirely unsubstantiated allegation. On the contrary, and for many years now, Total has integrated climate change concerns into the development of its strategy. \u201cIndeed, our challenge is to increase access to affordable energy to satisfy the needs of a growing population, while providing concrete solutions that will help limit the effects of climate change and supply an energy mix that progressively decreases in carbon intensity. \u201cAs far as the Climate Accountability Institute\u2019s study you refer to is concerned, a distinction must be made between emissions resulting directly from our activities and those which arise from the use of the products which we make available to our customers and which we do not control. The emissions resulting from our activities account for roughly a 10th of the total figures you indicate in your email, the remainder being related to the use of our products by our customers. You will find here our statement regarding our emissions in 2018.\u201d ConocoPhillips \u201cAs we work to safely find and deliver energy to the world, addressing climate-related issues is a high priority. We recognise that human activity, including the burning of fossil fuels, is contributing to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere that can lead to adverse changes in global climate. While uncertainties remain, we continue to manage GHG emissions in our operations and to integrate climate-change-related activities and goals into our business planning. Details on our GHG metrics can be found here. \u201cOur company has voluntarily reduced our emissions by almost 7m tonnes per year since 2009. This is significant when put in context: This reduction number does not include mandated reductions. Our total operated emissions are about 20m tonnes per year. \u201cWe have a long-term target to reduce our GHG emissions intensity from 5-15% by 2030, which is subject to periodic reviews and adjustment as we progress. We have had a longstanding climate change position and we continue to integrate climate-change-related activities and goals into our business planning. See our full climate policy history here.\u201d BHP \u201cBHP is a very strong and consistent advocate of the Paris agreement and more recently on the IPCC 1.5C position. BHP has never shied away from its responsibilities on CO2 and climate change, in fact, we have been one of the strongest \u2013 if not the strongest \u2013 advocate and proactive player in the sector in addressing our own operations as well as researching, funding and promoting technologies, practices and policies to mitigate environmental impacts from our activities.\u201d The company highlighted an announcement this year in which its chief executive, Andrew Mackenzie, said BHP was setting up a $400m climate investment programme to develop technologies to reduce emissions from its operations as well as those generated from the use of its resources. \u201cOver the next five years this programme will scale up low-carbon technologies critical to the decarbonisation of our operations. It will drive investment in nature-based solutions and encourage further collective action on scope three emissions \u2026 We must take a product-stewardship role for emissions across our value chain and commit to work with shippers, processors and users of our products to reduce scope three emissions.\u201d Petrobras \u201cPetrobras has been accompanying the climate science evolution and its developments on energetic, social and economic systems for over 15 years. The company monitors opportunities that the new regulations and technological innovations bring about in terms of new products and business models. \u201dIn its operations, Petrobras seeks to apply technologies which have as a direct consequence the reduction of carbon intensity, with significant results already achieved: since 2008, 9.8m tonnes of CO2 have been reinjected from the pre-salt pits in the Bacia dos Santos. \u201cUntil 2025, the company projects reinjecting 40m tons of CO2. Between 2009 and 2018, the emission of over 120m tons of CO2 has been averted, which equals two years of total emissions from the Petrobras. \u201cCurrently, Petrobras has, among the major oil and natural gas producers, the second best performance in relative emissions (CO2/barrel) in exploration and production activities. \u201cThe company has vowed to achieve zero growth in operational emissions up until 2025 (base year 2015), even with an increase in production, setting emission-intensity reduction goals of 32% in exploitation and production of oil and 16% in refining. \u201dAdditionally, by 2023, Petrobras will invest US $350m in research and development in the areas of CCUS (carbon capture utilisation and storage), advanced biofuels, offshore wind and solar energy.\u201d Peabody Energy Peabody recognises that climate change is occurring and that human activity, including the use of fossil fuels, contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. We also recognise that coal is essential to affordable, reliable energy and will continue to play a significant role in the global energy mix for the foreseeable future. Peabody views technology as vital to advancing global climate change solutions, and the company supports advanced coal technologies to drive continuous improvement toward the ultimate goal of near-zero emissions from coal.",

According to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, more than 60,000 people have fled their homes since Wednesday. They have been followed by dozens of aid workers, who crossed the border from north-eastern Syria into Turkey after agencies ordered a widespread evacuation in anticipation of an expanded Turkish push into the region. The exodus kept border officials busy throughout Thursday morning. Aid workers said they had been told to leave by their organisations, and most had done so reluctantly. Aid agencies, military leaders and senior international officials have warned that hundreds of thousands of people were in immediate danger from Turkey\u2019s newly announced offensive targeting Kurdish forces in northern Syria. \u201cHundreds of thousands of civilians in northern Syria are now in harm\u2019s way,\u201d said Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees. \u201cCivilians and civilian infrastructure must not be a target.\u201d The UNHCR called on parties to adhere to international humanitarian law, including providing access for aid agencies. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces warned of an \u201cimminent humanitarian catastrophe\u201d as Nato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, both appealed to Turkey to avoid adding to the instability in Syria. Syria is already hosting one of the world\u2019s most complex humanitarian crises, with millions of people displaced both within and outside its borders, and the Turkish offensive, announced on Tuesday, threatens to add a frightening new dimension. In sharp-edged remarks aimed at Turkey, Juncker pointed out that the EU was contributing \u20ac6bn (\u00a35.4bn) to Turkey to help support the 3.6 million Syrian refugees in the country, adding that Europe would not contribute to the creation of a \u201csafe zone\u201d in northern Syria. \u201cI call on Turkey, as well as on the other actors, to act with restraint and to stop operations already, as we are speaking, underway,\u201d said Juncker.

Many have been displaced multiple times during Syria\u2019s long war. Among those raising concern was the International Rescue Committee, which warned: \u201cAs [the] Turkish offensive in Syria begins, the IRC is deeply concerned about the lives and livelihoods of the 2 million civilians in north-east Syria who have already survived Isis brutality and multiple displacements. \u201cA military offensive could displace 300,000 people and disrupt life-saving humanitarian services, including the IRC\u2019s.\u201d Amnesty International also cautioned against indiscriminate attacks that could result in civilian casualties. \u201cBoth Turkish and Kurdish forces have a track record of carrying out indiscriminate attacks in Syria that have killed scores of civilians,\u201d said Lynn Maalouf, Middle East research director for the group. \u201cThis must not be allowed to happen again. \u201cThe international community must take measures to ensure respect for international humanitarian law by the Turkish authorities and pro-Turkey armed groups and Kurdish forces, if yet another humanitarian catastrophe in northern Syria is to be avoided. \u201cAs in other parts of Syria, scores of civilians in north-east Syria have already suffered from the impact of successive military offensives, multiple displacements and dire living conditions. \u201cTurkey has an obligation under international humanitarian law to take all possible measures to protect civilians and to ensure they have access to humanitarian aid. Civilians wishing to flee the fighting must be given safe passage to do so.\u201d The UK-based agency Save the Children also issued a warning ahead of the start of the offensive. \u201cWe are deeply concerned for the hundreds of thousands of people present in north-east Syria, and we urge all military parties on the ground to ensure that operations do not impact civilians who could face widespread displacement or have their movements restricted. \u201cCurrently, there are 1.65 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in this area, including more than 650,000 displaced by war. All essential services including food, water, shelter, health, education and protection must be consistently provided to all civilians, or we could see another humanitarian disaster unfold before our eyes. \u201cIn addition to the Syrian civilians in the north-east, there are thousands of women and children living in camps across the area \u2026 who rely completely and exclusively on humanitarian aid. Any interruption to camp services which are already overstretched would put their lives at risk. \u201cChildren in Syria who have fled Isis-held areas are innocent and swept up in horrific events far beyond their control. Their short lives have been full of violence and fear. All children deserve [the] chance to recover.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "In 1919, the Swiss pilot and photographer Walter Mittelholzer flew over Mont Blanc in a biplane photographing the alpine landscape. A century on, scientists have recreated his images to show the impact of global heating on the mountain\u2019s glaciers. Dr Kieran Baxter and Dr Alice Watterson from the University of Dundee used a process called monoplotting to work out the precise locations from which Mittelholzer had taken his photographs. They returned to the spot in a helicopter and lined up their cameras using the alpine peaks as their guide. The scientists captured images of three glaciers that Mittelholzer had also photographed: the Bossons glacier, the Argenti\u00e8re glacier and the Mer de Glace, all on the northern side of the Mont Blanc massif. The resulting photographs show just how much ice has been lost from the region over the past century. Baxter said: \u201cThe scale of the ice loss was immediately evident as we reached altitude but it was only by comparing the images side-by-side that the last 100 years of change were made visible. \u201cIt was both a breathtaking and heartbreaking experience, particularly knowing that the melt has accelerated massively in the last few decades.\u201d The Mer de Glace, the longest glacier in France, is the site of the biggest changes over past decades. In the 1800s, travel writers described how it could be seen from the resort town of Chamonix, but it has since receded more than 2km up the mountain\u2019s slopes. The Mer de Glace \u201cis now melting at the rate of around 40 metres a year and has lost 80 metres in depth over the last 20 years alone,\u201d the glaciologist Luc Moreau told the Guardian last year. Mittelholzer, who trained as a military pilot during the first world war, later became the director of a commercial aviation company that later became the Swiss national carrier, Swissair. He died in a climbing accident in 1937. Baxter said: \u201cMittelholzer played a key role in popularising commercial air travel in Switzerland, an industry which ironically came to contribute to the warming of the climate \u2013 and the detriment of the alpine landscapes.\u201d The Dundee scientists said they were careful to keep their own impact on the environment to a minimum. \u201cWhen working at these heights there is currently no viable emission-free alternative so airtime is kept as brief as possible and careful planning goes into getting the most out of a photography flight like this one,\u201d said Baxter. \u201cLuckily, clear weather allowed these repeat aerial photographs to be taken on the centenary year of the originals. Unless we drastically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, there will be little ice left to photograph in another hundred years.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 24 October 2019 to correct the caption of an image that said it depicted Walter Mittelholzer flying over Mont Blanc. In fact, the image shows Mittelholzer further east, over the Bernese Alps in Switzerland.",

      "body": "<p>Davina James-Hanman has only met one self-aware murderer. It\u2019s not that they are generally monsters. \u201cThey are often personable and likeable, and that is how they have been able to abuse women,\u201d she says. But self-awareness? That\u2019s a rarer commodity among the men \u2013 and it is overwhelmingly men \u2013 who now kill their partners or ex-partners in the UK at a rate of three every week.</p> <p>She met the exception to the rule after he had been in prison for 18 months. \u201cBy then he was really owning what he\u2019d done.\u201d Generally, she says, men who kill their partners are, \u201cstill defensive, still in denial \u2013 and they still want you to accept that she was asking for it\u201d.</p> <p>For more than three decades, James-Hanman, 52, has fought to protect survivors of domestic violence. Her career, which started in a women\u2019s refuge in the late 1980s, has included stints running a major charity, advising the government and eight years in charge of strategy for the mayor of London (until Boris Johnson fired her, more of which later).</p> <p>As a consultant on violence against women, she now devotes much of her time to women whose time has run out. Since 2011, every domestic murder has triggered a domestic homicide review (DHR). This is a detailed multi-agency inquiry into the circumstances of the victim\u2019s life and death, and their contact with agencies and services. James-Hanman, who has completed more than 30 DHRs for the Home Office, says it \u201cforces you to ask what would have made a difference\u201d.</p> <p>She applies to each review the lessons of a frontline career in a sector that barely existed when she started. She talks to police officers, doctors and local authorities, as well as the grieving family and friends. She searches victims\u2019 social media accounts. \u201cOccasionally, I get to read their diary,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>She also writes to the killers. About a third agree to meet her.</p> <p>Her workload is huge. Two days before we meet, the BBC publishes new domestic abuse-related homicide data. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/13/domestic-violence-killings-in-uk-at-five-year-high\" title=\"\">In 2018, 173 people were killed</a>, the highest number for five years. The perpetrators were predominantly male (<a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/domesticabuseinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2018\" title=\"\">from 2014 to 2017</a>, 73% of domestic homicide victims were women and 61% of male victims were killed by other men).</p> <p>\u201cWell, did you think austerity was going to have no consequences?\u201d James-Hanman asks. \u201cIf anything, I\u2019m surprised it has taken this long for the numbers to go up. Women are calling the police and they are not turning up. Or abusers are breaching bail and not being arrested. Legal aid has been cut,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cWomen are turned away from refuges because they are full. Money for prevention work has all but dried up \u2026 this stuff makes a difference.\u201d</p> <p>The figures came out three days after Theresa May, as the departing prime minister, awarded a knighthood to Geoffrey Boycott. James-Hanman listened to the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 when Boycott lashed out at presenter Martha Kearney for daring to ask about his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/sep/10/geoffrey-boycott-theresa-may-knighthood\" title=\"1\">1998 conviction in a French court</a> for repeatedly punching his then girlfriend, Margaret Moore, which he still denies. \u201cI don\u2019t give a toss about her, love,\u201d he said of the chief executive of Women\u2019s Aid, who had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/10/geoffrey-boycott-i-dont-give-a-toss-about-criticism-of-knighthood\" title=\"d\">described his knighthood as \u201cextremely disappointing</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was she thinking?\u201d James-Hanman asks of May\u2019s decision to honour Boycott. \u201cWhen abusers say they should have anonymity until they are convicted because otherwise it would ruin their careers, you can say: \u2018Well, you can get convicted and then knighted.\u2019 It\u2019s depressing because it reminds you how far there is to go.\u201d</p> <p>Only weeks before Boycott\u2019s knighthood, May had announced a domestic violence bill, to which the prime minister, Boris Johnson, has now expressed his \u201cfull commitment\u201d (it fell when he prorogued parliament in September). James-Hanman is positive about some of the measures in May\u2019s bill \u2013 it would place new statutory duties on councils among other things \u2013 but says they \u201cring hollow\u201d after a decade of austerity.</p> <p>Her cynicism could be forgiven. Murder is the worst result of a flawed system. <a href=\"https://www.refuge.org.uk/our-work/forms-of-violence-and-abuse/domestic-violence/domestic-violence-the-facts/\" title=\"\">One in four women</a> will experience domestic abuse of some kind in their life. Protecting them has been her life\u2019s work. After a conservative upbringing in a military family, James-Hanman remembers a formative school trip to an exhibition about the suffragettes. \u201cLearning about them was electrifying \u2013 this group of really badly behaved women,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You can get convicted of domestic abuse and then knighted \u2013 it\u2019s depressing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a history student at the University of East Anglia, she was struck, while volunteering at a free pregnancy testing service in Norwich, by how many women were checking their reproductive status as part of decision-making about an abusive relationship.</p> <p>James-Hanman\u2019s first paid job was at a refuge in Hillingdon, west London. This was the late 80s and domestic abuse murders were not even added up officially. James-Hanman still remembers the sole civil servant who looked at national policy (\u201cGeoffrey Marriage. He had a beard you could hide a badger in\u201d). Police forces, meanwhile, would typically assign women officers who were new mothers to domestic cases because the hours were easier.</p> <p>When the refuge applied to social services to fund summer activities for the 25 children it housed, \u201cWe were turned down by a female committee chair on the grounds that we were encouraging feckless women to leave loving husbands.\u201d She laughs sardonically. \u201cEven in the late 80s, \u2018feckless\u2019 was quite an antediluvian word.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe used to say domestic violence was everywhere but nowhere because it was nobody\u2019s focus,\u201d she adds. But soon the sector would learn from emerging American \u201cmulti-agency\u201d approaches, including health and education as well as police and the criminal justice system. In 1992, James-Hanman became Britain\u2019s first local authority domestic violence coordinator, in Islington. Among other measures, the London borough placed crisis intervention workers in police stations.</p> <p>After 1997, the Labour government pumped money into the sector. The 1998 Crime and Disorder Act offered local authorities and police forces central funding if they hit new crime targets, creating a financial incentive to tackle domestic violence. In 2000, the new mayor, Ken Livingstone, asked James-Hanman to develop the city\u2019s first domestic violence strategy. Attempting to unite the women\u2019s sector, police and 32 boroughs was a major challenge, she says: \u201cI went home and cried every day.\u201d She kept banging heads together until, 10 days after Johnson was elected mayor in 2008, he dismissed her by letter. (He eventually announced his own strategy.)</p> <p>The new focus and funding were pivotal but fraught. As the sector became more professional, faultlines opened between the women who had started it as a feminist movement \u2013 many were themselves survivors \u2013 and a new generation of professionals who had followed the money. The priority became prosecution and the highest-risk cases, which neglected victims of coercive control and other forms of abuse. Then came austerity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"73a1a9a7b166a41bfd4a30b57c8097c3864da5e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73a1a9a7b166a41bfd4a30b57c8097c3864da5e4/69_67_1207_1508/800.jpg\" alt=\"Shana Grice, who was killed by her former boyfriend\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shana Grice, who was killed by her former boyfriend</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family Handout/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2015, coercive control became<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/29/domestic-abuse-law-controlling-coercive-behaviour\" title=\"a\"> a crime</a>, but we still neglect the root causes of abuse, James-Hanman says. They permeate a society in which \u201cwife beating\u201d is viewed as an inevitability, even a punchline. \u201cIn the early days I used to have paranoid fantasies that there was some kind of secret abuser\u2019s handbook,\u201d she says, so similar were the stories victims brought to refuges. \u201cEventually I realised that there is, and it\u2019s not secret at all \u2013 it\u2019s called mainstream culture.\u201d</p> <p>James-Hanman sees it in her homicide reviews and in prisons. She meets men who fear losing the power that comes with a rigid belief in traditional gender roles. Men who repackage \u201cgirly\u201d emotions such as insecurity, stress and fear as anger. \u201cOften they are not feeling anger at all but that\u2019s the only safe emotion to feel because if they stop believing in gender roles, their whole world starts to crumble,\u201d she says. Substance abuse and financial stresses don\u2019t help.</p> <p>Progress means <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/02/labour-mp-moves-colleagues-to-tears-with-domestic-abuse-story\" title=\"m\">more women now recognise abuse and get out of toxic relationships sooner</a>. But when a woman becomes a mother, the power balance in a couple changes. James-Hanman draws a direct link to the inequities of parental leave. \u201cViolence against women is a cause and consequence of women\u2019s inequality,\u201d she says \u2013 repeating a mantra in the sector.</p> <p>She has seen the pernicious effect of technology, too. Abusers now use video calling so they can see which rooms their partners are in, and put satellite trackers in their cars.

      "bodyText": "Davina James-Hanman has only met one self-aware murderer. It\u2019s not that they are generally monsters. \u201cThey are often personable and likeable, and that is how they have been able to abuse women,\u201d she says. But self-awareness? That\u2019s a rarer commodity among the men \u2013 and it is overwhelmingly men \u2013 who now kill their partners or ex-partners in the UK at a rate of three every week. She met the exception to the rule after he had been in prison for 18 months. \u201cBy then he was really owning what he\u2019d done.\u201d Generally, she says, men who kill their partners are, \u201cstill defensive, still in denial \u2013 and they still want you to accept that she was asking for it\u201d. For more than three decades, James-Hanman, 52, has fought to protect survivors of domestic violence. Her career, which started in a women\u2019s refuge in the late 1980s, has included stints running a major charity, advising the government and eight years in charge of strategy for the mayor of London (until Boris Johnson fired her, more of which later). As a consultant on violence against women, she now devotes much of her time to women whose time has run out. Since 2011, every domestic murder has triggered a domestic homicide review (DHR). This is a detailed multi-agency inquiry into the circumstances of the victim\u2019s life and death, and their contact with agencies and services. James-Hanman, who has completed more than 30 DHRs for the Home Office, says it \u201cforces you to ask what would have made a difference\u201d. She applies to each review the lessons of a frontline career in a sector that barely existed when she started. She talks to police officers, doctors and local authorities, as well as the grieving family and friends. She searches victims\u2019 social media accounts. \u201cOccasionally, I get to read their diary,\u201d she adds. She also writes to the killers. About a third agree to meet her. Her workload is huge. Two days before we meet, the BBC publishes new domestic abuse-related homicide data. In 2018, 173 people were killed, the highest number for five years. The perpetrators were predominantly male (from 2014 to 2017, 73% of domestic homicide victims were women and 61% of male victims were killed by other men). \u201cWell, did you think austerity was going to have no consequences?\u201d James-Hanman asks. \u201cIf anything, I\u2019m surprised it has taken this long for the numbers to go up. Women are calling the police and they are not turning up. Or abusers are breaching bail and not being arrested. Legal aid has been cut,\u201d she says. \u201cWomen are turned away from refuges because they are full. Money for prevention work has all but dried up \u2026 this stuff makes a difference.\u201d The figures came out three days after Theresa May, as the departing prime minister, awarded a knighthood to Geoffrey Boycott. James-Hanman listened to the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 when Boycott lashed out at presenter Martha Kearney for daring to ask about his 1998 conviction in a French court for repeatedly punching his then girlfriend, Margaret Moore, which he still denies. \u201cI don\u2019t give a toss about her, love,\u201d he said of the chief executive of Women\u2019s Aid, who had described his knighthood as \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d. \u201cWhat was she thinking?\u201d James-Hanman asks of May\u2019s decision to honour Boycott. \u201cWhen abusers say they should have anonymity until they are convicted because otherwise it would ruin their careers, you can say: \u2018Well, you can get convicted and then knighted.\u2019 It\u2019s depressing because it reminds you how far there is to go.\u201d Only weeks before Boycott\u2019s knighthood, May had announced a domestic violence bill, to which the prime minister, Boris Johnson, has now expressed his \u201cfull commitment\u201d (it fell when he prorogued parliament in September). James-Hanman is positive about some of the measures in May\u2019s bill \u2013 it would place new statutory duties on councils among other things \u2013 but says they \u201cring hollow\u201d after a decade of austerity. Her cynicism could be forgiven. Murder is the worst result of a flawed system. One in four women will experience domestic abuse of some kind in their life. Protecting them has been her life\u2019s work. After a conservative upbringing in a military family, James-Hanman remembers a formative school trip to an exhibition about the suffragettes. \u201cLearning about them was electrifying \u2013 this group of really badly behaved women,\u201d she says. As a history student at the University of East Anglia, she was struck, while volunteering at a free pregnancy testing service in Norwich, by how many women were checking their reproductive status as part of decision-making about an abusive relationship. James-Hanman\u2019s first paid job was at a refuge in Hillingdon, west London. This was the late 80s and domestic abuse murders were not even added up officially. James-Hanman still remembers the sole civil servant who looked at national policy (\u201cGeoffrey Marriage. He had a beard you could hide a badger in\u201d). Police forces, meanwhile, would typically assign women officers who were new mothers to domestic cases because the hours were easier. When the refuge applied to social services to fund summer activities for the 25 children it housed, \u201cWe were turned down by a female committee chair on the grounds that we were encouraging feckless women to leave loving husbands.\u201d She laughs sardonically. \u201cEven in the late 80s, \u2018feckless\u2019 was quite an antediluvian word.\u201d \u201cWe used to say domestic violence was everywhere but nowhere because it was nobody\u2019s focus,\u201d she adds. But soon the sector would learn from emerging American \u201cmulti-agency\u201d approaches, including health and education as well as police and the criminal justice system. In 1992, James-Hanman became Britain\u2019s first local authority domestic violence coordinator, in Islington. Among other measures, the London borough placed crisis intervention workers in police stations. After 1997, the Labour government pumped money into the sector. The 1998 Crime and Disorder Act offered local authorities and police forces central funding if they hit new crime targets, creating a financial incentive to tackle domestic violence. In 2000, the new mayor, Ken Livingstone, asked James-Hanman to develop the city\u2019s first domestic violence strategy. Attempting to unite the women\u2019s sector, police and 32 boroughs was a major challenge, she says: \u201cI went home and cried every day.\u201d She kept banging heads together until, 10 days after Johnson was elected mayor in 2008, he dismissed her by letter. (He eventually announced his own strategy.) The new focus and funding were pivotal but fraught. As the sector became more professional, faultlines opened between the women who had started it as a feminist movement \u2013 many were themselves survivors \u2013 and a new generation of professionals who had followed the money. The priority became prosecution and the highest-risk cases, which neglected victims of coercive control and other forms of abuse. Then came austerity. In 2015, coercive control became a crime, but we still neglect the root causes of abuse, James-Hanman says. They permeate a society in which \u201cwife beating\u201d is viewed as an inevitability, even a punchline. \u201cIn the early days I used to have paranoid fantasies that there was some kind of secret abuser\u2019s handbook,\u201d she says, so similar were the stories victims brought to refuges. \u201cEventually I realised that there is, and it\u2019s not secret at all \u2013 it\u2019s called mainstream culture.\u201d James-Hanman sees it in her homicide reviews and in prisons. She meets men who fear losing the power that comes with a rigid belief in traditional gender roles. Men who repackage \u201cgirly\u201d emotions such as insecurity, stress and fear as anger. \u201cOften they are not feeling anger at all but that\u2019s the only safe emotion to feel because if they stop believing in gender roles, their whole world starts to crumble,\u201d she says. Substance abuse and financial stresses don\u2019t help. Progress means more women now recognise abuse and get out of toxic relationships sooner. But when a woman becomes a mother, the power balance in a couple changes. James-Hanman draws a direct link to the inequities of parental leave. \u201cViolence against women is a cause and consequence of women\u2019s inequality,\u201d she says \u2013 repeating a mantra in the sector. She has seen the pernicious effect of technology, too. Abusers now use video calling so they can see which rooms their partners are in, and put satellite trackers in their cars. Also, pornography is ubiquitous and fills a gap in young minds that should be filled with learning about relationships. For 17 years, until 2014, James-Hanman ran the Against Violence and Abuse charity. When she worked with the Home Office on its \u201cThis is abuse\u201d campaign, she moderated the teenage chatrooms. \u201cSome of them were just \u2026\u201d she drops her jaw. \u201cThings like, \u2018My boyfriend made me give a blowjob in front of his mates; is this abuse?\u2019\u201d In the recent homicide review of Shana Grice, 19, who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend in 2016, James-Hanman noted that the prevailing culture among young people, in which teenage girls face \u201can endless bombardment of messages that inform them they are valued for how they look\u201d, means harassment is often \u201cminimised, normalised or even rationalised as \u2018romance\u2019\u201d.

It may still happen, although, alas, not for Fiji because, without the cash injection World Rugby had pledged, they would bring no commercial value. Japan are different and it has been notable that advertisements on trains and the subway now feature local players prominently. The Rugby Championship countries are negotiating a new television deal for another four years at a time when Super Rugby\u2019s allure is fading, having lost so many players to Europe and Japan. South Africa have wondered aloud about joining the European countries because it would be more financially lucrative but Japan have given pause for thought. No Nations League means the south will continue to lag behind the north financially but Japan may prove to be the land of opportunity. The TV audience share for the match between Japan and Samoa was more than 46%, reckoned to be the biggest live audience in the country this year, and 150,000 supporters crammed into the fan zones. Japan making the quarter-finals would only enhance their value. At the start of the tournament there was an assumption they would target the Scotland game but their coach, Jamie Joseph, had Ireland in mind all along. The result was an explosion in interest in Japan and Scotland are now being billed as the fall guys. They will not accept the role come Sunday but it is not only because Japan are the hosts that they are in such a position. \u2022 This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

Two people died and two others were severely injured in the attempted mass shooting, as the gunman, wearing a military-style uniform, tried to force his way into the synagogue during a Yom Kippur celebration on Wednesday. He recorded the attacks on a head-mounted camera and uploaded some 35 minutes of footage online, accompanied by an antisemitic and rightwing extremist rant. Homemade weapons.

Johnson &amp; Johnson says it will appeal a US jury\u2019s demand that it pay $8bn in punitive damages over a side-effect of its antipsychotic drug Risperdal, which the plaintiff\u2019s lawyers say is linked to the abnormal growth of female breast tissue in boys.

      "body": "<p>In the basement of Nottingham Contemporary art gallery, Jennifer Lacey fans out a set of large homemade tarot cards. I pick a pink one, turn it over, and find an image of a baby chick beneath a pair of boob-like fried eggs. The artist <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/lucas-self-portrait-with-fried-eggs-p78447\">Sarah Lucas</a> immediately springs to mind but Lacey\u2019s picture is actually a homage to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/mar/06/leigh-bowery-most-outrageous-looks-in-pictures\">Leigh Bowery</a>, the outre superstar who was his own art object. Several portraits of Bowery hang a couple of floors above us, along with a video of him strolling through Manhattan\u2019s Meatpacking District in a peanut bodysuit and one-shoulder floral dress. They are part of the exhibition <a href=\"https://www.nottinghamcontemporary.org/whats-on/undead-pop-culture-in-britain-beyond-the-bauhaus/\">Still Undead: Britain Beyond the Bauhaus</a>, which explores the far-reaching influence of the Weimar art school. Lacey has drawn upon several of the artworks for her one-to-one performance, Extended Hermeneutics, which I\u2019m experiencing over a cup of tea in the cafe.</p> <p>Lacey is an American choreographer who has been based in France since the start of the century. Presented by Nottingham\u2019s biennial dance festival, <a href=\"https://www.dance4.co.uk/nottdance/\">Nottdance</a>, Extended Hermeneutics is, well, not dance. She may end each 30-minute session with a short solo but for the main part she will act as life coach, psychologist and fortune-teller. The tarot cards are part of \u201ca performance we\u2019re doing together,\u201d she tells me. \u201cWe\u2019re asking the art.\u201d The idea is to use artworks suggested by the cards to wrestle with a problem offered by the participant.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been told that world peace and the economy are off limits and that I should choose a problem from my personal life. Having wandered around Still Undead and grown nostalgic in a room devoted to Leeds Polytechnic, I say I miss my family in Yorkshire and wish I could see more of them, but that home life with my kids in London is always hectic. Lacey seems pleased by the dilemma and we contemplate the fried eggs and happy chick on the tarot card, which is supposed to give us a feel of both the dynamics of the problem and the spirit of Bowery\u2019s work. \u201cI pretty much thought about Leigh Bowery and thought I\u2019d make him out of eggs,\u201d she explains cheerily.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f02846e69b232d0aba31490ae78c43238bd3ee2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f02846e69b232d0aba31490ae78c43238bd3ee2/0_0_4247_2968/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tarot cards designed by Jennifer Lacey for her show Extended Hermeneutics, responding to the work of Leigh Bowery (left) and Gertrud Arndt (right).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"699\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tarot cards designed by Jennifer Lacey for her show Extended Hermeneutics, responding to the work of Leigh Bowery (left) and Gertrud Arndt (right).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Jennifer Lacey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I try to offer up a literal interpretation of the card as suggesting domestic routine and family life, with eggs the stuff of birth and breakfasts.

      "body": "<p>When a brash businessman-turned-politician won a majority government in Canada\u2019s most populous province in 2018, Conservatives in the country wondered if they could ride a similar populist wave to national victory in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/justin-trudeau-seeks-to-repeat-2015-surge-as-canada-braces-for-election\">this year\u2019s general election</a>.</p> <p>Promising to slash income tax, cut fuel prices and repeal carbon pricing, Doug Ford took 41% of the vote and ended 15 years of Liberal rule in Ontario.</p> <p>In the weeks after his win, Conservative leaders flocked to his side, bathing in reflected electoral glory \u2013 and speculating that similar tactics might take them to victory over Justin Trudeau.</p> <p>But as the federal election draws near, Canada\u2019s Conservatives have adopted a very different tactic: avoiding Ford at all costs.</p> <p>In less than a year, Ford\u2019s stock as an electoral asset has plummeted: the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer, hasn\u2019t appeared at a single campaign event with the premier, even when canvassing in Ford\u2019s own neighbourhood.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Conservatives have struggled to build momentum outside their base. Scheer has failed to draw crowds to his campaign events, and has been forced to defend past remarks on same-sex marriage and abortion.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/08/canada-leaders-debate-justin-trudeau-puts-climate-crisis-at-heart-of-election\">Canada leaders' debate: tarnished Trudeau puts climate crisis at heart of election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And even after the prime minister became entangled in two scandals \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/14/trudeau-broke-ethics-law-in-snc-lavalin-case-watchdog-rules\">ethics violations</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/19/justin-trudeau-wearing-blackface-details-emerge-third-incident\">images showing him in racist blackface</a>, polls show Scheer and Trudeau locked in a dead heat. Conservative strategists worry that Scheer has failed to galvanize voters \u2013 and that Ford has become so toxic that he is hampering the party\u2019s chances of forming a government.</p> <p>As recently as late spring, Conservatives were basking in poll numbers that put them comfortably ahead of Trudeau\u2019s party.</p> <p>And in Ontario \u2013 where the Conservatives were overturning the legacy of an unpopular Liberal provincial government \u2013 the federal party was confident they had a strong ally.</p> <p>Ford was a relatively new face to mainstream conservative politics: his early political career was overshadowed by his younger brother Rob, the notorious former Toronto mayor who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/11/rob-ford-crack-video-release\">admitted smoking crack while in office</a>.</p> <p>Despite several years as a city councillor, the elder Ford only entered provincial politics after his brother\u2019s death, and his candidacy was initially viewed with skepticism.</p> <p>But his blunt language and appeal to \u201cthe common folk\u201d soon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/30/doug-ford-ontario-conservative-trump-comparison-canada\">drew comparisons with Donald Trump</a>. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/08/ontario-election-results-populist-doug-ford-to-become-premier\">after he became premier of Ontario</a>, Ford was quickly elevated to celebrity status within conservative circles, often appearing with Scheer at party events.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m putting the prime minister on notice,\u201d Ford told a cheering crowd last year. \u201cJustin Trudeau, you\u2019re next.\u201d</p> <p>In recent months, however, Ford has experienced a stunning reversal of fortune. His government has been dogged by protests over steep cuts to education, patronage scandals and looming labour strikes.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/03/doug-ford-scraps-carbon-tax-plan-and-sets-up-climate-fight-with-trudeau\">Ford has also gone to war with the federal government over a carbon tax</a>, spending millions on a legal fight the majority of Ontario residents oppose.

      "bodyText": "When a brash businessman-turned-politician won a majority government in Canada\u2019s most populous province in 2018, Conservatives in the country wondered if they could ride a similar populist wave to national victory in this year\u2019s general election. Promising to slash income tax, cut fuel prices and repeal carbon pricing, Doug Ford took 41% of the vote and ended 15 years of Liberal rule in Ontario. In the weeks after his win, Conservative leaders flocked to his side, bathing in reflected electoral glory \u2013 and speculating that similar tactics might take them to victory over Justin Trudeau. But as the federal election draws near, Canada\u2019s Conservatives have adopted a very different tactic: avoiding Ford at all costs. In less than a year, Ford\u2019s stock as an electoral asset has plummeted: the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer, hasn\u2019t appeared at a single campaign event with the premier, even when canvassing in Ford\u2019s own neighbourhood. Meanwhile, the Conservatives have struggled to build momentum outside their base. Scheer has failed to draw crowds to his campaign events, and has been forced to defend past remarks on same-sex marriage and abortion. And even after the prime minister became entangled in two scandals \u2013 ethics violations and images showing him in racist blackface, polls show Scheer and Trudeau locked in a dead heat. Conservative strategists worry that Scheer has failed to galvanize voters \u2013 and that Ford has become so toxic that he is hampering the party\u2019s chances of forming a government. As recently as late spring, Conservatives were basking in poll numbers that put them comfortably ahead of Trudeau\u2019s party. And in Ontario \u2013 where the Conservatives were overturning the legacy of an unpopular Liberal provincial government \u2013 the federal party was confident they had a strong ally. Ford was a relatively new face to mainstream conservative politics: his early political career was overshadowed by his younger brother Rob, the notorious former Toronto mayor who admitted smoking crack while in office. Despite several years as a city councillor, the elder Ford only entered provincial politics after his brother\u2019s death, and his candidacy was initially viewed with skepticism. But his blunt language and appeal to \u201cthe common folk\u201d soon drew comparisons with Donald Trump. And after he became premier of Ontario, Ford was quickly elevated to celebrity status within conservative circles, often appearing with Scheer at party events. \u201cI\u2019m putting the prime minister on notice,\u201d Ford told a cheering crowd last year. \u201cJustin Trudeau, you\u2019re next.\u201d In recent months, however, Ford has experienced a stunning reversal of fortune. His government has been dogged by protests over steep cuts to education, patronage scandals and looming labour strikes. Ford has also gone to war with the federal government over a carbon tax, spending millions on a legal fight the majority of Ontario residents oppose. His approval rating has dropped to 25%, making him the second-most disliked premier in the country. \u201cHe came in really wanting to quickly undo a lot of the signature policies of the previous government,\u201d said Omar Yan Khan, a political strategist in Toronto. \u201c[Ford\u2019s government] have been getting quite a bit of blowback from some of those decisions and it\u2019s led to a little bit of buyer\u2019s remorse on the part of many in the Ontario electorate.\u201d A recent poll from the Angus Reid Institute found that 85% of Ontario says the \u201cpolicies and actions\u201d of Ford\u2019s government would make them less likely to vote for Scheer\u2019s Conservatives in the federal election \u2013 and 71% suggested it would direct them towards the Liberals. Because of Ontario\u2019s electoral weight, it is virtually impossible for a party to win a general election in Canada without success in the province. Conservatives have traditionally done well in the region\u2019s rural areas, but the 21 October election is likely to hinge on the ethnically diverse suburbs of Toronto, a suburban sprawl known as the 905 (for its dialing code). 905 voters can be fickle: they granted the Conservatives a majority in 2011 \u2013 only to snatch it back in 2015, when Trudeau swept the province. Earlier this year, the Conservatives held a 10-point lead over the Liberals in Ontario \u2013 but that has now become a 10-point deficit, driven largely by Ford\u2019s unpopularity, said Frank Graves, head of polling firm Ekos Research. \u201cThat\u2019s an enormous transfer of seats from one side of the ledger to the other,\u201d he said. The cold math of parliament suggests Scheer, who has no viable allies on the right, needs to win an outright majority to have any hope of forming a government. Anything short of this allows Trudeau to strike deals with left-of-centre parties to stay in power. \u201cOntario is now turning into something of a political proxy war,\u201d said Shachi Kurl, executive director at Angus Reid. \u201cAnd Scheer is dealing with the Ford factor, which is a drag on the Conservative\u2019s political fortunes.\u201d Before Trudeau swept to power in 2015, the Conservatives governed Canada for nearly a decade and they retain immense support in rural areas and the western heartlands of the country\u2019s oil industry. But in an election taking place amid a climate emergency and rising income inequality, the party\u2019s pledge to quash carbon pricing legislation and cut taxes have not resonated with voters. Meanwhile, Scheer, who narrowly won control of the party in 2017, has struggled to carve out a distinct identity, lacking the charisma \u2013 and name recognition of Trudeau. Eager to capitalize on Conservative weaknesses in Ontario, Trudeau has taken to mentioning Ford every at every opportunity \u2013 so much so that at the last leaders\u2019 debate on Monday, Scheer accused the prime minister of being \u201coddly obsessed with provincial politics\u201d. But in a tacit admission that Ford is electoral kryptonite, the Conservatives recently took the unprecedented step of parachuting in a different Conservative premier to campaign in Ontario. Over the weekend, the Alberta premier, Jason Kenney, toured the south of the province, stumping for Scheer. Ford was nowhere to be seen.",

      "bodyText": "The governor of the Bank of England has unveiled the new \u00a320 polymer banknote featuring the artist JMW Turner as the Bank continues its switch away from paper money. Mark Carney revealed the note\u2019s design in Margate at Turner Contemporary gallery, which is named after the painter. Carney was joined by the artist Tracey Emin, who grew up in the Kent coastal town. Turner, the first artist to feature on a British banknote, went to school in Margate and many of his paintings were of the local seascapes. Turner Contemporary is on the site of the lodging house where he stayed when he returned to the town. The \u00a320 note follows the Bank\u2019s launch of polymer \u00a35 and \u00a310 notes, which went into circulation in September 2016 and September 2017 respectively. The Bank is opting for polymer over traditional paper notes because it is cleaner, longer-lasting and harder to forge. The Bank said the latest note was its most secure yet with two windows and a two-colour foil, making it difficult to counterfeit. With more than 2bn \u00a320 notes in circulation, it is Britain\u2019s most used and forged banknote. The foil features Turner Contemporary, which opened in 2011 and helped revive Margate as an artistic centre, in blue and the town\u2019s lighthouse in gold. The note will enter circulation on 20 February alongside existing paper \u00a320 notes, which will be phased out. The new polymer notes feature images of historic British figures, with Winston Churchill appearing on the \u00a35 note and Jane Austen on the \u00a310 note. A \u00a350 note featuring the mathematician and second world war codebreaker Alan Turing will follow in 2021. Carney said on Thursday: \u201cOur banknotes celebrate the UK\u2019s heritage, salute its culture, and testify to the achievements of its most notable individuals. Turner\u2019s contribution to art extends well beyond his favourite stretch of shoreline. \u201cTurner\u2019s painting was transformative, his influence spanned lifetimes, and his legacy endures today. The new \u00a320 note celebrates Turner, his art and his legacy in all their radiant, colourful, evocative glory.\u201d The note features Turner\u2019s 1799 self-portrait, which hangs in Tate Britain, as well as one of his most recognisable works, The Fighting Temeraire \u2013 a tribute to the ship which played a big part in Nelson\u2019s victory at the battle of Trafalgar in 1805. The \u00a320 note has a quote from Turner, \u201clight is therefore colour\u201d, and his signature taken from his will, which bequeathed many of his works to the nation. Emin said: \u201cWhat is really fantastic about Turner being on this note is he was wild and he was a maverick. This note is going to go all over the world and wherever I go I can say: \u2018This is where I come from.\u2019 Not just Margate but art.

I might not have been as successful but it would have been very different.\u201d Turner was selected in 2016 from a longlist of 590 painters, sculptors, fashion designers, photographers, film-makers and actors put forward by 30,000 members of the public. The list was whittled down to five and Turner was chosen by the Bank\u2019s banknote character advisory committee.

So what now? | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The moment May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/18/the-guardian-view-on-theresa-mays-brexit-strategy-failing-on-two-fronts\" title=\"\">took a different course</a>, she was doomed to fail. EU support for Ireland\u2019s position on the border meant the government could not get the UK-wide free trade agreement Brexiter MPs wanted. A significant number in May\u2019s own party then decided only no deal would be acceptable. From that point on, it would be impossible to get any kind of Brexit deal through either the current parliament or the country in a second referendum.</p> <p>The reason is simple. A combination of remainers and Brexiters would block any Brexit deal in parliament, and outvote it in a referendum. Game theory calls it a blocking coalition. People talk about a growing polarisation of views about Brexit, but its roots lie in this blocking majority against any form of deal. Once Brexiters realised that ensuring no hard border in Ireland entailed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/11/john-major-customs-union-brexit-hard-border-northern-ireland\" title=\"\">customs union</a>, the chance of any Brexit deal vanished in this parliament.</p> <p>But Brexit was to be revived. The European elections <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/27/nigel-farage-brexit-party-elections\" title=\"\">provided its proponents with new hope</a>. The Conservatives\u2019 terrible performance led to May\u2019s replacement by Johnson, who said he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/24/boris-johnson-favourite-as-uk-to-have-new-pm-by-end-of-july\" title=\"\">prepared for a no-deal exit</a>. More importantly, the failure of the Labour leadership to see how things had changed since 2016 allowed for a Liberal Democrat revival and a split in the remain vote.</p> <p>The tragedy of Labour\u2019s stance was that the impossibility of any deal winning in the country also applied to anything a Labour government could negotiate. Remainers would vote against a soft Brexit, and Brexiters would ensure many leavers would not vote for it. The painful reluctance of the Labour leadership to give up the idea of a soft Brexit, a reluctance that split the remain vote, was entirely futile because Labour\u2019s soft Brexit can never happen.</p> <p>The implications of a split remain vote for Brexiters was obvious. If parliament was to block their plans, they had an opportunity to change its composition in a general election. Johnson\u2019s attempt to get a deal is a charade simply designed to win an election and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/08/brexit-lates-news-boris-johnons-dominic-cummings-accused-of-being-source-of-unofficial-no-10-threat-to-retaliate-against-eu-countries-that-back-extension-live-news\" title=\"\">blame both the EU</a> and parliament for any extension beyond October.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62bd94044a666b2e11ee37f8cd8cf4d5c2a0492d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62bd94044a666b2e11ee37f8cd8cf4d5c2a0492d/0_26_4863_2918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Major and Tony Blair campaigning for remain in Derry, June 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When John Major and Tony Blair said Brexit would damage the Good Friday agreement, leavers said, accused them of project fear.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If Johnson wins that election, Brexiters will have saved Brexit from the jaws of defeat to achieve complete victory. What started as a referendum where there was a slim majority for some type of Brexit deal is likely to end with no deal supported by a minority being imposed on the majority. But it is worse than that: the sizable minority who say they want no deal have little idea of what they are voting for.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/02/no-deal-brexit-hurt-uk-economy-mark-carney\" title=\"\">economic consequences</a> of a no-deal Brexit are well rehearsed. The media focus on the short-term consequences, but what academics of trade economics are confident about is the large and negative <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-no-deal-economy-gdp-trade-us-growth-pound-a9089826.html\" title=\"\">long-term impact</a>. Almost everyone\u2019s income will be lower by a number of percentage points compared with remaining in the EU. The more human face of that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49970197\" title=\"\">will include farmers</a>, who will go bankrupt in their thousands or be kept afloat with borrowed government money. But the economic damage is only half the story.</p> <p>The potential <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/22/northern-ireland-police-chief-simon-byrne-warns-brexit-hard-border-could-revive-paramilitary-groups\" title=\"\">breakdown of peace</a> in Northern Ireland caused by a hard border would be catastrophic. The UK will also have to deal with attempts by Scotland to achieve independence. Brexit will lead to endless negotiations with the EU as UK politicians are forced to make compromises they refuse to make today. The same politicians, meanwhile, will be so desperate to do a trade deal with the US that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/06/britain-urged-to-reject-backward-us-food-safety-standards\" title=\"\">UK food safety standards</a> will be compromised and the NHS made more attractive to US companies. And so on.</p> <p>\u201cProject fear\u201d? Let\u2019s look at the record of the Brexiters\u2019 favourite phrase. When remainers said negotiations would be difficult, leavers said that was project fear at work: it would be the easiest deal in history. When John Major and Tony Blair said Brexit would damage the Good Friday agreement, leavers again accused them of project fear: there would be no border thanks to technology. </p> <p>Talking about the Treasury\u2019s forecast does not disguise the economic costs of the referendum so far: a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/22/brexit-vote-cost-uk-mark-carney-bank-of-england\" title=\"\">fall in average incomes</a> and a substantial drop in inward investment. Most businesses really fear no deal.</p> <p>The Brexiters\u2019 last resort is to say it is not about economics. There is an element of truth in the culture war argument, but what was sold in the referendum is not what leavers will get. Carmakers advertise their new models by showing glamorous pictures of vehicles gliding around mountain roads \u2013 Vote Leave used similar tactics. If you have any doubt about this, you only have to watch Dominic Cummings talking about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDbRxH9Kiy4\" title=\"\">how he won in 2016</a>.</p> <p>Did he base his campaign on the concerns Brexiter MPs had about loss of sovereignty? Of course not, because no one understood the EU. He instead talked about taking back control in order to capitalise on the backlash from the financial crisis and austerity. He countered the economic fears of leaving with stories of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/16/michael-gove-admits-leave-was-wrong-to-fuel-immigration-fears\" title=\"\">Turkey\u2019s imminent membership</a>. He talked about \u00a3350m so everyone would talk about how much the EU cost rather than its benefits.</p> <p>Just as people were sold snake oil in 2016, the Brexiters and their press are selling no deal (a \u201cclean break\u201d) in a similar way now. The number of people who will be better off in any way as a result of a no-deal Brexit can be counted in thousands, not millions. If Johnson wins the next election, it will be these thousands who will benefit while the rest of the country suffers.</p> <p>\u2022 Simon Wren-Lewis is emeritus professor of economics and fellow of Merton College, Oxford.

      "bodyText": "In the months after the 2016 referendum, there was a chance of finding a Brexit deal that parliament could have voted for. Both major parties wanted to respect the result. Many remain voters were prepared to back Brexit. But it required Theresa May to negotiate with the opposition to find a soft Brexit deal both leaders could support. The moment May took a different course, she was doomed to fail. EU support for Ireland\u2019s position on the border meant the government could not get the UK-wide free trade agreement Brexiter MPs wanted. A significant number in May\u2019s own party then decided only no deal would be acceptable. From that point on, it would be impossible to get any kind of Brexit deal through either the current parliament or the country in a second referendum. The reason is simple. A combination of remainers and Brexiters would block any Brexit deal in parliament, and outvote it in a referendum. Game theory calls it a blocking coalition. People talk about a growing polarisation of views about Brexit, but its roots lie in this blocking majority against any form of deal. Once Brexiters realised that ensuring no hard border in Ireland entailed a customs union, the chance of any Brexit deal vanished in this parliament. But Brexit was to be revived. The European elections provided its proponents with new hope. The Conservatives\u2019 terrible performance led to May\u2019s replacement by Johnson, who said he was prepared for a no-deal exit. More importantly, the failure of the Labour leadership to see how things had changed since 2016 allowed for a Liberal Democrat revival and a split in the remain vote. The tragedy of Labour\u2019s stance was that the impossibility of any deal winning in the country also applied to anything a Labour government could negotiate. Remainers would vote against a soft Brexit, and Brexiters would ensure many leavers would not vote for it. The painful reluctance of the Labour leadership to give up the idea of a soft Brexit, a reluctance that split the remain vote, was entirely futile because Labour\u2019s soft Brexit can never happen. The implications of a split remain vote for Brexiters was obvious. If parliament was to block their plans, they had an opportunity to change its composition in a general election. Johnson\u2019s attempt to get a deal is a charade simply designed to win an election and blame both the EU and parliament for any extension beyond October. If Johnson wins that election, Brexiters will have saved Brexit from the jaws of defeat to achieve complete victory. What started as a referendum where there was a slim majority for some type of Brexit deal is likely to end with no deal supported by a minority being imposed on the majority. But it is worse than that: the sizable minority who say they want no deal have little idea of what they are voting for. The economic consequences of a no-deal Brexit are well rehearsed. The media focus on the short-term consequences, but what academics of trade economics are confident about is the large and negative long-term impact. Almost everyone\u2019s income will be lower by a number of percentage points compared with remaining in the EU. The more human face of that will include farmers, who will go bankrupt in their thousands or be kept afloat with borrowed government money. But the economic damage is only half the story. The potential breakdown of peace in Northern Ireland caused by a hard border would be catastrophic. The UK will also have to deal with attempts by Scotland to achieve independence. Brexit will lead to endless negotiations with the EU as UK politicians are forced to make compromises they refuse to make today. The same politicians, meanwhile, will be so desperate to do a trade deal with the US that UK food safety standards will be compromised and the NHS made more attractive to US companies. And so on. \u201cProject fear\u201d? Let\u2019s look at the record of the Brexiters\u2019 favourite phrase. When remainers said negotiations would be difficult, leavers said that was project fear at work: it would be the easiest deal in history. When John Major and Tony Blair said Brexit would damage the Good Friday agreement, leavers again accused them of project fear: there would be no border thanks to technology. Talking about the Treasury\u2019s forecast does not disguise the economic costs of the referendum so far: a fall in average incomes and a substantial drop in inward investment. Most businesses really fear no deal. The Brexiters\u2019 last resort is to say it is not about economics. There is an element of truth in the culture war argument, but what was sold in the referendum is not what leavers will get. Carmakers advertise their new models by showing glamorous pictures of vehicles gliding around mountain roads \u2013 Vote Leave used similar tactics. If you have any doubt about this, you only have to watch Dominic Cummings talking about how he won in 2016. Did he base his campaign on the concerns Brexiter MPs had about loss of sovereignty? Of course not, because no one understood the EU. He instead talked about taking back control in order to capitalise on the backlash from the financial crisis and austerity. He countered the economic fears of leaving with stories of Turkey\u2019s imminent membership. He talked about \u00a3350m so everyone would talk about how much the EU cost rather than its benefits. Just as people were sold snake oil in 2016, the Brexiters and their press are selling no deal (a \u201cclean break\u201d) in a similar way now. The number of people who will be better off in any way as a result of a no-deal Brexit can be counted in thousands, not millions. If Johnson wins the next election, it will be these thousands who will benefit while the rest of the country suffers. \u2022 Simon Wren-Lewis is emeritus professor of economics and fellow of Merton College, Oxford.

      "bodyText": "Politicians on both sides of the Atlantic have pledged to crack down on fossil fuel companies in light of the Guardian\u2019s investigation revealing that the world\u2019s leading fossil fuel giants are linked to more than a third of carbon emissions in the modern era. Bernie Sanders, leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and the UK Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said they would take measures to rein in big oil corporations to protect the public and prevent the worst impacts of climate breakdown. Sanders said the fossil fuel industry knew \u201cclimate change was real\u201d but instead of acting it had \u201cput stooges on TV and lied over and over to the American people about the facts\u201d. He added: \u201cWhat do you do with the executives who destroyed the planet to fill their own pockets? When I\u2019m president, you better believe we\u2019re going to bring criminal charges against them.\u201d Corbyn, who on Wednesday visited a new windfarm to highlight Labour\u2019s plans to transform the economy away from fossil fuels, said: \u201cBillions of people are suffering the worst effects of climate change because of a few companies which are profiting from selling fossil fuels.\u201d And he underlined the party\u2019s determination to take on the companies \u2013 and their financial backers \u2013 who are driving the climate crisis. \u201cLabour will delist companies that fail to meet environmental criteria from the [London Stock Exchange], and reform the finance sector to make it part of the solution to climate change instead of lending to companies that are part of the problem.\u201d The Green party in the UK praised the Guardian\u2019s \u201cincredibly important journalistic work\u201d and said: \u201cIt\u2019s time for governments and businesses to divest from these corporations. We must stop funding climate chaos.\u201d Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP for Brighton Pavilion, also welcomed the Guardian\u2019s investigation. The Conservative government in the UK did not respond to request for comment. Environmental campaign groups and lawyers also called for action after the polluters investigation. Charlie Kronick, a senior climate campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cAs our planet has been speeding towards climate catastrophe it\u2019s been big oil with their foot on the pedal. Oil companies have known for decades the harm they are doing. \u201cYet the oil industry has not only ploughed on as usual but has actively sought to undermine the very changes we need to secure a sustainable world, while continuing to spend billions looking for oil and gas we cannot afford to burn. As we seek to build that sustainable world there are only two real options for these companies: switch to 100% renewables or shut up shop.\u201d Thousands of people have taken to the streets of London this week as part of the Extinction Rebellion\u2019s civil disobedience to demand urgent political action on the ecological emergency. On Thursday, as activists occupied London City airport in the capital, the group said the actions of the fossil fuel industry, revealed by the Guardian\u2019s investigation, underlined the need for them to be on the streets. Peter Barnett, a lawyer at ClientEarth, an international NGO that seeks to protect the environment through legal action, said: \u201cCarbon majors are facing an ever-growing number of lawsuits seeking to hold them accountable for the climate crisis.

New data, from world-renowned researchers, details how a cohort of state-owned and multinational firms are driving the climate emergency that threatens the future of humanity, and are continuing to expand their operations despite being aware of the industry\u2019s devastating impact on the planet.",

The academy has since made changes that it says will improve transparency, including allowing members to voluntarily resign, which they could not previously do. It has also pledged to review its lifetime membership policy and appointed five members to its selection committee from outside the body. Seven new members have been appointed and a respected literature professor, Mats Malm, took over as permanent secretary in June after the resignation of his predecessor, Sara Danius. The Nobel Foundation, which funds the literary world\u2019s most prestigious prize, said the academy still needed to do more. \u201cI think they can \u2013 and to some extent they have already begun doing so \u2013 act more openly than they have done in the past and I think that would be a good thing,\u201d said Lars Heikensten, the executive director of the Nobel Foundation, who in May gave the academy the green light to crown a laureate in 2019. \u201cOur reputation is everything,\u201d Heikensten said. \u201cObviously it is important to avoid this kind of situation we have been in and of course it cannot be repeated.\u201d A Swedish literary critic, Madeleine Levy, told Agence-France Presse: \u201cThe Nobel prize is for many now associated with #MeToo \u2026 and a dysfunctional organisation.\u201d It seems almost certain that at least one of the laureates will be a woman. The Polish writers Olga Tokarczuk and Hanna Krall, South Korea\u2019s Han Kang, Joyce Carol Oates of the US and the Russian novelist Lyudmila Ulitskaya have all been mentioned as contenders. Only 14 of the 114 laureates since 1901 have been women. Another male writer thought to be in with a chance is the Romanian novelist Mircea C\u0103rt\u0103rescu. Previous winners of the prize include Bob Dylan (2016), Alice Munro (2013), Orhan Pamuk (2006), Toni Morrison (2003) and Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez (1982). One academy member, Anders Olsson, said the committee had looked for a more diverse shortlist this year and tried to move away from a \u201cmale-oriented\u201d and \u201cEurocentric perspective of literature\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Two British Isis members accused of involvement in the beheading of western hostages held in north east Syria have been taken into US custody as a Turkish offensive on the Kurdish region begins. Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, were members of a British group of Isis militants known as \u201cthe Beatles\u201d and are understood to be amongst a number of fighters in the process of being transferred to the Americans. US officials briefed media on the custody operation overnight, with the action first reported by the Washington Post. Prisoners previously held by the Syrian Kurds were first expected to be taken to neighbouring Iraq. Donald Trump said: \u201cWe have taken a certain number of Isis fighters that are particularly bad, and we\u2019ve wanted to make sure that nothing happened with them with respect to getting out.\u201d The US president subsequently tweeted: \u201cIn case the Kurds or Turkey lose control, the United States has already taken the 2 ISIS militants tied to beheadings in Syria, known as the Beetles, out of that country and into a secure location controlled by the U.S. They are the worst of the worst!\u201d Trump said he had spoken to Boris Johnson on the subject of Isis prisoners, but did not say whether he was referring to Kotey and Elsheikh. It is not clear how many prisoners are involved in the transfer. The duo were part of a group of four who are accused of being involved in the apparently filmed beheadings of British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning and American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. Group leader Mohammed Emwazi was killed in a US drone strike in 2015, while another Aine Davis was caught in Turkey and jailed for seven and half years in 2017, for being member of a terror organisation. Estimates vary about the number of foreign Isis fighters held by the Kurdish military, the Syrian Democratic Forces, the SDF, but their numbers are at least 1,000 and potentially double that. There are also an estimated 10,000 or so Isis fighters in detention from Syria and Iraq. The number of Britons held in Isis jails is estimated by security source to be around 30, and the UK has largely pursued a policy of ignoring them, arguing that they travelled to Syria at their own risk, a country where there has been no consular support since the start of the civil war in 2011. One of those held is Jack Letts, who was raised in Oxfordshire and fled to join Isis before he was picked up in 2017. His British citizenship was stripped by the UK government over the summer, leaving him with his Canadian nationality inherited from his father. His situation is unclear. There had been repeated warnings that the Turkish invasion meant that the Isis fighters could end up being released by one of the parties to the looming conflict, but Trump\u2019s words suggest that the US intended to mitigate some of that risk. British officials said they could not confirm what was happening, although there indications that the UK had been briefed in advance on the plans. A UK Home Office spokesperson said on Thursday: \u201cIt would be inappropriate to comment whilst legal proceedings are ongoing.\u201d Earlier this month, a cross-party group of MPs and peers who visited the region last month warned that Trump\u2019s green light to a Turkish invasion \u201crisks global security\u201d because it could allow Isis members to escape and regroup. The two British Isis fighters had been at the centre of a legal battle in London, led by Elsheikh\u2019s mother who went to the Supreme Court in London to stop his extradition to the US, and to prevent the British government sharing evidence with the US, if the death penalty is not ruled out. Judgment in that case is awaited. Meanwhile, women and children in the largest Islamic State detention centre in Kurdish-controlled Syria are expecting to be freed in the wake of a Turkish assault on the area, according to people inside the camp. Al-Hawl, home to about 60,000 women and children with links to Isis and 10,000 displaced civilians, has been tense since Donald Trump announced US troops would leave the area at the weekend, paving the way for the Turkish attack on Wednesday. Radicalised women, including some who have been accused of killing other prisoners they say are not adhering to Isis\u2019s strict ideology, believe Isis sleeper cells in the area will attack the Kurdish guards and free those inside in the next two days, a woman who has been held alongside them said via WhatsApp message. \u201cThey know the Turkish campaign has begun,\u201d the woman said. \u201cAfter living in this horrible place for months they are ready to take this opportunity to break out.\u201d About 90,000 men, women and children from Isis\u2019 former \u201ccaliphate\u201d are currently in the custody of the US-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).

A teacher on a career break, Luke has returned from Dublin to his ancestral home in Waterford, overlooking a bend in the Sullane. The family were not quite \u201ccastle Catholics\u201d, but the O\u2019Briens nonetheless had money and status, and he is the last of the line. A Joyce obsessive whose plans for a book have come to nothing, Luke is so immersed in <em>Ulysses</em> that he thinks in its language and rhythms, and sees parallels with Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus and Joyce himself in the most minor occurrences of everyday life. He is also a metaphysician, compulsive connection-maker and \u2013 perhaps \u2013 bipolar: \u201cA touch, maybe. Occasional highs, definite lows. Restlessness. Some hubris \u2026 Certainly nothing that warrants intervention.\u201d</p> <p>Luke is becalmed. Like the book on Joyce, his plans to renovate Ardboe have barely got off the ground and his four-year career break has slowly stilled to almost nothing: \u201cSome days, sitting in the same position, he thinks he has been there for a few minutes when, in fact, hours have passed and suddenly it is noon or afternoon or four o\u2019clock and the day outside has entirely changed.\u201d He does very little except visit his elderly aunt Ellen, who lives nearby; her sister, his aunt Josie \u2013 \u201cslow, they\u2019d call her now\u201d \u2013 died not long ago, and Luke still mourns her. His attachment to and identification with women is even more striking than Bloom\u2019s: \u201cAlone, he contemplated the feminine in himself and, stirred by desire at the thought of being part woman, he massaged his nipples, ran a finger along his scrotal scar, the vestigial seam of a foetal vagina \u2026 he suspected that, at certain times of the month, he still possessed traces of a rudimentary menstrual cycle that, prone to the pull of celestial bodies, affected his entire organism.\u201d</p> <p>Luke is like the river itself, which is tidal in its more distant reaches, but on O\u2019Brien land slows at the sharp bend called The Inch so that its movement is all but imperceptible. \u201cBefore it was named, before this place was touched by humans, the river captured the drainage system of another lower, lesser river and met a strange new tide coming up from the sea \u2026 usurping the route and riverbed.\u201d</p> <p>Into this stagnant but luminously described world steps Ruth, a divorced woman who grew up just three miles away; the connection between them is instant, and Costello quickly and deftly conjures the wild excitement of falling in love. Ruth\u2019s arrival is the book\u2019s inciting incident, but the eponymous \u201criver capture\u201d occurs a little later for Luke, and in an entirely unexpected way. It breaks the book as dramatically as though the spine has been cracked at the halfway point, and in a nod to the \u201cIthaca\u201d chapter in <em>Ulysses</em> the narration becomes a series of questions asked (and answered) by Luke of himself. It\u2019s an effective way to render shock and the strange detachment from reality that it can bring, and rings entirely true; however, Costello persists with this question-and-answer formula for nearly the entire second half of the book, and once Luke\u2019s initial distress has passed it loses its effectiveness, becoming lumpen instead of dazed and holding back the natural development of the story.</p> <p>To take on the ne plus ultra of literary modernism and bend it to one\u2019s own ends is an audacious act of literary ventriloquism and one that Costello pulls off astonishingly successfully. She renders Luke as a convincing blend of Leopold Bloom and a modern-day man with his own particularities. Likewise, the relationship between Luke and the tidal river, and the patterning that underlies the novel\u2019s structure, are accomplished and satisfying; but having divided the book so strictly into two, the incoming tide that powered the first half becomes rather obstructed, and is at risk of petering out.

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s nothing wrong with a game making you work hard before it yields rewards, but Ghost Recon Breakpoint takes that principle so far that, in its early stages at least, playing it is a chore. The latest iteration of Ubisoft\u2019s future-soldier open-world shooter has plenty of good points, but those are marred by basic elements that so broken that the game feels like a backward step from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/13/tom-clancy-ghost-recon-wildlands-review-ubisoft-open-world-game\">Ghost Recon: Wildlands</a> (2017).</p> <p>Two factors create the worst possible first impression: a glacially slow start to the main story and a refusal to highlight the importance of the key in-game weapons and gear systems, which have been more or less cribbed from Destiny 2. Once you learn to ignore the gun stats and instead merely upgrade and equip the ones that have a higher gear level, you might start enjoying Breakpoint. Until then, its early missions seem impossible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ff825a4aff813f592bb541819b8edc57d334b67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ff825a4aff813f592bb541819b8edc57d334b67/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Impossible \u2026 Ghost Recon Breakpoint.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Impossible \u2026 Ghost Recon Breakpoint.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ubisoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ghost Recon Breakpoint\u2019s storyline eventually perks up, though, and the way in which it cleverly splits is pleasingly nonlinear. You play Nomad, a Ghost from the US military helicoptered in, with a squad of colleagues, to an archipelago called Auroa, owned by tech entrepreneur Jace Skell. A US cargo ship anchored off the island has been bombed, so the Ghosts are tasked with finding out what happened. Nomad discovers that Auroa is in the grip of a dictatorship enacted by a private military company called Sentinel.</p> <p>Hooking up with a bunch of ex-Skell employees and indigenous Auroans, Nomad sets about disrupting Sentinel\u2019s drone defence systems sufficiently to get a boat off the archipelago and return with a military force. Studded with flashbacks and double-dealing, the story unfolds like a well-executed spec-ops mission.</p> <p>But basic aspects of the game obstruct whatever fun there is to be had. Chief among those is the cover system, a vital element of any third-person shooter. (Breakpoint only drops into first-person view when you aim.) It automatically tries to snap you to any cover in the vicinity but is hopelessly erratic, often giving enemies the chance to spot you and raise the alarm.</p> <p>Plus, whenever you die, Breakpoint respawns you in seemingly random positions, so often you must hike for miles before having a chance to resume what you had been attempting to do. And while the giant map\u2019s terrain is impressive, Nomad\u2019s traversal of it is farcically clunky; at the bottom of every cliff you encounter, for instance, you may wish the game included a grappling hook.</p> <p>The feeling that you must overcome the game\u2019s basic mechanics to complete missions is a shame, because Breakpoint isn\u2019t all bad. There is a handy network of bivouacs around the map to fast-travel to and in which Nomad can apply temporary buffs, craft, change class and, crucially, spawn a helicopter.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxPLG0FUo-E\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SxPLG0FUo-E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There is also a massive amount to do, with a welter of side quests, and the story missions are pleasantly varied and often require tactical about-turns. Ghost Recon\u2019s gadgets are present and correct, including its signature drone for marking enemies, although the ability to auto-eliminate up to three marked enemies has been devolved to specialist sync-shot drones. As ever in a Ghost Recon game, you can drop into or out of co-operative play; if you assemble up to four squad-mates, you\u2019ll find it easier and much more enjoyable.</p> <p>Breakpoint\u2019s Ghost War online mode is also not bad. It pitches two teams of four Ghosts against each other, with clever equipment balancing and several nods to battle royale gameplay. It does get repetitive after a while, but Ubisoft has big post-launch expansion plans.</p> <p>Which is to presume that anyone feels inclined to carry on playing it for a prolonged period. Die-hard Ghost Recon fans will quickly work out how to overcome its more egregious aspects, but Breakpoint\u2019s glaring flaws render play strangely joyless \u2013 in marked contrast to the exuberant mayhem of recent releases such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/sep/20/borderlands-3-review-welcome-addition-to-much-loved-looter-shooter-franchise\">Borderlands 3</a>. With its vast array of gear to collect, use for a bit, then dismantle, plus its gargantuan game world, Ubisoft may have been aiming to set Breakpoint up to be played for years after launch. Instead, it seems as if it has opted for quantity over quality.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s nothing wrong with a game making you work hard before it yields rewards, but Ghost Recon Breakpoint takes that principle so far that, in its early stages at least, playing it is a chore. The latest iteration of Ubisoft\u2019s future-soldier open-world shooter has plenty of good points, but those are marred by basic elements that so broken that the game feels like a backward step from Ghost Recon: Wildlands (2017). Two factors create the worst possible first impression: a glacially slow start to the main story and a refusal to highlight the importance of the key in-game weapons and gear systems, which have been more or less cribbed from Destiny 2. Once you learn to ignore the gun stats and instead merely upgrade and equip the ones that have a higher gear level, you might start enjoying Breakpoint. Until then, its early missions seem impossible. Ghost Recon Breakpoint\u2019s storyline eventually perks up, though, and the way in which it cleverly splits is pleasingly nonlinear. You play Nomad, a Ghost from the US military helicoptered in, with a squad of colleagues, to an archipelago called Auroa, owned by tech entrepreneur Jace Skell. A US cargo ship anchored off the island has been bombed, so the Ghosts are tasked with finding out what happened. Nomad discovers that Auroa is in the grip of a dictatorship enacted by a private military company called Sentinel. Hooking up with a bunch of ex-Skell employees and indigenous Auroans, Nomad sets about disrupting Sentinel\u2019s drone defence systems sufficiently to get a boat off the archipelago and return with a military force. Studded with flashbacks and double-dealing, the story unfolds like a well-executed spec-ops mission. But basic aspects of the game obstruct whatever fun there is to be had. Chief among those is the cover system, a vital element of any third-person shooter. (Breakpoint only drops into first-person view when you aim.) It automatically tries to snap you to any cover in the vicinity but is hopelessly erratic, often giving enemies the chance to spot you and raise the alarm. Plus, whenever you die, Breakpoint respawns you in seemingly random positions, so often you must hike for miles before having a chance to resume what you had been attempting to do. And while the giant map\u2019s terrain is impressive, Nomad\u2019s traversal of it is farcically clunky; at the bottom of every cliff you encounter, for instance, you may wish the game included a grappling hook. The feeling that you must overcome the game\u2019s basic mechanics to complete missions is a shame, because Breakpoint isn\u2019t all bad. There is a handy network of bivouacs around the map to fast-travel to and in which Nomad can apply temporary buffs, craft, change class and, crucially, spawn a helicopter. There is also a massive amount to do, with a welter of side quests, and the story missions are pleasantly varied and often require tactical about-turns. Ghost Recon\u2019s gadgets are present and correct, including its signature drone for marking enemies, although the ability to auto-eliminate up to three marked enemies has been devolved to specialist sync-shot drones. As ever in a Ghost Recon game, you can drop into or out of co-operative play; if you assemble up to four squad-mates, you\u2019ll find it easier and much more enjoyable. Breakpoint\u2019s Ghost War online mode is also not bad. It pitches two teams of four Ghosts against each other, with clever equipment balancing and several nods to battle royale gameplay. It does get repetitive after a while, but Ubisoft has big post-launch expansion plans. Which is to presume that anyone feels inclined to carry on playing it for a prolonged period. Die-hard Ghost Recon fans will quickly work out how to overcome its more egregious aspects, but Breakpoint\u2019s glaring flaws render play strangely joyless \u2013 in marked contrast to the exuberant mayhem of recent releases such as Borderlands 3. With its vast array of gear to collect, use for a bit, then dismantle, plus its gargantuan game world, Ubisoft may have been aiming to set Breakpoint up to be played for years after launch. Instead, it seems as if it has opted for quantity over quality.",

If I buy a Windows 10 machine, could I or should I continue to run Windows 7 on it?<em> </em><strong>Pablo</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>There is no universal answer to your first question. The time to sell, repurpose or recycle an old PC depends on a large number of factors. Some are technical, such as the specification, the build quality, and whether it will actually run Windows 10. Some are personal, such as what you use it for, how much money you can spare, and whether your time has any value.</p> <p>Circumstances alter cases. It might not be worth replacing a very old PC that\u2019s only used for personal emails, especially if the user is short of cash. On the other hand, it could make sense for a company to replace a high-spec machine that is only a few months old if time is extremely valuable, as it can be in financial organisations.</p> <p>However, your second question is easy. Windows 7 was launched in 2009, and reaches the end of its supported life in January 2020. After that, there will be no more security patches except for the companies able and willing to pay. I understand that Windows 7 Extended Security Updates for Windows Enterprise Edition will cost $25 per device for the first year, $50 for the second year and $100 for the third year.

Manufacturers don\u2019t test their machines with obsolete operating systems.

Old machines may still work, but usually they will have been left behind by technological advances. In your case, the T510 is missing the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface\">UEFI</a> system that provides fast start-up, M.2 slots for faster SSD modules, USB-C or Thunderbolt for faster connections, better on-chip graphics with video support, a camera for Windows Hello face-recognition log-on, and so on. You\u2019re also missing out on a touch screen with tablet and pen capabilities.</p> <p>Of course, you can improve the performance of your Lenovo ThinkPad T510 by adding more memory and swapping the original hard drive for a fast SSD. Not everybody can. We\u2019ve all seen the trend towards sealed cases, soldered-in memory and storage chips, glued-in batteries and so on. These make laptops more expensive to repair or upgrade, and therefore more disposable.</p> <p>Old PCs also consume more power, which makes them more expensive to run. Mid-range processors have not become dramatically faster, though having (usually) more cores does mean they work more smoothly.

A typical laptop processor now runs at a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_design_power\">TDP</a> of about 15W, going down to 6W, instead of 35W or 45W.

It appeared around the end of 2010, so the design is nine years old. Its premium features included a Firewire 400 port, which you probably don\u2019t use. The main problem is that <a href=\"https://support.lenovo.com/gb/en/solutions/ht508488\">it\u2019s not on Lenovo\u2019s Windows 10-compatible list</a>. However, <a href=\"https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-T400-T500-and-newer-T/T510-and-Windows-10-compatibility/td-p/4461531\">some people have managed to install the 1903 version</a>, so you could download it and have a go. If it installs, your Windows 7 product code should authenticate it, so you won\u2019t have to pay for it. And if all else fails, you could install Linux.</p> <p>Sadly, even if your ThinkPad T510 runs Windows 10, it has a lot of limitations. These include the screen resolution (1366 x 768 pixels), slow USB 2 ports, the fairly slow drive speed (SATA 2 is 3Gbps not 6Gbps; no M.2 slot), the lack of memory (8GB is the max), and the slow CPU.</p> <p>The T510 is, as mentioned, upgradeable. You have 6GB of memory so it\u2019s probably not worth replacing a 2GB <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMM\">simm</a> with a 4GB module to raise that to 8GB. However, it would be worth swapping the hard drive for a 250GB or 500GB SSD, costing $49.99 or $66.99 at <a href=\"https://www.crucial.com/usa/en/compatible-upgrade-for/Lenovo/thinkpad-t510-series\">Crucial\u2019s US site</a>. You may be able to find cheaper alternatives where you live in Mexico. An SSD would make a significant difference to your laptop\u2019s responsiveness.</p> <p>Unfortunately, you cannot do anything about the first generation <a href=\"https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/43544/intel-core-i5-540m-processor-3m-cache-2-53-ghz.html\">Core i5-540M</a>, though it has held up pretty well. The i5-540M has a <a href=\"https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Core+i5-540M+%40+2.53GHz&amp;id=779\">Passmark score of 2,452</a>, which is the bare minimum for running Windows 10 at a usable speed. Basically, it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/Intel-Core-i5-540M-vs-Intel-Pentium-Silver-N5000/779vs3204\">as fast as today\u2019s Intel Pentium Silver N5000</a>, which is a cheap, battery-efficient 6W chip. The Core i5-540M has a TDP of 35W.</p> <p>If you were to buy something like the T510 today, you\u2019d probably get a 15W Core i5-8265U or better. I regard the i5-8265U as the starting point for serious laptops, and it has a Passmark score of <a href=\"https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Core+i5-8265U+%40+1.60GHz&amp;id=3323\">8,000</a>. It has four cores and eight threads, where your i5-540M has two cores and four threads. According to the <a href=\"https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i5-8265U-vs-Intel-Core-i5-M-540/m566107vsm882\">UserBenchmark</a> website, the i5-8265U is 141% faster, and if you\u2019re using all the threads, it\u2019s three times as fast.

An SSD would make a significant difference to your laptop\u2019s responsiveness. Unfortunately, you cannot do anything about the first generation Core i5-540M, though it has held up pretty well. The i5-540M has a Passmark score of 2,452, which is the bare minimum for running Windows 10 at a usable speed. Basically, it\u2019s as fast as today\u2019s Intel Pentium Silver N5000, which is a cheap, battery-efficient 6W chip. The Core i5-540M has a TDP of 35W. If you were to buy something like the T510 today, you\u2019d probably get a 15W Core i5-8265U or better. I regard the i5-8265U as the starting point for serious laptops, and it has a Passmark score of 8,000. It has four cores and eight threads, where your i5-540M has two cores and four threads. According to the UserBenchmark website, the i5-8265U is 141% faster, and if you\u2019re using all the threads, it\u2019s three times as fast. You would notice the difference. Options? If you don\u2019t want to spend a lot of money, put what you would have spent on your T510 towards a refurbished ThinkPad with a much more recent processor, such as the T440 or the X250. If you want to replace your T510 with today\u2019s equivalent, I\u2019d go for the 14in T490s rather than the 15.6in T590. That would get you a Core i5 or i7 processor, 8GB or 16GB of memory, a choice of SSDs from 128GB to 1TB, a good Full HD (1920 x 1080-pixel) screen and a great selection of ports including USB-C/Thunderbolt 3. It\u2019s 16.7mm thin and weighs 1.35kg, where your T510 is more than twice as thick (35.8mm) and more than twice as heavy (2.8kg). There are, obviously, much sexier options, such as the ThinkPad X1 Carbon, and the Yoga C940 with its 10th-generation Core processor. But anyone spending that sort of money could put off purchasing a new laptop for about a year or so, because dual-screen machines look like the coming thing. The Asus ZenBook Pro Duo UX581 is a stunning piece of work, while the 14in ZenBook Duo UX481 is a more portable, and more affordable, alternative. Last week, Microsoft previewed its own dual screen machines, the Surface Neo Windows laptop and the Surface Duo Android phone, due about a year from now. Microsoft and Asus have been messing around with \u201cauxiliary displays\u201d since at least 2005. Asus showed a prototype hinged, dual-screen ebook reader in 2009, and the Microsoft Courier attracted some attention before it was cancelled in 2010. More recently, Lenovo had a go with the Lenovo Book, which transitioned from Windows to Android. I\u2019ve seen a lot of terrible machines, but the Surface Duo looks like the real deal. I expect all the leading manufacturers to launch their own versions, which will establish it as a new form factor, as happened with the Surface Pro. I wouldn\u2019t be shocked to see a dual-screen iPad\u2026 Have you got a question? Email it to Ask.Jack@theguardian.com This article was amended on 10 October to correct the description of the Surface Neo and Surface Duo",

Later he became a BBC foreign correspondent, reporting on the 1971 war in Pakistan, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/07/chile-coup-pinochet-allende\" title=\"\">military coup</a> in Chile in 1973, and the Rhodesian bush war, which culminated in the election of Robert Mugabe in 1980 and where, for his own safety, Humphrys was encouraged to buy a submachine gun and put it on expenses.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Rhodesia, for his own safety, Humphrys was encouraged to buy a submachine gun and put it on expenses</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After a stint back home as a newsreader, he took a job on Radio 4\u2019s flagship news programme, <em>Today</em>, and stayed for 32 years (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2019/sep/19/john-humphrys-signs-off-today-programme-32-years-video\" title=\"\">he retired last month</a>). Humphrys quickly became the b\u00eate noire of senior politicians and anyone else who found themselves at the sharp end of his combative interviewing style. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/emin\" title=\"\">Tracey Emin</a> called him \u201cthe rudest man in Britain\u201d, while Jonathan Aitken accused him of \u201cpoisoning the well of democratic debate\u201d. Following a ferocious grilling of the social security secretary Harriet Harman over cuts to single parent benefits in 1997, the Labour communications director David Hill threatened to boycott the programme over \u201cthe John Humphrys problem\u201d. He riled listeners, too, as evidenced by a letter from a man who longed for the day \u201cwhen Mother Nature finally takes the old codger out\u201d.</p> <p>Humphrys takes such missives with good humour, though nonetheless offers a robust defence of his methods. \u201cI cannot deny that I enjoy arguing,\u201d he writes. \u201cNor would I deny that I approach people in power \u2013 all of them \u2013 with a pretty strong dose of scepticism.\u201d There are moments, too, where he admits to making errors. He was, he says, unnecessarily rude to John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party in Northern Ireland, in the late 1980s, and misjudged Thatcher, whom he tried and failed to rattle in his first interview with her, asking a question about her faith. But on others he stubbornly doubles down.</p> <p>By far the most unedifying moment in <em>A Day Like Today</em> is his recollection of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/26/equal-story-women-men-and-money-carrie-gracie-review\" title=\"\">Carrie Gracie</a> row regarding equal pay at the BBC, and the leaked conversation between Humphrys and the corporation\u2019s North America editor Jon Sopel in which the pair joked about taking a pay cut. Humphrys dismisses it as \u201ca bit of banter\u201d and puts the boot into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/eddie-mair\" title=\"\">Eddie Mair</a>, who he believes stitched him up with his coverage of the story on the Radio 4 show <em>PM</em>. Noting furiously that \u201cI had apparently joined the ranks of the world\u2019s great misogynists\u201d, Humphrys goes on to list the supposedly good deeds he has done for women. They include pronouncing publicly that the next director general of the BBC should be female and, ludicrously, the time when he was photographed with a group of <em>Today</em> women to mark the programme\u2019s 60th birthday. He calls these \u201cinconvenient truths to my accusers\u201d. There are, though, inconvenient truths regarding his on-air pronouncements that he himself overlooks, such as his lament, following allegations of sexual impropriety and abuse in Westminster, that MPs might no longer be able to date their assistants, and his recent suggestion that women are better at taking care of children than men.</p> <p>Elsewhere, along with expressing irritation at media studies degrees, social media, vox pops and political branding, Humphrys is damning about BBC management and exasperated by what he views as the corporation\u2019s \u201cinstitutional liberal bias\u201d and \u201cgroupthink mentality\u201d. While he makes apt points about the role of the BBC in public life, his old-man-yells-at-cloud shtick gets wearying. Tetchiness and irascibility are all part of the Humphrys package, of course, and taking the powerful to task, whether prime ministers or his former employers, is in his blood. Still, one is left with a sense of the author having not so much set the record straight as confirmed the suspicion that he is increasingly out of touch.</p> <p><em> \u2022 A Day Like Today is published by William Collins (\u00a320).

Tracey Emin called him \u201cthe rudest man in Britain\u201d, while Jonathan Aitken accused him of \u201cpoisoning the well of democratic debate\u201d. Following a ferocious grilling of the social security secretary Harriet Harman over cuts to single parent benefits in 1997, the Labour communications director David Hill threatened to boycott the programme over \u201cthe John Humphrys problem\u201d. He riled listeners, too, as evidenced by a letter from a man who longed for the day \u201cwhen Mother Nature finally takes the old codger out\u201d. Humphrys takes such missives with good humour, though nonetheless offers a robust defence of his methods. \u201cI cannot deny that I enjoy arguing,\u201d he writes. \u201cNor would I deny that I approach people in power \u2013 all of them \u2013 with a pretty strong dose of scepticism.\u201d There are moments, too, where he admits to making errors. He was, he says, unnecessarily rude to John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party in Northern Ireland, in the late 1980s, and misjudged Thatcher, whom he tried and failed to rattle in his first interview with her, asking a question about her faith. But on others he stubbornly doubles down. By far the most unedifying moment in A Day Like Today is his recollection of the Carrie Gracie row regarding equal pay at the BBC, and the leaked conversation between Humphrys and the corporation\u2019s North America editor Jon Sopel in which the pair joked about taking a pay cut. Humphrys dismisses it as \u201ca bit of banter\u201d and puts the boot into Eddie Mair, who he believes stitched him up with his coverage of the story on the Radio 4 show PM. Noting furiously that \u201cI had apparently joined the ranks of the world\u2019s great misogynists\u201d, Humphrys goes on to list the supposedly good deeds he has done for women. They include pronouncing publicly that the next director general of the BBC should be female and, ludicrously, the time when he was photographed with a group of Today women to mark the programme\u2019s 60th birthday. He calls these \u201cinconvenient truths to my accusers\u201d. There are, though, inconvenient truths regarding his on-air pronouncements that he himself overlooks, such as his lament, following allegations of sexual impropriety and abuse in Westminster, that MPs might no longer be able to date their assistants, and his recent suggestion that women are better at taking care of children than men. Elsewhere, along with expressing irritation at media studies degrees, social media, vox pops and political branding, Humphrys is damning about BBC management and exasperated by what he views as the corporation\u2019s \u201cinstitutional liberal bias\u201d and \u201cgroupthink mentality\u201d. While he makes apt points about the role of the BBC in public life, his old-man-yells-at-cloud shtick gets wearying. Tetchiness and irascibility are all part of the Humphrys package, of course, and taking the powerful to task, whether prime ministers or his former employers, is in his blood. Still, one is left with a sense of the author having not so much set the record straight as confirmed the suspicion that he is increasingly out of touch. \u2022 A Day Like Today is published by William Collins (\u00a320).

But Torn Apart focuses on the mass separation of more than 2,000 children from their parents in the summer of 2018, which prompted outrage and a federal order to reunite the families that has<a href=\"https://time.com/5678313/trump-administration-family-separation-lawsuits/\"> still not been fulfilled</a>.

The furore over family separation that summer \u201cfelt, to me, like gun violence, in that it was a defining story of our time\u201d, Torn Apart\u2019s director, Ellen Goosenberg Kent, told the Guardian. \u201cAnd it also felt to me that it was going to turn out to be one of the darkest chapters in this country\u2019s immigration history, and that it had to be told.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0bqmNy8nOo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P0bqmNy8nOo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Kent, in partnership with HBO, first traveled to El Paso, Texas, to meet with families in the midst of separation limbo. \u201cIt was important to me that I connect not only with parents but with kids capable of talking about what this experience was like for them,\u201d she said. She connected with several social services organizations working to reunite families \u2013 a difficult process given Ice\u2019s haphazard record-keeping. The government separated families with \u201creally no plan for how to reunite them ever again\u201d, said <a href=\"https://www.tahirih.org/people/shana-tabak/\">Shana Tabak</a>, executive director of the <a href=\"https://www.tahirih.org/\">Tahirih Justice Center</a> in Atlanta, Georgia. \u201cAnd so it was really left up to legal services, non-profits, and social service agencies to put the pieces back together of these families that the government had broken up.\u201d</p> <p>In El Paso, Kent met Mar\u00eda, who fled Honduras with her 10-year-old son, Alex, after the country\u2019s endemic violence claimed several family members and Alex\u2019s father. When they arrived at the US border, Mar\u00eda tearfully recalled, Alex was taken from her to a migrant facility in New York City; it had been 70 days since they last saw each other. Kent follows Mar\u00eda as she attempts to navigate a stubbornly unclear reunification process \u2013 delays, phone calls with lawyers, early mornings wired with the hope of seeing her son again. The two are finally reunited, but Alex is pensive, worried. Mar\u00eda\u2019s asylum case is still pending.</p> <p>Also still pending is Vilma\u2019s case, highlighting an even more Kafkaesque trip through immigration under the Trump administration. Vilma fled life-threatening domestic abuse in Guatemala with her 11-year-old daughter, Yeisvi, a US citizen (she was born when her parents were temporary farm workers in Georgia). But Ice, legally unable to detain a US citizen, sent Yeisvi into foster care in Arizona, while denying Vilma\u2019s asylum claim and detaining her in rural Ocilla, Georgia. The film meets Vilma in limbo, granted a new asylum hearing thanks to the work of Tabak and the Tahirih Justice Center, but still miles away from her daughter. Kent films Yeisvi, soft-voiced and timid, drawing crayon pictures for her mother while in foster care. She recalls a memory from Guatemala \u2013 her dad locking her out of the room, away from her mother \u2013 then starts to cry, unable to finish the story.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e5287caf74d3e3c0b2e5f8571d59f3c32a973695\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5287caf74d3e3c0b2e5f8571d59f3c32a973695/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vilma and her daughter Yeisvi reunited and cuddling in their bed in Torn Apart\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vilma and her daughter, Yeisvi, reunited and cuddling in their bed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At one point, the state of Arizona sued to take permanent custody of Yeisvi since Vilma, detained indefinitely by Ice, could not support her.

The Democrat congresswoman was the subject of an exclusive news story from the Washington Times on Wednesday, in which the newspaper reported she had spent nearly $300 on having her hair cut and coloured. \u201cThe self-declared socialist, who regularly rails against the rich and complains about the cost of living inside the Beltway, spent nearly $300 on her hairdo at a pricey salon she frequents in downtown Washington, The Washington Times has learned,\u201d the article began. The newspaper said that Last Tangle Salon charges $80 for a haircut and $180 for lowlights \u201caccording to sources familiar with the salon\u201d. The paper also factored in a 20% tip of $52, bringing the total of the entire hair maintenance experience to $312.

      "body": "<p>Karina Gross Polanco is still haunted by the moment she arrived on the scene after her brother, Anewki, had been shot dead by a member of the Puerto Rico police department.</p> <p>\u201cIt was full of cops and closed off with yellow tape,\u201d said Gross Polanco. \u201cWhen I saw him bleeding out on the floor and I asked what had happened and that we needed to call an ambulance, but they said it was an instant death by gunshot, there was no point.\u201d</p> <p>While standing at a food truck waiting for his order in July 2017, Gross Polanco, a Dominican immigrant, got into a drunken argument with Nieves P\u00e9rez Ortiz, an off-duty police officer. The officer shot Gross Polanco, who was unarmed, in his head.</p> <p>\u201cI ask myself how is it possible that a cop with so many other ways of solving the situation just shoots my brother in the face?\u201d Gross Polanco said. \u201cHe could have saved my brother\u2019s life with just one call. He left kids without their father and a family destroyed.\u201d</p> <p>The murder highlights civil rights activists\u2019 concerns that Dominican immigrants are subject to police profiling and brutality in Puerto Rico and, in an age of increased scrutiny by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), are also being targeted for deportation on the island. It is a heavy burden for an already vulnerable community in Puerto Rico, often afraid to speak out about abuse or discrimination, or being singled out for violence.</p> <p>\u201cMany Dominicans have been murdered here in Puerto Rico,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez, a Dominican community leader who has lived in Puerto Rico for more than three decades.</p> <p>Anewki Gross Polanco, 25, had come to Puerto Rico in a <em>yola</em> (a small wooden boat) with his sister years before. It was a treacherous and sometimes deadly <a href=\"https://www.latinousa.org/2015/01/02/border-unauthorized-immigration-puerto-rico/\">trek by water</a> across the Mona Passage that <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/article225544120.html\">many Dominican immigrants take each year</a> to reach the island, hoping for a better life.</p> <p>His sister says Gross Polanco had an appointment at the immigration office scheduled that week but he would never make it.</p> <p>Of the estimated 200,000 to 300,000 Dominicans living in Puerto Rico, Rodr\u00edguez says only a minority feel comfortable speaking out about any harassment they face or threat of deportation.</p> <p>\u201cMost of them are people who work, who do yard work, gardening, construction, welding, mechanics, cleaning; many women clean houses, take care of the elderly,\u201d says Rodr\u00edguez.</p> <p>They have good reason to fear speaking out.</p> <p>An investigation by the <a href=\"http://periodismoinvestigativo.com/2019/01/how-trumps-anti-immigrant-policies-separate-families-in-puerto-rico/\">Centro de Periodismo Investigativo (CPI)</a>, revealed Ice has shifted its focus to rounding up undocumented immigrants who have already established residency in Puerto Rico, a trend also reflected in the mainland US.</p> <p>\u201cWhen they get here to the federal prison, they quickly send them to Miami. They don\u2019t have funds. They don\u2019t have anyone there and if they don\u2019t have the resources to find a lawyer there, it\u2019s very difficult,\u201d said Rodr\u00edguez.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happens is that right now immigration has become a lucrative business. Flights to bring immigrants to their countries are a business.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPuerto Rican and Dominican people get along very well because \u2026 we are Caribbean and we have the same blood, the same DNA \u2026 we\u2019re brothers,\u201d said Rodr\u00edguez, referring to vibrant integrated communities where Dominicans have made roots on the island.</p> <p>But despite the cultural integration, predominantly Dominican communities, such as Barrio Obrero, do exist in Puerto Rico.</p> <p>\u201cYou can still point out where the Dominicans live, it\u2019s like they are segregated to certain areas. Those areas are identified as poor neighborhoods and areas with high crime rate and more police patrolling,\u201d says Dr B\u00e1rbara I Abad\u00eda-Rexach, a sociology professor at the University of Puerto Rico.</p> <p>Rodr\u00edguez said the profiling of Dominicans has both racial and ethnic components to it, as they may speak with a distinct Spanish accent and are often perceived as more likely to be <em>afrodescendientes</em> or of Afro-Latino heritage.</p> <p>\u201cThey stop you to corroborate you, they start talking to you to hear how you talk and that\u2019s what they use,\u201d said Rodr\u00edguez.</p> <p>\u201cWe had a case of a Puerto Rican in Caguas who was beaten because he was black. They thought he was Dominican because for the police, there are no black men here. If you\u2019re black, it\u2019s because you\u2019re Dominican.\u201d</p> <p>Race is a nuanced and at times complicated subject in Puerto Rico. Many Puerto Ricans take pride in the island as a racial utopia, which views itself as an equally valued mix of African, Taino native and Spanish heritage.</p> <p>The distinct \u201cblack v white\u201d racial framework that operates in the United States, particularly in the context of police brutality, can\u2019t be copy-pasted on to Puerto Rico. But scholars say it doesn\u2019t mean ethnic prejudice and racism doesn\u2019t exist.</p> <p>\u201cPolicing blackness \u2026 gets folded into and justified through this xenophobia directed at Dominicans in Puerto Rico,<em>\u201d </em>said Marisol LeBr\u00f3n, professor and author of Policing Life and Death : Race, Violence, and Resistance in Puerto Rico.</p> <p>\u201cAnd in that way, Puerto Ricans\u2019 discomfort with anti-black racism gets displaced on to this policing of immigrants.\u201d</p> <p>But officials often deny there is a systemic problem on the island.</p> <p>Eric Vos, a chief federal public defender in Puerto Rico, said profiling and arrests of Dominicans in Puerto Rico, haven\u2019t been on the uptick in his office.</p> <p>\u201cAnything\u2019s possible. It\u2019s a question of probable,\u201d says Vos. \u201cIt\u2019s just not something that we see.

      "bodyText": "Karina Gross Polanco is still haunted by the moment she arrived on the scene after her brother, Anewki, had been shot dead by a member of the Puerto Rico police department. \u201cIt was full of cops and closed off with yellow tape,\u201d said Gross Polanco. \u201cWhen I saw him bleeding out on the floor and I asked what had happened and that we needed to call an ambulance, but they said it was an instant death by gunshot, there was no point.\u201d While standing at a food truck waiting for his order in July 2017, Gross Polanco, a Dominican immigrant, got into a drunken argument with Nieves P\u00e9rez Ortiz, an off-duty police officer. The officer shot Gross Polanco, who was unarmed, in his head. \u201cI ask myself how is it possible that a cop with so many other ways of solving the situation just shoots my brother in the face?\u201d Gross Polanco said. \u201cHe could have saved my brother\u2019s life with just one call. He left kids without their father and a family destroyed.\u201d The murder highlights civil rights activists\u2019 concerns that Dominican immigrants are subject to police profiling and brutality in Puerto Rico and, in an age of increased scrutiny by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), are also being targeted for deportation on the island. It is a heavy burden for an already vulnerable community in Puerto Rico, often afraid to speak out about abuse or discrimination, or being singled out for violence. \u201cMany Dominicans have been murdered here in Puerto Rico,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez, a Dominican community leader who has lived in Puerto Rico for more than three decades. Anewki Gross Polanco, 25, had come to Puerto Rico in a yola (a small wooden boat) with his sister years before. It was a treacherous and sometimes deadly trek by water across the Mona Passage that many Dominican immigrants take each year to reach the island, hoping for a better life. His sister says Gross Polanco had an appointment at the immigration office scheduled that week but he would never make it. Of the estimated 200,000 to 300,000 Dominicans living in Puerto Rico, Rodr\u00edguez says only a minority feel comfortable speaking out about any harassment they face or threat of deportation. \u201cMost of them are people who work, who do yard work, gardening, construction, welding, mechanics, cleaning; many women clean houses, take care of the elderly,\u201d says Rodr\u00edguez. They have good reason to fear speaking out. An investigation by the Centro de Periodismo Investigativo (CPI), revealed Ice has shifted its focus to rounding up undocumented immigrants who have already established residency in Puerto Rico, a trend also reflected in the mainland US. \u201cWhen they get here to the federal prison, they quickly send them to Miami. They don\u2019t have funds. They don\u2019t have anyone there and if they don\u2019t have the resources to find a lawyer there, it\u2019s very difficult,\u201d said Rodr\u00edguez. \u201cWhat happens is that right now immigration has become a lucrative business. Flights to bring immigrants to their countries are a business.\u201d \u201cPuerto Rican and Dominican people get along very well because \u2026 we are Caribbean and we have the same blood, the same DNA \u2026 we\u2019re brothers,\u201d said Rodr\u00edguez, referring to vibrant integrated communities where Dominicans have made roots on the island. But despite the cultural integration, predominantly Dominican communities, such as Barrio Obrero, do exist in Puerto Rico. \u201cYou can still point out where the Dominicans live, it\u2019s like they are segregated to certain areas. Those areas are identified as poor neighborhoods and areas with high crime rate and more police patrolling,\u201d says Dr B\u00e1rbara I Abad\u00eda-Rexach, a sociology professor at the University of Puerto Rico. Rodr\u00edguez said the profiling of Dominicans has both racial and ethnic components to it, as they may speak with a distinct Spanish accent and are often perceived as more likely to be afrodescendientes or of Afro-Latino heritage. \u201cThey stop you to corroborate you, they start talking to you to hear how you talk and that\u2019s what they use,\u201d said Rodr\u00edguez. \u201cWe had a case of a Puerto Rican in Caguas who was beaten because he was black. They thought he was Dominican because for the police, there are no black men here. If you\u2019re black, it\u2019s because you\u2019re Dominican.\u201d Race is a nuanced and at times complicated subject in Puerto Rico. Many Puerto Ricans take pride in the island as a racial utopia, which views itself as an equally valued mix of African, Taino native and Spanish heritage. The distinct \u201cblack v white\u201d racial framework that operates in the United States, particularly in the context of police brutality, can\u2019t be copy-pasted on to Puerto Rico. But scholars say it doesn\u2019t mean ethnic prejudice and racism doesn\u2019t exist. \u201cPolicing blackness \u2026 gets folded into and justified through this xenophobia directed at Dominicans in Puerto Rico,\u201d said Marisol LeBr\u00f3n, professor and author of Policing Life and Death : Race, Violence, and Resistance in Puerto Rico. \u201cAnd in that way, Puerto Ricans\u2019 discomfort with anti-black racism gets displaced on to this policing of immigrants.\u201d But officials often deny there is a systemic problem on the island. Eric Vos, a chief federal public defender in Puerto Rico, said profiling and arrests of Dominicans in Puerto Rico, haven\u2019t been on the uptick in his office. \u201cAnything\u2019s possible. It\u2019s a question of probable,\u201d says Vos. \u201cIt\u2019s just not something that we see. If they were targeting disproportionately foreign nationals, Dominicans, we would see a much higher number statistically of immigration cases. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say it doesn\u2019t happen in state cases or in other scenarios but it just does not bear out in the federal arena.\u201d While non-discrimination and equal protection is one of the 11 areas of reform compliance listed on the Puerto Rico police department\u2019s website, an explicit plan to address racial and ethnic profiling is not posted. Opinions on reform\u2019s success are varied. \u201cThe problem is, the cops here investigate themselves. Complaints aren\u2019t investigated for that, because it\u2019s between cops. In other words, they have made the reform useless,\u201d said Rodr\u00edguez. Police leadership is what Karina Gross Polanco is still hoping for two years after her brother\u2019s murder. Last October a judge found the officer who shot him guilty of murder and sentenced him to 104 years in prison, but police convictions are still considered rare in Puerto Rico. \u201cNot all cops are the same, I have a few friends who are cops,\u201d said Gross Polanco, who still shows up regularly to the area where her brother was gunned down to place fresh flowers on a makeshift memorial. \u201cAt least now that rotten apple is gone and in jail. [But] if I don\u2019t do anything and push, he would have gotten free, he wouldn\u2019t be in jail.\u201d This story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center.",

Smoothies still fell out of fashion a bit when it was established that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/sep/07/smoothies-fruit-juices-new-health-risk\" title=\"\">it is better for satiety to simply eat the ingredients</a>. However, while it might come naturally to eat an apple and maybe a banana, you are unlikely to want to sprinkle some kale over either, less likely still to spread them with cashew butter. These are the key elements for nursing smoothies back into favour: vegetation and protein. The Nutribullet website has <a href=\"https://www.nutribullet.com/recipes/\" title=\"\">a ton of recipes</a>, and a fair number of them include protein powder, which I disapprove of. But there are other ways to boost protein, and that\u2019s the fashion: lower sugar, higher protein, while still fitting through a straw and being an appetising colour, which is to say not grey.</p> <p>There are two main routes to making things less sweet but still palatable: nutty or zingy. Almond milk is mysteriously good. You can use it with a banana base, but it\u2019s so silky in its own right, and has enough heft, that you don\u2019t need to. (It\u2019s good, if only for the soul, and the frail human need for variety, not to make all your smoothies with bananas.) A teaspoon of nut butter \u2013 peanut is tastier, cashew less assertive \u2013 rounds out the texture and makes it more filling. You\u2019re missing a trick if you don\u2019t add greens, since they pump up the healthiness without hugely changing the taste (if you want to change it, add rocket, but not until you get to zingy). Spinach is the favourite, though that tends to mean baby spinach, for mildness. Kale is particularly good with cherries, whose sweetness is quite fierce and distinctive (unlike strawberries, which have more of a cutesy flavour and taste like a mistake when set against a strong green vegetable). Blueberries are good with celery, like a married couple who seem incredibly different but who have elemental similarities that you only notice once they\u2019re both dead. That isn\u2019t a very nice colour, however, a kind of mauve that elsewhere in life would be discontinued and end up in TK Maxx. Beetroots are good but you have to steam them, which defeats the raw-purity agenda a bit; beetroot greens are surprisingly good with almost everything.</p> <p>Zing is generated mainly by lime and ginger; the theory, I think, is that they sort of blow your head off and you experience the smoothie more as a sensation than a taste. Apple, cucumber and parsley, ginger and lime is a hand-grenade start to a day.</p> <p>I retain a lot of affection for avocado in a smoothie, but if you have one ripe enough (it has to be perfect), it\u2019s tempting just to eat it.</p> <p>The big newcomers to the scene are: cauliflower, which you have to keep to a low proportion otherwise it makes it mealy (the texture; not \u201clike a meal\u201d); coconut water, which again, you have to keep to modest amounts, otherwise everything tastes of coconut (if you wanted it to taste of coconut, I would recommend actual coconut); flax seeds, which are satiating and good for vegans (mainly because of omega-3); ashwagandha \u2013 which literally means \u201csmell of a horse\u201d in Sanskrit, but in fact does not smell of a horse \u2013 is unobtrusive and apparently has a calming yet exhilarating effect that, I must admit, I did not notice; and custard apples, which genuinely taste of custard.</p> <p>Never put turmeric in a smoothie, even though people will persistently tell you to. It\u2019s just a fancy way of turning it the colour of turmeric.</p>",

But there are other ways to boost protein, and that\u2019s the fashion: lower sugar, higher protein, while still fitting through a straw and being an appetising colour, which is to say not grey. There are two main routes to making things less sweet but still palatable: nutty or zingy. Almond milk is mysteriously good. You can use it with a banana base, but it\u2019s so silky in its own right, and has enough heft, that you don\u2019t need to. (It\u2019s good, if only for the soul, and the frail human need for variety, not to make all your smoothies with bananas.) A teaspoon of nut butter \u2013 peanut is tastier, cashew less assertive \u2013 rounds out the texture and makes it more filling. You\u2019re missing a trick if you don\u2019t add greens, since they pump up the healthiness without hugely changing the taste (if you want to change it, add rocket, but not until you get to zingy). Spinach is the favourite, though that tends to mean baby spinach, for mildness. Kale is particularly good with cherries, whose sweetness is quite fierce and distinctive (unlike strawberries, which have more of a cutesy flavour and taste like a mistake when set against a strong green vegetable). Blueberries are good with celery, like a married couple who seem incredibly different but who have elemental similarities that you only notice once they\u2019re both dead. That isn\u2019t a very nice colour, however, a kind of mauve that elsewhere in life would be discontinued and end up in TK Maxx. Beetroots are good but you have to steam them, which defeats the raw-purity agenda a bit; beetroot greens are surprisingly good with almost everything. Zing is generated mainly by lime and ginger; the theory, I think, is that they sort of blow your head off and you experience the smoothie more as a sensation than a taste. Apple, cucumber and parsley, ginger and lime is a hand-grenade start to a day. I retain a lot of affection for avocado in a smoothie, but if you have one ripe enough (it has to be perfect), it\u2019s tempting just to eat it. The big newcomers to the scene are: cauliflower, which you have to keep to a low proportion otherwise it makes it mealy (the texture; not \u201clike a meal\u201d); coconut water, which again, you have to keep to modest amounts, otherwise everything tastes of coconut (if you wanted it to taste of coconut, I would recommend actual coconut); flax seeds, which are satiating and good for vegans (mainly because of omega-3); ashwagandha \u2013 which literally means \u201csmell of a horse\u201d in Sanskrit, but in fact does not smell of a horse \u2013 is unobtrusive and apparently has a calming yet exhilarating effect that, I must admit, I did not notice; and custard apples, which genuinely taste of custard. Never put turmeric in a smoothie, even though people will persistently tell you to. It\u2019s just a fancy way of turning it the colour of turmeric.",

Sugar is also one of the main causes of tooth decay.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The NHS advises that most adults and children in the UK eat too much of a type of sugar called 'free sugars'. These are the sugars added to food and drinks, found in biscuits, chocolate, breakfast cereals and fizzy drinks. But they are also found naturally in honey and unsweetened fruit juices.</p>\n    <p>The UK government\u2019s recommendation is that these 'free sugars' should not make up more than 5% of the calories you have every day. That is still quite a lot of sugar - it equates to seven sugar cubes worth for an adult. But bear in mind that one can of a fizzy drink can include the equivalent of 9 cubes of sugar. Children under 4 should avoid all sugar-sweetened drinks and food with added 'free sugars' in it.</p>\n    <p><b>Martin Belam</b><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Her report, she said, \u201cis aimed at politicians and policy makers, now and in the future\u201d.

The US president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/09/turkey-syria-attack-latest-news-kurds-trump\">washed his hands of Kurdish forces who fought alongside the US</a> against Islamic State for nearly five years, losing roughly 11,000 of their own. As Turkish troops bombarded and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/09/turkey-syria-attack-latest-news-kurds-trump\">advanced into the region</a>, activists and observers have reported multiple civilian casualties. Trump\u2019s decision has been widely criticised internationally.</p> \n<p>Two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/09/turkey-syria-attack-latest-news-kurds-trump\">notorious British members of Islamic State</a> have reportedly been moved from Kurdish to US custody. Turkey says it is seeking to establish a 20-mile-deep buffer zone against the threat of what it calls Kurdish terror groups, as well as Isis, and to resettle Syrian refugees. The UN security council is due today to discuss the offensive but it is not expected to deliver a strong rebuke to Turkey, given tacit Russian support and US ambivalence.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Hagibis causes rugby havoc \u2013 </strong>Scotland\u2019s World Cup remains in doubt with tournament organisers saying a short time ago that they must wait until Sunday morning to decide if their final and decisive pool match against Japan can go ahead. England and France will not play in Yokohama on Saturday evening, their match cancelled as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/10/rugby-world-cup-england-game-cancelled-with-decision-pending-on-scotland-as-typhoon-looms\">large parts of Japan await the arrival of a powerful typhoon</a>. Both teams have qualified for the quarter-finals with a game to spare. New Zealand and Italy also will not face each other. The matches will be treated as 0-0 draws and each team awarded two points. The stakes are high for the Scots, who would be eliminated if their match against Japan was to be cancelled, assuming that Ireland beat Samoa in Fukuoka on Saturday. Australia v Georgia and Ireland v Samoa are set to go ahead.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Antisemitic motives behind attack \u2013 </strong>The shooting attack that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/09/germany-shooting-synagogue-halle-livestreamed\">killed two people outside the Yom Kippur synagogue in Halle, Germany</a> was livestreamed online for 35 minutes. The suspect also posted vehemently antisemitic and racist documents online, as in the Christchurch mosque attack. One woman was shot dead near a Jewish cemetery and one man killed in a nearby kebab shop when a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/09/two-people-killed-in-shooting-in-german-city-of-halle\">gunman in a military-style outfit tried to force his way into the synagogue</a>.

Police confirmed an arrest had been made.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>PM meets taoiseach \u2013 </strong>Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar are set for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/09/boris-johnson-to-meet-leo-varadkar-over-brexit-compromise\">private meeting today on undisclosed \u201cneutral\u201d territory</a> in north-west England. Downing Street banned media from attending the talks and refused to disclose where they were taking place. The Irish taoiseach has said the British government\u2019s demand that Northern Ireland leave the EU customs union upon Brexit taking place poses a \u201cgrave difficulty\u201d for the government of the republic. Plans are being made to let parliament sit on a Saturday for the first time since the Falklands war to vote on any possible deal that emerges out of the EU summit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/09/parliament-set-for-brexit-showdown-on-19-october\">on 19</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/09/parliament-set-for-brexit-showdown-on-19-october\">October.</a></p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Real price of tea in your china \u2013 </strong>Poor pay and punitive working conditions are common on farms and plantations that supply fresh fruit or tea to UK supermarkets including Lidl, Aldi, Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and Morrisons, according to Oxfam. The charity says a \u201crelentless\u201d drive to maximise profits is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/10/workers-exploited-at-farms-supplying-uk-supermarkets-report\">fuelling poverty and gender discrimination in the supermarkets\u2019 supply chains</a>. Oxfam interviewed workers in India and Brazil and conducted a survey in five other countries. Workers on tea plantations in Assam said cholera and typhoid were rife because of poor access to toilets and safe drinking water. On fruit farms in north-east Brazil, women with children said they were forced to rely on relatives or government support to feed their families outside harvest season. Oxfam found that out of the 79p price of 100g of black Assam tea in the UK, supermarkets and tea brands receive 49p while workers get 3p.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Asian power list \u2013 </strong>Sajid Javid, Priti Patel and Rishi Sunak, all members of Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet, have made it into the top 10 of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/10/three-ministers-make-top-10-in-list-of-most-influential-uk-asians\">101 most influential Asians in Britain</a>. Javid appears as number one on the list for a second successive year. Gina Miller made the top three after her legal challenges against the government over Brexit.

      "bodyText": "Top story: US seizes Isis Britons from prison camp Good morning, I\u2019m Warren Murray and we can\u2019t make the news all good, but we can make it all a bit more clear. Donald Trump has dismissed Kurdish fighters\u2019 contribution to defeating Isis, declaring it is not as if they \u201chelped us with Normandy\u201d, as Turkey\u2019s military began attacks in north-eastern Syria. The US president washed his hands of Kurdish forces who fought alongside the US against Islamic State for nearly five years, losing roughly 11,000 of their own. As Turkish troops bombarded and advanced into the region, activists and observers have reported multiple civilian casualties. Trump\u2019s decision has been widely criticised internationally. Two notorious British members of Islamic State have reportedly been moved from Kurdish to US custody. Turkey says it is seeking to establish a 20-mile-deep buffer zone against the threat of what it calls Kurdish terror groups, as well as Isis, and to resettle Syrian refugees. The UN security council is due today to discuss the offensive but it is not expected to deliver a strong rebuke to Turkey, given tacit Russian support and US ambivalence. * * * Hagibis causes rugby havoc \u2013 Scotland\u2019s World Cup remains in doubt with tournament organisers saying a short time ago that they must wait until Sunday morning to decide if their final and decisive pool match against Japan can go ahead. England and France will not play in Yokohama on Saturday evening, their match cancelled as large parts of Japan await the arrival of a powerful typhoon. Both teams have qualified for the quarter-finals with a game to spare. New Zealand and Italy also will not face each other. The matches will be treated as 0-0 draws and each team awarded two points. The stakes are high for the Scots, who would be eliminated if their match against Japan was to be cancelled, assuming that Ireland beat Samoa in Fukuoka on Saturday. Australia v Georgia and Ireland v Samoa are set to go ahead. * * * Antisemitic motives behind attack \u2013 The shooting attack that killed two people outside the Yom Kippur synagogue in Halle, Germany was livestreamed online for 35 minutes. The suspect also posted vehemently antisemitic and racist documents online, as in the Christchurch mosque attack. One woman was shot dead near a Jewish cemetery and one man killed in a nearby kebab shop when a gunman in a military-style outfit tried to force his way into the synagogue. German media identified the suspect as Stephan Balliet, a 27-year-old German citizen from the town of Eisleben in Saxony-Anhalt. Police confirmed an arrest had been made. * * * PM meets taoiseach \u2013 Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar are set for a private meeting today on undisclosed \u201cneutral\u201d territory in north-west England. Downing Street banned media from attending the talks and refused to disclose where they were taking place. The Irish taoiseach has said the British government\u2019s demand that Northern Ireland leave the EU customs union upon Brexit taking place poses a \u201cgrave difficulty\u201d for the government of the republic. Plans are being made to let parliament sit on a Saturday for the first time since the Falklands war to vote on any possible deal that emerges out of the EU summit on 19 October. * * * Real price of tea in your china \u2013 Poor pay and punitive working conditions are common on farms and plantations that supply fresh fruit or tea to UK supermarkets including Lidl, Aldi, Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and Morrisons, according to Oxfam. The charity says a \u201crelentless\u201d drive to maximise profits is fuelling poverty and gender discrimination in the supermarkets\u2019 supply chains. Oxfam interviewed workers in India and Brazil and conducted a survey in five other countries. Workers on tea plantations in Assam said cholera and typhoid were rife because of poor access to toilets and safe drinking water. On fruit farms in north-east Brazil, women with children said they were forced to rely on relatives or government support to feed their families outside harvest season. Oxfam found that out of the 79p price of 100g of black Assam tea in the UK, supermarkets and tea brands receive 49p while workers get 3p. * * * Asian power list \u2013 Sajid Javid, Priti Patel and Rishi Sunak, all members of Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet, have made it into the top 10 of the 101 most influential Asians in Britain. Javid appears as number one on the list for a second successive year. Gina Miller made the top three after her legal challenges against the government over Brexit. Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, features in fourth place in the GG2 power list, which is collated by the Asian Media Group. Despite being second-generation migrants, Javid and Patel have both attracted controversy for their language around immigration. This is the ninth year of the list and it features 29 new entries.

Food and drink prices are very low, and the people really welcoming. Lift passes at \u20ac65 for two days are great value, or just \u20ac3 if, like me, you are over 70.

As with many small Spanish resorts it is only busy at weekends, so during the week you can enjoy deserted beautifully groomed pistes, with lovely off-piste challenges as well. Food and drink prices are very low, and the people really welcoming. Lift passes at \u20ac65 for two days are great value, or just \u20ac3 if, like me, you are over 70. There\u2019s accommodation in Rialp at the foot of the mountain or stay at Red Rock Trails near Tremp, if you want a multi-activity holiday. Note: Spanish schools don\u2019t have half-term, so those periods are no more expensive than any other time. \u2022 portaine.cat David Julian Alps, Slovenia Kranjska Gora is a brilliant small ski resort in Slovenia\u2019s Julian Alps, close to the Italian and Austrian borders. There\u2019s a great mix of slopes, including plenty of easier runs for families and beginners \u2013 all accessible via chair lifts and drag lifts. I thoroughly recommend the ski and snowboard school, and the nearby cross-country skiing centre makes a great day out. The village itself is full of Alpine charm \u2013 particular highlights were Lake Jasna (a stunning turquoise lake), Pizzeria Pino for wood-oven pizza and Slascicarna Kala for the best cake we\u2019ve ever eaten. \u2022 Two-day ski pass \u20ac59, kranjska-gora.si Mattie Valais, Switzerland Champex-Lac is a small village built around a lake that freezes for skating or cross-country skiing. Only two lifts, but it still has powder in a tree-lined bowl after nearby Verbier is skied out. The restaurants are traditional but good value (for Switzerland), and there are shops and ski rental in the town. There\u2019s plenty to do for kids \u2013 ice rink, nursery piste, sledge runs and a good ski school. It can be reached by train from Geneva via Martigny then the connecting branch line to nearby Orsi\u00e8res and a short bus ride. Verbier is a 20-minute drive away, if you want the big resort experience. \u2022 Two-day pass CHF56 (\u00a346), champex.info James Pooley Mora\u010da region, Montenegro Kola\u0161in in central Montenegro is the most underrated mountain resort in Europe. It is a small town surrounded by the Bjelasica and Sinjajevina mountains, which rise to above 2,000 metres. Skiing costs from \u20ac30 a day including lift pass, and there are also children\u2019s slopes with instructors. My seven-year-old loved it. The great-value Balkan cuisine is delicious and accommodation ranges from upmarket Hotel Bianca to reasonably priced log cabins. The ski slopes are 7km away and accessible by bus.

Some people can drink alcohol without developing a problem, not everyone who takes opiates recreationally has a problem, but pretty much everyone likes the feeling of nicotine.\u201d</p> <p>Vaping is even more addictive than cigarettes, Grisel said, and Juul is <a href=\"https://hartfordhealthcare.org/services/cancer-care/news/news-detail?articleId=17562\">more addictive</a> than other brands of vapes.

But what a lot of people don\u2019t realise is just how much downtime you have between scenes. Photographing those moments became a way of documenting my life and the lives of people around me, like a personal archive.</p> <p>Ten years ago, I had just finished filming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/feb/18/crazy-heart-film-review\">Crazy Heart </a>when I got a call from George Clooney pitching me his new film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/nov/06/the-men-who-stare-at-goats-review\">The Men Who Stare at Goats</a>. I was exhausted, but it was such a crazy idea I was immediately interested. When I started to explore it in a little more depth, I knew I had to do it, and off we went into this crazy thing together.</p> <p>I had never met George before, but he was splendid to work with and for. He produced the film and starred in it, and we had such a great time making it. He created such a relaxed atmosphere on set. As this picture shows, he\u2019s playful \u2013 an entertainer who\u2019s game for pretty much anything.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/aug/06/features.review\">I shoot on a Widelux</a>, a mechanical swing-lens panoramic camera, which is how I got this doubling effect. I get George in the far left of the viewfinder, then as the shot is exposing, I shout \u201cshift!\u201d at which point he turns his face and makes his sad face. The actor doesn\u2019t move across or anything, they just turn their head.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I'd get mad at myself for taking photos, or writing songs, or pouring myself into any pursuit that wasn\u2019t acting</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This image is part of a series of photographs that plays with the idea of comedy and tragedy and the masks of ancient Greek theatre. Partly, it\u2019s a way of me <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/26/jeff-bridges-career\">exploring what is to be an actor</a>, and tapping into the thrill of acting as I see it: the chance to represent what it means to be a human being \u2013 the extreme joy and sadness that make us human. But it also speaks to the masks we all wear in different situations.</p> <p>I\u2019ve always been interested in photography. As a kid I played with my dad\u2019s Nikon, and when he installed a darkroom in our house I loved getting into the technical side of it and seeing what shots would come out of the soup. The first wide-lens camera I had was a wedding gift from my wife, and I\u2019ve shot pretty exclusively on Widelux cameras ever since.</p> <p>I started shooting on set during the filming of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074751/\">King Kong </a>in the 1970s. My character had a Nikon strapped around his neck, so I thought I might as well use it. I guess it started out as part of my character but it became this passion.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/26/jeff-bridges-career\">Jeff Bridges: 'He's a real chameleon'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I used to get mad at myself for taking photos, or playing music, or writing songs, or pouring myself into any creative pursuit that wasn\u2019t acting. I would berate myself that it was a waste of time, that I should focus on one thing. But I\u2019ve come to realise that creativity feeds creativity \u2013 it\u2019s all part of the same thing and that you should give yourself time to explore your passions.</p> <p>Shooting on set is a pretty amazing thing. First, because the lighting is spectacular. And second, you\u2019re shooting people who know how to interact with a camera. For me and a lot of actors, even being around a camera changes something in your chemistry.</p> <p>I never intended to publish these shots. Originally, I did it so I could make little books for the cast and crew to remember the experience and time we spent together.

      "bodyText": "As an actor, and coming from a family in entertainment, I\u2019ve spent pretty much my whole life on set. But what a lot of people don\u2019t realise is just how much downtime you have between scenes. Photographing those moments became a way of documenting my life and the lives of people around me, like a personal archive. Ten years ago, I had just finished filming Crazy Heart when I got a call from George Clooney pitching me his new film, The Men Who Stare at Goats. I was exhausted, but it was such a crazy idea I was immediately interested. When I started to explore it in a little more depth, I knew I had to do it, and off we went into this crazy thing together. I had never met George before, but he was splendid to work with and for. He produced the film and starred in it, and we had such a great time making it. He created such a relaxed atmosphere on set. As this picture shows, he\u2019s playful \u2013 an entertainer who\u2019s game for pretty much anything. I shoot on a Widelux, a mechanical swing-lens panoramic camera, which is how I got this doubling effect. I get George in the far left of the viewfinder, then as the shot is exposing, I shout \u201cshift!\u201d at which point he turns his face and makes his sad face. The actor doesn\u2019t move across or anything, they just turn their head. This image is part of a series of photographs that plays with the idea of comedy and tragedy and the masks of ancient Greek theatre. Partly, it\u2019s a way of me exploring what is to be an actor, and tapping into the thrill of acting as I see it: the chance to represent what it means to be a human being \u2013 the extreme joy and sadness that make us human. But it also speaks to the masks we all wear in different situations. I\u2019ve always been interested in photography. As a kid I played with my dad\u2019s Nikon, and when he installed a darkroom in our house I loved getting into the technical side of it and seeing what shots would come out of the soup. The first wide-lens camera I had was a wedding gift from my wife, and I\u2019ve shot pretty exclusively on Widelux cameras ever since. I started shooting on set during the filming of King Kong in the 1970s. My character had a Nikon strapped around his neck, so I thought I might as well use it. I guess it started out as part of my character but it became this passion. I used to get mad at myself for taking photos, or playing music, or writing songs, or pouring myself into any creative pursuit that wasn\u2019t acting. I would berate myself that it was a waste of time, that I should focus on one thing. But I\u2019ve come to realise that creativity feeds creativity \u2013 it\u2019s all part of the same thing and that you should give yourself time to explore your passions. Shooting on set is a pretty amazing thing. First, because the lighting is spectacular. And second, you\u2019re shooting people who know how to interact with a camera. For me and a lot of actors, even being around a camera changes something in your chemistry. I never intended to publish these shots. Originally, I did it so I could make little books for the cast and crew to remember the experience and time we spent together. Usually, at the first script reading or the producers\u2019 meeting, I\u2019ll ask if people are OK with me shooting backstage. They tend to be pretty cool with it. But it felt as if I should share the work with the world. It\u2019s a way of giving something back to the motion picture industry that has been such a wonderful home to me for decades. \u2022 Jeff Bridges: Pictures Volume 2 is published by powerHouse Books on 15 October.

      "body": "<p>On the film sets of legends, size matters: big equipment, big performances, big egos, big budgets, big screen. On this shoot, none of that applies. We are on a trading estate in Gateshead, in a unit that looks as tired as any depot you have ever seen, right down to the backroom office\u2019s carpet tiles that are now the colour of boot soles. The fulcrum of this production is not a swaggering auteur, but a slight, bespectacled 83-year-old man who, instead of barking orders, speaks in a tone as polite and wholesome as Ovaltine.</p> <p>\u201cRighto, folks!\u201d he says, swaddled in a coat against the autumn cold that keeps pushing in.</p> <p>This is Ken Loach, socialist firebrand and provider of such recent headline hits as Tom Watson \u201c<a href=\"https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/09/ken-loach-tom-watson-is-the-biggest-threat-facing-labour/\" title=\"\">is the biggest threat\u201d to the future of the Labour party</a> and Ed Miliband is a \u201cfake left\u201d politician \u2013 and those were from just one week in September. Yet the atmosphere on set is more like a school camping trip than a political seminar.</p> <p>\u201cKaren,\u201d Loach tells one actor, \u201cwe\u2019ll see more of you later.\u201d When he spots the innuendo, he breaks into a giggle, joined by the cast and crew. More directing notes follow, before he breaks off again: \u201cRicky, Charlie \u2013 don\u2019t take the piss.\u201d More laughter. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the liberal press here today.\u201d</p> <p>Fifty years have passed since his breakthrough Kes, and Loach is still at it, winding up class enemies and sneaking reality into the multiplex. His latest is Sorry We Missed You, which will no doubt be described as a companion piece to I, Daniel Blake \u2013 the 2016 film about our inhumane welfare system that provoked condemnation from Tory ministers even as it shaped public debate about poverty in the fifth-biggest economy in the world.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysjwg-MnZao\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ysjwg-MnZao?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Both films are set in and around Newcastle upon Tyne, both show the human wreckage left by a broken economy and a punitive state, and at the heart of both are characters who could be your dad, your uncle, your mate \u2013 men who start off with high hopes and faith in the system, yet who in 90 minutes on screen are swallowed whole by an abyss.</p> <p>In Sorry We Missed You, that man is Ricky Turner. A blow-in from Manchester, he used to be a builder, until the financial crash killed the local trade. His latest, perhaps last, roll of the dice is to become a delivery driver; one of those guys who park their vans on double yellows and lug boxes to your door and who make today\u2019s consumer economy work. His wife is Abby, whose dreams of a family home died along with the collapse in 2007 of their mortgage provider, Northern Rock. She is a carer, looking after sick and elderly people as best as she can within the few minutes allowed by her agency.</p> <p>The couple work in the gig economy, a world of zero-hours contracts, barely any holiday or sick pay, and firms that paint workers as their own bosses, even as they punish them for being an inch out of line or a minute over time. The gulf between rhetoric and reality is mapped in the film\u2019s opening minutes, when Ricky signs up at the depot with promises of being \u201cmaster of your own destiny\u201d just before another driver throws him a plastic bottle saying: \u201cYou\u2019ll need this for a piss.\u201d The routes they must follow don\u2019t allow for toilet breaks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09169e1da9d121d2510178e0c15f19abd6d582e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09169e1da9d121d2510178e0c15f19abd6d582e2/0_262_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kris Hitchen in Sorry We Missed You.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kris Hitchen in Sorry We Missed You.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Entertainment One</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/25/university-london-cleaners-economic-apartheid\" title=\"\">I have been reporting on this area for the Guardian for years</a> and I am here to see what cinema can do with a subject usually confined to print.

Victorian capitalism used to mangle workers\u2019 limbs in machines; a large part of 21st-century capitalism does something less visceral but still devastating: it pumps you full of dreams of self-realisation even as it destroys your deepest notions of who you are.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s labour you can turn on and off like a tap,\u201d says Loach. \u201cIt follows on from Daniel Blake because while researching<strong> </strong>that film<strong> </strong>we were struck in the foodbank that a number of the people were working, and when we were in the benefits office most [claimants] were working. The idea of the working poor loomed large in our conversation.\u201d</p> <p>Most key players on Team Loach, meanwhile, have been with him for decades. Paul Laverty has been writing the screenplays since before Tony Blair entered No 10. To research this film, he hung around in car parks talking to drivers, doing their rounds with them, seeing them spend long days with only high-energy, gut-rotting drinks to keep them going. The cast on the other hand are largely new or relatively unknown, such as lead actor Kris Hitchen, who has spent the past two decades as a self-employed plumber, careering around in a van just like Ricky Turner. Other actors who usually work as delivery drivers respond to directions on loading and scanning parcels with finicky details about how it would be done in real life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6929ea0daceb1a5c7ad31857ce184139031b8f5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6929ea0daceb1a5c7ad31857ce184139031b8f5d/0_792_1755_1944/903.jpg\" alt=\"Ken Loach Adrien Brody and Pilar Padilla\" width=\"903\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The director (centre) on the set of Bread and Roses with Adrien Brody and Pilar Padilla.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/FilmFour</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is Loach\u2019s 27th feature film, and it is done his way. The script is shot in sequence and actors learn the story as they go along \u2013 all the better to surprise them. \u201cI just want the performance to come straight from their stomach,\u201d he says. At lunchtime, everyone piles into a minibus to go to a church hall. Loach remembers shooting Bread and Roses in Los Angeles, and an actor asking: \u201cWhere are the chairs?\u201d</p> <p>Loach said: \u201cWhat chairs? There are a few around. Find one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe always have chairs with our name on.\u201d</p> <p>Loach: \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSixty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell I\u2019m fucking 75. When you see me sit down, you sit down.\u201d</p> <p>Loach laughs then says: \u201cWe keep going because we\u2019re so inexpensive.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Labour haven\u2019t taken Johnson apart politically. We\u2019ve pretended he\u2019s a joke</p> <footer> <cite>Ken Loach</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By the time I next meet Loach at his production company in Soho in early September, nearly a year has gone by and his film is already lined up for release. Outside the edit suite, the Conservative government has failed to get the UK out of the EU, Theresa May is out of No 10 and Boris Johnson is in. A number of Labour MPs have left to form a new political party, ChangeUK, which has taken flight only to crash disastrously, even while Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour has slumped around 10 points in the polls. As he walks into the attic of the office townhouse, the most pressing issue on Loach\u2019s mind is not promoting his new film.</p> <p>The new prime minister is \u201cvery dangerous\u201d, he says. \u201cA convincing populist, a piratical buccaneer who just cuts through the crap.\u201d He is also slicing through Her Majesty\u2019s Opposition. \u201cWe haven\u2019t taken him apart politically. We\u2019ve pretended he\u2019s a joke and we\u2019re not making the sharper analysis of where Johnson stands.\u201d</p> <p>When there is another general election, what does he think are Labour\u2019s chances? \u201cThey can win \u2026\u201d he begins. Then, ever the realist, he checks himself. \u201cCorbyn needs a team, and that\u2019s where the MPs around him have failed. Look at the ones who say: \u2018We won\u2019t work with him.\u2019 The majority of them would be very happy to see a rightwing leader \u2026 And the leadership\u2019s compromised too much with the [Labour] right.\u201d</p> <p>This is not the routine criticism of Corbyn: it comes from one of his most stalwart and high-profile supporters. But if asked, Loach \u201cwouldn\u2019t have a hesitation\u201d in making another election film for Labour, as he did in 2017.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"476cd49d56429f2aabdc5be31f76e87734bdfbcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/476cd49d56429f2aabdc5be31f76e87734bdfbcb/0_0_2598_1996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Williams and Carol White Ken Loach Poor Cow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"768\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Williams and Carol White in Loach\u2019s 1967 film Poor Cow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cinetext Bildarchiv/Allstar/Fenchurch/Studiocanal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of his suggested solutions is forcing Labour MPs to reapply for their jobs before each electoral battle. It is a strategy that has left Margaret Hodge, MP for Barking for the past quarter century, fighting for her political life. \u201cEvery candidate in an election, whether you\u2019re a sitting MP or a councillor, should be chosen afresh. Every candidate should be asked: \u2018What have you done over the past five years?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>His other big demand is for all wearers of the red rosette to argue hard for socialism: \u201cEnhancing trade union rights, planning the economy, investing in the regions, kicking out the privatised elements of the NHS.\u201d</p> <p>Note what is not on his list. \u201cThe big issues transcend Brexit,\u201d says Loach, who voted remain, albeit \u201cwith a heavy heart\u201d because of the EU\u2019s \u201cfree-market orientation\u201d. \u201cIf change is to come, it must come from the working class. That\u2019s why telling their story is important. That\u2019s why knowing our history is important.\u201d</p> <p>It was the BBC\u2019s drama department that taught him this ethos. As a director on the Wednesday Play in the 1960s, Loach focused on people who barely got a look-in on screen or stage and put them on primetime BBC One. \u201cThe whole point of that project was: explain the world.\u201d In an era of two-and-a-half channels (BBC Two didn\u2019t reach much of the country), with schedules that only began at teatime, each episode was an event. They made headlines and lit up debates. His drama about homelessness, Cathy Come Home, prompted the founding of housing charity Crisis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everything is micro-managed. We couldn't have done Cathy Come Home without people saying: Why have you cast this person?</p> <footer> <cite>Ken Loach</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This was the decade of kitchen-sink realism, of A Kind of Loving and A Taste of Honey, although that school of film-makers had one crucial difference, says Loach. \u201cThey saw the working class in the north as a location.\u201d The working class was both set dressing and a rung on the career ladder, just as they are in today\u2019s media. \u201cJohn Schlesinger went to the States, Lindsay Anderson went back to the Royal Court \u2026\u201d whereas to him, producer Tony Garnett and writer Roger Smith on the Wednesday Play, \u201cthat subject matter was the core of what we did\u201d.</p> <p>Today, he says, \u201cEverything is micro-managed, by a whole hierarchy above the programme-makers. There\u2019s no way we could have done Cathy Come Home without people saying: \u2018Why have you cast this person?\u2019.\u201d The meddling is as political as it is editorial and Loach reaches for a phrase from Garnett: \u201cIt\u2019s the enemy of creativity.\u201d</p> <p>What he is describing is the death of a liberal pluralism that could tolerate radical politics and formal experiment. Producer Rebecca O\u2019Brien <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/12/i-daniel-blake-ken-loachs-welfare-state-polemic-is-blunt-dignified-and-brutally-moving\" title=\"\">first approached Channel 4\u2019s films division to fund I, Daniel Blake</a>, as they had with previous Loach projects. \u201cThey seemed to take ages to get back to me,\u201d she recalls, before the money person at Film4 rang. \u201cShe said: \u2018I\u2019m embarrassed about this \u2026 but the current regime think we\u2019re already covering the area because we\u2019re doing Benefits Street.\u2019\u201d Asked for a response, a spokesperson for Film4 says it has \u201cbacked 11 Ken Loach films and at the time it was in development I, Daniel Blake didn\u2019t feel quite right for us\u201d. In the end, the tab was picked up by BBC Films.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are aware of what the unspoken rules are,\u201d says Loach. Otherwise, \u201cthe airwaves would be full of outrage at poverty, homelessness, the grotesque inequality, the stupidity of privatisation, the collapse of the NHS. But they\u2019re not \u2013 because of that pressure.\u201d</p> <p>As we speak, the Edinburgh TV festival\u2019s MacTaggart lecture is in the headlines, thanks to Channel 4 News boss Dorothy Byrne calling the prime minister a \u201cknown liar\u201d in her address. Yet, the Byrne storm notwithstanding, Loach thinks some previous speakers show how cosy things have become. \u201cThe MacTaggart lecture: that\u2019s Jimmy MacTaggart, who was the main producer of the Wednesday Play. Jimmy was an iconoclast, constantly trying to knock down authority. The people giving the lecture are the authority that MacTaggart would have cut off at their knees.

      "bodyText": "On the film sets of legends, size matters: big equipment, big performances, big egos, big budgets, big screen. On this shoot, none of that applies. We are on a trading estate in Gateshead, in a unit that looks as tired as any depot you have ever seen, right down to the backroom office\u2019s carpet tiles that are now the colour of boot soles. The fulcrum of this production is not a swaggering auteur, but a slight, bespectacled 83-year-old man who, instead of barking orders, speaks in a tone as polite and wholesome as Ovaltine. \u201cRighto, folks!\u201d he says, swaddled in a coat against the autumn cold that keeps pushing in. This is Ken Loach, socialist firebrand and provider of such recent headline hits as Tom Watson \u201cis the biggest threat\u201d to the future of the Labour party and Ed Miliband is a \u201cfake left\u201d politician \u2013 and those were from just one week in September. Yet the atmosphere on set is more like a school camping trip than a political seminar. \u201cKaren,\u201d Loach tells one actor, \u201cwe\u2019ll see more of you later.\u201d When he spots the innuendo, he breaks into a giggle, joined by the cast and crew. More directing notes follow, before he breaks off again: \u201cRicky, Charlie \u2013 don\u2019t take the piss.\u201d More laughter. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the liberal press here today.\u201d Fifty years have passed since his breakthrough Kes, and Loach is still at it, winding up class enemies and sneaking reality into the multiplex. His latest is Sorry We Missed You, which will no doubt be described as a companion piece to I, Daniel Blake \u2013 the 2016 film about our inhumane welfare system that provoked condemnation from Tory ministers even as it shaped public debate about poverty in the fifth-biggest economy in the world. Both films are set in and around Newcastle upon Tyne, both show the human wreckage left by a broken economy and a punitive state, and at the heart of both are characters who could be your dad, your uncle, your mate \u2013 men who start off with high hopes and faith in the system, yet who in 90 minutes on screen are swallowed whole by an abyss. In Sorry We Missed You, that man is Ricky Turner. A blow-in from Manchester, he used to be a builder, until the financial crash killed the local trade. His latest, perhaps last, roll of the dice is to become a delivery driver; one of those guys who park their vans on double yellows and lug boxes to your door and who make today\u2019s consumer economy work. His wife is Abby, whose dreams of a family home died along with the collapse in 2007 of their mortgage provider, Northern Rock. She is a carer, looking after sick and elderly people as best as she can within the few minutes allowed by her agency. The couple work in the gig economy, a world of zero-hours contracts, barely any holiday or sick pay, and firms that paint workers as their own bosses, even as they punish them for being an inch out of line or a minute over time. The gulf between rhetoric and reality is mapped in the film\u2019s opening minutes, when Ricky signs up at the depot with promises of being \u201cmaster of your own destiny\u201d just before another driver throws him a plastic bottle saying: \u201cYou\u2019ll need this for a piss.\u201d The routes they must follow don\u2019t allow for toilet breaks. I have been reporting on this area for the Guardian for years and I am here to see what cinema can do with a subject usually confined to print. I have met an injured cleaner bullied so badly by her supervisor she considered suicide, minicab drivers who were whistled at \u201clike sheepdogs\u201d by their manager, an outsourced security guard living at home with his mum at the age of 46. The gig economy employs 4.7 million Britons, according to the TUC, from consultants on fat daily rates and hipsters in east London to these people working their guts out for poverty pay. Victorian capitalism used to mangle workers\u2019 limbs in machines; a large part of 21st-century capitalism does something less visceral but still devastating: it pumps you full of dreams of self-realisation even as it destroys your deepest notions of who you are. \u201cIt\u2019s labour you can turn on and off like a tap,\u201d says Loach. \u201cIt follows on from Daniel Blake because while researching that film we were struck in the foodbank that a number of the people were working, and when we were in the benefits office most [claimants] were working. The idea of the working poor loomed large in our conversation.\u201d Most key players on Team Loach, meanwhile, have been with him for decades. Paul Laverty has been writing the screenplays since before Tony Blair entered No 10. To research this film, he hung around in car parks talking to drivers, doing their rounds with them, seeing them spend long days with only high-energy, gut-rotting drinks to keep them going. The cast on the other hand are largely new or relatively unknown, such as lead actor Kris Hitchen, who has spent the past two decades as a self-employed plumber, careering around in a van just like Ricky Turner. Other actors who usually work as delivery drivers respond to directions on loading and scanning parcels with finicky details about how it would be done in real life. This is Loach\u2019s 27th feature film, and it is done his way. The script is shot in sequence and actors learn the story as they go along \u2013 all the better to surprise them. \u201cI just want the performance to come straight from their stomach,\u201d he says. At lunchtime, everyone piles into a minibus to go to a church hall. Loach remembers shooting Bread and Roses in Los Angeles, and an actor asking: \u201cWhere are the chairs?\u201d Loach said: \u201cWhat chairs? There are a few around. Find one.\u201d \u201cWe always have chairs with our name on.\u201d Loach: \u201cHow old are you?\u201d \u201cSixty.\u201d \u201cWell I\u2019m fucking 75. When you see me sit down, you sit down.\u201d Loach laughs then says: \u201cWe keep going because we\u2019re so inexpensive.\u201d By the time I next meet Loach at his production company in Soho in early September, nearly a year has gone by and his film is already lined up for release. Outside the edit suite, the Conservative government has failed to get the UK out of the EU, Theresa May is out of No 10 and Boris Johnson is in. A number of Labour MPs have left to form a new political party, ChangeUK, which has taken flight only to crash disastrously, even while Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour has slumped around 10 points in the polls. As he walks into the attic of the office townhouse, the most pressing issue on Loach\u2019s mind is not promoting his new film. The new prime minister is \u201cvery dangerous\u201d, he says. \u201cA convincing populist, a piratical buccaneer who just cuts through the crap.\u201d He is also slicing through Her Majesty\u2019s Opposition. \u201cWe haven\u2019t taken him apart politically. We\u2019ve pretended he\u2019s a joke and we\u2019re not making the sharper analysis of where Johnson stands.\u201d When there is another general election, what does he think are Labour\u2019s chances? \u201cThey can win \u2026\u201d he begins. Then, ever the realist, he checks himself. \u201cCorbyn needs a team, and that\u2019s where the MPs around him have failed. Look at the ones who say: \u2018We won\u2019t work with him.\u2019 The majority of them would be very happy to see a rightwing leader \u2026 And the leadership\u2019s compromised too much with the [Labour] right.\u201d This is not the routine criticism of Corbyn: it comes from one of his most stalwart and high-profile supporters. But if asked, Loach \u201cwouldn\u2019t have a hesitation\u201d in making another election film for Labour, as he did in 2017. One of his suggested solutions is forcing Labour MPs to reapply for their jobs before each electoral battle. It is a strategy that has left Margaret Hodge, MP for Barking for the past quarter century, fighting for her political life. \u201cEvery candidate in an election, whether you\u2019re a sitting MP or a councillor, should be chosen afresh. Every candidate should be asked: \u2018What have you done over the past five years?\u2019\u201d His other big demand is for all wearers of the red rosette to argue hard for socialism: \u201cEnhancing trade union rights, planning the economy, investing in the regions, kicking out the privatised elements of the NHS.\u201d Note what is not on his list. \u201cThe big issues transcend Brexit,\u201d says Loach, who voted remain, albeit \u201cwith a heavy heart\u201d because of the EU\u2019s \u201cfree-market orientation\u201d. \u201cIf change is to come, it must come from the working class. That\u2019s why telling their story is important. That\u2019s why knowing our history is important.\u201d It was the BBC\u2019s drama department that taught him this ethos. As a director on the Wednesday Play in the 1960s, Loach focused on people who barely got a look-in on screen or stage and put them on primetime BBC One. \u201cThe whole point of that project was: explain the world.\u201d In an era of two-and-a-half channels (BBC Two didn\u2019t reach much of the country), with schedules that only began at teatime, each episode was an event. They made headlines and lit up debates. His drama about homelessness, Cathy Come Home, prompted the founding of housing charity Crisis. This was the decade of kitchen-sink realism, of A Kind of Loving and A Taste of Honey, although that school of film-makers had one crucial difference, says Loach. \u201cThey saw the working class in the north as a location.\u201d The working class was both set dressing and a rung on the career ladder, just as they are in today\u2019s media. \u201cJohn Schlesinger went to the States, Lindsay Anderson went back to the Royal Court \u2026\u201d whereas to him, producer Tony Garnett and writer Roger Smith on the Wednesday Play, \u201cthat subject matter was the core of what we did\u201d. Today, he says, \u201cEverything is micro-managed, by a whole hierarchy above the programme-makers. There\u2019s no way we could have done Cathy Come Home without people saying: \u2018Why have you cast this person?\u2019.\u201d The meddling is as political as it is editorial and Loach reaches for a phrase from Garnett: \u201cIt\u2019s the enemy of creativity.\u201d What he is describing is the death of a liberal pluralism that could tolerate radical politics and formal experiment. Producer Rebecca O\u2019Brien first approached Channel 4\u2019s films division to fund I, Daniel Blake, as they had with previous Loach projects. \u201cThey seemed to take ages to get back to me,\u201d she recalls, before the money person at Film4 rang. \u201cShe said: \u2018I\u2019m embarrassed about this \u2026 but the current regime think we\u2019re already covering the area because we\u2019re doing Benefits Street.\u2019\u201d Asked for a response, a spokesperson for Film4 says it has \u201cbacked 11 Ken Loach films and at the time it was in development I, Daniel Blake didn\u2019t feel quite right for us\u201d. In the end, the tab was picked up by BBC Films. \u201cPeople are aware of what the unspoken rules are,\u201d says Loach. Otherwise, \u201cthe airwaves would be full of outrage at poverty, homelessness, the grotesque inequality, the stupidity of privatisation, the collapse of the NHS. But they\u2019re not \u2013 because of that pressure.\u201d As we speak, the Edinburgh TV festival\u2019s MacTaggart lecture is in the headlines, thanks to Channel 4 News boss Dorothy Byrne calling the prime minister a \u201cknown liar\u201d in her address. Yet, the Byrne storm notwithstanding, Loach thinks some previous speakers show how cosy things have become. \u201cThe MacTaggart lecture: that\u2019s Jimmy MacTaggart, who was the main producer of the Wednesday Play. Jimmy was an iconoclast, constantly trying to knock down authority. The people giving the lecture are the authority that MacTaggart would have cut off at their knees. Now they use it as a mouthpiece for the establishment.\u201d Previous MacTaggart lecturers include not one but three Murdochs, including Rupert, plus Google\u2019s Eric Schmidt and a boardroom full of BBC and ITV bosses. \u201cThat\u2019s the wickedness of what they\u2019ve done to his name. He\u2019d have been horrified. These people: Jimmy MacTaggart would have pissed on them.\u201d For him, the output of the BBC is full of cosy complacency. \u201cThe BBC\u2019s investigative journalism is a joke.\u201d Then he moves on to the recent Panorama on antisemitism in the Labour party. \u201cThat was probably the most disgusting programme I\u2019ve ever seen on the BBC. Disgusting because it raised the horror of racism against Jews in the most atrocious propagandistic way, with crude journalism \u2026 and it bought the propaganda from people who were intent on destroying Corbyn.\u201d It\u2019s a comeback that feels just as tin-eared as Labour\u2019s initial response - given the testimony of staffers in the documentary who talk emotionally about how their mental health was seriously affected - even if some of his points, especially on the lack of statistical context, seem justified. The hard task in capturing Loach, whether in interview or over his films, is marrying up what he says with how he says it. He is the most self-effacing firebrand. As a boy in the 1940s, Kenneth Charles Loach would be taken by his mum and electrician dad to Blackpool for a week every year. He remembers seeing \u201cthe old man going on the beach with his lace-up shoes and suit \u2026 seeing the comics and people rocking with laughter\u201d and his work often thrums with a quiet delight in the silliness of life, from the three-legged dog who makes a cameo in all his films to the sheer exuberance of Ricky Tomlinson showing off his backside in Raining Stones and Riff-Raff. Tomlinson has just turned 80 and Loach hopes they will work together again, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know if the arse has now gone beyond repair\u201d. As for Loach himself: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can go around the course again. It does get increasingly hard. You always feel a degree of insecurity about getting through a film. Knowing you\u2019ll be away from home for a long time, that you\u2019ve got to put a physical and emotional commitment to it that\u2019s got to last 12 to 14 hours a day.\u201d And as we end, I find myself wondering why Britain has been so casual about one of its giants and if it will ever again encourage someone of his political commitment and artistic stature.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cWhen you tell people in Paris you live near the Gare du Nord, they usually grimace,\u201d sighed Sarah, a French academic in her 50s who has lived on a narrow, traffic-choked street next to Europe\u2019s busiest station for 30 years.</p> <p>\u201cArchitecturally, the station building is superb. But neighbourhoods around stations are never easy, wherever they are in the world.\u201d</p> <p>Sarah is part of a local residents\u2019 group that has found itself drawn into one of Paris\u2019s biggest development battles in years. The state rail firm SNCF has joined with private developers and is poised to transform the Gare du Nord into a gargantuan \u20ac600m (\u00a3540m) shopping and office complex along the lines of an airport. The French government says the massive glass refit \u2013 which will chop up the station into walkways and mezzanine levels via 105 escalators \u2013 is the only way to cope with the staggering 900,000 passengers per day who will be using the rail hub by 2030.</p> <p>But top French architects and urban planners, including the award-winning Jean Nouvel, are leading a rebellion. In an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/gare-du-nord-revamp-indecent-say-leading-french-architects\">open letter they slammed the plans</a> as \u201cunacceptable\u201d, \u201cindecent\u201d and a \u201cserious urban mistake\u201d. Paris city hall, which is merely an observer of the project run by the state, has this month vociferously opposed the private commercial plans to add vast shopping space, pleading for it to scaled back. A planning commission verdict on Thursday will determine whether the plans can go ahead. Meanwhile, Paris is grappling with what the essence of station is and how residents should live around it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91e5b6938ae000fb5d47cf17b8fcad3aef9271e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91e5b6938ae000fb5d47cf17b8fcad3aef9271e8/6_74_1436_862/1000.jpg\" alt=\"State rail firm SNCF has joined with private developers to transform the Gare du Nord into a shopping and office complex along the lines of an airport.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">State rail firm SNCF has joined with private developers to transform the Gare du Nord into a shopping and office complex along the lines of an airport.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Valode &amp; Pistre</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey can argue all they like about what is going to be put inside the station, but if the area around the station isn\u2019t taken into account and altered, with the thundering road traffic eased, the neighbourhood will never improve,\u201d Sarah said.</p> <p>The Gare du Nord is one of the busiest rail hubs in the world, behind only the biggest Japanese stations. When travellers get off the Eurostar from London or the Thalys from Brussels and Amsterdam they are \u2013 unusually for an international terminal \u2013 stepping right into a frenzy of local, commuter and northern transport which sees the departure of 2,100 trains a day, with 500,000 daily travellers from the Paris <em>banlieue</em> (suburbs) alone.</p> <p>And yet the Gare du Nord occupies a comparatively small site wedged into one of the most built-up and densely populated areas of one of the most tightly-packed capitals in Europe. It sits in what was historically a working-class area with a large hospital right beside it, roads hemming it in and almost no green space in the surrounding streets. With trains already running for four storeys below ground, and traffic choking the chaotic and unusually small forecourt, there is precious little room to expand.</p> <p>For a decade, the 19th-century building, seen as an architectural and engineering masterpiece, has suffered from unflattering comparisons with the calm and gleaming St Pancras in London where Eurostar passengers alight in the UK. Andy Street, the former head of John Lewis who is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_the_West_Midlands\">mayor of the West Midlands</a>, even had to apologise to France in 2014 after calling the Gare du Nord <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/03/john-lewis-boss-andy-street-says-france-finished\">\u201cthe squalor pit of Europe\u201d</a> compared with what he called the \u201cmodern, forward-looking\u201d St Pancras. But the Gare du Nord\u2019s 700,000 passengers per day dwarfs the footfall of the airier London Eurostar terminal. St Pancras has discreetly tucked its shops beneath lower level arches, while the Gare du Nord has obstructed its main concourse with retail units plonked here and there \u2013 at the expense of seating for waiting travellers, who as a consequence are often reduced to sitting on the floor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e86058ba96d3cdbab6bbcf19f79d8e9943c739fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e86058ba96d3cdbab6bbcf19f79d8e9943c739fa/0_0_4896_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The station is hemmed in by traffic-choked roads.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The station is hemmed in by traffic-choked roads.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kathy deWitt/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The French state railway SNCF wants a gleaming new station for the 2024 Paris Olympics, even though many architects believe this deadline is too tight. But the giant scale of the project has led to soul-searching about the city\u2019s future.</p> <p>Paris politicians on the left say private money has been allowed to dictate the project and threatens the very fabric of the station.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhen you tell people in Paris you live near the Gare du Nord, they usually grimace,\u201d sighed Sarah, a French academic in her 50s who has lived on a narrow, traffic-choked street next to Europe\u2019s busiest station for 30 years. \u201cArchitecturally, the station building is superb. But neighbourhoods around stations are never easy, wherever they are in the world.\u201d Sarah is part of a local residents\u2019 group that has found itself drawn into one of Paris\u2019s biggest development battles in years. The state rail firm SNCF has joined with private developers and is poised to transform the Gare du Nord into a gargantuan \u20ac600m (\u00a3540m) shopping and office complex along the lines of an airport. The French government says the massive glass refit \u2013 which will chop up the station into walkways and mezzanine levels via 105 escalators \u2013 is the only way to cope with the staggering 900,000 passengers per day who will be using the rail hub by 2030. But top French architects and urban planners, including the award-winning Jean Nouvel, are leading a rebellion. In an open letter they slammed the plans as \u201cunacceptable\u201d, \u201cindecent\u201d and a \u201cserious urban mistake\u201d. Paris city hall, which is merely an observer of the project run by the state, has this month vociferously opposed the private commercial plans to add vast shopping space, pleading for it to scaled back. A planning commission verdict on Thursday will determine whether the plans can go ahead. Meanwhile, Paris is grappling with what the essence of station is and how residents should live around it. \u201cThey can argue all they like about what is going to be put inside the station, but if the area around the station isn\u2019t taken into account and altered, with the thundering road traffic eased, the neighbourhood will never improve,\u201d Sarah said. The Gare du Nord is one of the busiest rail hubs in the world, behind only the biggest Japanese stations. When travellers get off the Eurostar from London or the Thalys from Brussels and Amsterdam they are \u2013 unusually for an international terminal \u2013 stepping right into a frenzy of local, commuter and northern transport which sees the departure of 2,100 trains a day, with 500,000 daily travellers from the Paris banlieue (suburbs) alone. And yet the Gare du Nord occupies a comparatively small site wedged into one of the most built-up and densely populated areas of one of the most tightly-packed capitals in Europe. It sits in what was historically a working-class area with a large hospital right beside it, roads hemming it in and almost no green space in the surrounding streets. With trains already running for four storeys below ground, and traffic choking the chaotic and unusually small forecourt, there is precious little room to expand. For a decade, the 19th-century building, seen as an architectural and engineering masterpiece, has suffered from unflattering comparisons with the calm and gleaming St Pancras in London where Eurostar passengers alight in the UK. Andy Street, the former head of John Lewis who is mayor of the West Midlands, even had to apologise to France in 2014 after calling the Gare du Nord \u201cthe squalor pit of Europe\u201d compared with what he called the \u201cmodern, forward-looking\u201d St Pancras. But the Gare du Nord\u2019s 700,000 passengers per day dwarfs the footfall of the airier London Eurostar terminal. St Pancras has discreetly tucked its shops beneath lower level arches, while the Gare du Nord has obstructed its main concourse with retail units plonked here and there \u2013 at the expense of seating for waiting travellers, who as a consequence are often reduced to sitting on the floor. The French state railway SNCF wants a gleaming new station for the 2024 Paris Olympics, even though many architects believe this deadline is too tight. But the giant scale of the project has led to soul-searching about the city\u2019s future. Paris politicians on the left say private money has been allowed to dictate the project and threatens the very fabric of the station. France\u2019s indebted state railway company now renovates Paris stations in partnership with commercial property giants, who stump up the cash and claw back profits by putting in large numbers of shops. The \u20ac600m plans for the Gare du Nord \u2013 drawn up with the supermarket giant Auchan \u2013 would turn the Gare du Nord into a gargantuan shopping and office complex along the lines of an airport. There will be separate spaces for arrivals and departures, which will push travellers up and down a striking number of walkways and escalators to get to and from the tracks while passing the maximum amount of shopping opportunity. Like an airport, there has even been discussion of putting up signs warning people how long it will take to reach their platform. Paris city hall \u2013 which is not in charge of the project \u2013 has for a year pushed for changes from the sidelines, saying there wasn\u2019t enough space for bikes, not enough thought about rail-users and too much commercial focus, that the project was ridiculously big just to enable a private firm to make money. But suddenly this month, Paris city hall under Socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo, toughened its stance, arguing the \u201cneedless\u201d shopping complex should be scrapped and instead the state should fund a much smaller and simple refit. The government and the state railway insists the full project must go ahead if France\u2019s image is to be upheld for the Olympics. Politicians on the left have warned that the French business model of building vast flagship shopping centres is in decline. Several giant shopping complexes are currently struggling, including one in Aubervilliers on the northern edge of Paris and another near Charles de Gaulle airport. Plans to build a giant shopping and leisure complex north east of Paris called EuropaCity have sparked a huge political row, with business unions warning it will kill small shops in nearby towns. Just one stop away by the RER train from the Gare du Nord, the Forum des Halles at Ch\u00e2telet is already home to a gargantuan shopping centre which was recently recently rebranded as a Westfield. Restaurants and bars dominate the streets around the Gare du Nord, doing a good trade, and many fear that the new station plans will hurt the neighbourhood economy. The row is so fraught because the Gare du Nord has always had a symbolic place in the social make-up of Paris and the region that surrounds it. It is the gateway to the banlieue and the packed local trains bring professionals to Paris as well as a large proportion of the city\u2019s low-income workers doing crucial service jobs. \u201cI just want to get straight to work and straight home at night and have a seat on the train,\u201d said Maria 52, who lives on an estate north east of Paris and takes crowded trains to several different cleaning jobs each week. In 2001, during the last major renovations, a much-praised glass shed brought some light down into the dingy levels below ground. The architect, Jean-Marie Duthilleul, said: \u201cInstead of looking at their feet, now people can raise their eyes.\u201d But the station is still under pressure to rid itself of the sense it is some kind of border between the rich bustle of Paris and a young population discriminated against and pushed to the outskirts.

She said the compact 10th arrondissement, with 100,000 people living in less than three square km of densely packed streets with no public parks, sees its population swell to 1 million people each day as passengers arrive at the two main stations. The patchwork of local apartments and small studios has a broad cultural mix, including students and artists as well as richer residents who have made money on larger properties. Three years ago, France\u2019s first supervised injection facility for drug users opened on a street adjoining the Gare du Nord to allow addicts to inject with clean syringes and under supervision in order to curb overdose deaths and transmission of diseases spread by needle-sharing. Cordebard stressed its opening hours are soon to be extended. The station area has also become a focal point for homelessness. Residents groups insist there must be a post office in the new station as many local services near the station, including the old post office, have closed. Massive traffic jams in front of the station, with motorbikes parked up across pavements, mean it is often a challenge to even cross the road. Cordebard\u2019s key concern is how the area will remain liveable with the climate crisis and rising temperatures. The station and the nearby hospital emit heat amid vast road traffic pollution, and virtually no green space to counter it. \u201cIf you look at the thermal map of Paris, the area around the Gare du Nord is the hottest part of the whole city,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the hardest parts of Paris to cool down \u2013 we have to limit motorised vehicles and we have to find ways to plant trees.\u201d She added: \u201cFor the Gare du Nord to suddenly have this huge extra shopping centre built on top, bringing dozens and dozens of extra lorries a day, bringing extra rubbish each day in a place which can already barely absorb its own daily traffic and activity, I think that\u2019s a problem.

She said it would be \u201ca shame\u201d to put up a series of heavy new walkways that would cut through Hittorff\u2019s vast station space and mask the ornate back elevation.

Michel Babut of the train-users association FNAUT, said that although there were some positives, such as the Eurostar area of the station being moved to the side and renovated, \u201cthis project will spend colossal sums but not improve travellers\u2019 journeys and their experience of the station.\u201d On the station concourse, Patrica, in her 60s, who used to work in a notary\u2019s office in Etaples on the northern French coast, had been travelling regularly to the Gare du Nord for 40 years. \u201cI love the station building, although it does need more toilets,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it needs more shops. People are so rushed these days, they just want peace and quiet.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

      "body": "<p>The best thing since sliced bread turns out not to be sliced bread. Our supermarket loaf, which accounts for 80% of all the bread bought in the UK, is sweetish, soft and pappy. The ingredients listed on the plastic sleeve include added E-numbers, enzyme \u201cimprovers\u201d, extra gluten, protein powders, fats, emulsifiers and preservatives. It is baked according to the Chorleywood process (named after the location of the lab where it was invented) developed in the 1960s for speed, from grain that has been milled between steel rollers, removing the germ where the oils and nutrients reside, and the bran husk where the fibre is, leaving only the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal_germ#/media/File:Wheat-kernel_nutrition.png\" title=\"\">endosperm</a>, a pure starch so nutritionally void that by UK law vitamins must be added back into white flour.</p> <p>Mechanised food factories demand ingredients that are standard, stable and easy to transport, and make products that are standard, stable and easy to transport. New wheats have been bred for high yields and high protein content that require inputs of chemical fertilisers and pesticides. To increase efficiency, hedgerows and copses have been eliminated and farmland agglomerated into increasingly larger tracts of monoculture.</p> <p>From soil to plastic-packaged loaf, industrialised breads are the end product of 100 years of innovation in agriculture, manufacturing and transport, all of which prioritises efficiency and cost over nutrition and taste. Bread is the most-bought food item in the UK, but the supermarket loaf is just part of a basket of highly processed foods that we are now beginning to understand is making us fat, sick and allergic.</p> <p>While the big bakeries may market brown loaves under homely monikers such as farmhouse, wholegrain and multiseed, these are often distinctions without much meaning. The basic ingredient of highly processed flour is the same, even if bran or other sources of fibre are added back into the mix. More research is needed, but there is increasing evidence to suggest that gluten intolerance (not to be confused with coeliac disease, which means people cannot process gluten at all) could be caused by the extra gluten that is often added to mass-produced wholewheat products, and that the old-fashioned longer proving time \u2013 the resting time that allows yeasts to ferment the dough and make it rise \u2013 is a key factor in rendering wholegrains more digestible.</p> <p>Good bread needs no more than four ingredients: flour, yeast, water and salt. Wheats were once regional and adapted to the land; grain was milled locally and often baked as wholegrain flour into dense loaves. In Britain and the US, most of us have not eaten this kind of bread in so many generations there is no longer even a folk memory of what it tasted like. The desire for lighter and whiter bread is steeped in history: finer, paler, sifted flour was more expensive and the province of the rich, and as such has been a enduring trend, even as flour became a bland and cheap commodity, often bleached to make it even whiter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c499be44387cb31a12f0a8b19f9dc2fddf99def0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c499be44387cb31a12f0a8b19f9dc2fddf99def0/116_141_2802_1681/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mass-produced \u2018Chorleywood\u2019 bread.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mass-produced \u2018Chorleywood\u2019 bread.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ludmila Smite/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But in the past couple of decades, new movements have begun to challenge the prevailing food culture. In the early 2000s, activist and journalist Michael Pollan wrote about how what we eat had lost its link with the land and the farmer. Leading the revolt against processed food, in 2010, Pollan came up with the line that became a catchphrase: \u201cDon\u2019t eat anything your great-grandmother wouldn\u2019t recognise as food.\u201d Dan Barber, a chef on a mission to bring back the links between sustainable farming and taste and nutrition, delivered a Ted Talk in 2008 in which he described modern industrial agriculture as \u201can insult to the basic laws of nature\u201d. He and others have popularised the farm-to-table movement that is changing people\u2019s eating habits, encouraging farmers to grow varieties for deliciousness over yield, efficiency of transport and shelf life.</p> <p>In 2011, the geneticist Stephen Jones founded the Bread Lab in Washington, bringing farmers, millers, brewers and bakers together to develop new grains that emphasised taste. In 2014, Jones suggested the supermarket loaf should be called \u201cAmerican\u201d or \u201cprocessed bread\u201d, to distinguish its mass-produced identity and nutritional characteristics. He told me he does not like to be in the same room as white flour. Meanwhile, a sourdough movement bubbled up in San Francisco, championing the resurgence of the traditional method of leavening bread using natural starters that harness a complex web of ambient bacteria and fungi, rather than strong modern yeasts bred to inject air into almost anything.</p> <p>The great food writer Julia Child once said British white bread tasted \u201clike Kleenex\u201d. Maybe that is why we load our white sliced toast with so much jam and chocolate spread and peanut butter. Wholegrain, sourdough bread is a very different beast; crunchy, crusty, chewy, with a complex taste that is rich, nutty and tangy. Quite often, I find a couple of thick slices, spread with a generous swathe of butter, a satisfying lunch.</p> <p>The revival of ancient varieties of wheat is inspiring a new movement of agronomists, farmers, millers and bakers in the UK. They are coming together to develop and grow new kinds of wheat that do not need dousing with chemicals, to mill the grain in such a way as to keep taste and nutrition intact, and to bake loaves that are delicious and healthy. In the process, these artisans want to challenge the dominance of chemical agriculture and the supermarket loaf, to establish a new kind of supply chain that links our diet to nature and creates healthy communities.</p> <p>Bread is a basic foodstuff. It is our land and our kitchen table, family tradition and religious celebration. Our daily bread is our daily life; it is economics \u2013 breadwinner, breadbaskets, breadlines; it is politics \u2013 upper crust, bread and circuses, grist for the mill. As this group of growers, millers and bakers are demonstrating, bread can be revolution, too.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In the 1960s, while we were falling for the abundance of postwar produce and the convenience of the supermarket, one British plant pathologist was battling with mould. As a young researcher in East Anglia, Martin Wolfe specialised in barley mildew. At the time, the prevailing view was that science could improve on nature\u2019s design; agronomy focused on breeding grains that would produce the highest yields, and developing fertilisers and pesticides to encourage and protect them.</p> <p>Wolfe began to see that as soon as a new variety of barley was introduced, pathogens adapted to find a way to attack it; as soon as a new fungicide was formulated, the pathogen reacted by developing resistance to it. He realised that nature was always going to win the race.</p> <p>He was single-minded, driven, almost obsessive; his family complained that he was difficult to call away from his desk for dinner. He understood earlier than most that adding more chemicals was not a sustainable answer, and looked for different ways to grow healthy crops. He experimented with breeding varieties carrying different resistance genes. When he planted out his new varieties and mixtures, he found that infection levels fell.</p> <p>In the 70s, Wolfe worked with East German scientists who wanted to reduce their use of expensive foreign pesticides. By the end of the 80s, almost all their spring barley (an important crop, because the East exported malted barley to the West German brewing industry for hard currency) was being grown according to Wolfe\u2019s techniques. But when the Berlin Wall came down, they were encouraged, like other farmers in western Europe, via subsidies and promises of high yields, to use chemical fertilisers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d12e7da0125d191a7ce16cd5c3150a9f53cc4282\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d12e7da0125d191a7ce16cd5c3150a9f53cc4282/191_494_4602_2761/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Martin Wolfe at Wakelyns Agroforestry in Suffolk in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Martin Wolfe at Wakelyns Agroforestry in Suffolk in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Cullen/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always felt like a bit of an outsider,\u201d Wolfe admitted in an interview. He was a scientist, and at first sceptical of the organic movement that emerged in the 80s, which he felt was turning back the clock. His priority was breeding new crops to tackle the environmental challenges of the future. Over the decades, Wolfe became convinced that diversity \u2013 the very thing that modern agriculture was eliminating with its herbicides and monoculture \u2013 was the key to resistance. When a pathogen attacked a genetically homogenous crop, it could wipe out a whole field.</p> <p>As he approached retirement, Wolfe wanted to put some of the new ideas about mixed farming practices into use. Agroforestry had begun to gain ground in the 70s when Phil Rutter, an American plant breeder, asked a big question: if nature\u2019s dominant agriculture was trees \u2013 perennials \u2013 why had man spent 10,000 years developing annual crops? Rutter was convinced that trees such as hazel and chestnut could provide as much nutrition as cereals without having to be resown every year. His motto was: \u201cThe future of the world is nuts.\u201d</p> <p>In 1994, Wolfe bought two meadows and a low-ceilinged long house in Suffolk called Wakelyns, which had a been a pig farm, then a dog-breeding site. Wolfe drew up elaborate plans for avenues of hazel, willow and a mixture of fruit, nut and timber trees. In the lanes in between the trees, he would grow annual crops: vegetables, cereals, legumes. Wakelyns was always imagined as an experimental agroforestry farm, \u201ca rather expensive personal hobby\u201d, as his son, David, put it, not a going concern. It soon became a centre for real research.</p> <p>At first, the saplings, planted in mud with protective plastic rabbit-proof sleeves, looked thin, vulnerable and unimpressive. Visiting farmers shook their heads, wondering why land was being wasted by planting trees on it. \u201cNo experiment ever fails,\u201d Wolfe liked to say. As the trees grew and projects proceeded, visitors were drawn to Wakelyns to see for themselves one of the best examples of agroforestry in Europe. Wolfe walked them through his lanes of crops, his white hair glowing like a nimbus, backlit by the sun, explaining the how the trees, with their long roots, were able to draw nutrients from deep in the soil, which the annual crops also benefited from, via fungal networks in the soil. \u201cThere is an idea that crops suffer from competition with trees,\u201d he told one interviewer, \u201cbut it is not true \u2013 they are sheltered and protected by trees.\u201d</p> <p>In 2000, Wolfe created a very special crop. With the help of plant breeders and the scientists from the Organic Research Centre, Wolfe took 20 varieties of wheat that had been doing well under low-input conditions in the UK, half chosen for their quality \u2013 their high protein and gluten contents \u2013 half for their high yield, and cross-bred them every which way, resulting in 190 new crosses. Normally, a breeder would look at these plants and select for the traits they wanted. But this time seeds from all 190 were thrown together in a field, grown, harvested and reseeded together for several years. Wolfe called it YQ, for \u201cyield\u201d and \u201cquality\u201d.</p> <p>Whereas selection ordinarily narrowed the genetic pool, as with inbreeding dogs, this method maintained it. The genetic diversity in this crop meant the wheat was not only resistant to pathogens, but also tolerant of varying growing conditions. The yield of YQ was never going to match that of high-yield wheat in a good year, but over time, Wolfe showed, its yields through wet or dry or pestilential years, when whole fields of homogenous wheat could be wiped out, were compellingly consistent.</p> <p>Wolfe milled his YQ grain into flour in a small electric stone mill in his barn. His wife, Ann, made cakes and pastry with it, and everyone loved its rich, nutty taste. But Wolfe had not yet found a baker who would turn it into bread.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Last February, I drove north to meet one of the foremost of a new generation of British artisanal bakers \u2013 Kim Bell, who started The Small Food Bakery in Nottingham five years ago and, in 2018, won a prestigious BBC Food and Farming award. I found Bell cleaning up at the end of the day. Hale, with floury hands, and her hair tied up in a cloth bandana, she gave me a bottle of house-made rhubarb kefir as she finished vacuuming the ovens. She is a proper baker \u2013 a mix of passion and exhaustion. When she finally sat down, I said: \u201cOne day you\u2019ll have someone else to do the washing up!\u201d Bell shook her head. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anyone who comes in to do menial work. We all do it ourselves.\u201d This, she explained, was deliberate, part of a policy to encourage autonomy and responsibility. She wanted each baker to be mindful of resources: energy, time and hot water.</p> <p>I ate one of her cinnamon buns: sticky, soft and crunchy all at once; sweet from the chestnut honey and sour from the tang of the naturally fermented dough. Every mouthful was differently delicious.</p> <p>Bell had gone to art school but didn\u2019t want to be an artist. For many years, she worked with her father in a contracting business, specialising in installing coffee shops and minimarkets in petrol stations. They were successful, but she found the world of mass-market retail depressing and wasteful. Bell is the kind of person who always has a dozen projects on the go and a large cast of collaborators. She was often cooking on the side, filling in at a friend\u2019s pub, catering a wedding or baking for the Women\u2019s Institute market. At one point, she got involved with helping a friend open a cafe.</p> <p>She also started reading Michael Pollan and Dan Barber, and discovered the US food movement linking sustainable agriculture and deliciousness. She went to listen to a talk by Andrew Whitley, the godfather of the British sourdough movement, who had opened the first organic bakery in the UK \u2013 the Village Bakery in Melmerby in Cumbria \u2013 in 1976. \u201cAndrew was selling the idea of a bread revolution where we use wild yeasts and we know where our grain comes from.\u201d</p> <p>Bell is a very good baker; she is also a political baker. Learning about soil depletion and disease and social justice, she was appalled, and then galvanised. \u201cIt just all came together for me: there is a problem in our food system and we need to fix it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thoughts converged, and events conspired: a small kitchen-cafe came up for hire in an artists\u2019 co-op in Nottingham, and in 2014, Bell found herself with a space and an oven. Opening a bakery seemed an obvious way to challenge all that she felt was wrong with the industrial food system, a sourdough gauntlet to throw down in opposition to the supermarket loaf in its plastic sleeve.</p> <p>\u201cI flung my doors open one day with absolutely no fanfare,\u201d Bell remembered. \u201cI didn\u2019t announce it. There was no sign. I had one customer the whole day. And she was gluten intolerant.\u201d Bell had no formal baking training; she did what most new artisan bakers do: she tried to copy the Tartine Bakery in San Francisco, with its much-lauded and Instagram-famous crumb (bread\u2019s interior texture) full of big holes, and its sharply crunchy crusts.</p> <p>\u201cYou think flour is a stable ingredient,\u201d Bell explained to me as she opened a few bags of different flours for me to feel and taste. \u201cBut if it\u2019s done right, it\u2019s living and alive.\u201d I held some flour in my palm and saw how it clumped a little when I compressed it \u2013 the measure of its moisture. The flour I had unthinkingly always used is really only an inert powder of indefinable shelf life, whereas this kind of whole grain, containing the oils of the germ, lasts a few months before it can go rancid. </p> <p>Bell is one of the vanguard of bakers in the UK trying to make better flour and tastier, more satisfying loaves. Part of the taste comes from using different grains \u2013 the ancient progenitors of modern wheats, like spelt, einkorn and emmer, or cereals such as rye, buckwheat, barley and oats \u2013 and part from the lactic tang of the \u201cstarter\u201d, the natural leavening ferment made from a flour-and-water paste and ambient yeasts.</p> <p>When Bell first started the bakery she used organic flour from Shipton Mill, a British miller that provides high-quality blends of flour. But she wanted to understand more about the products she was using, where they came from, how they were grown; she wanted, as part of the mission and identity of the bakery, to source ingredients locally. She soon found someone who was milling organic flour in a windmill only 40 miles away.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>After working for years in the corporate world, Paul Wyman and his wife, Fari, bought the refurbished windmill at Tuxford 14 years ago, pretty much on a whim. The learning curve was steep. Wyman had to figure out the hard way the difference between \u201cmilling wheat\u201d and \u201cfeed wheat\u201d fit for animals (it has a different protein content; a lot of bakers are used to working with higher protein contents because it creates a more open, structured crumb), and there were plenty of mechanical problems and sudden wind gusts, but, he admitted, \u201cslowly, I became a pretty good miller\u201d.</p> <p>His wife presides in the tea room, selling cakes and scones made with flour he has milled, to showcase how different the taste can be. (I bought two bags of his Tuxford Gold and made everything from pasta to pastry with them; the difference in quality was clear \u2013 it was richer, more complicated, more interesting.)</p> <p>There is something quite extraordinary about the sheer physicality of a working windmill. The big canvas sails turned as gracefully and powerful as a tall masted ship. Inside the shafts and chains and pulleys and wooden toothed gears clanked and thumped as the iron spindle revolved, running through the centre of the two heavy grinding stones. People have been grinding grain into flour in this way for thousands of years.</p> <p>The grain is poured into a hole in the centre of the circular mill stones. The top stone is smooth, and the bottom one carved into grooved sections. The grooves funnel the wheat to the outside of the stones, slicing each grain 20-30,000 times before it falls over the edge as fine fluffy flour. Milling in this way is a technical art. Milling at a cooler temperature allows the miller to grind a wholegrain \u2013 100% of the grain, germ and bran included \u2013 and then sift the flour, shaking through sieves of different sizes, to varying degrees. When there is still a fair bit of bran in the flour, it is called middlings (\u201chence the origin of the term \u2018fair to middling,\u2019\u201d explained Wyman). A full extraction to white flour might discard a third or more of the whole grain.</p> <p>Milling wholegrain preserves the grain\u2019s essential nutrients, as Stephen Jones at the Bread Lab in Washington state explained to me. \u201cA kernel of grain has 8% fibre, white flour has zero. A kernel of grain has 35-100mg of iron per kilo, white flour has close to zero.\u201d The bran is usually sold off cheap, as animal feed or potting material.</p> <p>Jones convenes an annual symposium, the Grain Gathering, which brings together bakers, breeders and millers from all over the world. Jones is a global leader developing new wheats and other cereals tailored to the varied needs of bakers, brewers, farmers and consumers. Recently, the Bread Lab launched a new sliced loaf developed to appeal to consumers brought up on soft and sweet American bread.</p> <p>Kim Bell met Jones several times at the Grain Gathering. For the past two years, she has organised a UK version, the Grain Lab, a two-day event bringing together 150 farmers, millers and bakers from 14 countries to discuss issues of marketing, transport and cost.</p> <p>A supermarket loaf might cost about \u00a31, a loaf from an artisanal bakery three or four times that. Inevitably, the price of sourdough has given it an elite, middle-class foodie tag. Supermarket bread sells at wafer-thin margins, and big bakeries operate on giant economies of scale; small bakeries have to contend with high rents and labour costs, expensive organic ingredients and a time-intensive process. Bakers defend the value of their loaves, their high satiety (one thick slice fills you up quite happily) and lower waste: supermarket bread is so undervalued that almost half of it is thrown away. Increasingly, we are beginning to understand the real costs of an industrialised food supply, not borne by the agro-food industry, but by the taxpayer. <a href=\"https://sustainablefoodtrust.org/articles/hidden-cost-uk-food/\" title=\"\">A study</a> for the Sustainable Food Trust in 2017 suggested that when you have factored in the health costs of obesity and diabetes, environmental clean-up and subsidies, the real cost of our food is double what we pay for it in a shop.</p> <p>Bell and others are trying to put together local networks of supply, to create a new kind of grain economy; inevitably, their efforts come up against the problem of how we value benefits that we can feel, rather than count. Bell told me that the connections she makes are often personal and unexpectedly moving (for example, when farmers taste bread baked with grain they have grown for the first time). For Bell, the quality of her relationships is as important as the quality of the ingredients.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>One day, more than three years ago, Josiah Meldrum, an organic farming activist, walked into Kim Bell\u2019s bakery with a bag of YQ flour. Meldrum, co-founder of Hodmedod\u2019s, a Norfolk company selling and championing British legumes, was a close friend of Martin Wolfe and keen to help him get bakers interested in YQ. He told Bell the story of YQ and asked her if she would try baking with it, explaining apologetically that YQ had a relatively low protein content. Most bakers would have been put off, but Bell smelled its toasty nuttiness and was intrigued.</p> <p>Her first efforts produced tough, dense loaves, or the dough became a puddle of unshapeable slop. Bell tried varying the proportions of starter, upped hydration levels, reduced the temperature, mixed it vigorously instead of gently. \u201cIt was just trial and error really.\u201d She wanted to bring out the flavour of the wheat. Finally, she was satisfied and had a domed loaf with a dark umber crust and a russet interior of soft, pillowy crumb that she could take to show Wolfe at Wakelyns.</p> <p>Bell was nervous: \u201cHe\u2019s a bit famous.\u201d But they ended up spending all day talking. \u201cHe was delighted, because he had been working on this project for 20 years and scientists were fascinated by it, but he couldn\u2019t seem to get a baker to bake with it.\u201d Bell and Wolfe recognised in each other the other half of an equation. For Bell, the YQ wheat represented \u201ceverything we had been thinking about in the bakery, diversification and decentralisation, resonated back down to the seed.\u201d</p> <p>Since the early 20th century, seeds that are sold commercially have had to be legally registered according to variety. In this way, buyers are protected and breeders can receive royalties on plants they have spent time and money developing. Accordingly, seeds and plant varieties must conform to certain criteria for uniformity and stability. But YQ is genetically thousands of different varieties of wheat, known as a \u201cpopulation\u201d. As such, it could not be legally registered, or traded, in Europe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ea436c57661c5671a326c632a80633fd21e69624\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea436c57661c5671a326c632a80633fd21e69624/0_70_1536_1175/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tuxford Windmill and Tearooms\" width=\"1000\" height=\"765\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tuxford Windmill and Tearooms in Nottinghamshire</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tuxford Windmill</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Bell fell in love with YQ and its story, Wolfe had been growing it for almost 15 years. In the US, they were continuing to develop populations, as were a few agronomists in France, Germany and Italy. But generally, these were a new, untested type of crop. Between 2007 and 2013, YQ went on a tour around Europe, to see how it would grow in different climates. The results showed that even in varying weather conditions and soils the overall yield of YQ was remarkably stable.</p> <p>In the meantime, Wolfe went back and forth between Brussels and Westminster to lobby for an exception to the EU regulations that would allow YQ to be sold. Finally, in 2014, he was successful, and in July 2017 YQ seed, officially called the ORC Wakelyns Population, was the first population wheat to go on sale in Europe.</p> <p>Bell wanted to use YQ flour at the Small Food Bakery, but she needed to find a farmer to grow it. She asked Paul Wyman at Tuxford Mill if he had any ideas. Wyman sourced a lot of his organic wheat from John and Guy Turner, who had a family farm in Lincolnshire, 40 minutes down the A1. He suggested giving them a call.</p> <p>The Turner brothers at Grange Farm are fourth-generation farmers with 100 hectares (250 acres). Over the decades, they had watched other small farmers around them struggle and sell up. So, in 2001, they decided to go organic. \u201cBasically, we\u2019ve been holding on by our fingertips for the last 30 years,\u201d John Turner told me. They had begun to send their wheat to Paul Wyman when they were looking for a way to sell a few tonnes of extra grain. When Bell asked if they would be interested in planting YQ the brothers said: \u201cOK. Why not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOver the winter, we weren\u2019t too sure about it at all,\u201d Guy told me. \u201cIt was quite a spindly, thin crop. But then in the spring, when the weather warmed up, it just absolutely took off. You could almost sit at the edge of the field and watch it grow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t appreciate the diversity until you actually see it,\u201d said John. \u201cSome plants were four foot high, some two foot, some had awns [bristles], some were without, some had spikey filaments hanging off, some had square heads, chunky and robust, some were more slender.\u201d The summer of 2018 was very dry and not a good year for cereals, and YQ outperformed a lot of the conventionally grown crops in the area.</p> <p>Bell continued to champion YQ to other bakers and gave baking demonstrations with it at her Grain Lab. Ben Mackinnon at E5 Bakery in London Fields, which mills its own flour at its premises under a railway arch, grew up on a farm near Wakelyns, knew Wolfe (he once spent a month digging up potatoes for him) and said he would take four tonnes. Turner was delighted. The only problem was how to get the grain to London. Turner suggested he take a load on a trailer hooked up to his 4X4. He soon got lost in the narrow streets. \u201cI felt like a real hick from the sticks,\u201d he said, laughing. I said he was doing something that probably hadn\u2019t been done in 150 years: a farmer transporting his own grain into central London to be milled.</p> <p>When I visited E5 in April, they had almost run out of the Turner\u2019s YQ and had begun to source it from another farmer in Essex. Word had gone around, artisanal bakers were excited by the YQ story and its flavour; almost the whole 2018 crop had sold out.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Martin Wolfe died after a short illness in March. We had been in touch and he had invited me to come to see his farm. Two weeks after his death, his son David and Josiah Meldrum kindly met me at Wakelyns. It was a brittle spring day, bright spots of sun in a cold wind.</p> <p>They showed me Martin\u2019s office \u2013 a mess of papers, slides of mildewed barley leaves, a nest of wires on the floor, chainsaw parts. In the sheds and barns, there were tractors and combine harvesters and all sorts of Heath Robinson-esque machinery he had modified for his experiments. \u201cThere\u2019s not much you can\u2019t do with a Ribena bottle,\u201d David laughed, pointing to plastic bottle taped to a stick. \u201cEverything tied up with baler twine,\u201d Meldrum added. \u201cMartin would never let a good idea be stymied by not having the right equipment.\u201d</p> <p>And here were the avenues of trees, and between them alleys of clover and blades of green YQ. The trees were splotched with green and white and pink blossom, 40 kinds of apple, multiples of pear, plum. There were the prints of muntjac deer and hares in the mud and thrushes warbling in the hazel.</p> <p>We walked through a hedge and came out on to a lane as a blast of raw wind, unchecked by trees, blew into our faces. Before us was a 40-hectare expanse of wheat on the neighbouring farm, as evenly green as a billiard table. The contrast between the variegated beauty of Wakelyns agroforestry and this conventionally farmed field could not have been more stark.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/01/bacon-cancer-processed-meats-nitrates-nitrites-sausages\">Yes, bacon really is killing us</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We are only beginning to understand the importance of diversity and the complex systems that plants \u2013 and animals, and us \u2013 need to thrive. In an interview, Martin Wolfe once argued that value should be accounted not just according to the cash received for a crop, but to the effect of the plants on the soil and carbon sequestration, and wider effects \u201con mood, on beauty, on community\u201d. The story of YQ spins a narrative from soil health to grain resistance to nutritious flour to tasty bread, and it also describes a group of people working together to create a local food network that nourishes a community.</p> <p>\u201cMartin was always full of crazy ideas,\u201d said his son. We walked to the end of a grassy meadow. His wife Ann\u2019s grave was marked with a simple stone among stands of daffodils. In April, Martin was buried next to her.</p> <p>As a result of his lobbying, YQ wheat will receive legal status to be traded from the EU in 2021. Before he died, Bell told me: \u201cI\u2019m buoyed by Martin. Last year he said to me: \u2018Kim, it\u2019s happening, I\u2019m seeing it for the first time in my life. It\u2019s going to come.

      "bodyText": "The best thing since sliced bread turns out not to be sliced bread. Our supermarket loaf, which accounts for 80% of all the bread bought in the UK, is sweetish, soft and pappy. The ingredients listed on the plastic sleeve include added E-numbers, enzyme \u201cimprovers\u201d, extra gluten, protein powders, fats, emulsifiers and preservatives. It is baked according to the Chorleywood process (named after the location of the lab where it was invented) developed in the 1960s for speed, from grain that has been milled between steel rollers, removing the germ where the oils and nutrients reside, and the bran husk where the fibre is, leaving only the endosperm, a pure starch so nutritionally void that by UK law vitamins must be added back into white flour. Mechanised food factories demand ingredients that are standard, stable and easy to transport, and make products that are standard, stable and easy to transport. New wheats have been bred for high yields and high protein content that require inputs of chemical fertilisers and pesticides. To increase efficiency, hedgerows and copses have been eliminated and farmland agglomerated into increasingly larger tracts of monoculture. From soil to plastic-packaged loaf, industrialised breads are the end product of 100 years of innovation in agriculture, manufacturing and transport, all of which prioritises efficiency and cost over nutrition and taste. Bread is the most-bought food item in the UK, but the supermarket loaf is just part of a basket of highly processed foods that we are now beginning to understand is making us fat, sick and allergic. While the big bakeries may market brown loaves under homely monikers such as farmhouse, wholegrain and multiseed, these are often distinctions without much meaning. The basic ingredient of highly processed flour is the same, even if bran or other sources of fibre are added back into the mix. More research is needed, but there is increasing evidence to suggest that gluten intolerance (not to be confused with coeliac disease, which means people cannot process gluten at all) could be caused by the extra gluten that is often added to mass-produced wholewheat products, and that the old-fashioned longer proving time \u2013 the resting time that allows yeasts to ferment the dough and make it rise \u2013 is a key factor in rendering wholegrains more digestible. Good bread needs no more than four ingredients: flour, yeast, water and salt. Wheats were once regional and adapted to the land; grain was milled locally and often baked as wholegrain flour into dense loaves. In Britain and the US, most of us have not eaten this kind of bread in so many generations there is no longer even a folk memory of what it tasted like. The desire for lighter and whiter bread is steeped in history: finer, paler, sifted flour was more expensive and the province of the rich, and as such has been a enduring trend, even as flour became a bland and cheap commodity, often bleached to make it even whiter. But in the past couple of decades, new movements have begun to challenge the prevailing food culture. In the early 2000s, activist and journalist Michael Pollan wrote about how what we eat had lost its link with the land and the farmer. Leading the revolt against processed food, in 2010, Pollan came up with the line that became a catchphrase: \u201cDon\u2019t eat anything your great-grandmother wouldn\u2019t recognise as food.\u201d Dan Barber, a chef on a mission to bring back the links between sustainable farming and taste and nutrition, delivered a Ted Talk in 2008 in which he described modern industrial agriculture as \u201can insult to the basic laws of nature\u201d. He and others have popularised the farm-to-table movement that is changing people\u2019s eating habits, encouraging farmers to grow varieties for deliciousness over yield, efficiency of transport and shelf life. In 2011, the geneticist Stephen Jones founded the Bread Lab in Washington, bringing farmers, millers, brewers and bakers together to develop new grains that emphasised taste. In 2014, Jones suggested the supermarket loaf should be called \u201cAmerican\u201d or \u201cprocessed bread\u201d, to distinguish its mass-produced identity and nutritional characteristics. He told me he does not like to be in the same room as white flour. Meanwhile, a sourdough movement bubbled up in San Francisco, championing the resurgence of the traditional method of leavening bread using natural starters that harness a complex web of ambient bacteria and fungi, rather than strong modern yeasts bred to inject air into almost anything. The great food writer Julia Child once said British white bread tasted \u201clike Kleenex\u201d. Maybe that is why we load our white sliced toast with so much jam and chocolate spread and peanut butter. Wholegrain, sourdough bread is a very different beast; crunchy, crusty, chewy, with a complex taste that is rich, nutty and tangy. Quite often, I find a couple of thick slices, spread with a generous swathe of butter, a satisfying lunch. The revival of ancient varieties of wheat is inspiring a new movement of agronomists, farmers, millers and bakers in the UK. They are coming together to develop and grow new kinds of wheat that do not need dousing with chemicals, to mill the grain in such a way as to keep taste and nutrition intact, and to bake loaves that are delicious and healthy. In the process, these artisans want to challenge the dominance of chemical agriculture and the supermarket loaf, to establish a new kind of supply chain that links our diet to nature and creates healthy communities. Bread is a basic foodstuff. It is our land and our kitchen table, family tradition and religious celebration. Our daily bread is our daily life; it is economics \u2013 breadwinner, breadbaskets, breadlines; it is politics \u2013 upper crust, bread and circuses, grist for the mill. As this group of growers, millers and bakers are demonstrating, bread can be revolution, too. * * * In the 1960s, while we were falling for the abundance of postwar produce and the convenience of the supermarket, one British plant pathologist was battling with mould. As a young researcher in East Anglia, Martin Wolfe specialised in barley mildew. At the time, the prevailing view was that science could improve on nature\u2019s design; agronomy focused on breeding grains that would produce the highest yields, and developing fertilisers and pesticides to encourage and protect them. Wolfe began to see that as soon as a new variety of barley was introduced, pathogens adapted to find a way to attack it; as soon as a new fungicide was formulated, the pathogen reacted by developing resistance to it. He realised that nature was always going to win the race. He was single-minded, driven, almost obsessive; his family complained that he was difficult to call away from his desk for dinner. He understood earlier than most that adding more chemicals was not a sustainable answer, and looked for different ways to grow healthy crops. He experimented with breeding varieties carrying different resistance genes. When he planted out his new varieties and mixtures, he found that infection levels fell. In the 70s, Wolfe worked with East German scientists who wanted to reduce their use of expensive foreign pesticides. By the end of the 80s, almost all their spring barley (an important crop, because the East exported malted barley to the West German brewing industry for hard currency) was being grown according to Wolfe\u2019s techniques. But when the Berlin Wall came down, they were encouraged, like other farmers in western Europe, via subsidies and promises of high yields, to use chemical fertilisers. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt like a bit of an outsider,\u201d Wolfe admitted in an interview. He was a scientist, and at first sceptical of the organic movement that emerged in the 80s, which he felt was turning back the clock. His priority was breeding new crops to tackle the environmental challenges of the future. Over the decades, Wolfe became convinced that diversity \u2013 the very thing that modern agriculture was eliminating with its herbicides and monoculture \u2013 was the key to resistance. When a pathogen attacked a genetically homogenous crop, it could wipe out a whole field. As he approached retirement, Wolfe wanted to put some of the new ideas about mixed farming practices into use. Agroforestry had begun to gain ground in the 70s when Phil Rutter, an American plant breeder, asked a big question: if nature\u2019s dominant agriculture was trees \u2013 perennials \u2013 why had man spent 10,000 years developing annual crops? Rutter was convinced that trees such as hazel and chestnut could provide as much nutrition as cereals without having to be resown every year. His motto was: \u201cThe future of the world is nuts.\u201d In 1994, Wolfe bought two meadows and a low-ceilinged long house in Suffolk called Wakelyns, which had a been a pig farm, then a dog-breeding site. Wolfe drew up elaborate plans for avenues of hazel, willow and a mixture of fruit, nut and timber trees. In the lanes in between the trees, he would grow annual crops: vegetables, cereals, legumes. Wakelyns was always imagined as an experimental agroforestry farm, \u201ca rather expensive personal hobby\u201d, as his son, David, put it, not a going concern. It soon became a centre for real research. At first, the saplings, planted in mud with protective plastic rabbit-proof sleeves, looked thin, vulnerable and unimpressive. Visiting farmers shook their heads, wondering why land was being wasted by planting trees on it. \u201cNo experiment ever fails,\u201d Wolfe liked to say. As the trees grew and projects proceeded, visitors were drawn to Wakelyns to see for themselves one of the best examples of agroforestry in Europe. Wolfe walked them through his lanes of crops, his white hair glowing like a nimbus, backlit by the sun, explaining the how the trees, with their long roots, were able to draw nutrients from deep in the soil, which the annual crops also benefited from, via fungal networks in the soil. \u201cThere is an idea that crops suffer from competition with trees,\u201d he told one interviewer, \u201cbut it is not true \u2013 they are sheltered and protected by trees.\u201d In 2000, Wolfe created a very special crop. With the help of plant breeders and the scientists from the Organic Research Centre, Wolfe took 20 varieties of wheat that had been doing well under low-input conditions in the UK, half chosen for their quality \u2013 their high protein and gluten contents \u2013 half for their high yield, and cross-bred them every which way, resulting in 190 new crosses. Normally, a breeder would look at these plants and select for the traits they wanted. But this time seeds from all 190 were thrown together in a field, grown, harvested and reseeded together for several years. Wolfe called it YQ, for \u201cyield\u201d and \u201cquality\u201d. Whereas selection ordinarily narrowed the genetic pool, as with inbreeding dogs, this method maintained it. The genetic diversity in this crop meant the wheat was not only resistant to pathogens, but also tolerant of varying growing conditions. The yield of YQ was never going to match that of high-yield wheat in a good year, but over time, Wolfe showed, its yields through wet or dry or pestilential years, when whole fields of homogenous wheat could be wiped out, were compellingly consistent. Wolfe milled his YQ grain into flour in a small electric stone mill in his barn. His wife, Ann, made cakes and pastry with it, and everyone loved its rich, nutty taste. But Wolfe had not yet found a baker who would turn it into bread. * * * Last February, I drove north to meet one of the foremost of a new generation of British artisanal bakers \u2013 Kim Bell, who started The Small Food Bakery in Nottingham five years ago and, in 2018, won a prestigious BBC Food and Farming award. I found Bell cleaning up at the end of the day. Hale, with floury hands, and her hair tied up in a cloth bandana, she gave me a bottle of house-made rhubarb kefir as she finished vacuuming the ovens. She is a proper baker \u2013 a mix of passion and exhaustion. When she finally sat down, I said: \u201cOne day you\u2019ll have someone else to do the washing up!\u201d Bell shook her head. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anyone who comes in to do menial work. We all do it ourselves.\u201d This, she explained, was deliberate, part of a policy to encourage autonomy and responsibility. She wanted each baker to be mindful of resources: energy, time and hot water. I ate one of her cinnamon buns: sticky, soft and crunchy all at once; sweet from the chestnut honey and sour from the tang of the naturally fermented dough. Every mouthful was differently delicious. Bell had gone to art school but didn\u2019t want to be an artist. For many years, she worked with her father in a contracting business, specialising in installing coffee shops and minimarkets in petrol stations. They were successful, but she found the world of mass-market retail depressing and wasteful. Bell is the kind of person who always has a dozen projects on the go and a large cast of collaborators. She was often cooking on the side, filling in at a friend\u2019s pub, catering a wedding or baking for the Women\u2019s Institute market. At one point, she got involved with helping a friend open a cafe. She also started reading Michael Pollan and Dan Barber, and discovered the US food movement linking sustainable agriculture and deliciousness. She went to listen to a talk by Andrew Whitley, the godfather of the British sourdough movement, who had opened the first organic bakery in the UK \u2013 the Village Bakery in Melmerby in Cumbria \u2013 in 1976. \u201cAndrew was selling the idea of a bread revolution where we use wild yeasts and we know where our grain comes from.\u201d Bell is a very good baker; she is also a political baker. Learning about soil depletion and disease and social justice, she was appalled, and then galvanised. \u201cIt just all came together for me: there is a problem in our food system and we need to fix it.\u201d Thoughts converged, and events conspired: a small kitchen-cafe came up for hire in an artists\u2019 co-op in Nottingham, and in 2014, Bell found herself with a space and an oven. Opening a bakery seemed an obvious way to challenge all that she felt was wrong with the industrial food system, a sourdough gauntlet to throw down in opposition to the supermarket loaf in its plastic sleeve. \u201cI flung my doors open one day with absolutely no fanfare,\u201d Bell remembered. \u201cI didn\u2019t announce it. There was no sign. I had one customer the whole day. And she was gluten intolerant.\u201d Bell had no formal baking training; she did what most new artisan bakers do: she tried to copy the Tartine Bakery in San Francisco, with its much-lauded and Instagram-famous crumb (bread\u2019s interior texture) full of big holes, and its sharply crunchy crusts. \u201cYou think flour is a stable ingredient,\u201d Bell explained to me as she opened a few bags of different flours for me to feel and taste. \u201cBut if it\u2019s done right, it\u2019s living and alive.\u201d I held some flour in my palm and saw how it clumped a little when I compressed it \u2013 the measure of its moisture. The flour I had unthinkingly always used is really only an inert powder of indefinable shelf life, whereas this kind of whole grain, containing the oils of the germ, lasts a few months before it can go rancid. Bell is one of the vanguard of bakers in the UK trying to make better flour and tastier, more satisfying loaves. Part of the taste comes from using different grains \u2013 the ancient progenitors of modern wheats, like spelt, einkorn and emmer, or cereals such as rye, buckwheat, barley and oats \u2013 and part from the lactic tang of the \u201cstarter\u201d, the natural leavening ferment made from a flour-and-water paste and ambient yeasts. When Bell first started the bakery she used organic flour from Shipton Mill, a British miller that provides high-quality blends of flour. But she wanted to understand more about the products she was using, where they came from, how they were grown; she wanted, as part of the mission and identity of the bakery, to source ingredients locally. She soon found someone who was milling organic flour in a windmill only 40 miles away. * * * After working for years in the corporate world, Paul Wyman and his wife, Fari, bought the refurbished windmill at Tuxford 14 years ago, pretty much on a whim. The learning curve was steep. Wyman had to figure out the hard way the difference between \u201cmilling wheat\u201d and \u201cfeed wheat\u201d fit for animals (it has a different protein content; a lot of bakers are used to working with higher protein contents because it creates a more open, structured crumb), and there were plenty of mechanical problems and sudden wind gusts, but, he admitted, \u201cslowly, I became a pretty good miller\u201d. His wife presides in the tea room, selling cakes and scones made with flour he has milled, to showcase how different the taste can be. (I bought two bags of his Tuxford Gold and made everything from pasta to pastry with them; the difference in quality was clear \u2013 it was richer, more complicated, more interesting.) There is something quite extraordinary about the sheer physicality of a working windmill. The big canvas sails turned as gracefully and powerful as a tall masted ship. Inside the shafts and chains and pulleys and wooden toothed gears clanked and thumped as the iron spindle revolved, running through the centre of the two heavy grinding stones. People have been grinding grain into flour in this way for thousands of years. The grain is poured into a hole in the centre of the circular mill stones. The top stone is smooth, and the bottom one carved into grooved sections. The grooves funnel the wheat to the outside of the stones, slicing each grain 20-30,000 times before it falls over the edge as fine fluffy flour. Milling in this way is a technical art. Milling at a cooler temperature allows the miller to grind a wholegrain \u2013 100% of the grain, germ and bran included \u2013 and then sift the flour, shaking through sieves of different sizes, to varying degrees. When there is still a fair bit of bran in the flour, it is called middlings (\u201chence the origin of the term \u2018fair to middling,\u2019\u201d explained Wyman). A full extraction to white flour might discard a third or more of the whole grain. Milling wholegrain preserves the grain\u2019s essential nutrients, as Stephen Jones at the Bread Lab in Washington state explained to me. \u201cA kernel of grain has 8% fibre, white flour has zero. A kernel of grain has 35-100mg of iron per kilo, white flour has close to zero.\u201d The bran is usually sold off cheap, as animal feed or potting material. Jones convenes an annual symposium, the Grain Gathering, which brings together bakers, breeders and millers from all over the world. Jones is a global leader developing new wheats and other cereals tailored to the varied needs of bakers, brewers, farmers and consumers. Recently, the Bread Lab launched a new sliced loaf developed to appeal to consumers brought up on soft and sweet American bread. Kim Bell met Jones several times at the Grain Gathering. For the past two years, she has organised a UK version, the Grain Lab, a two-day event bringing together 150 farmers, millers and bakers from 14 countries to discuss issues of marketing, transport and cost. A supermarket loaf might cost about \u00a31, a loaf from an artisanal bakery three or four times that. Inevitably, the price of sourdough has given it an elite, middle-class foodie tag. Supermarket bread sells at wafer-thin margins, and big bakeries operate on giant economies of scale; small bakeries have to contend with high rents and labour costs, expensive organic ingredients and a time-intensive process. Bakers defend the value of their loaves, their high satiety (one thick slice fills you up quite happily) and lower waste: supermarket bread is so undervalued that almost half of it is thrown away. Increasingly, we are beginning to understand the real costs of an industrialised food supply, not borne by the agro-food industry, but by the taxpayer. A study for the Sustainable Food Trust in 2017 suggested that when you have factored in the health costs of obesity and diabetes, environmental clean-up and subsidies, the real cost of our food is double what we pay for it in a shop. Bell and others are trying to put together local networks of supply, to create a new kind of grain economy; inevitably, their efforts come up against the problem of how we value benefits that we can feel, rather than count. Bell told me that the connections she makes are often personal and unexpectedly moving (for example, when farmers taste bread baked with grain they have grown for the first time). For Bell, the quality of her relationships is as important as the quality of the ingredients. * * * One day, more than three years ago, Josiah Meldrum, an organic farming activist, walked into Kim Bell\u2019s bakery with a bag of YQ flour. Meldrum, co-founder of Hodmedod\u2019s, a Norfolk company selling and championing British legumes, was a close friend of Martin Wolfe and keen to help him get bakers interested in YQ. He told Bell the story of YQ and asked her if she would try baking with it, explaining apologetically that YQ had a relatively low protein content. Most bakers would have been put off, but Bell smelled its toasty nuttiness and was intrigued. Her first efforts produced tough, dense loaves, or the dough became a puddle of unshapeable slop. Bell tried varying the proportions of starter, upped hydration levels, reduced the temperature, mixed it vigorously instead of gently. \u201cIt was just trial and error really.\u201d She wanted to bring out the flavour of the wheat. Finally, she was satisfied and had a domed loaf with a dark umber crust and a russet interior of soft, pillowy crumb that she could take to show Wolfe at Wakelyns. Bell was nervous: \u201cHe\u2019s a bit famous.\u201d But they ended up spending all day talking. \u201cHe was delighted, because he had been working on this project for 20 years and scientists were fascinated by it, but he couldn\u2019t seem to get a baker to bake with it.\u201d Bell and Wolfe recognised in each other the other half of an equation. For Bell, the YQ wheat represented \u201ceverything we had been thinking about in the bakery, diversification and decentralisation, resonated back down to the seed.\u201d Since the early 20th century, seeds that are sold commercially have had to be legally registered according to variety. In this way, buyers are protected and breeders can receive royalties on plants they have spent time and money developing. Accordingly, seeds and plant varieties must conform to certain criteria for uniformity and stability. But YQ is genetically thousands of different varieties of wheat, known as a \u201cpopulation\u201d. As such, it could not be legally registered, or traded, in Europe. When Bell fell in love with YQ and its story, Wolfe had been growing it for almost 15 years. In the US, they were continuing to develop populations, as were a few agronomists in France, Germany and Italy. But generally, these were a new, untested type of crop. Between 2007 and 2013, YQ went on a tour around Europe, to see how it would grow in different climates. The results showed that even in varying weather conditions and soils the overall yield of YQ was remarkably stable. In the meantime, Wolfe went back and forth between Brussels and Westminster to lobby for an exception to the EU regulations that would allow YQ to be sold. Finally, in 2014, he was successful, and in July 2017 YQ seed, officially called the ORC Wakelyns Population, was the first population wheat to go on sale in Europe. Bell wanted to use YQ flour at the Small Food Bakery, but she needed to find a farmer to grow it. She asked Paul Wyman at Tuxford Mill if he had any ideas. Wyman sourced a lot of his organic wheat from John and Guy Turner, who had a family farm in Lincolnshire, 40 minutes down the A1. He suggested giving them a call. The Turner brothers at Grange Farm are fourth-generation farmers with 100 hectares (250 acres). Over the decades, they had watched other small farmers around them struggle and sell up. So, in 2001, they decided to go organic. \u201cBasically, we\u2019ve been holding on by our fingertips for the last 30 years,\u201d John Turner told me. They had begun to send their wheat to Paul Wyman when they were looking for a way to sell a few tonnes of extra grain. When Bell asked if they would be interested in planting YQ the brothers said: \u201cOK. Why not?\u201d \u201cOver the winter, we weren\u2019t too sure about it at all,\u201d Guy told me. \u201cIt was quite a spindly, thin crop. But then in the spring, when the weather warmed up, it just absolutely took off. You could almost sit at the edge of the field and watch it grow.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t appreciate the diversity until you actually see it,\u201d said John. \u201cSome plants were four foot high, some two foot, some had awns [bristles], some were without, some had spikey filaments hanging off, some had square heads, chunky and robust, some were more slender.\u201d The summer of 2018 was very dry and not a good year for cereals, and YQ outperformed a lot of the conventionally grown crops in the area. Bell continued to champion YQ to other bakers and gave baking demonstrations with it at her Grain Lab. Ben Mackinnon at E5 Bakery in London Fields, which mills its own flour at its premises under a railway arch, grew up on a farm near Wakelyns, knew Wolfe (he once spent a month digging up potatoes for him) and said he would take four tonnes. Turner was delighted. The only problem was how to get the grain to London. Turner suggested he take a load on a trailer hooked up to his 4X4. He soon got lost in the narrow streets. \u201cI felt like a real hick from the sticks,\u201d he said, laughing. I said he was doing something that probably hadn\u2019t been done in 150 years: a farmer transporting his own grain into central London to be milled. When I visited E5 in April, they had almost run out of the Turner\u2019s YQ and had begun to source it from another farmer in Essex. Word had gone around, artisanal bakers were excited by the YQ story and its flavour; almost the whole 2018 crop had sold out. * * * Martin Wolfe died after a short illness in March. We had been in touch and he had invited me to come to see his farm. Two weeks after his death, his son David and Josiah Meldrum kindly met me at Wakelyns. It was a brittle spring day, bright spots of sun in a cold wind. They showed me Martin\u2019s office \u2013 a mess of papers, slides of mildewed barley leaves, a nest of wires on the floor, chainsaw parts. In the sheds and barns, there were tractors and combine harvesters and all sorts of Heath Robinson-esque machinery he had modified for his experiments. \u201cThere\u2019s not much you can\u2019t do with a Ribena bottle,\u201d David laughed, pointing to plastic bottle taped to a stick. \u201cEverything tied up with baler twine,\u201d Meldrum added. \u201cMartin would never let a good idea be stymied by not having the right equipment.\u201d And here were the avenues of trees, and between them alleys of clover and blades of green YQ. The trees were splotched with green and white and pink blossom, 40 kinds of apple, multiples of pear, plum. There were the prints of muntjac deer and hares in the mud and thrushes warbling in the hazel. We walked through a hedge and came out on to a lane as a blast of raw wind, unchecked by trees, blew into our faces. Before us was a 40-hectare expanse of wheat on the neighbouring farm, as evenly green as a billiard table. The contrast between the variegated beauty of Wakelyns agroforestry and this conventionally farmed field could not have been more stark. We are only beginning to understand the importance of diversity and the complex systems that plants \u2013 and animals, and us \u2013 need to thrive. In an interview, Martin Wolfe once argued that value should be accounted not just according to the cash received for a crop, but to the effect of the plants on the soil and carbon sequestration, and wider effects \u201con mood, on beauty, on community\u201d. The story of YQ spins a narrative from soil health to grain resistance to nutritious flour to tasty bread, and it also describes a group of people working together to create a local food network that nourishes a community. \u201cMartin was always full of crazy ideas,\u201d said his son. We walked to the end of a grassy meadow. His wife Ann\u2019s grave was marked with a simple stone among stands of daffodils. In April, Martin was buried next to her. As a result of his lobbying, YQ wheat will receive legal status to be traded from the EU in 2021. Before he died, Bell told me: \u201cI\u2019m buoyed by Martin. Last year he said to me: \u2018Kim, it\u2019s happening, I\u2019m seeing it for the first time in my life. It\u2019s going to come. Things are changing.\u2019\u201d \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 October 2019 because an earlier version said genetically modified wheat was grown in the US.

      "bodyText": "If Donald Trump could count on anyone for sympathy as his impeachment troubles mount, you\u2019d think it would be loyalists of the last Republican president to be charged with abusing the power of the Oval Office for political ends. Yet, in the two weeks since the House of Representatives started formally investigating the president, veterans of the Nixon administration have been notable only for their silence. In fact, they have been about as willing to answer questions about impeachment now as they were when they were being dragged before House and Senate investigative committees at the height of the Watergate scandal. The main keeper of the 37th president\u2019s flame, the Richard Nixon Foundation, offered not one word for or against Trump when approached. A post-presidential chief of staff told the Guardian he was \u201cpretty much focused elsewhere\u201d. A former domestic policy aide who served on Nixon\u2019s legal defense team refused to speak on the record \u2013 even though he writes regular, highly opinionated pieces for conservative outlets that touch on impeachment, whistleblowers, special prosecutors and more. An outspoken former Nixon speechwriter, Bruce Herschensohn, declared in an email: \u201cI believe in saving the possibility of impeachment for impeachable offenses as defined by the U.S. Founders and authors of the U.S. Constitution.\u201d When asked, however, whether the allegation against Trump, subverting national security policy to search for dirt on his enemies, might constitute just such an impeachable offense, Herschensohn went silent. Such skittishness is more bad news for Trump, since the Republican party as a whole is showing reluctance to speak up in his defense and, on the issue of withdrawing support from Kurds in Syria, a willingness to be openly critical. The Nixon crowd can generally be counted on to be good Republican partisans, not least because the foundation, among others, relies on the party base to make donations, buy tickets to events, and otherwise contribute to the furtherance of Nixon\u2019s memory. Recent invitees to foundation events in Yorba Linda, California, where Nixon was born, include the Fox News hosts Jeanine Pirro and Bret Baier, the former House speaker Newt Gingrich, and Trump\u2019s first supreme court appointee, Neil Gorsuch. The Trump presidency, though, poses a number of challenges to the Nixonian worldview. Nixon, unlike Trump, was a firm believer in international alliances and treaties, and for all his willingness to lean on the FBI and the IRS to do his political bidding domestically he never \u2013 at least as president \u2013 sought to extract political favors from overseas allies or client states. Some of that ambivalence was expressed by Bob Bostock, a post-presidential Nixon staffer who put together a sympathetic account of the Watergate scandal for display at the Nixon Presidential Library in the days when it was still controlled by loyalists. (The library was taken over by the National Archives in 2007 and the display subsequently replaced.) \u201cI don\u2019t believe for a second that Nixon committed an impeachable offense,\u201d Bostock said. \u201cI don\u2019t think President Clinton committed an impeachable offense. Andrew Johnson certainly didn\u2019t. With respect to Trump \u2013 it\u2019s way too early.\u201d Bostock, a lifelong Republican, complained about the bitter partisan atmosphere in Washington and said he suspected impeachment was just another form of cross-party political warfare. But he also acknowledged that goading foreign countries into interfering in US elections was not acceptable. Whether Trump had done such a thing \u201cremains an open question\u201d, he said.

And for many Nixonians, that\u2019s a bridge too far.\u201d The Russia investigation was much more comfortable territory, because they could draw parallels between James Comey, the whistle-blowing former FBI director, and John Dean, Nixon\u2019s White House counsel who ended up testifying against him, and because they could issue general denunciations of special prosecutors past and present to whom they find it much easier to attach the \u201cabuse of power\u201d label. In their retelling, hotly contested by less partisan historians, Dean was the true architect of the Watergate cover-up and Nixon got trapped in Dean\u2019s net only because he wanted to stand by his aides and supporters. Geoff Shepard, the former domestic policy aide to Nixon who would not talk on the record, recently cited a line from a mafioso to encapsulate his and his fellow loyalists\u2019 thorough-going loathing for Dean: \u201cThat guy would steal the silver dollars off his dead mother\u2019s eyes.\u201d A more mainstream view of Dean would cast him as a whistleblower who, like many other whistleblowers before and since, inspires strong feelings of anger and betrayal in those he turned against.

A total of 21 Rohingya face up to two years in jail under Myanmar\u2019s Residents of Burma Registration Act, which stipulates that citizens must be in possession of \u201cregistration cards\u201d to prove their identity. The act has been used against Myanmar\u2019s Rohingya Muslim minority, who are denied citizenship of the country and are officially stateless. Nine children travelling as part of the group were sent to juvenile detention centres. A five-year-old boy\u2019s fate is yet to be decided, activists said. Authorities told Radio Free Asia that the Rohingya, having left villages in Rakhine state where they reportedly faced violence and ethnic cleansing, were attempting to reach Malaysia. They allegedly paid traffickers between 500,000 and 700,000 kyats (\u00a3270-\u00a3380) to transport them to Yangon, where they hoped to find work or passage out of Myanmar. \u201cIt\u2019s a cruel irony that these Rohingya will be trading what was effectively confinement to open-air detention in Rakhinestate for confinement in a state prison in Pathein,\u201d said Brad Adams, executive director at Human Rights Watch (HRW). The Rohingya have faced waves of persecution in Myanmar. In 2017, amid alleged mass slaughter and arson attacks in their villages, more than 700,000 Rohingya fled to neighbouring Bangladesh, settling in refugee camps near the border. Within Myanmar, Rohingya are prohibited from travelling outside certain areas without official permission. Myanmar considers Rohingya people illegal Bangladeshi immigrants and denies them access to basic services and rights. Phil Robertson, deputy director of HRW\u2019s Asia division, said many Rohingya remaining in Rakhine state live in virtual imprisonment, with daily life subject to multiple restrictions such as limited access to money and jobs, constant monitoring by police and violent vigilantism. \u201cIt\u2019s like apartheid,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrific situation that has gone unnoticed by the world.\u201d Human rights organisations have warned repeatedly that ongoing negotiations between Bangladesh and Myanmar about returning Rohingya refugees could lead to further persecution, especially because Myanmar continues to deny Rohingya Muslims citizenship. Adam said the imprisonment of Rohingya trying to leave the country \u201cstands as a clear marker to the United Nations and foreign governments encouraging the return of Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh that Myanmar has no interest in granting its Rohingya population fundamental freedoms\u201d. The jailed Rohingya said that they had initially set out as a group of 44 from Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine state, where they lived in townships. But their group shrunk after authorities stopped them at a jetty. The decision to jail them came after a one-day trial at which the Rohingya were denied legal representation, said HRW. Tin Hlaing, a Muslim from Thae Chaung village, who according to Radio Free Asia had tried to stop the group from travelling, said the families of the imprisoned group were \u201cgravely concerned\u201d about their safety. \u201cThey are going through various hardships with a scarcity of job opportunities and restrictions on their movements,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t accept our suggestions because they felt the pressure of their hardship and joblessness.\u201d",

Hooded youths threw stones and burned tires as police fired tear gas around the empty parliament building which had been sealed off. Demonstrators also tried unsuccessfully to storm barricades around the presidential palace, which the president, Len\u00edn Moreno, left on Monday, moving his government to the port city of Guayaquil. Other groups including labour unions and indigenous federations marched, for the most part peacefully, on the first day of a national strike which leaders say will not end until the government repeals a decree scrapping fuel subsidies which caused the price of petrol to spike by a third and the cost of diesel to more than double. Moreno\u2019s government lifted the petrol and diesel subsidies last Tuesday as part of a $4.2bn loan deal with the International Monetary Fund reached last year that hinges on belt-tightening reforms. According to the government the payments had cost the country close to $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) annually, according to official sources. Outside Quito\u2019s parliament building, thousands of indigenous Ecuadoreans camped out on the grass, many of them carrying sticks. Through loudspeakers, leaders of different indigenous groups addressed the crowd. \u201cWhat the government has done is reward the big banks, the capitalists, and punish poor Ecuadorians,\u201d said Mes\u00edas Tatamuez, head of the Workers\u2019 United Front umbrella union. Indigenous protests have played a central role in toppling a string of Ecuador\u2019s presidents, including Abdal\u00e1 Bucaram in 1997, Jamil Mahuad in 2000 and Lucio Guti\u00e9rrez in 2005. Jaime Vargas, the leader of the Ecuador\u2019s indigenous confederation Conaie, said there would be no dialogue until the government rolled back its order ending the subsidies. \u201cIf it is repealed the people will then decide if we will talk or not, but we are angry because we have several injured, several detained and several dead, and this will not stand.\u201d Across the country, two people have died in the unrest, dozens more have been injured and more than 570 have been detained, according to official sources. One demonstrator who wanted to remain anonymous said she had been among more than 100 protesters held by police in the basement of the parliament after a foiled attempt by protesters to take over the building on Monday. \u201cThey treated us badly, they insulted us. There are children and young people who are suffering terribly, young people who are being subjugated,\u201d she said. Amnesty International called on the Ecuadorean government to end to \u201cthe heavy-handed repression of demonstrations, including mass detentions\u201d. \u201cThe state of emergency cannot be an excuse to violently repress people\u2019s discontent over economic measures that may put their rights at risk,\u201d said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. Ecuador\u2019s defence minister, Oswaldo Jarr\u00edn, said the army was seeking to \u201crestore, order, peace and tranquility\u201d on Wednesday as widespread protests took place across the country. Moreno, 66, has accused political opponents of orchestrating an attempted coup and claimed associates of his predecessor Rafael Correa \u2013 a former ally turned bitter enemy \u2013 were infiltrating the protests and stoking unrest. \u201cThey are sectors who are taking advantage of the situation to generate an atmosphere of chaos in Ecuador, very different behaviour from a country which has seen other social protests,\u201d Mar\u00eda Paula Romo, the interior minister, said on Wednesday. Correa, who governed Ecuador for a decade, has brushed off the claim he was behind the protest but called for Moreno to step down and for new elections in which he might consider being a candidate. Protest leader Lourdes Tib\u00e1n, a former parliamentarian, said the violence had been caused by \u201cinfiltrators who want to show that the indigenous activists are criminals and thieves who causes damage \u2013 but that\u2019s not true\u201d. She said the vast majority of protesters were marching because the fuel price hike had inflated food and transport prices and the indigenous people were the hardest hit. \u201cRafael Correa does not have the moral authority to praise this protest when he criminalised social protest for us,\u201d she said. Street vendor Carmen Jaque, 50, who had marched to the capital from the Andean province of Chimborazo, said: \u201cWe, the people, are marching here, not infiltrators. We\u2019re the ones feeling the price rises.\u201d Moreno was elected in 2017 as the candidate for Correa\u2019s centre-left party but has since moved to the right. Though he enjoys the support of business and the military, Moreno\u2019s popularity has sunk to under 30%, compared with 70% in 2017.",

On Thursday frontbench MP Matt Keogh gave qualified support for a deal on an emissions reduction target for this term of government, suggesting Labor could then reassess ahead of the next election depending on how successful the Coalition was at reducing emissions by 2022. \u201cIf you provide that certainty now about where we are aiming over this term of government, then the approach we take at the next election will be based on how successful the government has been on the government\u2019s own policy as opposed to having competing policies over the course of this term,\u201d Keogh told the Australian. \u201cLet\u2019s not get in the way and continue to haggle with them for the next two and a half years.\u201d Fitzgibbon said emissions had grown every year for the past four years, but the prime minister, Scott Morrison, \u201cdeflects questions about that by talking ad nauseam about Labor\u2019s more ambitious targets\u201d. \u201cSo I say, let\u2019s pull back \u2026 Let\u2019s put the pressure on him to turn them around \u2026 to fulfil his Paris commitments \u2026 and in three years, it would leave us in a better place to build on something more ambitious,\u201d he told Sky News. Butler told Guardian Australia Labor remained committed to implementing the principles of the Paris agreement, to keep global warming well below 2C and pursue efforts around 1.5C. \u201cWe will have a mid-century target of zero emissions and medium-term targets which are consistent with the agreement \u2013 and the government\u2019s target, which was developed by Tony Abbott with no expert advice, is fundamentally inconsistent with the Paris agreement,\u201d he said.",

Hagibis earned super status \u2013 the most severe category \u2013 after winds passed the 150mph threshold, peaking at 180mph. It is far larger than Typhoon Faxai which \u2013 on the day of England\u2019s arrival for the World Cup \u2013 brought Tokyo to a standstill, killing three people and leaving a million homes without power. Hagibis is weakening, but its power remains destructive.</p>\n      <p><b>How did it grow so fierce?&nbsp;</b>US Navy meteorologist Robert Speta told the Japan Times the storm had gone through an 'explosive intensification in a matter of hours', adding: 'In fact it was an historic amount of intensification in such a short time. This only happens when all the right ingredients are in place. Like if you had a fire and instead of throwing gasoline on it to make it bigger you also grabbed some lighter fluid, a bit of oil and a couple of aerosol cans for good measure.'</p>\n      <p><b>What are those ingredients?&nbsp;</b>Warm sea temperature, high humidity, Coriolis force, low wind shear and atmospheric instability.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p><b>Which games are affected?&nbsp;</b>Besides the Pool C decider in Yokohama on Saturday, Scotland\u2019s match with Japan at the same venue 24 hours later. Ireland\u2019s Pool A game against Samoa on Saturday and Wales\u2019s Pool&nbsp;D match with Uruguay on Sunday are on the other side of Japan, so likely out of the storm\u2019s main path.

      "bodyText": "World Rugby has announced the cancellation of two matches this weekend, due to the impact of Super Typhoon Hagibis. The England v France and New Zealand v Italy matches will be cancelled. Scotland\u2019s fate still hangs in the balance after tournament organisers said they would wait until Sunday morning to decide if the Scots\u2019 final and decisive pool match against Japan would go ahead that evening. For matches that do not go ahead as scheduled, two points will be awarded to each team in line with tournament rules. Tournament director, Alan Gilpin, said Scotland, who would need a strong victory over Japan in order to make it through the group stage, would not be given special treatment. \u201cItaly are in exactly the same position Scotland are in,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t be treating that match, if it can\u2019t be played, any differently.\u201d Gilpin said the decisions had not been made lightly, but that safety was the organisers number one concern. \u201cWhile making every possible effort to put in place a contingency plan that would enable all of Saturday\u2019s matches to be played, it would be grossly irresponsible to leave teams, fans, volunteers and other tournament personnel exposed during what is predicted to be a severe typhoon,\u201d he said. A spokesman for Scottish Rugby said: \u201cWith potential impact on our last Pool A fixture, Scottish Rugby fully expects contingency plans to be put in place to enable Scotland to contest for a place in the quarter-finals, and will be flexible to accommodate this.\u201d Super Typhoon Hagibis is predicted to be one of the most violent typhoons in recent history. If it makes landfall in Japan as it is predicted to on Saturday, it could cause huge damage and potential casualties. Eddie Jones said he will take his England squad down to Miyazaki for the weekend to train away from the storm before relocating to Oita early next week. England Rugby is holding a press conference Head coach Eddie Jones says everyone is \u201cdisappointed\u201d about the cancellation of their upcoming match against France but they \u201chave no issue\u201d with Rugby World Cup\u2019s decision to cancel the game. My colleague Rob Kitson is at the same presser: \u201cJones says is taking his squad down to Miyazaki for the weekend to train away from the storm before relocating to Oita early next week. He says he does not want to get involved in the ins and outs of whether the tournament organisers could have reacted differently.\u201d Andy Burke from BBC Scotland has a statement from Scottish Rugby. A spokesman for Scottish Rugby said: \u201cWith potential impact on our last Pool A fixture, Scottish Rugby fully expects contingency plans to be put in place to enable Scotland to contest for a place in the quarter-finals, and will be flexible to accommodate this.\u201d Reaction from France Rugby, which (for those who don\u2019t parlent francais) roughly translates to: The match between France and England on Saturday is cancelled, security is more important than anything, we encourage fans to follow all security advice. \u201cSupporters, fans, we want to also extend our full support. The disappointment is shared.\u201d A reminder of the stakes from Duncan Smith, sportswriter for The Scotsman publications and the i. In line with his tweet, there was a lot of emphasis on safety from the RWC officials at the press conference. We are increasing our commitment to New Zealand readers by offering more stories every day about the key issues in New Zealand. We couldn\u2019t do this without the support of our generous readers. If you are a supporter, thank you. If you haven\u2019t yet contributed, please consider supporting our independent journalism. And the press conference has ended. Alan Gilpin is answering a question about why the cancelled matches couldn\u2019t have been moved to stadia that were used in previous games and the reporter wonders if this is because some stadia have been de-rigged and no longer have any branding visible. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a question of whether they\u2019d been de-rigged, they just weren\u2019t an option to us,\u201d says Gilpin, who adds that given the size of the typhoon\u2019s potential zone of impact, there were very few stadia that could be used safely. He is now being asked if \u201cin hindsight\u201d they should have built more flexibility into the scedule. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. The schedule for RWC is a complex beast - 40 pool matches in four weeks,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is very little flexibility in the RWC match schedule, that\u2019s why the tournament rules are as they are, we have some different opportunities in case of something similar in the knockout round.\u201d After extensive evaluation, World Rugby and the Japan Rugby 2019 Organising Committee have announced an update regarding the predicted impact of Typhoon Hagibis on this weekend\u2019s Rugby World Cup 2019 pool matches. This includes the decision to cancel matches on safety grounds. Based on the latest detailed information from the tournament\u2019s independent weather experts, Hagibis is predicted to be the biggest typhoon of the 2019 season and is highly likely to cause considerable disruption in the Tokyo, Yokohama and City of Toyota areas throughout Saturday, including likely public transport shutdown or disruption. As a result, World Rugby and the Japan Rugby 2019 Organising Committee have taken the difficult, but right decision to cancel matches in the affected areas on safety grounds. The impacted teams have been informed and are understanding. For matches that do not go ahead as scheduled, two points will be awarded to each team in line with tournament rules. It is an exceptional, complex and rapidly evolving situation and team and public safety is the number one priority. This has been central in all decision-making in partnership with the tournament\u2019s weather information experts, host cities, venues and teams. Based on the latest detailed weather information, the following update is provided: Friday, 11 October Pool D match between Australia and Georgia in Shizuoka at 19:15 JST to be played as scheduled Saturday, 12 October Pool A match between Ireland and Samoa in Fukuoka at 19:45 JST to be played as scheduled Pool B match between New Zealand and Italy to be cancelled Pool C match between England and France to be cancelled The decision to cancel matches has not been taken lightly and has been made in the best interests of public, team, tournament personnel and volunteer safety, based on expert advice and detailed weather information. While we have extensively explored all options, public and team safety was our utmost priority as well as ensuring a consistent, fair and equitable outcome for all teams. All fans with tickets for a cancelled match will receive a full refund for the face value of their match tickets. Sunday, 13 October Every effort is being made to ensure Sunday\u2019s matches will be played as scheduled. A thorough assessment of venues will take place after the typhoon has passed before a final decision is made on Sunday morning. Based on the advice of government authorities and experts, World Rugby and the Japan Rugby 2019 Organising Committee are advising fans in the Tokyo, Yokohama and City of Toyota areas to stay indoors on Saturday, not to travel and to keep monitoring the official Rugby World Cup 2019 digital and social channels, including the RWC 2019 Fan Information Twitter handle @Japan2019_ENG for regular updates. World Rugby Chief Operating Officer and Tournament Director Alan Gilpin said when addressing the media: \u201cThis is a complex and dynamic situation which we have been monitoring extremely closely with the assistance of our weather information experts. We are now in a position to accurately predict the likely impact of Typhoon Hagibis on Rugby World Cup fixtures this weekend. \u201cWhile making every possible effort to put in place a contingency plan that would enable all of Saturday\u2019s matches to be played, it would be grossly irresponsible to leave teams, fans, volunteers and other tournament personnel exposed during what is predicted to be a severe typhoon. \u201cAs a result, we have taken the decision to cancel some matches in order to ensure the safety of all involved. It is the right thing to do, and comes with the support of all stakeholders, including the teams. \u201cWe fully appreciate that England, France, New Zealand and Italy fans will be disappointed, but we trust they will appreciate that their safety must come first. They will be entitled to a full refund on their match tickets. \u201cOur message for all fans in Japan for Rugby World Cup is to heed all official advice, stay indoors throughout Saturday and do not attempt to travel on the day.\u201d Scotland match won\u2019t be given special treatment, says Alan Gilpin Alan Gilpin has been asked about the Scotland match, which is slated for Sunday and has not yet been cancelled, with Gilpin saying RWC would make a decision about the game on Sunday morning after reviewing weather conditions. The reporter asks if conditions mean it can\u2019t be played on Sunday, whether RWC might consider moving the match to a different venue, or delaying to a difference day, given the significance of the match and the fact it is effectively a knockout match for Scotland, Gilpin says they have been striving for consistency with their contingency policy. \u201cItaly are in exactly the same position Scotland are in,\u201d says Gilpin. He says that while Scotland v Japan is a \u201chuge match\u201d and they\u2019d obviously love it to go ahead \u201cWe won\u2019t be treating that match, if it can\u2019t be played, any differently.\u201d Alan Gilpin has been asked if Rugby World Cup has any regrets in light of these cancellations. \u201cNo regrets at all,\u201d he says. \u201cI think what you\u2019ve all seen over the last three weeks, absolutely in all respects vindicates the decision to hold the tournament here in Japan. \u201cIt\u2019s rare for a typhoon of this magnitude to cause these impacts this late in the typhoon season. \u201cWe\u2019ve made the right decision.\u201d Scotland\u2019s World Cup is still in doubt after tournament organisers said on Thursday they would wait until Sunday morning to decide if the Scots\u2019 final and decisive pool match against Japan would go ahead that evening, as large parts of the country await the arrival of one of the most powerful typhoons in decades. England and France, however, will not play in Yokohama on Saturday evening, with World Rugby and tournament organisers taking the unprecedented step of cancelling their match. Both teams have qualified for the quarterfinals with a game to spare. Tournament director Alan Gilpin told reporters that \u201cafter extensive evaluation of weather information\u201d organisers had decided to take the unprecedented step of cancelling matches between New Zealand and Italy and England v France. The matches will be treated as a 0-0 draws and each time awarded two points. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken the very difficult but we think right decision to cancel matches,\u201d Gilpin said, adding that Australia v Georgia and Ireland v Ireland Samoa would go ahead. \u201cThe decision to cancel these matches has not been taken lightly and had been taken with the safety of players, supporters, and volunteers\u2019 safety as a priority,\u201d Gilpin said. He said the risks were \u201ctoo challenging\u201d to deliver a fair and consistent approach for all teams and ensure the safety of spectators. Fans with tickets for the two cancelled matches will receive a refund. Gilpin says that RWC is issuing advice to all rubgby fans in the Tokyo and Yokohama areas \u201cto stay indoors, not to travel and to monitor Rugby World Cup through digital and social channels\u201d. Alan Gilpin is running through a list of the matches from this weekend and the impact the typhoon will have on them: Australia v Georgia will go ahead. Ireland v Samoa will go ahead. New Zealand v Italy will be cancelled. England v France will be cancelled. Unless I missed it, he did not say what will happen with the Japan v Scotland game. Alan Gilpin, head of the Rugby World Cup, is speaking now. He says they are \u201cConfirming adjustments to match schedule\u201d as a result of the predicted impact of Hagibis. Which includes \u201cregrettably the decision to cancel matches on safety grounds\u201d. Officials are arriving and taking their seats on the podium. Cue the mad shuttering of cameras. Ooh, we have someone speaking. They\u2019re just issuing housekeeping notices \u2013 about translation, asking people to raise their hands, identify themselves and to speak slowly for translators. We have a livestream of the press conference (which is also embedded at the top of this blog), though as you will see, nothing is happening and we are waiting for officials, including Mick Wright, Alan Gilpin, Akira Shimasu, and Koji Horluchi to arrive. Our rugby union correspondent Rob Kitson is there and says: \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of interest from all over the world, as you would expect. Clearly it is an extreme weather situation but World Rugby is under a bit of pressure to clarify a number of issues, not least precisely how many games the organisers are still looking to reschedule. If Scotland v Japan does not happen for any reason there will be a major row; England, meanwhile, are understood to be relocating to a new base away from Tokyo today to avoid the approaching typhoon.\u201d Our rugby union correspondent Gerard Meagher explains what is going on and what it might mean for the tournament: World Rugby may be forced into taking the unprecedented step of cancelling Saturday\u2019s Pool C match between England and France as well as Scotland\u2019s crucial fixture with Japan 24 hours later as the category five super typhoon heads for Yokohama. Both matches were among the most in-demand when tickets went on sale. Any games cancelled due to weather problems are registered as scoreless draws, with both sides awarded two points. While England and France have already qualified for the quarter-finals, it could have huge consequences for Scotland\u2019s Pool A game with the hosts, which also takes place at Yokohama\u2019s 72,000-seater stadium. If that match is cancelled Scotland would be eliminated, assuming Ireland beat Samoa on Saturday. One of World Rugby\u2019s contingency plans is to move both matches to other venues but that would cause havoc for more than 140,000 supporters across the weekend and prove a huge logistical headache for tournament organisers. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of today\u2019s Rugby World Cup weather-related drama. World Rugby is set to hold a press conference, announcing a decision on whether Super Typhoon Hagibis will prompt some of this weekend\u2019s matches to be cancelled or moved. Japan is awaiting updates on the progress of one of the most violent super typhoons in recent history, which, if it makes landfall in Japan as it is predicted to on Saturday, could cause huge damage and potential casualties. Rugby fans are watching the progress of the typhoon carefully, for its impact on the World Cup. Two crucial matches face cancellation or disruptive last-minute shifts to new venue due to Hagibis. Scotland are scheduled to play Japan at the 72,000-seater Yokohama Stadium on Sunday, and England are scheduled to play France at the same venue on Saturday. Both matches were among the most in-demand when tickets went on sale. The stakes are highest for the Scots, who would be eliminated if their match against Japan were to be cancelled, assuming that Ireland beat Samoa in Fukuoka on Saturday. World Rugby and World Cup organisers are due to hold a press conference at noon local time on Thursday (4am BST, 2pm AEDT). Our Japan correspondent Justin McCurry is on the ground at the press conference, to bring us news from it. Our stellar Rugby World Cup team is also on hand to provide analysis of and reaction to whatever announcement is made today. Thanks for following along. If you have questions, comments, witty repartee, or are a ticket-holder for one of these matches and have thoughts to share, please get in touch via the comments, email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com) or on Twitter. I want to hear from you. Otherwise, let\u2019s crack on.",

prime minister said the government was \u201cdeeply troubled by Turkey\u2019s unilateral military operation\u201d into north-eastern Syria.</p> <p>\u201cActions of this nature will have grave consequences for regional security and could significantly undermine the gains made by the international coalition in its fight against Da\u2019esh, which remains a serious threat to regional peace

humanitarian access.</p> <p>\u201cWhile Turkey has legitimate domestic security concerns, unilateral cross-border military action will not solve these concerns.</p> <p>\u201cWe have expressed this view directly to the Turkish government.\u201d</p> <p>The statement also acknowledged the work <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/kurds\">Kurdish fighters</a> had done in fighting the terrorist group as partners of the international coalition, having \u201cborne a significant share of the sacrifice\u201d, as well as the security support the Syrian Democratic Forces had provided at prisons and displaced peoples camps.</p> <p>In a press conference on Thursday afternoon, Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong made deliberate mention of the United States\u2019 decision to withdraw troops.</p> <p>While Wong echoed Morrison and Payne\u2019s views on Turkey, she cited the reaction of senior Republican senator Lindsey Graham, a noted Trump supporter, who said it would lead to the re-emergence of Isis, as well as the criticism from former US military commanders, in singling out the responsibility of the United States.</p> <p>\u201cWe are concerned regarding the consequences of this decision by the Trump administration,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThe Australian government should express these concerns.</p> <p>\u201cAmongst the greater strengths the United States has with its network of alliances, and through credibility and reliability are critical to that strength.

      "bodyText": "Less than 24 hours after standing by Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US military troops from northern Syria, Scott Morrison says he has \u201cdeep concerns\u201d Turkey\u2019s incursion into the area will lead to the resurgence of the terrorist group Islamic State. On Wednesday, the Australian prime minister was a minority voice on a decision which has been roundly condemned by the international community and the US president\u2019s own political allies, telling reporters he believed there to be \u201can element of consistency\u201d in Trump\u2019s actions. Trump had spoken of his intent to withdraw US troops from the area a year ago, but was reportedly talked out of acting. But with Turkey having taken the US withdrawal as an opportunity to attack north eastern Syria with both an air and land offensive against the Kurdish military \u2013 which had been the west\u2019s ally in fighting back and defeating Isis \u2013 Morrison said he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d Da\u2019esh (Isis) could take back territory it had been driven from. \u201cAnd that is a concern that has been expressed by Australia and by many others,\u201d Morrison said, adding Australia was conveying its message through \u201call its diplomatic channels\u201d. \u201cThat is what we have expressed directly to our partners and our allies and certainly to the Turkish government.\u201d But Morrison said Australia\u2019s concerns rested with Turkey\u2019s actions, not the United States. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear \u2013 it is the Turkish government that is taking action here to create an unstable situation,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who are actually deploying and seeking to walk across the border and to take actions in another nation state. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cIt is the actions of the Turkish government that concerns Australia very seriously.\u201d In a joint statement with the foreign minister, Marise Payne, released after his Thursday morning press conference, the prime minister said the government was \u201cdeeply troubled by Turkey\u2019s unilateral military operation\u201d into north-eastern Syria. \u201cActions of this nature will have grave consequences for regional security and could significantly undermine the gains made by the international coalition in its fight against Da\u2019esh, which remains a serious threat to regional peace and security despite its territorial defeat,\u201d the statement read. \u201cIt will cause additional civilian suffering, lead to greater population displacement, and further inhibit humanitarian access. \u201cWhile Turkey has legitimate domestic security concerns, unilateral cross-border military action will not solve these concerns. \u201cWe have expressed this view directly to the Turkish government.\u201d The statement also acknowledged the work Kurdish fighters had done in fighting the terrorist group as partners of the international coalition, having \u201cborne a significant share of the sacrifice\u201d, as well as the security support the Syrian Democratic Forces had provided at prisons and displaced peoples camps. In a press conference on Thursday afternoon, Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong made deliberate mention of the United States\u2019 decision to withdraw troops. While Wong echoed Morrison and Payne\u2019s views on Turkey, she cited the reaction of senior Republican senator Lindsey Graham, a noted Trump supporter, who said it would lead to the re-emergence of Isis, as well as the criticism from former US military commanders, in singling out the responsibility of the United States. \u201cWe are concerned regarding the consequences of this decision by the Trump administration,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Australian government should express these concerns. \u201cAmongst the greater strengths the United States has with its network of alliances, and through credibility and reliability are critical to that strength. I also note that Kurdish fighters were the backbone of the fight against Da\u2019esh.\u201d The Syrian Democratic Forces estimates at least 11,000 of its members were killed in the past five years. Meanwhile, the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said Australia would not be moving to extract Australian women and children who fled to the al-Hawl refugee camp, after Isis\u2019s defeat. The site is reportedly under threat, after Kurdish soldiers guarding it and its surrounds moved to defend against the Turkish incursion at the border. The government has stripped at least three more dual citizens of their Australian citizenship after they travelled to Syria to join with Isis fighters, including Zehra Duman, who left the country as a teenager to marry an Islamic State member. There are concerns her two children had been left stateless by the decision. Morrison said his advice was the citizenship status of her children were not impacted by her own citizenship cancellation. Dutton says there would be no emergency extraction of Australians trapped in the camp, despite the shifting situation. \u201cI don\u2019t think it should come as any surprise to people when we say that we\u2019re not going to send our soldiers or our staff through the foreign affairs department or my department into harm\u2019s way to rescue people of this nature,\u201d he told Sydney radio station 2GB. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at individual cases, and in some cases it may make sense for us to intervene but in the majority of cases I think people realise that if you go into a war zone, and you take your kids into a war zone, that\u2019s a decision you\u2019ve made as a parent. \u201cThe fact that you made a decision to destroy the lives of your children, that\u2019s something you\u2019ll have to live with, but my job is to protect kids back here and make sure that Australians are as safe as possible.\u201d Morrison and Payne backed Dutton\u2019s stance. \u201cThe full implications of the Turkish military operation on these camps and the people residing in them are difficult to assess at this early stage and will depend, in part, on subsequent actions taken by Turkey and the Kurds,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cThe government remains concerned for the Australians in these camps but, as we have previously stated, the situation is dangerous and unpredictable, and we will not put Australian officials and the public in danger.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Kurdish Australians say they fear for family members in northern Syria, and for the future of their people, following Turkish airstrikes, artillery bombardment and military invasion of Kurdish-dominated cities and villages. Following the sudden withdrawal of US troops from the Kurdish-controlled areas of north-eastern Syria \u2013 known as Rojava \u2013 Turkey has begun a long-threatened assault on Kurdish centres. The Turkish military \u201claunched the land operation into the east of the Euphrates River\u201d on Wednesday, later claiming to have hit 181 \u201cmilitant targets\u201d. Video footage showed civilians fleeing towns with columns of smoke rising in the background and jet trails visible in the sky. Observers reported at least seven civilians had been killed. The president of the Kurdish Lobby Australia, Eziz Bawermend, said Kurds in Australia felt their people had been abandoned not only by long-standing ally the US, but also by the broader global community. \u201cIt\u2019s a feeling of horror, if you like, we feel abandoned, we feel despondent and totally hopeless. I spoke with several people on both sides of the [Turkish-Syrian] border, and it\u2019s the same feeling: does the world care? Will anything happen?

Herki said there was barely a Kurdish family in Australia that had not lost someone to the violence of the region over the past five years, and said many now feared further deaths from the Turkish incursion and from a resurgent Isis in the chaos expected to follow. \u201cPeople say they are stranded in fear, the land is very flat, and people fear when the bombs will come. \u201cMany houses, many buildings have been destroyed.

But the council was not expected to strongly condemn Ankara\u2019s actions, given tacit Russian support and US ambivalence.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s national census should be updated to give an accurate picture of ethnic diversity and help identify the population\u2019s untapped potential, the shadow minister for multiculturalism has said. Labor MP Andrew Giles also hit out at the Coalition government for failing to condemn former Liberal leaders Tony Abbott and Alexander Downer for seeking to \u201cundermine multiculturalism\u201d in recent speeches. Speaking at a national conference of ethnic community councils in Hobart on Thursday, Giles linked sketchy population data to Australia\u2019s lack of diversity in public- and private-sector leadership. Giles has called for the next census, in 2021, to include questions on race and ethnicity to inform better policy, describing Australia\u2019s data collection practices as \u201crelatively poor\u201d in a letter to the head of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. \u201cAt the moment our data is largely limited to ancestry, language, and place of birth. By contrast New Zealand, Canada and the United States all question ethnicity or race in their respective censuses,\u201d he wrote to ABS chief David Kalisch. \u201cWhile in the United Kingdom authorities have produced a Race Disparity Audit, which looked at the treatment of people from different backgrounds across education, employment and the criminal justice system.\u201d In the UK\u2019s 2011 census, respondents were asked their ethnicity within specific categories including white; mixed or multiple ethnicities; Asian or Asian British; Black, African, Caribbean, or Black British; and other ethnic groups. In the US and New Zealand there are similar breakdowns designed around the nations\u2019 histories, including ethnicities within \u201cwhite \u201c categories, as well as Indigenous backgrounds and Pasifika in New Zealand. The Australian census asks about ancestry, allowing respondents up to two entries. But Tim Soutphommasane, the former race commissioner at the Australian Human Rights Commission, said the data did not reveal anything meaningful about the ethnic composition of the population. \u201c[The commission] did model this \u2013 using the 2016 census \u2013 to get a more meaningful picture of what we look like as a country, and based on that we believe that close to a quarter of the Australian population has a non-European or Indigenous background \u2026 but we can\u2019t say that with any certainty,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a clear picture at the moment of some of the disadvantages or barriers that may exist for those from non-white or non-European backgrounds in particular.\u201d He suggested categories which reflected the waves of changes in Australia\u2019s population, beginning with First Australians, then the Anglo-Celtic arrivals from 1788, the post-war European influx, and the non-European migration after the end of the White Australia policy. \u201cThe kind of situation we\u2019re in is that we\u2019re often celebrated as multicultural success story, but we can\u2019t have a sophisticated conversation about the ethnicity of our nation.\u201d The ABS is making some changes to the next census, with testing beginning soon on proposed new questions, arising from its 2018 review, on non-binary gender, long-term health conditions and Australian Defence Force service. However, the bureau has abandoned preparations to ask about sexual orientation and gender identity. A spokesman said the ABS wanted to keep the burden on responding households to a minimum. The ABS\u2019s review proposed minimal changes to questions on ancestry and languages spoken at home, but acknowledged it had received a number of submissions suggesting it gather data on race. \u201cSubmissions indicated that cultural diversity remains a relevant and important topic,\u201d the ABS said. \u201cSpecifically, submissions supported most cultural diversity topics on the census to remain without change but noted opportunities for minor changes on some topics to better understand new and emerging priorities.\u201d In his speech to the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia\u2019s (Fecca) national conference in Hobart on Thursday morning, Giles said there was \u201csimply too much we don\u2019t know\u201d, and linked it to a lack of diversity across Australian public- and private-sector leadership. \u201cThis is a critical threshold issue to be resolved if we are to fully realise the potential of our multiculturalism.\u201d \u201cWe need to recognise that there are those who are seeking to undermine or even reject our multiculturalism. Think of the recent contributions of Alexander Downer and Tony Abbott in Hungary, talking all of us down, inaccurately and offensively. \u201cAnd think of the lack of a response from anyone in the Morrison government to this.\u201d This week it emerged that Downer, a former foreign minister and high commissioner to the UK, had delivered a speech to a migration summit in Hungary in which he said migrants in Australia lived \u201cBantustan-style\u201d in \u201cseparate ghettos\u201d and that Australia should give refugees only temporary protection. Last month former prime minister Abbott gave a speech praising Hungary\u2019s far-right leader, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, for his nativist policies, and warned that \u201cmilitary-age\u201d male immigrants were \u201cswarming\u201d the European continent. Kristina Keneally has also condemned Abbott\u2019s appearance in Hungary, warning that multiculturalism in Australia is under threat from resurgent nationalism and calling for people to be vigilant in defending one of the country\u2019s \u201cgreatest strengths\u201d. In a draft of a speech to be delivered to the ethnic community councils in Hobart on Thursday night, Keneally argued that this traditional strength was facing \u201cnew threats\u201d, including from the proliferation of fake news. \u201cWe have seen these threats on the rise in other countries \u2013 particularly the likes of Hungary, Italy and Greece \u2013 and we are seeing them in Australia.\u201d \u201cThe manufacturing of hatred has happened in various ways \u2013 through purposeful language of political leaders to the proliferation of fake news on Facebook,\u201d Keneally\u2019s speech said. She said research by the University of Warwick in England that studied more than 3,000 anti-refugee attacks in Germany found that wherever Facebook usage rose to one standard deviation above normal, attacks on refugees increased by 50%. When there were internet outages in areas with high Facebook usage, the attacks dropped significantly. \u201cThis is just one of the covert ways a fear of migrants and migration has the potential to undermine one of our biggest national strengths,\u201d Keneally says. \u201cWe have seen right-wing extremists share the stage in Australia with Government MPs and Senators \u2013 an event where the crowd chanted \u2018send her back\u2019 in relation to yours truly,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd at the same time there are still politicians who want to see protections under 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act rolled back or watered down.\u201d",

Previous evidence to the Independent Commission Against Corruption has alleged that Huang, a banned donor, brought an Aldi shopping bag full of $100,000 cash to Labor\u2019s Sussex Street headquarters in April 2015 and handed it to Clements. Icac has heard the illegal donation was covered up using a series of straw, or fake, donors. But Clements on Thursday denied receiving a bag of cash from Huang, despite prior evidence from the Labor official Kenrick Cheah, who said Clements gave him the bag and asked him to count and process the money. \u201cI deny that evidence,\u201d he said. \u201cI deny that on my oath.\u201d Clements agreed that Huang and an interpreter, Tim Xu, had come to the Sussex Street headquarters on 7 April 2015.

Clements remembers Shorten sending over glasses of Grange wine to Huang\u2019s staff, while they sat in the tea room. \u201cActually Mr Shorten sent some glasses of Grange in for them to drink,\u201d Clements said. Clements said Huang had wanted Shorten to arrange a meeting between Victorian premier Daniel Andrews and a delegation from China. Shorten did not end up arranging the meeting with Andrews, and Clements said he ended up arranging it himself. The inquiry has heard that Huang gave large amounts of cash to Clements as personal gifts. Clements said the Chinese billionaire gave him $35,000 cash, stored in a wine box, to pay for legal bills in 2016. Huang is also said to have employed Clements after he resigned as the NSW Labor general secretary, putting him on a retainer of $4,000 a week for three years, an amount totalling more than $600,000. Huang also gave Clements $10,000 in an envelope to pass on to an unidentified union official for his campaign in May 2015, the inquiry heard. In a fiery cross-examination, Labor\u2019s barrister Arthur Moses, SC, accused Clements of seeking out the $10,000 union donation because he knew Huang had given NSW Labor $100,000 and was \u201cgood for it\u201d. Moses suggested the truth was \u201ctoo awful\u201d for Clements to admit. \u201cNo the reason I\u2019m not admitting to it is because it\u2019s not true.\u201d Moses also attacked Clements for failing to tell the party of the cash gifts. He said the party had been left blind to Huang\u2019s potential influence on the NSW Labor general secretary. Moses said that Clements could have been Huang\u2019s \u201cstooge\u201d and the party wouldn\u2019t have known, prompting objections from Clements\u2019 barrister, who described the remark as \u201cpersonal abuse\u201d.

Clements choked back tears as he said he was depressed and close to a breakdown, and questioned whether \u201cin some alternate universe, I had forgotten about this\u201d. He sought out Xu, Huang\u2019s interpreter, who laughed and told him it was a \u201cmade up story\u201d. \u201cThinking about it here today, in the mental position that I am today, there\u2019s just no way,\u201d he said.

The New South Wales treasurer, Dominic Perrottet, is pushing for the federal government to bring back plans for asset recycling for large infrastructure projects, according to a report in the Financial Review. Trad said most of the infrastructure spending announced in the federal budget was funded beyond the forward estimates. \u201cIt\u2019s a similar story in other states,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need the funding to be accelerated and these projects to be fast-tracked now to provide the stimulus needed.\u201d She joined the Victorian treasurer, Tim Pallas, in arguing for the federal government to bring forward spending on maintenance. \u201cI would also like to see the federal government increase its commitment to jointly funding the maintenance of existing assets, given the role they can continue to play in supporting our communities for many decades to come,\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "The Thai government has come under fire for a new regulation that forces coffee shop owners to track and store the data of customers using their wifi, a move critics say will be used to stifle political dissent and free speech. Thailand\u2019s digital economy and society ministry has demanded that cafe owners retain a log file of their customers\u2019 browsing data for at least 90 days, in line with Section 26 of the country\u2019s Computer Crimes Act. The new rule will allow authorities to more easily identify and track down internet users deemed to be violating Thai law. The digital economy and society minister, Buddhipongse Punnakanta, said the data would be used by Thailand\u2019s new \u201cfake news centre\u201d, which opened this August to monitor and track \u201cfalse and inappropriate\u201d reports. Thai business owners, especially small-scale operators, have complained the new rule would mean added cost, because they would have to purchase servers to store the data, while also burdening customers who would have to provide their personal information in order to log on to their wifi. The ministry suggested coffee shops and internet cafes keep paper records if concerned about data storage costs. The announcement comes in the same week that Karn Pongpraphapan, a 25-year-old pro-democracy activist, was arrested for allegedly insulting the monarchy online. In a Facebook post on 2 October, Karn made reference to the grisly fates of past European monarchs, although he did not specifically mention the Thai royal family. It is forbidden to insult the monarchy in Thailand, which has among the strictest lese-majesty laws in the world. Critics say the new data retention rule could also be used to stifle political dissent and free speech. Arthit Suriyawongkul, coordinator of the NGO Thai Netizen, a group that advocates digital rights, told the Bangkok Post that activists would push for an amendment to the controversial legislation. \u201cDoes the government really think they can catch bad people with this?\u201d he said in response to the new rule, \u201cOr is it just a way to threaten people with the knowledge that they are being watched?\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales government is considering opening two large coal fields to exploration as it seeks to make the state the \u201cnumber one mining investment destination\u201d, Guardian Australia has learned. The Advisory Body for Strategic Release, which controls the state\u2019s minerals reserves, has written to the deputy premier, John Barilaro, who is also the minister for regional affairs, recommending the Berejiklian government approve the development of the Hawkins-Rumker area in the central tablelands and the Wollar field near Bylong. \u201cNo decision has been made by the NSW government to open up areas to strategic release,\u201d a spokeswoman for Barilaro said. \u201cThe NSW deputy premier is determined to make the state the number one mining investment destination and coal has a critical part to play in that.\u201d Approval could open the door for more areas to be developed, including the Doyles Creek mine linked to the former NSW resources minister Ian Macdonald, who is to face trial on corruption charges in February, with the former Labor powerbroker Eddie Obeid. It comes as the NSW government considers legislation to ease the way for new mines by preventing planning authorities considering the environmental impact of emissions when coal is burned. NSW\u2019s economy is the worst performing on the east coast, with gross state product last year a low 2.6% \u2013 a result that was propped up by state government spending. Spending growth in the state recently fell to zero after consumers closed their wallets and Sydney\u2019s housing market stalled. The Hawkins-Rumker field, described by the NSW environment department as \u201ctwo large, adjacent export-quality thermal coal resources\u201d, is near Rylstone, in the north of the Bathurst electorate held by Barilaro\u2019s National party colleague and minister for regional transport and roads, Paul Toole. Wollar, which already plays host to two coalmines, is a little further north in the Upper Hunter seat of another National, Michael Johnsen. A new Wollar field would be likely to be of interest to the American group Peabody, which has repeatedly expanded its existing Wilpinjong mine despite vocal opposition from locals. The strategic release body was set up as part of an overhaul of the mining licence system recommended in 2013 by the Independent Commission Against Corruption, which conducted a series of investigations into the sector. Its chairman is Mark Darras, a lawyer and former Australia Post director who was appointed by the then resources minister, Don Harwin, in 2017 to be a \u201ctruly independent chair\u201d. Guardian Australia understands Darras wrote to Barilaro recommending he open the Hawkins-Rumker and Wollar fields a little under a fortnight ago. The next step in the process is consideration by cabinet, after which the exploration licences would be put out for auction. It is believed the NSW government could make a decision by Christmas, opening the way for an auction early next year. The usual environmental approvals would still be required before any mining could take place. If the process succeeds, it could open the way for the redevelopment of the Doyles Creek mine, which has been shut since 2014 when the NSW government cancelled its licence on the recommendation of Icac. This would likely spark fresh anger from NuCoal, which bought the licence in 2009 from a company associated with the former union official John Maitland. Maitland had received the licence from Macdonald the previous year. NuCoal has so far been unsuccessful in a series of legal challenges against the cancellation that have gone all the way to the high court, and currently pins its hopes of compensation on a private member\u2019s bill put forward by the upper house Christian Democrat Fred Nile and the possibility of action under a trade treaty with the US. Both Macdonald and Obeid were due to face trial this year over corruption allegations related to a different exploration licence in the Bylong Valley, not far from Wollar. However, late last month the hearing was put off until February following media coverage of the Icac hearing into donations NSW Labor allegedly received from the Chinese-Australian billionaire and tax fugitive Huang Xiangmo. \u201cThe press coverage of the Icac hearing included, by way of commentary, repeated adverse reference to the accused Mr Edward Obeid and Mr Ian Macdonald utilising a range of epithets,\u201d supreme court judge Elizabeth Fullerton said.",

The boy\u2019s body was found in a caravan park in Kambalda, a mining town 60km south of Kalgoorlie, on 12 July 1995. Police believe it was discovered soon after his birth. Last month a 38-year-old Victorian woman, believed to be the mother, was charged with his murder. The woman was 14 when the boy was born, and 13 when he was conceived. On Thursday police from Western Australia extradited a 55-year-old man from Queensland on charges of historic child sexual abuse. WA police said the young age of the mother at the time of the birth prompted officers from the cold case homicide squad to conduct a separate investigation \u201cinto the circumstances surrounding the conception of the child\u201d. \u201cIt will be alleged the man, who was known to the victim at the time, sexually assaulted the then 13-year-old girl, resulting in the baby being conceived,\u201d police said. \u201cIt will be further alleged the man engaged in unlawful sexual conduct with the victim over a number of years when the victim was aged between 11 years old and 16 years old.\u201d The man has been charged with two counts of sexually penetrating a child under the age of 13, sexually penetrating a child between the ages of 13 and 16, and two counts of sexually penetrating a child over the age of 16 who was under their authority. He has also been charged with having a sexual relationship with a child under the age of 16. The man was scheduled to appear in Perth magistrates court on Thursday.

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues on Thursday\u2019s blog: Trump defended his decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria, allowing for Turkey to launch a military offensive against US-allied Kurdish forces in the region, noting that the Kurds \u201cdidn\u2019t help us with Normandy\u201d. Republican senator Lindsay Graham teamed up with democrat Chris Van Hollen to draft sanctions against Turkey. House Democrats are reportedly planning a new wave of subpoenas after the White House indicated it would not cooperate with their investigations. The Justice Department announced it had arrested a Defense Intelligence Agency employee for allegedly leaking sensitive national security information to journalists. For the first time, Joe Biden unequivocally called Trump\u2019s impeachment. Bernie Sanders said he \u201cmisspoke\u201d when he said his campaign would slow down following a heart attack. Senators have released an outline of potential sanctions against Turkey, following news of the Turkish military offensive against US-allied Kurdish forces in Syria. Senator Lindsey Graham, a republican from South Carolina, joined with democratic Maryland senator Chris Van Hollen to draft the bill. Trump\u2019s decision to pull US troops out of the region, leaving Kurdish forces who bore the brunt of the US-led campaign against Isis defenseless has been met with bipartisan opposition. The senators said they would push sanctions unless the Trump administration confirms that \u201cTurkey is not operating unilaterally\u201d in Syria. Donald Trump pressed former secretary of state Rex Tillerson to persude the Justice Department to drop a case against an Iranian-Turkish gold trader who was a client of Rudy Giuliani, Bloomberg is reporting, citing three unnamed sources familiar with the 2017 meeting. Tillerson refused, arguing it would constitute interference in an ongoing investigation of the trader, Reza Zarrab, according to the people. They said other participants in the Oval Office were shocked by the request. Tillerson immediately repeated his objections to then-Chief of Staff John Kelly in a hallway conversation just outside the Oval Office, emphasizing that the request would be illegal. Neither episode has been previously reported, and all of the people spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the conversations. Zarrab was being prosecuted in federal court in New York at the time on charges of evading U.S. sanctions against Iran\u2019s nuclear program. He had hired former Attorney General Michael Mukasey and Giuliani, who has said he reached out repeatedly to U.S. officials to seek a diplomatic solution for his client outside the courts. The president\u2019s request to Tillerson -- which included asking him to speak with Giuliani -- bears the hallmarks of Trump\u2019s governing style, defined by his willingness to sweep aside the customary procedures and constraints of government to pursue matters outside normal channels. Tillerson\u2019s objection came to light as Trump\u2019s dealings with foreign leaders face intense scrutiny following the July 25 call with Ukraine\u2019s president that has sparked an impeachment inquiry in the House. The Guardian has not independently verified Bloomberg\u2019s report. Bernie Sanders said he \u201cmisspoke\u201d when he said he\u2019d be slowing down his campaign In an interview with NBC, Sanders said he wouldn\u2019t be slowing down his campaign after suffering a heart attack, saying he misspoke when he told reporters that he will \u201cchange the nature of the campaign a bit\u201d after being hospitalized. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign, I love doing rallies and I love doing town meetings,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI want to start off slower and build up and build up and build up.\u201d Last week, Sanders was at a campaign event in Nevada when he experienced chest discomfort and was taken to a hospital. \u201cI found that to be wholly appropriate,\u201d said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of the July call between Donald Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president. \u201cI was on the call. I listened to it. It was consistent with what President Trump has been trying to do to take corruption out\u201d Pompeo told PBS\u2019 Judy Woodruff. As we noted earlier, when Trump defended his decision abandon Kurdish allies in Syria by saying that they didn\u2019t help the US during World War II. \u201cThey didn\u2019t help us with Normandy as an example,\u201d Trump told reporters. Kurdish forces, did, however, fight alongside the US against Isis for nearly five years, losing roughly 11,000 fighters. On Sunday, the president announced that US troops would withdraw from the region, and today, Turkey has launched an offensive into north-eastern Syria against Kurdish forces who control the region. Trump said he learned that the Kurds didn\u2019t help in Normandy from a \u201cvery, very powerful article\u201d, and seemed to be referencing a column by conservative opinion writer Kurt Schlichter. Misrepresenting how Nato works, Trump told reporters: \u201cIf you look at how much money we spend on NATO and how much countries from Europe who are a much bigger beneficiary than we are.\u201d \u201cAlliances are very easy. But our alliances have taken advantage of us,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have spent a tremendous amount of money helping the Kurds,\u201d the president said. \u201cThey\u2019re fighting for their land. When you say they\u2019re fighting with the US, yes. But they\u2019re fighting for their land.\u201d \u201cWith all of that being said, we like the Kurds,\u201d Trump added. Trump told reporters he\u2019ll cooperate with the House democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry if \u201cthey give us our rights\u201d. Asked whether he\u2019ll cooperate with the democrats if they hold a vote on the impeachment inquiry, Trump responded: \u201cThe Republican Party and president has been treated extremely badly by the Democrats, very unfairly, because they have a tiny margin in the House, they have eviscerated the rules, they don\u2019t give us any fair play, it is the most unfair situation people have seen, no lawyers, you can\u2019t have lawyers, you can\u2019t speak, you can\u2019t do anything.\u201d But does the president have the right to due process during an impeachment? In a word: No. From NPR: The Constitution states clearly that the House of Representatives \u201cshall have the sole Power of Impeachment,\u201d and that \u201cthe Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments.\u201d What \u201cimpeachment\u201d means in this context is, effectively, indictment \u2014 the House has the power to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to spur a trial that would then take place in the Senate. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will be taking over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The Justice Department announced the arrest of an employee at the Defense Intelligence Agency for allegedly leaking sensitive national security information to two journalists. For the first time, Joe Biden called for the impeachment of Trump over the Ukraine controversy. Trump defended his decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria as Turkey launched a military operation in the region. (The president also flippantly said he was not worried about the potential escape of Islamic State fighters because they would likely flee to Europe.) Despite that defensive stance, a number of Republican lawmakers criticized Trump\u2019s Syria policy as news of the Turkish operation broke. House Democrats are reportedly planning a new wave of subpoenas as the White House made clear it would not cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. Maanvi will have more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. House Democrats are preparing a new wave of subpoenas as the White House has signaled it will not cooperate with the impeachment inquiry, according to CNN. They are also considering a secret interview of the whistleblower who kicked off the Ukraine controversy. CNN reports: In the face of the blistering White House letter refusing to cooperate with their probe, Democrats expect they are likely done with any voluntary interviews for most witnesses, according to multiple Democratic sources. And Democrats are now threatening subpoenas to associates of Rudy Giuliani and considering them for current State Department officials, including former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. She is scheduled for an interview Friday, but there are new concerns she won\u2019t appear given that she is still a State Department employee and could face backlash internally if she were to appear voluntarily. Negotiations are also intensifying over bringing in for an interview the whistleblower whose complaint has upended Trump\u2019s presidency, with new discussions about holding the interview in secret or off site and not disclosing that it happened until after the fact, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation. In response to a question about the threat facing America\u2019s Kurdish allies now that Turkey had launched a military operation in northern Syria, Trump blamed them for not assisting in World War II. Asked about Islamic State fighters potentially escaping amid Turkey\u2019s military operation in northern Syria, Trump told reporters he felt the United States had carried a disproportionate amount of responsibility in capturing the militants. Trump said: \u201cWell, they\u2019re going to be escaping to Europe. That\u2019s where they want to go; they want to go back to their homes, but Europe didn\u2019t want them from us.\u201d The president said the relationship between the US and its European allies had not been \u201creciprocal\u201d when it came to combating the Islamic State. In response to Trump\u2019s comments, a CNN reporter questioned whether the flippant remark about Islamic State militants returning to Europe, where the group has previously carried out terrorist attacks, would provoke any condemnation from Republican lawmakers. Trump said he would cooperate with the impeachment inquiry if the full House votes on it and \u201cif the rules are fair,\u201d but he appeared to leave himself a lot of wiggle room on the issue. When asked by reporters whether he was concerned that Islamic State fighters would be able to escape because of Turkey\u2019s military operation, Trump predicted that the militants would not travel to the US. The president said this to apparently reassure the American people (and surely terrify many US allies): \u201cThey\u2019re going to be escaping to Europe.\u201d Trump also dismissed criticism from senator Lindsey Graham, one of his closest congressional allies, over the president\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from the region. Trump said: \u201cI think Lindsey would like to stay there for the next 200 years.\u201d Speaking to reporters after signing two executive orders, Trump stood by his decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria even as Turkey launched a military operation in the region. Asked how he would react if Turkish forces decimated America\u2019s Kurdish allies in the region, Trump warned he would \u201cwipe out\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if they did so. The British prime minister\u2019s office released a readout from Boris Johnson\u2019s conversation with Trump. It reads, in part: \u201cThe Prime Minister spoke to President Trump this evening. The leaders expressed their serious concern at Turkey\u2019s invasion of north east Syria and the risk of a humanitarian catastrophe in the region. ... \u201cOn trade, the Prime Minister underlined his disappointment at the US announcement of tariffs against UK and EU exports in the Airbus-Boeing dispute, which will harm a number of industries including Scotch Whisky. He pressed the President not to impose the tariffs.\u201d Trump is now making remarks about two executive orders he is signing and noted that he had an \u201cextended conversation\u201d with the British prime minister, Boris Johnson. Even as senator Lindsey Graham lambastes Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, he is standing by the president on confronting the impeachment inquiry. Specifically, the Senate judiciary committee chairman is accusing House Democrats of abusing their power by not releasing a transcript from their closed-door interview with Kurt Volker, the former US ambassador to NATO. Graham warned that he would call Volker to publicly testify if the transcript is not released soon. Facebook is refusing to take down a Trump campaign ad that centers on false claims of corruption against Joe Biden. CNN has already refused to air the ad over its factual inaccuracies, but Facebook wrote in a letter to the Biden campaign that the video did not violate the social media platform\u2019s policies. A Facebook executive wrote: \u201cOur approach is grounded in Facebook\u2019s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is.\u201d The social media giant\u2019s decision provoked an enraged response from at least one of Biden\u2019s primary opponents, Elizabeth Warren. The minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s last meeting are out and Trump\u2019s trade policy is getting the blame for a slowing economy. \u201cTrade policy concerns continued to weigh on firms\u2019 investment decision,\u201d the Fed wrote, citing those tensions and a global economic slowdown as its reasons for cutting rates - albeit not by as much as Trump, a persistent critic of the Fed, had wanted. Trump has yet to tweet about the Fed - he\u2019s clearly too busy with \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d and impeachment. A senior adviser to the Turkish president claimed that Trump knew in advance \u201cprecisely\u201d the scope of the military operation in northern Syria. Meanwhile, more Republican lawmakers are condemning the president\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from the region, abandoning America\u2019s Kurdish allies. In addition to the trade discussion, Mike Pence was in Iowa to campaign for Republican senator Joni Ernst. When asked by a reporter yesterday whether it was acceptable for a president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival, as Trump has previously confirmed he did, Ernst dodged the question three times. Ernst said: \u201cWe again, we don\u2019t have the facts in front of us. And what we see pushed out through the media, we don\u2019t know what is accurate at this point.\u201d But when repeatedly pressed on whether the request itself would be inappropriate, Ernst refused to answer until she simply turned away from the reporter. The Ukraine controversy does not appear to be causing alarm among Trump\u2019s base, if the attendees of an Iowa event with the vice president are any indication. Mike Pence is hosting a discussion on trade in the Midwestern state, and several of those attending the event dismissed the Ukraine controversy as an overblown political stunt by House Democrats, per an AP reporter there. Biden added in a separate tweet that Trump has \u201cindicted himself\u201d through his actions toward Ukraine and reiterated his call for the president\u2019s impeachment. Biden has responded to Trump\u2019s taunt by calling on him to release his tax returns, which the president has refused to do since the 2016 election. Trump was unsurprisingly dismissive of Biden\u2019s call for his impeachment, belittling it as \u201cso pathetic\u201d and repeating false corruption claims against the former vice president. The blog has covered this many, many times, but there is no evidence to support claims that Biden exploited his influence as vice president to aid his son or his business. The Ukrainian prosecutor who initially investigated corruption claims against a business with ties to Hunter Biden has said he does not believe either of the Bidens broke Ukrainian law. CNN even refused to air a Trump campaign ad centered on the accusations against Biden, saying it was factually inaccurate. Biden said that Trump had \u201cviolated his oath of office\u201d and represented a unique threat to the constitution. The former vice-president told the New Hampshire crowd: \u201cTo preserve our constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached.\u201d Biden had previously avoided specifically saying how he would vote on impeachment, citing his past role overseeing the Senate as vice president. Joe Biden went further than he ever has before on the Ukraine controversy, arguing that Trump \u201cshould be impeached.\u201d Speaking at a campaign event in New Hampshire, the former vice president warned that Trump believes he \u201ccan and will get away with anything he does.\u201d Biden referenced Trump\u2019s past claim that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue in New York and get away with it. Biden said: \u201cIt\u2019s no joke. He\u2019s shooting holes in the Constitution. And we cannot let him get away with it.\u201d According to the indictment, Frese allegedly transmitted information about \u201ca foreign country\u2019s weapons systems\u201d to a reporter identified as \u201cJournalist 1.\u201d That reporter then allegedly asked Frese to talk to \u201cJournalist 2,\u201d which the DIA employee agreed to do. According to a press release from the Justice Department, Frese and \u201cJournalist 1\u201d appeared to be involved in a romantic relationship together and shared a residence at one point. The justice department announced it has arrested an employee of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Henry Kyle Frese, for allegedly leaking sensitive information to two journalists. Assistant attorney general for national security, John C Demers, said in a statement: \u201cAs laid out in today\u2019s indictment, Frese was caught red-handed disclosing sensitive national security information for personal gain.\u201d Frese has been charged with two counts of willful transmission of national defense information to unauthorized recipients and could face up to 10 years in prison for each charge. In his statement on Turkey\u2019s military operation in northern Syria, Trump expressed his expectation that Turkish officials would take responsibility for the Islamic State fighters detained in prisons there. The prisons are currently maintained by America\u2019s Kurdish allies, who may have to abandon the sites given Turkey\u2019s latest operation. But even some Republican lawmakers have expressed concern that this development could lead to thousands of Islamic State fighters escaping. Trump has released a statement through a White House spokesperson on Turkey launching a military operation in northern Syria. The statement reads: \u201cThis morning, Turkey, a NATO member, invaded Syria. The United States does not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea. \u201cThere are no American soldiers in the area. From the first day I entered the political arena, I made it clear that I did not want to fight these endless, senseless wars\u2014especially those that don\u2019t benefit the United States. \u201cTurkey has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place\u2014and we will hold them to this commitment. \u201cIn addition, Turkey is now responsible for ensuring all ISIS fighters being held captive remain in prison and that ISIS does not reconstitute in any way, shape, or form. We expect Turkey to abide by all of its commitments, and we continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201d Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Turkey has launched a military operation in northern Syria following Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from the region. In reaction to the White House letter saying officials would not cooperate with House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry because it was allegedly unconstitutional, Nancy Pelosi warned that Trump was just giving lawmakers more evidence of obstruction. Another poll found that half of American voters support removing Trump from office. There\u2019s still more coming up, so stay tuned. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren said she would not pursue big-dollar donors if she won the party\u2019s nomination. The Massachusetts senator has avoided such fundraisers in the primary race, but Warren had not said she would do so in a potential general election. The commitment could pose some issues for Warren if she becomes the eventual nominee, particularly given the massive fundraising operation Trump has built up in recent months. A former finance director for Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign slammed the decision as \u201ccolossally stupid.\u201d Some House Democrats are making the argument that the White House\u2019s efforts to stonewall the impeachment inquiry will prove unsuccessful because of the evidence already in lawmakers\u2019 possession. Specifically, the Democrats argue that the whistleblower complaint, the White House memo on the Ukraine call and text messages shared by senior officials like Rudy Giuliani present a compelling case for Trump\u2019s removal from office. Democratic representative Gerry Connelly told CNN: \u201cYou know what you need to know from the documents that we already have. It is why I think the stonewalling is counterproductive and ultimately futile. \u201cThere are going to be more people coming forward irrespective of WH stonewalling. All it does is persuade the public ... [the President] is resisting for a reason.\u201d But senator Lindsey Graham told Fox &amp; Friends earlier today that Senate Republicans would not vote for Trump\u2019s removal based solely on the information already available on the Ukraine call. In impeachment-related news, US diplomats who expressed unease about withholding military aid from Ukraine were advised to downplay the eventual release of the funds, according to the New York Times. The Times reports: \u2018Keep moving, people, nothing to see here \u2026\u2019 Brad Freden, the State Department\u2019s acting deputy assistant secretary overseeing issues in Europe and Eurasia, wrote in a Sept. 12 email obtained by The New York Times. He said the National Security Council would not publicly announce that $141 million in State Department assistance was being restored after being held up in what the White House described as a normal review. ... A series of previously unreported internal State Department emails reflect diplomats\u2019 frustration with the unexpected freeze on funding that Congress had already approved. \u2018We realize the strain this puts on posts and your ability to conclude grants and carry out programs,\u2019 Jim Kulikowski, the State Department\u2019s regional assistance coordinator, wrote in an Aug. 5 email. Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader in the House, has condemned Turkey for launching a military operation in northern Syria after Trump decided to withdraw US troops from the region. Given that McCarthy has been a key ally to Trump as the president attempts to combat House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, the California Republican may have a unique opportunity to push the commander-in-chief to change his position on Syria. But Trump has so far shown no sign of reconsidering his decision to withdraw the US troops. Senator Lindsey Graham is now more broadly attacking Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d foreign policy, arguing that isolationism represents a dangerous threat to the nation. Graham said in a previous tweet, reacting to the news of Turkey\u2019s military operation in northern Syria, that America\u2019s Kurdish allies had been \u201cshamelessly abandoned by the Trump administration.\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke said he thinks Nancy Pelosi should hold a formal vote on opening an impeachment inquiry. Pelosi has said she does not plan to hold a vote and argued that the Constitution does not require such a formality to launch an impeachment inquiry, a reading that is backed up by legal experts. The House speaker is also likely trying to protect vulnerable Democrats, even though many of her caucus members from more conservative districts have come out in support of the inquiry. But depending on what the investigation uncovers, such a vote could eventually come to reflect badly upon the Republicans who would likely oppose it. Despite his opposition to Trump\u2019s Syria policy, senator Lindsey Graham has been one of the president\u2019s most ardent defenders when it comes to impeachment. Just this morning, the South Carolina Republican told \u201cFox &amp; Friends\u201d that House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry threatens to \u201cdestroy the nation.\u201d Graham said of the Ukraine call: \u201cI\u2019ve read the transcript. ... I do not see anything wrong there, and I want Nancy Pelosi to know that Republican senators are not going to impeach this president based on this transcript.\u201d But the White House\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the inquiry may be another matter. Back when Bill Clinton was facing potential removal from office, Graham argued that Richard Nixon\u2019s greatest impeachable offense was failing to comply with a congressional subpoena. Senator Lindsey Graham, one of Trump\u2019s closest congressional allies, urged the president to change course in Syria after news broke that Turkey has launched a military operation in the country\u2019s northern region. Graham warned in an interview last night that Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria could be a career-ending move. The South Carolina Republican told Axios: \u201cI think he\u2019s putting the nation at risk, and I think he\u2019s putting his presidency at risk. And I hope he will adjust his policies like he did before. That would actually be a sign of real leadership.\u201d Graham added: \u201cThis is worse than when Obama left Iraq, because you\u2019ve got so much information as to what happens. This would be a game changer to our national security. This would pave the way to the re-emergence of ISIS. ... \u201cIf I hear the president say one more time, \u2018I made a campaign promise to get out of Syria,\u2019 I\u2019m going to throw up.\u201d Meanwhile, the president\u2019s former fixer, Michael Cohen, is reportedly being brought back to New York to reveal more information to state prosecutors who are investigating whether the Trump Organization falsified business records. CNN reports: The information, if deemed credible, could result in Cohen testifying before a grand jury, the official said. This meeting would be the third time Cohen has met with prosecutors and should happen this month, according to the official. It is expected to be held at the district attorney\u2019s office in Lower Manhattan with Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance\u2019s general counsel and the head of the economic crimes bureau, the official said. It is unknown if Vance himself will be there. ... CNN first reported last month that officials from the district attorney\u2019s office, led by Vance, interviewed Cohen at the federal prison in Otisville, New York, where he is serving a three-year sentence after pleading guilty to multiple crimes including campaign finance violations tied to payments to two women alleging affairs with Trump a decade ago. Despite news of Turkey\u2019s military operation in Syria, Trump is keeping his attention squarely on the impeachment inquiry, even dubiously accusing special counsel Robert Mueller of perjury. Another Senate Republican, Marco Rubio of Florida, slammed the abandonment of America\u2019s Kurdish allies as \u201cmorally repugnant\u201d yesterday. Rubio also warned that Trump\u2019s foreign policy shift could lead to thousands of Islamic State militants being released from prison. The Washington Post has more on that: The U.S. military has no plans to intervene if Syrian Kurdish forces abandon a constellation of Islamic State prisons in Syria to confront a possible Turkish invasion, officials said Tuesday. Kurdish officials said that guards were still in place at the more than 20 prisons and camps under their control but were prepared to move, raising the possibility that about 11,000 militants and their families could escape. Trump defended his foreign policy in the Middle East in a pair of bombastic tweets this morning. But even some of Trump\u2019s closest congressional allies, including senator Lindsey Graham, have sounded alarm bells about clearing the way for a Turkish military operation in Syria. Turkish officials said the country was launching a military operation in northern Syria following Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that he would withdraw US troops from the region. Bethan McKernan reports: Several large explosions rocked the north-east Syrian town of Ras al-Ain, on the border across from the Turkish town of Ceylanp\u0131nar, a CNN Turk reporter said, adding that the sound of planes could be heard above. He said smoke could be seen rising from buildings in Ras al-Ain. Kurdish military leaders inside Syria have been braced for an attack since Donald Trump announced earlier this week that US troops were withdrawing from the area. [Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan] said the offensive, dubbed \u2018Operation Peace Spring\u2019, would aim to eliminate threats from the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia and Islamic State militants, and enable the return of Syrian refugees in Turkey after the formation of a \u2018safe zone\u2019 in the area, he said. On the 2020 campaign trail, Bernie Sanders said he would scale back his events following his heart attack last week. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to change the nature of the campaign a bit,\u201d Sanders said after visiting a cardiologist in his home state of Vermont. \u201cMake sure that I have the strength to do what I have to do.\u201d The senator\u2019s comments might come as a surprise to some of his staffers, given that the campaign has insisted the candidate would continue with his bid as planned despite his health issues. His decision to slow down a bit will also likely intensify questions about whether he (and other older candidates like Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren) are the best options for the Oval Office. Another poll has come out this morning showing that about half of voters support removing Trump from office. According to the Politico/Morning Consult poll, 50% of voters would support Trump\u2019s removal, compared to 43% who would not. Those results come on the heels of yesterday\u2019s Washington Post/Schar School poll, which found that 49% of registered voters would support the president\u2019s removal. And Quinnipiac found that 45% of registered voters believe Trump should be removed from office. This marks an uptick in support in recent weeks as House Democrats have launched their formal impeachment inquiry, and Democratic leaders are counting on the number to continue rising as they present their case for impeachment. Good morning, live blog readers! The White House has come up with its strategy to combat House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry: denial. Of course, administration officials are not denying key elements of Donald Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president, which were confirmed in the White House\u2019s own memo on the conversation. Instead, they\u2019re denying that Congress has the right to investigate the president. White House counsel Pat Cipollone wrote in a letter to House speaker Nancy Pelosi: \u201cYou have designed and implemented your inquiry in a manner that violates fundamental fairness and constitutionally mandated due process.\u201d Legal experts said the White House letter did not rely on any sound reading of the constitution, and Pelosi warned in her own blistering statement that further efforts to block the inquiry would be taken as more evidence of obstruction. The House speaker said: \u201cThe White House letter is only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy, and to insist that the President is above the law ... Mr President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable.\u201d All of this puts the White House and the House of Representatives on a collision course over how to read the Constitution that could set a precedent for decades to comes. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will sign an executive order on transparency in federal guidance and enforcement at 3.15pm ET. Mike Pence is in Iowa for a campaign event with Republican senator Joni Ernst and a discussion on trade. Joe Biden is campaigning in New Hampshire today. That\u2019s all still coming up, so stay tuned.",
