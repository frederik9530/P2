The update follows the announcement in June of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/27/twitter-warning-labels-tweets-violate-site-rules\">policy whereby the company would choose not to delete tweets</a> by major political figures that violated the company\u2019s rules if the company decided it was in the public interest. </p> \n  <p>Since the election of Donald Trump, Twitter has been in the unenviable position of having the ability to censor the president of the United States on the very platform where he is the most unguarded. It has largely resisted the intense pressure to do so, even when it seemed that Trump\u2019s tweets might have fallen afoul of Twitter\u2019s rules if they had been sent by anyone else. </p> \n  <p>In September 2017, after Trump appeared to threaten North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Twitter, the company announced that it had begun considering \u201cnewsworthiness\u201d when considering whether to take down a tweet. </p> \n  <p>The June 2019 policy allowed for a scenario whereby a world leader\u2019s tweet was bad enough to come down, but merited remaining up for documentation or accountability.

Open hearings with big names can be illuminating and move the dial in investigations, whether it\u2019s Trump-Russia or Trump-Ukraine, or whatever. But there\u2019s no denying they often descend into a partisan circus.</p> \n  <p>Yesterday career diplomat and former top Russia aide, British-born Fiona Hill, who has worked during the administrations of no less than six presidents, gave testimony for almost 10 hours. Some of the details that were later disclosed by indiscreet politicians are absolute <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/14/fiona-hill-testimony-trump-impeachment-inquiry\">dynamite</a>.</p> \n  <p>Today it\u2019s <strong>George Kent</strong>, whose title, ordinarily, would be an eye-glazer - Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs. But in the circumstances, with the White House trying to stop officials from testifying, folks like these are pure gold to investigators looking for sober facts about what the president\u2019s henchmen have been up to, where, when, with whom and why. The White House apparently attempted to block him, to no avail.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kyledcheney/status/1184118504666079232\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NEWS: The State Department and White House tried to block George Kent from appearing -- so the House Intel Committee subpoenaed him, according to a source working on the impeachment inquiry.

He probably wishes he had the dignity of being able to call himself a career diplomat, instead of Trump Super Fan.</p> \n  <p>And now to that <strong>Trump tweet</strong>. It seems this whole behind-closed-doors thing is really getting the president\u2019s goat. Listen, as the mainstream media, we\u2019d love nothing more than a seat in those committee hearings, but have to admit, reluctantly, that in-camera testimony is a logical move for <strong>Adam Schiff</strong> and his intel committee.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1184101618901540864\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Democrats are allowing no transparency at the Witch Hunt hearings.

      "bodyText": "For the rest of tonight\u2019s coverage, please head on over to our Democratic presidential primary debate blog! Just to sum things up here: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff held a press conference today, from which most were expecting some form of fireworks - especially given all the failures to comply with congressional subpoenas. But Schiff mostly provided an update on the impeachment inquiry, saying that House Dems have \u201cmade dramatic progress in answering some of the questions surrounding that July telephone call\u201d between Donald Trump and the Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Schiff made a point to note that secretary of defense Mark Esper said on Sunday that he would comply with congressional subpoenas, but that \u201capparently, his willingness to comply has been countermanded by a higher authority.\u201d \u201cThe case for obstruction of Congress continues to build,\u201d Schiff said. In fielding questions from reporters, Pelosi said she would not be calling for a vote to formalize the impeachment inquiry. \u201cWe are not here to call bluffs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are on a path that is taking us to a path to truth, a timetable that respects our consitition.\u201d For more on the impeachment inquiry, take a read of our story today: \u201cThere is no requirement that we have a vote,\u201d said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi . \u201cWe will not be having a vote.\u201d \u201cWe are on the path of fairness,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe are not here to call bluffs. We are on a path that is taking us to a path to truth, a timetable that respects our consitition.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff provided an update on the impeachment inquiry, with Schiff focusing a portion of his remarks on the failure to comply with congressional subpoenas. \u201cWe know from the witnesses that have come forward that there are additional documents that they have provided the state department that they have not provided to Congress,\u201d Schiff said. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that a grand jury has issued a subpoena tied to Manhattan federal prosecutors\u2019 investigation into Giuliani, seeking documents from former Rep Pete Sessions about his dealings with Trump\u2019s lawyer. The Journal has cited people familiar with the matter: From the Journal: The subpoena seeks documents related to Mr. Giuliani\u2019s business dealings with Ukraine and his involvement in efforts to oust the U.S. ambassador in Kyiv, as well as any interactions between Mr. Sessions, Mr. Giuliani and four of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s associates who were indicted last week on campaign-finance and conspiracy accounts, the people said. Mr. Giuliani is the primary focus of the subpoena, the people said. Mr. Giuliani has denied wrongdoing and said he has had no indication his actions are being investigated by prosecutors. Mike Pence\u2019s office have said the vice president will not comply with a request from the House to turn over documents related to Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, NBC News is reporting: In a letter to the chairs of the house intelligence, foreign affairs and oversight committees, Pence counsel Matthew Morgan called the request part of a \u201cself-proclaimed impeachment inquiry\u201d. The letter: Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have released a joint statement following the introduction of a bipartisan resolution opposing the president\u2019s decision in Syria: The chaos and insecurity unleashed in Syria by President Trump\u2019s disastrous decision to precipitously withdraw from northern Syria require strong, smart leadership from Congress. Since President Trump gave Turkey the green light to attack our Kurdish partners, Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate have been united in our swift and serious condemnation of this reckless action, which threatens countless lives, endangers our Kurdish partners and undermines our credibility in the world. Furthermore, President Trump\u2019s action not only risks regional security, it risks security in our homeland because ISIS is resurging. Already, dozens of people have died and hundreds of ISIS supporters and families have escaped. We have always maintained that, while certainly needed, a sanctions package alone is insufficient for reversing this humanitarian disaster. Today, the Congress continues bipartisan, bicameral leadership to reject President Trump\u2019s dangerous actions in Syria. With one voice, we call on President Trump to support Kurdish communities, to work to ensure that the Turkish military acts with restraint, and to present a clear strategy to defeat ISIS. This resolution also urges President Erdogan to immediately cease unilateral military action in Syria.\u201d A federal judge has overturned Affordable Care Act protections for transgender patients, ruling against a non-discrimination policy included in Obamacare, the Hill is reporting: The regulation in question prohibited federally funded providers and insurers from refusing to treat or provide coverage to people based on their gender identity or termination of pregnancy, the Hill reported, noting that the judge\u2019s decision would likely be appealed. The ruling comes as trans rights are facing significant and repeated attacks by the Trump administration, and following a high-stakes US supreme court hearing this month. Nancy Pelosi is due to speak in an hour \u2013 a bit before the 2020 debate is set to start. Could be newsworthy: ProPublica is reporting that one of the speakers at at a recent pro-Trump conference repeatedly urged the crowd to go to \u201cwar\u201d in support of the president: \u201cWe\u2019ve come to declare war!\u201d Pastor Mark Burns told the crowd three times in the Donald J Trump Grand Ballroom. Conference-goers roared back: \u201cWar! War!\u201d Full story here: Asked for comment, Burns told ProPublica he does not endorse violence: \u201cMe talking about going to war for Donald Trump is simply a call to action for Republicans to be verbal in support of our conservative values and support for this president.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s senior technology reporter, Julia Carrie Wong, has this update on Twitter\u2019s policies for world leader\u2019s tweets: Twitter on Tuesday published additional information about how it plans to act if a world leader tweets something that violates its rules. The update follows the announcement in June of a policy whereby the company would choose not to delete tweets by major political figures that violated the company\u2019s rules if the company decided it was in the public interest. Since the election of Donald Trump, Twitter has been in the unenviable position of having the ability to censor the president of the United States on the very platform where he is the most unguarded. It has largely resisted the intense pressure to do so, even when it seemed that Trump\u2019s tweets might have fallen afoul of Twitter\u2019s rules if they had been sent by anyone else. In September 2017, after Trump appeared to threaten North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Twitter, the company announced that it had begun considering \u201cnewsworthiness\u201d when considering whether to take down a tweet. The June 2019 policy allowed for a scenario whereby a world leader\u2019s tweet was bad enough to come down, but merited remaining up for documentation or accountability. In these scenarios, Twitter said today, the company will apply a label to the offending tweet and users will not be allowed to like, retweet or otherwise share it. Today\u2019s blog post by Twitter also provides a bit more detail about how they plan to approach such a scenario. The company says that it is more likely to simply delete a tweet by a world leader if it promotes terrorism, violence or self-harm; involves illegal goods or services; is intended to interfere with elections (such as by posting misinformation about voting); or includes the private information of another person \u2013 especially if that person is not a public figure. The company says that it is more likely to allow a violating tweet to remain published if it violates rules against hate speech and hateful conduct; abuse or harassment; or contains graphic or gruesome media. Hi all - Sam Levin here, taking over our live coverage for a bit before the debates kick off. US prosecutors in New York have charged Turkey\u2019s Halkbank with taking part in a multibillion-dollar scheme to evade US sanctions against Iran, Reuters is reporting. The charges against the majority state-owned bank mirror those against one of its former executives, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who was found guilty and sentenced to prison after a trial in Manhattan federal court last year. Prosecutors said that between 2012 and 2016, Halkbank helped run a scheme that allowed Iran to spend proceeds from sales of its oil and gas on international markets, in violation of U.S. sanctions, using a complex web of front companies. The scheme ran with the protection of high-ranking officials in Iran and Turkey, some of whom received tens of millions of dollars in bribes, the prosecutors said. A US lawyer for Halkbank did not immediately respond to Reuters\u2019 request for comment. Some backstory here on how the bank relates to the ongoing Rudy Giuliani scandal: There is still plenty of action to come in the world of US politics, so do stay tuned. My colleague Sam Levin is taking over this blog for a short while and then, at 6.30ET, Guardian US\u2019s Joan Greve will roll out tonight\u2019s Democratic debate live blog. Stay tuned. Here are the main events so far today: Mike Pence, in what looks like a hapless move to close the stable door after the horse has bolted, is traveling to Turkey tomorrow to give leaders there a piece of his mind about advancing on Kurdish territory in Syria after the US quit. Rudy Giuliani has refused to comply with the congressional subpoena that demanded documents relating to the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry from his by a deadline of today. State department official George Kent is still testifying behind closed doors on Capitol Hill in the impeachment inquiry. The parents of British teenager Harry Dunn, who died in a car crash involving the wife of a US diplomat, who then fled to America under the cloak of diplomatic immunity, were due to have a meeting at the White House this afternoon. Further details are yet to emerge, so stay tuned. Vice President Mike Pence will travel to Ankara tomorrow, leading a US delegation to try to pressure the Turkish government to ceasefire and halt its aggressive military action in the Kurdish region of north-eastern Syria. This is in addition to sanctions announced against Turkey by the president yesterday. As a reminder, here\u2019s what Republican Mitt Romney had to say about Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull US troops from that area, where they had allied with Kurdish forces to attack ISIS and keep hostile Turkish and semi-hostile Syrian forces at bay. Last week Romney issued a bipartisan statement with Democratic Senator Chris Murphy. And today, Murphy issued a fresh statement that read, in part: \u201cNo one but Trump is to blame for the chaos Turkey has unleashed in Syria, and we all need to acknowledge it will be difficult to put the genie back in the bottle at this point. It\u2019s absurd that Trump is now sanctioning Turkey for an invasion that he invited and announced. \u201cCongress now has a decision to make: do something in haste that makes us feel powerful or do something strategic that accounts for the fact that much of the harm Trump has done cannot be reversed...Congress needs to make sure America does its part to alleviate the humanitarian nightmare caused by Trump\u2019s unconscionable double crossing of the Kurds.\u201d He also called for Congress to require the Trump administration to take increased numbers of Kurdish refugees into the United States, and provide countries such as Iraq with humanitarian aid to help deal with a new influx of refugees. Rudy Giuliani has formally notified the House that he won\u2019t submit documents requested by the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry, which had a deadline of today. In the letter to the relevant committee chairmen from his erstwhile lawyer, Jon Sale, the inquiry is condemned as \u201can unconstitutional, baseless and illegitimate \u2018impeachment inquiry\u2019\u201d and that the subpoena is \u201coverbroad and unduly burdensome\u201d. The government budget office has also just said that it will not comply with the demand for documents, either. The subpoena issued to the office of management and budget related to the delay in military funds to Ukraine. That issue is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, in relation to allegations that Donald Trump held back congressionally-approved aid to Ukraine as a form of pressure to persuade the new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate Trump\u2019s Democratic rival, Joe Biden, and son Hunter Biden. Giuliani stonewalls And sticking with Giuliani, subpoenas and lawyers... Rudy Giuliani parted ways today with his attorney Jon Sale. But, apparently on the cusp of not being his lawyer, Sale put his pen to this refusal of Giuliani to comply with the congressional subpoena seeking documents in the impeachment inquiry. Sale, former Watergate prosecutor and a former assistant US attorney in the Southern District of New York, was only hired a couple of weeks ago. Rudy Giuliani was paid $500,000 for work he did for a company co-founded by the Ukrainian-American businessman arrested last week on campaign finance charges, Giuliani has told Reuters today. The businessman, Lev Parnas, is a close associate of Giuliani and was involved in his effort to investigate Trump\u2019s political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. Giuliani said Parnas\u2019 company, \u201cFraud Guarantee\u201d, based in Boca Raton, Florida, whose website says it aims to help clients \u201creduce and mitigate fraud\u201d, engaged Giuliani Partners, a management and security consulting firm, around August 2018. Giuliani said he was hired to consult on Fraud Guarantee\u2019s technologies and provide legal advice on regulatory issues. Federal prosecutors are \u201cexamining Giuliani\u2019s interactions\u201d with Parnas and another Giuliani associate, Igor Fruman, who was also indicted on campaign finance charges, a law enforcement source told Reuters on Sunday. The New York Times reported last week that Parnas had told associates he paid Giuliani hundreds of thousands of dollars for what Giuliani said was business and legal advice. Giuliani said for the first time on Monday that the total amount was $500,000. Giuliani told Reuters the money came in two payments made within weeks of each other. He said he could not recall the dates of the payments. He said most of the work he did for Fraud Guarantee was completed in 2018 but that he had been doing follow-up for over a year. Parnas and Fruman were arrested at Dulles Airport outside Washington last week on charges they funneled foreign money to unnamed U.S. politicians in a bid to influence US-Ukraine relations in violation of US campaign finance laws. The men were preparing to board a plane to Europe. Foreign nationals are prohibited from making contributions and other expenditures in connection with US elections, and from making contributions in someone else\u2019s name. Giuliani would not say where the money came from, only adding: \u201cI know beyond any doubt the source of the money is not any questionable source. The money did not come from foreigners. I can rule that out 100%.\u201d Subpoena deadlines today Rudy Giuliani has a deadline of today to turn over documents related to the impeachment inquiry, after he was subpoenaed, aka legally ordered, to do so last month. The three House committees leading the inquiry, intelligence, foreign affairs and oversight, demanded the material from Giuliani, alleging that he \u201cpressed the Ukrainian government to pursue two politically motivated investigations.\u201d The chances of him turning over the material on deadline are, perhaps, slim to medium, given that he has been scathing about the political integrity of the inquiry. Vice president Mike Pence has also been subpoenaed to submit documents by today, and the chances of him doing so appear to be slim to zero. And defense secretary Mark Esper, likewise, has a today deadline to comply with a subpoena for related documents from the Pentagon, and has indicated the department will cooperate. However, he added on Fox News Sunday at the weekend that Donald Trump and other officials may yet create complications for the compliance \u201cI don\u2019t know what restrictions we may have internally in regard to releasing them,\u201d Esper said. \u201cThe White House has a say on the release of documents as well.\u201d As state department official George Kent continues his testimony behind closed doors to the House intelligence committee on Capitol Hill, crumbs of info are tumbling out in the ongoing impeachment inquiry. Kent said he warned colleagues as far back as March, the New York Times reports, about Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer/human \u201chand grenade\u201d Rudy Giuliani\u2019s role in what Kent described as a \u201cdisinformation\u201d campaign - using a Ukrainian prosecutor to smear Trump\u2019s Democratic rival in the 2020 presidential race, Joe Biden, and the ousted ambassador to the Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. Yovanovitch, who was reportedly told that she had \u201cdone nothing wrong\u201d but was being withdrawn from her post anyway (following an apparent political campaign against her because she was seen as anti-Trump - and possibly, for those on the make in the swamp, too zealously anti-corruption) defied White House non-cooperation with the impeachment inquiry and testified in Washington last week. Warren goes full-on SNL Democratic front-runner Elizabeth Warren is on an absolute tweet storm today, linking America\u2019s big dollar election donation system corrupt, calling out pay-for-play - and taking full advantage of comedy actor Kate McKinnon\u2019s most recent depiction of her on Saturday Night Live. McKinnon has Warren\u2019s bright-eyed, brisk and breathless earnestness down and raised laughs with her impression of the Senator and 2020 candidate\u2019s tactic of calling small-dollar donors personally to thank them for giving to her campaign. But for Warren, 70, it\u2019s pure gold. Action in the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry is taking place behind closed doors today, so we\u2019ll wait breathlessly for any revelations via participating lawmakers on Capitol Hill committees taking testimony from state department official George Kent. Meanwhile, there is plenty else afoot in US politics. The British parents of 19-year-old Harry Dunn have suddenly been invited to the White House this afternoon in connection with the diplomatic row over their son\u2019s death in August. Kent is just one of a string of key witnesses testifying behind closed doors in Congress this week, much to Donald Trump\u2019s chagrin. The US Congress is back in session after a two week recess. Apart from impeachment action in the House, Senate Democrats aim to force votes on a number of issues, including the climate crisis and gun control. Elizabeth Warren will be hoping to cement her position as Democratic front-runner in the primary debate in Ohio tonight - only just over a year to the presidential election now! And how will Bernie Sanders do, just coming back from a heart attack? In an unprecedented format, it\u2019s one stage, one night 12 candidates tonight. The Guardian\u2019s crack team of politics reporter Lauren Gambino and live blogger Joan Greve will be there. National affairs correspondent Tom McCarthy will train his eagle-eye from New York and bring you the main \u201ctake aways\u201d. As US troops are pulling back from Kurdish territory in north-eastern Syria, Russian forces are moving in amid violence and extreme tension between Turkish, Kurdish and Syrian interests, in a pickle that threatens a new wave of Middle Eastern geo-political instability. \u201cA pain no painkillers can take away\u201d Harry Dunn\u2019s parents have spoken this week about the emotional devastation they are suffering after losing their 19-year-old son to a car crash, when he was riding his motorcycle and it was in a collision on a British minor road with a car driven by Anne Sacoolas, the wife of an American diplomat. She has expressed grief and sorrow and apologized to Harry\u2019s parents, but they remain bewildered by the fact that she has been able to disappear to the US instead of working with police in the UK for the duration of their investigation into Harry\u2019s death. A family spokesman said this morning that the parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, who flew to the US on Sunday to \u201ccontinue our fight for justice\u201d, had been suddenly issued an urgent invitation to the White House this afternoon. It\u2019s unclear what is planned or whether they will meet with Donald Trump there. Charles said before boarding her flight for the US she had received a letter from Sacoolas expressing her \u201cdeepest sympathies and apologies\u201d. Charles said: \u201cTo be perfectly honest, yes, it\u2019s the start of some closure for our family...having said that, as it\u2019s nearly seven weeks now since we lost our boy, sorry just doesn\u2019t cut it.\u201d Charles described the sensation of losing Harry, who was still conscious when his parents came upon the scene of the crash and tried to reassure him that he would recover, as being \u201cin pain morning until night that no painkillers can take away\u201d. The family doesn\u2019t want diplomatic immunity to stand in the way of Sacoolas, 42, taking part in the crash investigation in the UK. The parents of Harry Dunn, the 19-year-old motorcyclist killed recently in a car accident outside an RAF base involving a US diplomat\u2019s wife in Britain, are going to the White House this afternoon for a meeting, according to the family. The parents have already demanded to see all the exchanges between the US embassy, the UK Foreign Office and the British police that led to the decision for the American driver Anne Sacoolas to claim diplomatic immunity and leave the country, the Guardian\u2019s Patrick Wintour writes today. The lawyers say they will mount a judicial review if the Foreign Office does not cooperate. Sacoolas has admitted in a statement that she was \u201cdriving on the wrong side of the road and is terribly, terribly sorry for that tragic mistake\u201d. The Foreign Office wrote to the Dunn family at the weekend to say that the US and the UK agreed her diplomatic immunity no longer applied once she returned to the US. The Dunn family, currently in the US to pursue their demand that Sacoolas return to UK to face an investigation, said they were ready to launch a full investigation into the Foreign Office role. It is unclear who the family will meet at the White House or what will be discussed. The parents have recently arrived in the US to step up their campaign to pressure Sacoolas to return to the UK and face police questioning. She left the UK shortly after the collision between Dunn\u2019s motorbike and a car outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on 27 August. She is believed to have been driving the car and met police afterwards. But no investigation followed after the force was advised she had protective status granted to foreign diplomats. \u201cConspiracy of silence\u201d Much lively chatter about MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes and his closing monologue last night in which he noted former colleague Ronan Farrow\u2019s description of alleged attempts at NBC to kill his reporting into the Harvey Weinstein rape and sexual harassment allegations as \u201ca conspiracy of silence by NBC management.\u201d The news network denies any such conspiracy or campaign and maintains that it didn\u2019t broadcast Farrow\u2019s story (which he soon after took to the New Yorker) because the journalism wasn\u2019t quite there. And here\u2019s April Ryan and Ronan Farrow, just coz! US soldiers pulling back as Russian troops arrive The approximately 1,000 US troops being withdrawn from northern Syria will reposition in Iraq, Kuwait and possibly Jordan, an official has told the Associated Press. The politically-sensitive pull-out continues steadily amid heavy fighting between Turkish and Syrian Kurdish forces. The official says the American troops have pulled out of the Manbij area, where US outposts were set up in 2017. Troops are consolidating their positions to prepare to fly out of the country soon and US soldiers based in Iraq could conduct cross-border operations against the Islamic State in Syria as they did before creating the now-abandoned partnership with Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. The AP reminds us that the White House announced a week ago that US forces in northeast Syria would move aside and clear the way for an expected Turkish assault, essentially abandoning the Kurds who fought alongside American forces in the attempt to defeat Islamic State militants. Captured ISIS militants have been freeing themselves from prison as the region descends into a dangerous chaos. Last night Trump announced a halt to negotiations on a $100 billion trade deal with Turkey and began other sanctions, including raising steel tariffs back up to 50% and actions against three senior Turkish officials and Turkey\u2019s defense and energy ministries. Opposition to these announcements can be summarized thus: a day late and a dollar short. Especially for the Kurdish militia in what had been a semi-autonomous area of north-eastern Syria, and civilians now caught between Turkish and Syrian interests. The latest news from the region, as reported by the Guardian\u2019s Bethan McKernan, is that Russian troops are now patrolling in the area \u201cin a clear sign that Moscow has become the de facto power broker in the region after the evacuation of US troops.\u201d It\u2019s the week that diplomats you\u2019ve never heard of are attending closed door hearings in Washington to testify before the House intelligence committee, which is taking the lead on the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry. But their very obscurity (for the average outside-the-beltway peasant), and the in-camera nature of the hearings, is of vital importance. Open hearings with big names can be illuminating and move the dial in investigations, whether it\u2019s Trump-Russia or Trump-Ukraine, or whatever. But there\u2019s no denying they often descend into a partisan circus. Yesterday career diplomat and former top Russia aide, British-born Fiona Hill, who has worked during the administrations of no less than six presidents, gave testimony for almost 10 hours. Some of the details that were later disclosed by indiscreet politicians are absolute dynamite. Today it\u2019s George Kent, whose title, ordinarily, would be an eye-glazer - Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs. But in the circumstances, with the White House trying to stop officials from testifying, folks like these are pure gold to investigators looking for sober facts about what the president\u2019s henchmen have been up to, where, when, with whom and why. The White House apparently attempted to block him, to no avail. Tomorrow it\u2019s Michael McKinley, who resigned last week as senior adviser to secretary of state Mike Pompeo, who has to be presiding over an increasingly-demoralized state department (what\u2019s left of it) as more details come out about Trump administration shenanigans in Ukraine, and the summary career-execution of former ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. On Thursday it\u2019s Gordon Sondland, who is defying a White House block in order to testify about being up to his sorry neck in the Ukraine scandal, despite being US ambassador to the European Union (of which Ukraine is not a member). He probably wishes he had the dignity of being able to call himself a career diplomat, instead of Trump Super Fan. And now to that Trump tweet. It seems this whole behind-closed-doors thing is really getting the president\u2019s goat. Listen, as the mainstream media, we\u2019d love nothing more than a seat in those committee hearings, but have to admit, reluctantly, that in-camera testimony is a logical move for Adam Schiff and his intel committee. Can Warren stay ahead? Before we had back to the impeachment cobbler, here\u2019s a look at that Quinnipiac University poll from late yesterday that noted Elizabeth Warren staying slightly ahead of Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic party nomination to fight for the White House in 2020 - and those two leaders leaving the rest of the pack seemingly further and further behind. Just a day before the Democratic debate tonight in Ohio, (with a special curtain-raiser piece by my politics colleague, Lauren Gambino) Quinnipiac reports that Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden \u201cremain locked in a close race for the top spot\u201d. In the latest opinion poll, Warren received 30 percent of the vote among Democratic voters and registered independents who lean towards voting Democratic, while Biden got 27 percent. Getting smaller in their rear-view mirrors, next placed was Bernie Sanders, with just 11 percent support. South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg was at eight percent and Senator and former California attorney general, Kamala Harris, was struggling at four percent. No other candidate topped even two percent - we\u2019re looking at you, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Juli\u00e1n Castro and the etceteras. This compares to an October 8 Quinnipiac University poll, in which Warren received 29 percent, Biden got 26 percent, and Sanders had 16 percent of the vote, just shortly after he suffered a heart attack on the campaign trail and was taken to hospital in Las Vegas. Former chief strategist for Barack Obama and regular TV pundit, David Axelrod, said on CNN last night that Warren \u201cwill be stepping up there tonight as a front-runner, if not the front-runner\u201d and striving to cement that position. Warren tweeting more than Trump At least, today. Donald Trump has only tweeted once this morning - and we\u2019ll come on to that in a sec. Meanwhile, the Warren digits are flying across the keyboard with her latest \u201cplan for that\u201d on campaign financing. \u201cWhen I\u2019m the Democratic nominee,\u201d she states, her campaign will continue to eschew donations from federal lobbyists of Political Action Committees (PACs). And she\u2019s just announced that she won\u2019t take any contributions over $200 from Big Tech and Big Finance execs, affirming that she\u2019s running a grassroots campaign. In a flurry of tweets, she also notes that \u201cwhen I\u2019m president\u201d she will \u201celiminate big money\u201d from US politics. She wants new campaign finance laws in order to \u201cshut down corruption\u201d and she is keen to pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Supreme Court decisions that lifted restrictions on what she calls \u201cmoney for influence\u201d election spending. Climate crisis and inequality: the green gap An environmental justice forum for presidential candidates in the 2020 election will take place on 8 November in South Carolina, the National Black Caucus of State Legislators (NBCSL) has just announced, my colleague Nina Lakhani, Guardian US environmental justice reporter, writes. This is the first event focussed on environmental and climate justice issues - such as access in the United States to clean air and water, public transport, healthy food, and flood resistance -which disproportionately affect people of colour, indigenous and low income communities. Inequality around such essentials has been called a \u201ccivil rights emergency\u201d in the age of Donald Trump. It will be a Q&amp;A format with candidates to appear on stage one by one in the Martin Luther King Jr. Auditorium of South Carolina State University. Questions for candidates can be submitted via ejpresforum.org. Unsurprisingly, US Senator and currently Democratic front-runner-by-a-whisker, Elizabeth Warren is one of the first to confirm that she\u2019ll take part. Last week Warren published an ambitious plan to tackle decades of environmental discrimination. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), former Maryland US Representative John Delaney (who is still in the 2020 race, at least officially and in his own mind, despite not making the party threshold for appearing in the debates these days), and entrepreneur Tom Steyer, who makes his debate debut tonight, have also confirmed. You can check here for an up-to-date list of participants ejpresforum.org. NBCSL is partnering with a bunch of interesting groups for the event including the Pee Dee Indian Tribe of South Carolina, South Carolina Environmental Justice Network, WE ACT for Environmental Justice, NAACP, National Wildlife Federation, National Children\u2019s Campaign, and South Carolina State University. The event signals how pressing environmental justice issues are in the country\u2019s most marginalized communities - yet it\u2019s an area most candidates have yet to address. NBCSL President Gilda Cobb-Hunter, said the event, \u2018Moving Vulnerable Communities from Surviving to Thriving\u2019 will give candidates a rare opportunity for candidates to show votes \u201cwhere they stand on clean water, clean air and so many of the important issues that people living on the front lines of environmental degradation face. \u201dCandidates who want to earn the votes of communities impacted by environmental justice should step up, hear our concerns and explain their plans for a cleaner, healthier future for all\u2026 [and] show us where they stand on clean water, clean air and so many of the important issues that people living on the front lines of environmental degradation face.\u201d The NBCSL will hold a second event on gun violence and mental health in December at its Annual Legislative Conference in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The US Congress returns to business today after a two-week recess. Things have been far from quiet on Capitol Hill, with the impeachment inquiry going full steam ahead via committee sittings and a flurry of subpoenas demanding documents and testimony from witnesses, in the face of the White House declaration that it won\u2019t cooperate with the inquiry. But the majority of lawmakers have been back in their districts, out and about listening to voters, and now that they\u2019re back in session. Something outside of the impeachment storm that\u2019s coming up is a likely attempt by Democrats in the Senate (remember them? They\u2019ve been taking a solid back seat to House Democrats who are A. in the majority and B. leading the impeachment inquiry) to force votes on action to address the climate crisis, gun control, healthcare provision and other policies. Democrats, led in the Senate by New York\u2019s Chuck Schumer, aim to oblige a floor vote on these issues, including Trump administration\u2019s ongoing attempts to roll back the emissions controls kicked off by the Obama administration\u2019s clean power plan. In a statement, Schumer said that Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell \u201cand Senate Republicans have shunned vital proposals to improve American\u2019s lives, including those to address the climate crisis and gun violence epidemic, save protections for people with pre-existing conditions, secure our elections, get big special interest money out of politics and more.\u201d Good morning, US politics watchers, it\u2019s another huge day in Washington \u2013 and Ohio. The fourth Democratic primary debate takes place in Westerville, near Columbus, Ohio, tonight (8pm ET) and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has crept into the lead in latest polling. This is the first time we could consider that, perhaps, Joe Biden is no longer the frontrunner. Warren will be extremely keen to consolidate her position tonight, and she and Biden can see the rest of the field slipping behind. Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, also today (of all days) gave his first TV interview about the Ukraine mess, regretting that he got involved in the business-political \u201cswamp\u201d out there. Understatement. It is also a crucial night for Bernie Sanders, attempting to bounce back after a heart attack. He\u2019ll feel the spotlight hot on his brow tonight. In Washington, the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry continues at breakneck speed. George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state, testifies on Capitol Hill behind closed doors, a day after former top Russia aide Fiona Hill testified for almost 10 hours, after which incredible details oozed out via lawmakers. She reported that Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, has been referred to as a human \u201chand grenade\u201d. Also, federal prosecutors are reported to be scrutinizing Rudy Giuliani\u2019s business and political dealings with regard to Ukraine and Trump\u2019s purported \u201cshadow foreign policy\u201d serving his own ends in the region, the Wall Street Journal says. And, in northern Syria, the US is scrambling to remove its remaining troops safely as the Trump administration itself scrambles to try to rein in Turkey\u2019s military advance, which it is largely accused of facilitating, to the cost of Kurdish allies.

Legislation for the first phase linking London and Birmingham has been enacted, while the bill for an extension to Crewe was reannounced in the Queen\u2019s speech, leaving the northern sections most vulnerable to the axe. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, announced last month that the cost of the entire scheme was now forecast to reach \u00a388bn, with a construction delay of five to seven years. Shapps said reports that Oakervee\u2019s review would be delivered on Friday and recommend scrapping the eastern leg were \u201ctotally untrue\u201d. A DfT spokesman said the Oakervee review would \u201cprovide the government with clear advice on how and whether the project should proceed\u201d. He added: \u201cAs the prime minister recently set out, this government wants to drive growth across the north including through Northern Powerhouse Rail and giving local leaders a greater say in the running of the railway.\u201d",

The unseeded Arsenal, who are England\u2019s other team in the tournament and who could have faced the holders Lyon, were handed the kinder tie against Slavia Prague.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/15/arsenal-wsl-joe-montemurro-small-squad\">Will Montemurro\u2019s small squad come back to haunt Arsenal this season? | Suzanne Wrack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It has been a tough year for Duggan, who joined Barcelona alongside the star of the Netherlands\u2019 Euro 2017 campaign Lieke Martens to help usher in a new era of investment in Catalonia. She left Bar\u00e7a this summer after a season which the club ended empty handed, having lost a Copa de la Reina semi-final against Atl\u00e9tico and finished six points behind Atl\u00e9ti in the league.</p> <p>A somewhat surprising Champions League run, helped by a kind draw, to a first final was tempered by<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/18/lyon-barcelona-womens-champions-league-final-match-report\" title=\"\"> a bruising 4-1 defeat to Lyon</a>. While Duggan was hardworking but fairly anonymous at one end of the pitch, a 16-minute hat-trick from Ada Hegerberg up the other end, after Dszenifer Marozs\u00e1n\u2019s early opener, stole the show and crushed Bar\u00e7a.</p> <p>Duggan was distraught that night. Tearstained and struggling to stay composed, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing. As a footballer I want to come here and win, I don\u2019t want to just be here for the occasion. I\u2019m really sad, that\u2019s understandable right now but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll look back on it in the future and realise we created history.\u201d</p> <p>Looking to put the defeat behind her she left for France with England, but her World Cup campaign was hampered from the off when she picked up a thigh strain in the first training session in the French Riviera.

      "bodyText": "The England forward Toni Duggan will face a familiar foe when she pulls on the red and white of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in Manchester on Wednesday night. The 28-year-old was a key part of the Manchester City project, spending four years at the club and helping them to a first League Cup win, a first Women\u2019s Super League title and another League Cup in 2016, and a first FA Cup in 2017. Now, she will face her former club for the first time, competitively, since departing for Spain, in the tastiest fixture of the Champions League last 16. The unseeded Arsenal, who are England\u2019s other team in the tournament and who could have faced the holders Lyon, were handed the kinder tie against Slavia Prague. It has been a tough year for Duggan, who joined Barcelona alongside the star of the Netherlands\u2019 Euro 2017 campaign Lieke Martens to help usher in a new era of investment in Catalonia. She left Bar\u00e7a this summer after a season which the club ended empty handed, having lost a Copa de la Reina semi-final against Atl\u00e9tico and finished six points behind Atl\u00e9ti in the league. A somewhat surprising Champions League run, helped by a kind draw, to a first final was tempered by a bruising 4-1 defeat to Lyon. While Duggan was hardworking but fairly anonymous at one end of the pitch, a 16-minute hat-trick from Ada Hegerberg up the other end, after Dszenifer Marozs\u00e1n\u2019s early opener, stole the show and crushed Bar\u00e7a. Duggan was distraught that night. Tearstained and struggling to stay composed, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing. As a footballer I want to come here and win, I don\u2019t want to just be here for the occasion. I\u2019m really sad, that\u2019s understandable right now but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll look back on it in the future and realise we created history.\u201d Looking to put the defeat behind her she left for France with England, but her World Cup campaign was hampered from the off when she picked up a thigh strain in the first training session in the French Riviera. The forward supposedly shook off that knock but did not look her usual self when out on the left wing, with the toll of a long season also undoubtedly playing its part. But a new season brings a new journey. Duggan, having scored in Barcelona\u2019s 2-0 defeat of Atl\u00e9ti in front of a league record 60,739 fans last campaign, switched to the league winners this summer. A rollercoaster start to the season, however, has showed that this is not the same Atl\u00e9tico Madrid side that outclassed Manchester City in the round of 32 last season. In their second league game of the season, for example, they suffered a humiliating and shocking 6-1 defeat to Barcelona. A 90th-minute goal from Virginia Torrecilla ensured a 3-2 victory in Serbia against Spartak Subotica in the Champions League round of 32 first leg before a tense second game ended 1-1 to set up the meeting with City. The team are third in the league, only a point behind Bar\u00e7a and second-placed Deportivo de la Coru\u00f1a, and it is not quite time to panic in Madrid, but with the manager Jos\u00e9 Luis S\u00e1nchez Vera departing \u2013 for personal, rather than performance-related, reasons according to the club \u2013 Atl\u00e9ti are going through a difficult period. The fairly unknown Pablo L\u00f3pez, who has managed men\u2019s teams in Segunda B and the third and fourth divisions, has stepped in until the end of the season. The trip to the north west of England will be his second game in charge, having started with a 1-0 win at Levante on Saturday. The game on Wednesday could not have offered a bigger test of his nascent tenure. City are flying in all competitions. Nick Cushing\u2019s team are unbeaten and have only conceded once in seven games. Revenge for last season\u2019s frustrating Champions League exit, beaten 2-0 at home after drawing 1-1 in Madrid, will be on their minds too. In Duggan, though, Atl\u00e9tico perhaps have the key to unlocking City if they can take advantage of her knowledge of the opposition manager and pick her brains on how to handle the 11 City players that she has played with internationally.",

      "bodyText": "Britain needs to take concerted action to reduce the risk of malicious actors in the UK and abroad from contaminating the results of a looming general election, according to a new study that warns of the risks of public \u201cabuse and deception\u201d. A group of experts say government, political parties and social media companies all need to take immediate action, at a time when there is rising concern within Whitehall about the integrity of the democratic process. Lisa-Maria Neudert, who acted as the secretary to the author of the study, the Oxford Technology and Elections Commission, said there was growing recognition that \u201cmanipulation and propaganda which was only thought to happen in authoritarian regimes can happen in democracies like the UK\u201d. The research calls for: The Electoral Commission to verify the social media accounts of all candidates and registered campaigners to prevent fraudulent accounts taking advantage. Political parties to monitor all the digital communications they produce and to maintain an archive in publicly accessible databases to ensure transparency. All social media companies, including Facebook and Twitter, to warn promptly when they suspect foreign interference or other meddling is taking place. Concern has been rising in government circles about electoral integrity in the UK. The Cabinet Office is nominally responsible but intelligence agencies have been taking a growing interest in the rise of state disinformation online, principally from Russia and China. There have been repeated warnings about Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, as well as questions about the impact of microtargeted internet advertising during the EU referendum, and the commission\u2019s researchers, at Oxford University, believe the risks remain current. During the European election campaign of the early summer, they highlighted the sharing of \u201cextremist, sensationalist or conspiratorial junk news\u201d typically involving anti-immigration and Islamophobic sentiment across the continent. One example cited was the Notre Dame Cathedral fire, in Paris, in April which while not immediately a political story, was manipulated during the campaign period for what amounted to political purposes by Russian and other social media accounts. They unearthed a trail of propaganda furthering the false idea that the fire in the Gothic cathedral was started by Islamist terrorists, or that plans for reconstructing the Paris landmark would include a minaret. \u201cWe want social media companies to help us understand why such stories are so widely shared by their algorithms,\u201d Neudert said. \u201cThey should be required to release information so we can understand why such disinformation so easily spreads.\u201d Other specific risks highlighted included the use of \u201cnon-transparent\u201d, or dark, advertising where money can be spent on targeting voters by political actors without any visibility \u2013 unless a record is taken. Facebook, for example, maintains an archive of political adverts, but not all technology companies do. The reporting is not standardised, meaning that \u201cis usually rendered useless for statistical analysis because of inconsistent or incomplete metrics that make it impossible to compare and understand trends\u201d. Ministers have outlined plans to require people to bring photo ID to polling stations in order to vote in a future election, but while the proposal was mentioned in the Queen\u2019s speech, on Monday, it was not accompanied by a promise for wider reform of election law.",

      "bodyText": "With an AR-15 assault rifle in his hand and six spare magazines across his chest, the burly policemen looked nothing if not intimidating as he prepared to attend a memorial service for 13 fellow officers who were killed in an ambush in western Mexico on Monday. Inside, he didn\u2019t feel so tough. \u201cWe feel impotent, we feel alone,\u201d the officer said, asking for his name not be used for fear of reprisals from his superiors. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any support.\u201d At least 30 gunmen opened fire on the convoy of state police officers as they drove along a rural road in the municipality of Aguililla in the state of Michoac\u00e1n early on Monday morning. The ambush was the latest in a string of brazen attacks by the Jalisco New Generation cartel (known by its Spanish initials CJNG), and represents a direct challenge to Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s promise to end Mexico\u2019s security crisis while avoiding direct conflict with organized crime groups. President L\u00f3pez Obrador, widely known as Amlo, insists the military-led offensives against the cartels pursued by his two predecessors have only made things worse, and has instead focused on crime prevention. Meanwhile, a 70,000-strong militarized police force called the National Guard has drawn criticism for being used heavily to keep migrants from reaching the US border. Asked about the ambush on Tuesday, Amlo said the government would continue with its strategy. \u201cThis is a violent area, and we are going to continue attending to the causes of this kind of social decomposition,\u201d he said. According to Falko Ernst, Mexico analyst of the Crisis Group, the problem is that this focus on the long term is allowing entrenched conflicts, like the one in Michoac\u00e1n, to spin out of control. \u201cThere is no short-term strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the very least, these groups are getting the message that the leash is loose \u2013 and it makes sense for them to test how far they can go.\u201d Monday\u2019s ambush was claimed by the CJNG, which is currently fighting to seize the region known as Tierra Caliente \u2013 the Hot Land \u2013 from a litany of other armed groups. These include the remnants of older cartels partially dismantled by government offensives of the past (such as the once-dominant Knights Templar), former armed vigilante groups and the different police forces \u2013 all of which are deeply corroded by links to organized crime. Two active officers and one former officer at Tuesday\u2019s memorial services, speaking on condition of anonymity, accepted that the state police force is riddled with corruption. They blamed the commanders who they said gave their subordinates no choice but to follow orders \u2013 even if these were orders meant acting in ways that favoured the interests of criminal groups. They also said that they suspected senior commanders knew of an impending attack when they sent the officers to Aguililla to serve a a warrant related to a dispute in a family court. One officer said it was almost unheard of for police to go into that area without an army escort because it is known to be so dangerous. \u201cThey were sent to the slaughter,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a lot of anger.\u201d While the police officers at the memorial service held in the state capital Morelia remained stony-faced, several grieving relatives were not so restrained. A speech by Governor Silvando Aureoles \u2013 who called for all Mexico to stand together to against criminals \u201cwho are on the lowest rung of the human ladder\u201d \u2013was greeted with tepid applause. But as he left a smattering of female voices screamed out \u201c\u00a1Asesino!\u201d and a small group began a chant of \u201cJusticia.\u201d Though their voices faded, their sentiment prompted mumblings of agreement throughout the crowd. \u201cThis ceremony is a mockery \u2013 a chance for the bosses to pretend that they care,\u201d said the brother of one officer, whose death leaves his five-months pregnant wife and one-year-old child without support. \u201cWe are only here so that he is not forgotten.\u201d",

Comyn, who faces shareholders at the bank\u2019s annual meeting on Wednesday, was questioned about whistleblower Tim Cradock during parliamentary hearings in October last year. Cradock, who is suing the bank in the federal court for failing to protect him as a whistleblower, was sacked in April 2013 after making complaints that he was bullied by his manager and that staff were using two scams to beef up their bonuses. In one of the alleged rorts, staff were swapping internal referrals to make each other\u2019s performance look better, while in the other they met a benchmark by depositing loose change left behind in the branch into Youthsaver accounts to activate them. The CBA denies Comyn misled parliament. A spokesman told Guardian Australia that Comyn\u2019s answer referred to allegations raised by Cradock in 2017, when he was granted whistleblower status. \u201cMatt Comyn\u2019s response was that Tim Cradock\u2019s redundancy occurred a significant period of time before he raised his allegations as a whistleblower,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cThis is correct.\u201d Cradock declined to comment because the case is before the court. However, his wife, who asked to remain anonymous because the couple have school-age children, said her husband\u2019s life had been turned upside down after he was sacked and \u201cmarched out of the building like a criminal\u201d. \u201cMy ambitious, positive, energetic and fun-loving husband had vanished and in his place was a humiliated, reclusive and physiologically broken person (although at the time he didn\u2019t want to admit it), a mere shadow of his former self,\u201d she said. Documents obtained by Guardian Australia show that Cradock, who worked in a part of the bank specialising in marketing to multicultural communities, first complained to the bank\u2019s human resources department on 26 February 2013. In a 12-page letter, copied to Comyn, who was head of retail banking at the time, Cradock claimed he had been bullied by his manager, raised concerns about the use of referrals to artificially boost performance measurements and complained that the bank\u2019s management of his division. He updated his complaint on 16 March 2013, adding concerns about the Youthsaver issue and again sending it to Comyn. However, Comyn told parliament his \u201conly involvement\u201d with the Youthsaver issue at this time was an email that was sent to all branch staff a few days earlier, warning them against the practice. \u201cI did nothing to go further into the subsequent investigation, and if I had my time again I would have,\u201d Comyn told parliament. CBA\u2019s HR department dismissed Cradock\u2019s bullying on 27 March 2013 and he was dismissed a week later on 3 April. The bank\u2019s spokesman said that Cradock was sacked as the result of a redundancy program that \u201chad already commenced rolling out in the months before the original complaint was lodged on 27 February\u201d. \u201cHe was not considered a whistleblower at the time, nor did he describe himself as one. \u201cHis HR complaint was investigated and found to be unsubstantiated before his employment was terminated due to a redundancy arising from a restructuring. Both the restructuring and the redundancy were unrelated to his complaint.\u201d The bank eventually recognised Cradock as a whistleblower in 2017 and hired law firm Minter Ellison to investigate his claims. Cradock\u2019s wife said she questioned how the Minter Ellison investigation could be independent when the law firm also represented CBA in a rate manipulation case brought against it by the corporate regulator. She said that \u201cwhistleblower policies and processes are great in theory but when they are blatantly used to cover up misconduct at the most senior levels of an organisation they aren\u2019t worth the piece of paper they are written on\u201d. \u201cChange can and should be driven from the top.

Trump\u2019s executive order on Monday imposed a 50% tariff on imports of Turkish steel, called off what officials called a $100bn bilateral trade deal and gave the state department and Treasury wide powers to impose targeted sanctions on Turkish officials. However, both administration critics and sanctions analysts said the administration proposal looked more imposing than it was in reality. The White House has yet to rescind a White House invitation to Erdo\u011fan which Trump offered to the Turkish president after being informed of the imminent offensive. And Trump\u2019s sanctions package does not affect US military support to Turkey. Furthermore it was unclear whether a $100bn trade deal administration officials said had been shelved had ever existed in the first place. Daniel Tannebaum, a former sanctions official, now head of sanctions at Oliver Wyman management consultants, said: \u201cThere has not been any evidence of a deal matching what was described. So there were some shoulder shrugs when this was announced. People asked: \u2018What are you referring to?\u2019\u201d Senator van Hollen called the Trump measures a \u201cpathetic response\u201d, pointing out that steel exports to the US were a fraction of one per cent of Turkey\u2019s total exports. The Trump administration also has a record of slow-rolling sanctions against regimes where the president believes he has a strong personal relationship with the leader, such as Russia and Saudi Arabia. Turkish equity markets spiked when markets opened on Tuesday, in an apparent sign of relief at the limited nature of the US response to the Syria invasion. In Washington the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said: \u201cPresident Trump has unleashed an escalation of chaos and insecurity in Syria. His announcement of a package of sanctions against Turkey falls very short of reversing that humanitarian disaster.\u201d Peter Harrell, former deputy assistant secretary of state for counter threat finance and sanctions, said: \u201cThe executive order has the potential to really be quite broad and impose quite draconian sanctions, but the targets the administration has picked to date have been low to mid-range \u2026 So I think there\u2019s sort of a substantive concern that the president doesn\u2019t actually intend to be particularly aggressive here.\u201d The most important difference between the congressional and administration sanctions packages could be the issue of military support. The Turkish army and air force is largely reliant on the US to keep up operations. Administration officials have been hesitant about imposing such military sanctions, for fear of pushing Turkey out of Nato altogether, though critics have argued that it has ceased to be an ally in any meaningful sense anyway. \u201cIf the Trump administration were truly serious about rolling back Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria, it would immediately cut off all US arms supplies to the Turkish military, including spare parts and maintenance,\u201d William Hartung, director of the arms and security project at the Center for International Policy. \u201cTurkey relies on the US for all of its combat aircraft and two-thirds of its armoured vehicles, so a full withdrawal of US support could degrade its fighting capability. And it would send a stronger message than the minimal economic measures the administration has taken thus far.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson has joined demands by anti-racism campaigners for Uefa to take strong action after the racist chanting that marred England\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria on Monday night.</p> \n<p>European football\u2019s governing body has opened disciplinary proceedings against the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) for racist behaviour of its supporters after the incidents at the Vasil Levski Stadium in Sofia, in which some home fans made monkey noises at Tyrone Mings, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford in the 6-0 victory for Gareth Southgate\u2019s side.</p> \n<p>The BFU was also charged over Nazi salutes by fans and the throwing of objects from the stands, while they and the English Football Association (FA) were both charged over the disruption of national anthems. The FA also faces a separate charge of having insufficient travelling stewards.</p> \n<p>The match was halted twice during the first half under Uefa\u2019s anti-racism protocols after Mings and Southgate alerted officials about the abuse, with television pictures at half-time also showing several fans using Nazi salutes. Their actions were condemned by the anti-\u00addiscrimination groups Kick It Out and Fare, while the FA chairman, Greg Clarke \u2013 who is also vice-president of Uefa \u2013 called for the authorities to now show \u201czero tolerance\u201d. The sports minister, Nigel Adams, has \u00adwritten to the Uefa president, Aleksander \u010ceferin, offering support and asking him to take \u201curgent action\u201d after the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said the incidents were a \u201cstain on football\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe England players and management showed tremendous dignity and the prime minister commends the players who were targeted for this \u00addespicable abuse for their response,\u201d he added. \u201cWe support the FA\u2019s calls for an urgent investigation with tough penalties to follow.\u201d</p> \n<p>A section of the stadium was closed for Monday\u2019s game after Uefa imposed sanctions over racist incidents during Bulgaria\u2019s qualifiers against Kosovo and the Czech Republic in June.</p> \n<p>The punishment will also apply in the home game against the Czech Republic next month. The next step would be to implement a full stadium closure, as was the case with Montenegro after England\u2019s players endured similar racial abuse during the qualifier in Podgorica in March, although Uefa\u2019s disciplinary panel is allowed to go much further and has the power to expel a country from a tournament.</p> \n<p>However, Bulgaria is expected to argue that those responsible for the problems were in the minority and dealt with by stadium stewards.</p> \n<p>A group of about 50 people, who are understood to have been members of club side Lokomotiv Plovdiv\u2019s \u201cultras\u201d group Lauta Army, were asked to leave at half-time. \u010ceferin has defended Uefa\u2019s punishments for racism as \u201camong the toughest in sport\u201d and called on for a \u201cwar\u201d on \u00addiscrimination but added that it would require the help of governments and the whole \u201cfootball family\u201d to tackle the problem.</p> \n<p>\u201cBelieve me, Uefa is committed to doing everything it can to eliminate this disease from football,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot afford to be content with this. We must always strive to strengthen our resolve.</p> \n<p>\u201cMore broadly, the football family\u2013 everyone from administrators to players, coaches and fans \u2013 needs to work with governments and NGOs to wage war on the racists and to \u00admarginalise their abhorrent views to the fringes of society.\u201d He added: \u201cFootball associations themselves cannot solve this problem. Governments to0 need to do more.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Kick It Out demanded that Uefa should consider a points \u00addeduction or tournament expulsion. \u201cThe fines from Uefa we don\u2019t think are enough,\u201d chief executive, Roisin Wood, said on the Today programme. \u201cThere have to be serious steps now, and that should include looking at expulsion or not letting people enter \u00adtournaments, because there has to be a clear message. This is 2019. These are \u00adprofessional players going out to play. You would never expect to get this in your workplace so why should \u00adprofessional players get it in theirs?\u201d</p> \n<p>Gianni Infantino, president of Fifa, the world game\u2019s governing body, said he wanted \u201call football governing \u00adbodies to join us and think together of new, stronger and more effective ways to eradicate racism in football\u201d.</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cAs a starting point, I \u00adsuggest that all competition organisers enact regulations which envisage life bans from stadiums for those who are found guilty of racist behaviour at a football match. Fifa can then enforce such bans at a worldwide level.\u201d</p> \n<p>Borislav Mihaylov, the BFU\u2019s president, has resigned after the prime minister, Boyko Borissov, demanded that he stepped down following his comments before the match last week. The former Reading goalkeeper had urged Uefa to take action against \u00adEngland after the Chelsea striker, Tammy Abraham, said \u00adSouthgate\u2019s side would walk off the pitch if they heard racist chanting.</p> \n<p>\u201cAfter last night\u2019s shameful defeat and given the bad results our football has registered recently, I\u2019ve told sports minister Krasen Kralev to end all kind of relationships with the BFU, \u00adincluding financial ones,\u201d Borissov wrote on his Facebook page. \u201cI also strongly condemn the behaviour of some of the fans that were in the stands. It\u2019s absolutely unacceptable for Bulgaria, which is one of the most tolerant countries in the world [and] where people of different ethnic and religious origins live together in peace, to be associated with racism.\u201d</p> \n<p>That reaction was applauded by the Manchester City and England forward Sterling, who was also on the receiving end of racist abuse in Montenegro. \u201cA good move credits to you M. Borissov,\u201d Sterling wrote on Twitter. But the Bulgaria goalkeeper, Plamen Iliev, saw it differently after the match, claiming the home supporters had \u201cbehaved well\u201d and that England\u2019s players had \u201coverreacted a bit\u201d.</p> \n<p>Yet the Aston Villa defender Mings, who was making his first international appearance on Monday, admitted he had spoken out because he felt a duty to report the abuse.\u201cIt didn\u2019t affect my feelings,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u2019m quite lucky in that way because I don\u2019t feel like it is a personal assault. I feel sorry for the people who have those views. But I also have a duty to represent people that don\u2019t have a voice. It was important that it was bigger than me, bigger than what I felt.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has joined demands by anti-racism campaigners for Uefa to take strong action after the racist chanting that marred England\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria on Monday night. European football\u2019s governing body has opened disciplinary proceedings against the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) for racist behaviour of its supporters after the incidents at the Vasil Levski Stadium in Sofia, in which some home fans made monkey noises at Tyrone Mings, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford in the 6-0 victory for Gareth Southgate\u2019s side. The BFU was also charged over Nazi salutes by fans and the throwing of objects from the stands, while they and the English Football Association (FA) were both charged over the disruption of national anthems. The FA also faces a separate charge of having insufficient travelling stewards. The match was halted twice during the first half under Uefa\u2019s anti-racism protocols after Mings and Southgate alerted officials about the abuse, with television pictures at half-time also showing several fans using Nazi salutes. Their actions were condemned by the anti-discrimination groups Kick It Out and Fare, while the FA chairman, Greg Clarke \u2013 who is also vice-president of Uefa \u2013 called for the authorities to now show \u201czero tolerance\u201d. The sports minister, Nigel Adams, has written to the Uefa president, Aleksander \u010ceferin, offering support and asking him to take \u201curgent action\u201d after the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said the incidents were a \u201cstain on football\u201d. \u201cThe England players and management showed tremendous dignity and the prime minister commends the players who were targeted for this despicable abuse for their response,\u201d he added. \u201cWe support the FA\u2019s calls for an urgent investigation with tough penalties to follow.\u201d A section of the stadium was closed for Monday\u2019s game after Uefa imposed sanctions over racist incidents during Bulgaria\u2019s qualifiers against Kosovo and the Czech Republic in June. The punishment will also apply in the home game against the Czech Republic next month. The next step would be to implement a full stadium closure, as was the case with Montenegro after England\u2019s players endured similar racial abuse during the qualifier in Podgorica in March, although Uefa\u2019s disciplinary panel is allowed to go much further and has the power to expel a country from a tournament. However, Bulgaria is expected to argue that those responsible for the problems were in the minority and dealt with by stadium stewards. A group of about 50 people, who are understood to have been members of club side Lokomotiv Plovdiv\u2019s \u201cultras\u201d group Lauta Army, were asked to leave at half-time. \u010ceferin has defended Uefa\u2019s punishments for racism as \u201camong the toughest in sport\u201d and called on for a \u201cwar\u201d on discrimination but added that it would require the help of governments and the whole \u201cfootball family\u201d to tackle the problem. \u201cBelieve me, Uefa is committed to doing everything it can to eliminate this disease from football,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot afford to be content with this. We must always strive to strengthen our resolve. \u201cMore broadly, the football family\u2013 everyone from administrators to players, coaches and fans \u2013 needs to work with governments and NGOs to wage war on the racists and to marginalise their abhorrent views to the fringes of society.\u201d He added: \u201cFootball associations themselves cannot solve this problem. Governments to0 need to do more.\u201d But Kick It Out demanded that Uefa should consider a points deduction or tournament expulsion. \u201cThe fines from Uefa we don\u2019t think are enough,\u201d chief executive, Roisin Wood, said on the Today programme. \u201cThere have to be serious steps now, and that should include looking at expulsion or not letting people enter tournaments, because there has to be a clear message. This is 2019. These are professional players going out to play. You would never expect to get this in your workplace so why should professional players get it in theirs?\u201d Gianni Infantino, president of Fifa, the world game\u2019s governing body, said he wanted \u201call football governing bodies to join us and think together of new, stronger and more effective ways to eradicate racism in football\u201d. He added: \u201cAs a starting point, I suggest that all competition organisers enact regulations which envisage life bans from stadiums for those who are found guilty of racist behaviour at a football match. Fifa can then enforce such bans at a worldwide level.\u201d Borislav Mihaylov, the BFU\u2019s president, has resigned after the prime minister, Boyko Borissov, demanded that he stepped down following his comments before the match last week. The former Reading goalkeeper had urged Uefa to take action against England after the Chelsea striker, Tammy Abraham, said Southgate\u2019s side would walk off the pitch if they heard racist chanting. \u201cAfter last night\u2019s shameful defeat and given the bad results our football has registered recently, I\u2019ve told sports minister Krasen Kralev to end all kind of relationships with the BFU, including financial ones,\u201d Borissov wrote on his Facebook page. \u201cI also strongly condemn the behaviour of some of the fans that were in the stands. It\u2019s absolutely unacceptable for Bulgaria, which is one of the most tolerant countries in the world [and] where people of different ethnic and religious origins live together in peace, to be associated with racism.\u201d That reaction was applauded by the Manchester City and England forward Sterling, who was also on the receiving end of racist abuse in Montenegro. \u201cA good move credits to you M. Borissov,\u201d Sterling wrote on Twitter. But the Bulgaria goalkeeper, Plamen Iliev, saw it differently after the match, claiming the home supporters had \u201cbehaved well\u201d and that England\u2019s players had \u201coverreacted a bit\u201d. Yet the Aston Villa defender Mings, who was making his first international appearance on Monday, admitted he had spoken out because he felt a duty to report the abuse.\u201cIt didn\u2019t affect my feelings,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u2019m quite lucky in that way because I don\u2019t feel like it is a personal assault. I feel sorry for the people who have those views. But I also have a duty to represent people that don\u2019t have a voice. It was important that it was bigger than me, bigger than what I felt.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Clashes between protesters and police erupted in Barcelona late on Tuesday after peaceful demonstrations over the jailing of nine Catalan separatist leaders descended into running battles. Protesters lit fires and erected makeshift barricades in the centre of the city before the crowd was dispersed by baton charges by Spanish and Catalan police, as far as Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, the elegant boulevard that is home to many of the city\u2019s most exclusive shops and hotels. By mid-evening, dozens of fires had been lit on the boulevard and surrounding streets as helicopters hovered overhead. Makeshift barricades were set up with rubbish containers as skirmishes between demonstrators and police continued, with riot police firing numerous rounds of rubber bullets. Similar scenes were witnessed in the other main Catalan cities of Tarragona, Girona and Lleida, where dozens of people were reportedly injured. Earlier in the day, the grassroots organisation Assamblea Nacional Catalana (ANC) called for a candlelit protest outside the offices of the Spanish government in Barcelona and other Spanish cities in response to Monday\u2019s sentencing of the nine Catalan politicians and activists for their part in the illegal referendum and unilateral declaration of independence in 2017. The disturbances follow violence on Monday night when thousands of pro-independence protesters attempted to shut down Barcelona airport, leading to police charges that left more than 130 people injured. Although Tuesday\u2019s demonstrations were called by the ANC, which has previously organised the independence movement\u2019s peaceful and spectacular demonstrations, it appears that it has lost the initiative to the so-called Committees for the Defence of the Republic (CDRs) who favour direct action and confrontation. The CDRs are thought to be behind the Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic, the social network group that coordinated Monday\u2019s airport protest. The Catalan president, Quim Torra, has been criticised for calling for civil disobedience while also sending in Catalan riot police to restore order. Torra said on Tuesday that the convicted prisoners were proud of the demonstrators and urged them to continue to mobilise over the coming days. A major demonstration and general strike has been called for Friday.",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for joining me! Not a great result or performance from Republic of Ireland tonight but their destiny is still in their own hands, even if they do need to beat Denmark. Here is the report from the Ireland game: And our roundup of the rest of the qualifiers: I have to go tell Mrs LiveBlogger than Romania conceded a last-minute equaliser. She will be raging. Sky are showing Gibraltar\u2019s goals against Georgia, which came from two cross. Maybe Ireland could learn something. Stephen Ward\u2019s continued positivity is concerning. Big Mick: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a second half we can be proud of.\u201d Why was it such a slow start? \u201cBecause they started fast. They\u2019re a good team.\u201d \u201cWe haven\u2019t scored that many goals, have we? We are missing our best striker. \u201cIt\u2019s a cup final on the 18th November at the Aviva [against Denmark]. I would have taken that.\u201d Darren Randolph: \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to lose with them scoring in the last minute with the last kick of the game but they\u2019re a good team. We have another chance next month to get the win at home. \u201cIt was a harsh sending off from my view, seeing it live.\u201d Good luck. Aaron Connolly: \u201cThe second half performance deserved something but we\u2019ve come away from nothing, so we can\u2019t complain.\u201d The forward did not seem too cheery in general. Stephen Ward is being very polite as he hates mates in the Ireland team but they were awful. Jeff Hendrick: \u201cI think we were pretty poor the first half - it was there for everyone to see. \u201cWe tried to get the ball moving and pass it a bit more but it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cWhen we got into their final third our final pass wasn\u2019t good enough.\u201d Babb reminds us that Gibraltar scored twice against Georgia where Ireland could barely muster a shot. Why does Big Mick hate attacking? Baz says ... Phil Babb thinks Big Mick will be encouraged by the second-half performance, which is sweet. Obviously, it\u2019s nice that Ireland want to qualify for the Euros, but do they really want a wider audience for this brand of football? Finland 3-0 Armenia Faroe Islands 1-0 Malta Gibraltar2-3 Georgia Greece2-1 Bosnia-Herzegovina Israel 3-1 Latvia Liechtenstein 0-5 Italy Romania 1-1 Norway Sweden 1-1 Spain Switzerland 2-0 Rep of Ireland Late goals in Sweden and Switzerland. Rodrigo\u2019s for Spain sees them qualify for the Euros, while the latter just makes things worse Ireland. Check out all the FT scores HERE. The ball arrives at Fernandes\u2019 feet in the box, he sidefoots it towards goal, Duffy tries to stop it but only steers it into the back of the net. The ball is smashed across goal where it seems like everyone on the pitch is waiting but Rodrigo is the man to react as he jabs the ball home. 90 mins: Switzerland break but it comes to nothing. Three minutes added on. 89 mins: Spain are trying to find an equaliser but this mainly involves passing the ball side-to-side. Sweden\u2019s defence has been excellent throughout. 87 mins: Michael Meagher says: \u201cIf that pass had found its man it would have been a thing of beauty.\u201d As Barry Glendenning of your parish likes to say: \u201cIf my aunt had balls she\u2019d be my uncle.\u201d I am sure people other than Baz say that. Additionally, I am just trying to find positives in this Irish positive. 85 mins: Switzerland are just keeping the ball here, as they also look tired, so do not want to strain themselves. AND ANOTHER! Nothing to see here. 82 mins: The Irish are trying to put pressure on the ball but the state of the pitch seems to have tired them sufficiently. 80 mins: With only 10 men on the pitch, can Ireland salvage anything here? No. Classic Jolly All done an dusted in Liechtenstein. 77 mins: PENALTY SAVED! Rodriguez sends a low penalty to Randolph\u2019s left but the goalkeeper gets a big hand on it, tipping the ball onto the post. 76 mins: Penalty! Switzerland have a penalty after an Embolo shot is adjudged to have been blocked by Coleman\u2019s hand, which results in him being sent off. After being 2-0 down against Georgia, Gibraltar have pulled it back to 2-2!!! 74 mins: Duffy does it best to whack a simple pass out of play when he misdirects it but Stevens recovers the ball just in time. Ireland need to up things here. The Italians finally have a second after Belotti heads home a corner. 71 mins: Browne sends a long pass down the pitch for Hogan to chase but it is intercepted before the striker can get to it. If that pass had found its man it would have be a thing of beauty. 69 mins: Duffy will miss Ireland\u2019s next match after receiving a yellow following a tough but, in my opinion, fair challenge on Akanji. That\u2019s a blow for McCarthy. Hogan is on for Ireland, replacing Connolly. 67 mins: Oyarzabal curls in a free-kick but Sweden clear, only for a second cross to be sent into the box which a diving Moreno flicks wide. 64 mins: Rodriguez whips in a corner which Schar rises highest for, only to see his head hit the outside of the post. Embolo whacks the ball across the six-yard box but Ireland manage to clear the danger. 62 mins: Oyarzabal gets on the end of a Carvajal cross but he heads the ball up and over. 61 mins: Egan is up for a set-piece and in the end he gets the ball on the edge of the area, where he turns, only to drag a shot wide. Ireland have looked better since the break, mainly as they are playing with some intent rather than just whacking it long. 60 mins: De Gea looks to have done his hamstring and is being replaced by Kepa. Not good news for Manchester United ahead of their clash with Liverpool at the weekend. I hope Lee Grant is fit. 58 mins: It is pretty fair by the looks of things, it was just the opening sixth of the game which was underwhelming. 56 mins: Embolo tries to break through the Irish midfield but is crudely brought down by Hendrick, who goes into the book. The striker looks hurt after also being caught by Whelan on his way down. Xhaka smacks the free-kick from 30 yards just over. 54 mins: Sweden barely had a kick in the opening 15 minutes but since then have created a number of chances and would already be ahead if it wasn\u2019t for the magnificence of De Gea, who has plenty of experience of keeping his club in games. 52 mins: Mandy Deen says: \u201cI just wanted to write in, as a Swiss, to provide some balance on the liveblog. I will predict there is a 80% chance Xhaka gets a red card before the end of the game and Ireland equalize. Also when is Embolo going to score in a game I\u2019m watching? I hear such buzz about him but have yet to see him score for Switzerland! Also to say hello to my Irish boyfriend who is sad and following along at work (as am I). \u201cHOPP SCHWIIZ!!\u201d Glad I am bringing lovers together. A chipped cross into the box is headed at goal by Berg but De Gea does well to palm it out, only for Forsberg to send it back towards the net, allowing Berg to head the ball home. 49 mins: Coleman spends 10 seconds turning himself inside out on his own byline before Embolo puts him out of his misery and gives Ireland a goal kick. Ultimately, yes, it is rubbish. 47 mins: McCarthy brought on O\u2019Dowda for Collins at the break, which might make a difference. Connolly is now down the middle. O\u2019Dowda makes an early impact by going past Akanji, forcing the defender to bring him down, earning a yellow for his troubles. Can you hear the whistles? They\u2019re being blown around Europe. Justin Kavanagh reminisces: \u201cDuring the Charlton years Ireland\u2019s groundsmen were told to leave the grass grow long so the ball would hold up when pumped long into the corners. But these days, the Aviva groundkeepers probably neglect their grass-cutting duties to avoid any danger of being given free tickets to watch this dross.\u201d I would not go very far to watch this, that\u2019s for sure. Pass the break with Marvin Sordell ... Can McCarthy make some changes? No, it will still be turgid whatever he does. Paul Fitzgerland emails to say: \u201cWhile it\u2019s hard to say as an Irishman, Ireland losing is at least just considering our approach to any game, just look at the Gibraltar match. Our game has always been about our backs to the wall but usually with a bit of guile or some tempo. These stodgy displays means that unfortunately if we don\u2019t make the finals, no one will miss us.\u201d I also watched the Gibraltar and Georgia games and they\u2019ve been utterly awful throughout. Ireland have offered very little and are deservedly behind in Switzerland. Nothing very interesting is happening elsewhere. Check out the HT scores HERE. 45 mins: JR says: \u201cYou should have said Lichtsteiner is a well known acting threat, not attacking threat. Dude\u2019s a troublemaker. So is Xhaka. So is Schar. Hopefully one of them get sent off. \u201cAs an Ireland supporter I\u2019m not in the best mood right now but Peter Oh\u2019s Adrian jape made me chuckle.\u201d Peter claims he was not joking ... 44 mins: Mick McCarthy is on the sideline shouting \u201cForward! Forward!\u201d which should solve all of Ireland\u2019s problems. Lichtsteiner goes down once again. He just loves making the most of a challenge. Seferovic chests one down in the area but then smashes the ball 344888 yards over from close range. 42 mins: Whelan swings in a cross for Ireland from the left, which Duffy heads straight into the \u2018keeper\u2019s arms. Geneva pitch update: it has cut up and looks rubbish. 40 mins: I have a lot of time for John O\u2019Shea referring to everyone by their first name on commentary. 38 mins: Schar gets on the end of a headed clearance, sets himself up for a shot but curls the ball just wide from 25 yards out. Karl Ruben Weseth asks: \u201cThis might be too niche, but: If you have any Hull fans in your audience tonight, maybe they can let me know exactly how ill-advised they think it\u2019s been of Grant McCann to freeze out Henriksen this season. Only asking because he\u2019s been immense so far for Norway this international break, especially for a player who has had no club minutes so far this fall (he means autumn). \u201cAlso, to answer Glenn Kuly\u2019s question about Kepa: he did give away an 90+ minute penalty in the last game, that might have had something to with him being left out for the Sweden game.\u201d 36 mins: McCarthy has changed things around and his side are now operating with a flat back four and Connolly playing on the left of midfield. 34 mins: Lichtsteiner goes down under aerially pressure from Browne. The Veteran defender rolls around on the floor like he\u2019s been elbowed but the replay shows the midfielder barely touched him. Browne is still booked, though. 32 mins: Coleman and Xhaka have a bit of afters following a foul, resulting in them both being booked and the Irishman accusing the Arsenal midfielder of being lippy. I was only born in 1987, so I will just blindly agree. 30 mins: Well-known attacking threat Lichtsteiner drives inside with the ball where there is lots of space, then whacks one with his left foot from 25 yards but drags it well wide. 28 mins: Peter Oh says: \u201cRe: Glenn Kuly\u2019s question about Spain\u2019s goalkeeping. Yes Kepa, sure De Gea. But what does Adrian have to do to get a look in? Arguably the best Spanish keeper in the Premier League at the moment. Disclaimer: Asked by a Liverpool fan.\u201d Let\u2019s not be silly, Pete. 26 mins: A rare foray forward for Sweden earns them a corner but it barely clears the first man and is whacked up field by the Spanish defence. They then get into the box once more but Berg is crowded out and the ball once again whacked away. Lustig does finally test De Gea with a low drive but the goalkeeper does well to hold. 24 mins: Embolo is looking bright for Switzerland - in order to stop the striker, Hendrick takes three attempts to tackle him but only succeeds in committing a foul. The hosts get a free-kick around 25 yards from goal but nothing comes of it. 22 mins: The pitch does not seem to have been much of a leveller for Ireland, as Switzerland have adapted to the conditions far better, while the visitors just seem to be knocking it long. 20 mins: Olsen dives to his right to palm away a downward header from Gerard Moreno, making his debut for Spain tonight. Glenn Kuly ponders: \u201cAny idea why De Gea, not Arrizabalaga, is in net for Spain tonight? Disclaimer: asked by a Chelsea fan.\u201d I think there is just a process of rotation with Spain at the moment, they\u2019ve made a few changes to the team. 18 mins: The Spain defence are really boosting their passing stats tonight by spending most of the game knocking it back and forth to each other. The ball is knocked down to Seferovic on the edge of the box, he gets it onto his left foot and arrows a shot into the corner beyond Randolph. 15 mins: Darren Randolph\u2019s once yellow kit is now a dark brown colour thanks to his diving around. He might need to change that at the break. Switzerland chuck a cross into the box but that is not an issue for Egan. 13 mins: In the opening 13 minutes, Sweden completed 10 passes to Spain\u2019s 150 or so. Could be a tough night for the Swedes. 11 mins: In Sweden, a corner is swung in from the left, which Rodri forces towards goal from six yards but Olsen is equal to it and pushes the ball wide. 9 mins: Switzerland are just passing the ball around the back, which seems a dangerous policy when the pitch is mainly mud. 7 mins: Xhaka gets the ball 25 yards from goal, cuts onto his left foot and hits a low shot which dips at the last second, skidding off the surface and forces Randolph into a fine save as he tips it round the post. 5 mins: There\u2019s been a few cheap fouls from Ireland early on but the referee has accepted he needs to be lenient in such conditions. The Italians have made 10 changes for their trip to Liechtenstein but it does not matter as they open the scoring bright and early through Bernardeschi. 2 mins: The pitch looks underwhelming in Geneva and we\u2019ve already seen some long balls and Embolo getting caught in the mud in the corner. Lichtsteiner has earned a free-kick, too, for a forearm to the face from McClean. Peep! Peep! Peep! The games have started across the continent. Granit Xhaka diving into tackles on the pitch in Geneva is going to be incredibly good fun. It\u2019s also hammering it down in Sweden for their game against Spain. They have also commissioned the world\u2019s biggest flag to get the fans excited before the match. It\u2019s bigger than my country estate (two bed flat)! The players are out on the pitch in Switzerland and the pitch looks ropey, to say the least. This should be fun ... John O\u2019Shea is on co-comms? Scenes! He\u2019s slid into this role quickly since retirement. Peter Oh says: \u201c30,000 kids in the stands in Bucharest? Not only is that going to do number on beer sales in the stadium, but the collective whine and unrest of \u201cCan we go home now? This is booooring!\u201d could overwhelm the stewards and security.\u201d Some of the kids might have fake IDs, to be fair. McCarthy says the pitch may be a leveller tonight and feels the conditions might give the Irish an advantage. He praises Switzerland\u2019s style of play and says he\u2019s picked his team to match them. Looks like the team will line up in a 3-5-2 formation with Coleman and McClean as wing-backs. Classic Teemu ... Who will most enjoy the muddy conditions in Switzerland? I am going for Shane Duffy. Paul has been using the old Twitter ... In Bucharest, 30,000 children will attend Romania v Norway after the hosts were sanctioned for ban-worthy behaviour, meaning only minors and their companions can attend. I guess it\u2019s sort of sweet. JR has been in touch, he asks: \u201cDo you know where Connolly is lining up? Please don\u2019t tell me on the right. I may not know what the hell I\u2019m talking about. Nevertheless I don\u2019t think he should play on the right. \u201cAlso, though I appreciate some of James McClean\u2019s attributes and past performances I think I\u2019ve seen about enough of him. Also also, Why isn\u2019t Doherty starting? I\u2019d try to find a way to get him in there. \u201cExpecting defeat but COYBIG and all that anyway.\u201d I get the feeling Connolly will be on the right. McClean was pretty awful against Georgia it has to be said and I assume Doherty is out to provide a better balance to the side, but who knows? Here is Barney Ronay on the factors which aided the scenes in Bulgaria last night ... A decent record ... There\u2019s been heavy rain in Geneva and the pitch had to pass an inspection for the game to go ahead, which is slightly worrying. The downpour has stopped and standing water removed. I am informed that Mick McCarthy is a frequent visitor to the Cote Brasserie in Blackheath. If his side get a win tonight surely he is going to be in this week to treat himself to the Prestige Menu. Barney Ronay was in Sofia last night, here is what he said about it: Finland have just beaten Armenia 3-0, including two almost identical dinks over the \u2018keeper from Norwich City striker Teemu Pukki. The win takes Finland one step closer to qualification. They now sit second in the group on 15 points. Needless to say, last night was a pretty depressing one for football. Hopefully those scenes will not be repeated. Here is the latest from the fallout, following Bulgaria v England game. Switzerland: Sommer, Lichtsteiner, Elvedi, Akanji, Embolo, Seferovic, Xhaka, Rodriguez, Zakaria, Mehmedi, Schar. Republic of Ireland: Randolph, Coleman, Duffy, Egan, Stevens, Whelan, Hendrick, Browne, McClean, Connolly, Collins Romania: T\u0103r\u0103ru\u0219anu, Benzar, Rus, Nedelcearu, Bancu, Mitri\u021b\u0103, Anton, Marin, Stanciu, Deac, Pu\u0219ca\u0219 Norway: Jarstein, Alesaami, Ajer, Hovland, Elabdellaoui, Selnaes, Henriksen, Berge, Johansen, Odegaard, King Sweden: Olsen, Lustig, Granqvist, Lindel\u00f6f, Bengtsson, Larsson, Olsson, Ekdal, Forsberg, Berg, Quaison. Spain: De Gea, Carvajal, Albiol, \u00cd\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez, Bernat, Ceballos, Thiago Alc\u00e1ntara, Rodri, Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz, Oyarzabal, Gerard Moreno The key thing this evening is that Switzerland v Republic of Ireland is somehow watchable, as the weekend\u2019s visit to Georgia was utterly dreadful. Starting Aaron Connolly seems to be Mick McCarthy\u2019s only hope as he brought some life to the general woefulness in Tbilisi. Not to mention the fact that a win or a draw for Big Mick\u2019s men would maintain or extend their gap to Switzerland in third as they battle for a place at next summer\u2019s Euros. \u201cHe\u2019s come into the squad, he\u2019s had his cameo at the end, and then of course the question is, could I have played him more?\u201d said McCarthy before the match. \u201cWell, I could have started him and he might not have played very well from the start in a rough and tumble game. He might have scored from the start, all those scenarios. \u201cBut had he started and not played well then that would have been, \u2018well, he shouldn\u2019t have had a debut\u2019, usual stuff, which I know is coming.\u201d Elsewhere, the most intriguing fixture is Sweden against Spain. Admittedly, the Spanish are top of the group by five points, are yet to lose in qualification and only need a draw to confirm place for next summer\u2019s tournament but a victory for the hosts could make things vaguely interesting. If that doesn\u2019t float your boat, then there\u2019s always Faroe Islands v Malta. Should be fun!",

How\u2019s this for vintage stomach-churning racism, punchlined by a national treasure in blackface? In 1969 \u2013 two years, indeed, after my dad arrived in the UK from India \u2013 Spike Milligan created a new sitcom, Curry and Chips. Even the title is a masterclass in stereotyping. Written by Johnny Speight, who also gifted Alf Garnett to the nation, it starred Milligan in blackface as a Pakistani immigrant called Kevin O\u2019Grady. (His name, presumably, a joke about the immigrant\u2019s pathetic stabs at assimilation.) \u201cI leave Pakistan because there are far too many wogs there,\u201d he says in a clip in Lenny Henry\u2019s Race Through Comedy (Gold). I\u2019ll leave you to imagine the accent. \u201cSo I come to England and there are still too many wogs.\u201d Cue canned laughter.</p> <p>It only lasted one series, which, frankly, is one too many. \u201cIf Spike Milligan wanted to do a comedy series and Johnny Speight wanted to write it, you didn\u2019t say no, did you?\u201d says Humphrey Barclay (head of comedy at LWT from 1977 to 1983), half a century later. Well no, clearly you didn\u2019t.</p> <p>In the first of a three-part series exploring the unsung history of multicultural comedy, Henry homes in on \u201cthe good, the bad and frankly really ugly sitcoms of the last 50 years\u201d. An affable presenter, Henry is sometimes a bit too generous about material this appallingly unfunny. But Curry and Chips was no anomaly in a Britain gripped by post-colonial shock. Out of such fearful times, vicious light entertainments such as Love Thy Neighbour were also born. \u201cI think that show did more harm than good,\u201d Henry notes. Sample line? \u201cI\u2019m calling to make a complaint against a nig-nog,\u201d white, working-class character Eddie says to a police officer. \u201cWhat\u2019s he done?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s moved next door!\u201d If we get the sitcoms we deserve, I dread to think what is being dreamed up in the still predominantly white, middle-class annals of our TV networks right now.</p> <p>The sitcom is a powerful lens through which to view the race-responsive temperature of our times. Situation comedy riffs, after all, on our current situation. We all grew up with one sitcom or another, whether it was reflecting our lives, reinforcing stereotypes, or, once in a blue moon, breaking new ground. My own was The Cosby Show (1984-1992), which I loved fiercely as an 80s brown child, and is discussed here in the most weird, uptight and avoidant language. \u201cLong before his misdemeanours came to light, Bill Cosby was one of the greatest comedians of all time \u2026\u201d begins one talking head. \u201cI know it\u2019s very difficult to think of this in the light of \u2026 recent developments \u2026 in Cosby\u2019s life,\u201d he concludes, looking like he wants the ground to swallow him up. In a show exploring the impact of comedy on our culture and vice versa, which really means the impact of words, is it really so hard to say: \u201cCosby is currently serving a sexual assault sentence\u201d?</p> <p>There was also the good, of course. The Fosters (1976-1977) got black representation right, for once, and featured a teenage Henry in his screen debut. According to the comedian Gina Yashere, \u201che was the holy grail of wow\u201d. According to Henry, he was \u201cterrible. You can watch me learning how to act, episode by episode.\u201d For the very first sitcom on Channel 4, No Problem! (1983-1985), Barclay commissioned the Black Theatre Co-operative to write and perform their own material. Unsurprisingly, giving black people the chance to write about and represent themselves resulted in genuinely good comedy. \u201cWe got a voice right for the first time,\u201d Barclay observes.</p> <p>Eventually we got <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/04/desmonds-at-30-i-wrote-it-for-white-people\" title=\"\">Desmond\u2019s</a> (1989-1994), the beloved black sitcom set in a Peckham barber shop, which starred the classically trained actor Norman Beaton in the titular role. What is not discussed here is the conspicuous lack of quality Asian sitcoms over the past 50 years.

Instead, Henry focuses on the new era of comedians making shows on their mobile phones, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/08/michaela-cole-enjoy-making-people-uncomfortable-chewing-gum-season-two\" title=\"\">Michaela Coel writing and starring in the brilliant Chewing Gum</a>.

      "body": "<p>If you ever want to know what sort of a feminist someone is, just ask them about the Kardashians.</p> <p>Some will tell you that the women of the family, who have made billions thanks to their sense of style, are great businesswomen who have reclaimed their bodies by monetizing them. Others will slate their feminism because it doesn\u2019t apply to anyone who isn\u2019t hot.</p> <p>The argument is a microcosm for a bigger battle about women\u2019s bodies and who gets to own them. And interestingly, Kim Kardashian West herself underlined this very question on Sunday, during a fiery exchange with her husband, Kanye West.</p> <p>On the show\u2019s latest episode, West admitted that he thought Kardashian West\u2019s 2019 Met gala dress was \u201ctoo sexy\u201d. (The dress was famously designed to make Kardashian West look like she was dripping wet.) West said he had gone through a \u2018\u201ctransition\u201d since his rapper days, when he was obsessed with wanting his wife to look good for others. Fast forward to today, and the dress is too much for him.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvY1nYsK0fE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mvY1nYsK0fE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Coming from a man who spent years talking about and profiting from his wife\u2019s body, you can see why a few eyebrows are being raised. When asked about their romance by the radio host Angie Martinez in 2013, West said he fell in love with Kardashian West after seeing a photo of her with Paris Hilton. He bragged that she was one of the most beautiful women \u201carguably of human existence\u201d. </p> <p>So it sounded pretty rich when he confessed on the show on Sunday: \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that was affecting my soul and my spirit \u2026 You\u2019re my wife and it affects me when pictures are too sexy!\u201d</p> <p>Does life get any harder than this?</p> <p>In response, Kardashian West reminded him: \u201cYou built me up to be this sexy person, confident and all this stuff. Just because you\u2019re on a journey of transformation does not mean I\u2019m in the same spot with you.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever you think of Kardashian West, we should applaud her for summing up the biggest problem with the beauty standard on women in one sentence. The very reason some people hate her \u2013 that she encourages a body ideal that requires self-torture for most people to attain \u2013 is perpetuated by men like West.</p> <p>It was perpetuated when he dedicated an entire music video to how great Kardashian West\u2019s silhouette looks on a motorbike; and it is perpetuated when, having achieved the body ideal, West berates her for being too sexy.</p> <p>She was right to call him out for being a hypocrite. All we can do now is hope that his spirit and soul can overcome it.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If you ever want to know what sort of a feminist someone is, just ask them about the Kardashians. Some will tell you that the women of the family, who have made billions thanks to their sense of style, are great businesswomen who have reclaimed their bodies by monetizing them. Others will slate their feminism because it doesn\u2019t apply to anyone who isn\u2019t hot. The argument is a microcosm for a bigger battle about women\u2019s bodies and who gets to own them. And interestingly, Kim Kardashian West herself underlined this very question on Sunday, during a fiery exchange with her husband, Kanye West. On the show\u2019s latest episode, West admitted that he thought Kardashian West\u2019s 2019 Met gala dress was \u201ctoo sexy\u201d. (The dress was famously designed to make Kardashian West look like she was dripping wet.) West said he had gone through a \u2018\u201ctransition\u201d since his rapper days, when he was obsessed with wanting his wife to look good for others. Fast forward to today, and the dress is too much for him. Coming from a man who spent years talking about and profiting from his wife\u2019s body, you can see why a few eyebrows are being raised. When asked about their romance by the radio host Angie Martinez in 2013, West said he fell in love with Kardashian West after seeing a photo of her with Paris Hilton. He bragged that she was one of the most beautiful women \u201carguably of human existence\u201d. So it sounded pretty rich when he confessed on the show on Sunday: \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that was affecting my soul and my spirit \u2026 You\u2019re my wife and it affects me when pictures are too sexy!\u201d Does life get any harder than this? In response, Kardashian West reminded him: \u201cYou built me up to be this sexy person, confident and all this stuff. Just because you\u2019re on a journey of transformation does not mean I\u2019m in the same spot with you.\u201d Whatever you think of Kardashian West, we should applaud her for summing up the biggest problem with the beauty standard on women in one sentence. The very reason some people hate her \u2013 that she encourages a body ideal that requires self-torture for most people to attain \u2013 is perpetuated by men like West. It was perpetuated when he dedicated an entire music video to how great Kardashian West\u2019s silhouette looks on a motorbike; and it is perpetuated when, having achieved the body ideal, West berates her for being too sexy. She was right to call him out for being a hypocrite. All we can do now is hope that his spirit and soul can overcome it.",

      "bodyText": "An unpredictable week in which the fringe wobbled before reclaiming the crown. Steph is triumphant once again. With great sadness we say goodbye to Henry, the James Dean of the church organ society. Undoubtedly the most entertaining of this year\u2019s bakers. He was a bantering community newsletter, a pre-watershed Puck, a whey-faced wayfinder for all rebels with a cause. The cause being fantastic television. We salute you, Henry. Thanks for your Moroccan pie expertise and unimpeachable Dionne Warwick puns, everyone. Come say hi to me in la la land or the bad place or if you want to get me super sog with excitement, buy my book. Off to don my own black veil, Rx I\u2019ve just had a look at Steff\u2019s(?) necklace and have been spelling her name wrong for two months. Or she has. Hmm. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Henry leaves us. Leaves us as ashen as his pastry walls. Yes REMEMBER THE CRAB, PRUE. RECALL THE CRUSTACEAN This. Watch. Tells. Time. Get. To.F...orgot how annoying Apple adverts are The world has turned, and transformed immeasurably in my lifetime. And yet somehow Hollyoaks still exists. Oh dear. What do we think gang? I mean I\u2019ll come back, but I\u2019ll leave the room for a good two minutes, in high dudgeon. DUDGEON I TELLS YA Nooo! If Henry goes, I go. Lol at Henry dropping his intricate pie on to the judge\u2019s bench from a foot height. Might as well have hurled it from a lacrosse stick. Steph\u2019s carousel is arguably less ambitious but better realised. The Fringe is strong with this one. Actually his marine scene is too salty. There is such a thing as following a brief too closely, guys. Do we think David is good at DIY? Must be something he can\u2019t do. Tough as old boots.\u201d Paul clearly not a Fantastic Mr Fox fan. Rosie\u2019s design is excellent but her castle of stone and fire is as dry as you\u2019d expect. I think she\u2019s in trouble. Alice in Wonderland has made an exquisite treehouse and garden. Essentially a Wes Anderson cartoon come to life. Incredible. I think about it approximately every eight days, like...clockwork Rosie\u2019s dragon is kind of amazing; but also kind of looks like a boiled armadillo. They\u2019re doubling down on this Sandi fitting into small spaces schtick aren\u2019t they? I love how Henry just talks. Do you know what I mean? No filter, not much confidence either. Unique combo. Do you like meaty pies?\u201d Henry asks Paul, who simply stares back. You know when you look into a gorilla\u2019s eyes at the zoo, searching for connection, but it wanders off utterly bored? Don\u2019t know why I\u2019m reminded of that. My mother\u2019s palate\u201d is the greatest comeback to a Hollywood prod I have ever seen. Hail Henry, fairly quiet until now. The dapper mouth is back. Meanwhile Sandi and Paul fight over chunks of ham. Life in Britain next month perhaps? Did Henry just say \u201cYes my darling\u201d to Prue? What the hell is he trying to pull? Lol at Rosie\u2019s husband Lewis getting namechecked immediately after being described as gastronomical milquetoast. I just saw someone getting married...\u201d why does Steph make it sound like she wasn\u2019t invited, just somehow took a wrong turning and ended up in the vicinity of other people\u2019s vows Thanks Kriti! Friends, we have just enjoyed werqa or warka pastry Just three pies, innit. Like an emergency shop at a petrol garage. Can someone give me David\u2019s posture for Christmas? Stands at his bench like he\u2019s just stuck the landing on the parallel bars, and is awaiting the judge\u2019s verdict. Heroic upside down triangle of a man. I have no idea who\u2019s winning.\u201d Prue. Or me watching cricket. \u201cGoths who have been on the electoral roll for five years.\u201d I do not understand that Experian advert but by Christ or Henry I\u2019m glad it exists. Much relate Henry drops a BIG Maundy Thursday reference. Hot stuff. Maundy Thursday always makes me think of that Arctic Monkeys song, Mardy Bum. Actually, he didn\u2019t blow up did he, he was burnt. Like Rosie\u2019s tarte tatin. Iron Fringe Steph makes an iron pie, and looks like the saddest little gelfling there ever was. Alice has apparently put too much garlic in hers \u2013 have me round to eat it please, and Rosie\u2019s black garlic pirate situation \u2013 while David nails the look and taste. (\u201cFinally!\u201d) He wins, while star bakers Henry and Steph bring up the rear. Most surprising success story belongs to Rosie, who finishes second despite her pie blowing up like Guy Fawkes. Moroccan\u2019t Pie Henry is squawking and swearing up a storm this week. His pie splits a bit! The good news (for him) is that Rosie\u2019s pie splits A LOT. It looks more like shepherd\u2019s pie. Look at Henry and David playing catch with a lime like mischievous boys. Noel and even Alice joining in eagerly. Big \u2018making life hard for the substitute teacher\u2019 energy and I love it. I love the look of these Walker pies though. The sort of thing they sell at the bar in upmarket cinemas. I have Google Walker pies, worker pies, warker pies, and still have zero ideas what it is they\u2019re making. I also googled Helena Bake Off Black Veil because I\u2019m not made of stone Red and blue Prue is basically dressed as Timmy Mallet again. Nice, inexplicable cameo from Adam Hills. Modelling a survivalist\u2019s mutton chops in advance of No Deal Bre- sorry, can\u2019t bring myself to say it. I am potentially going to survive the situation.\u201d Steph voicing the inner monologue of anyone emerging from an anxiety attack. OH Steph! She\u2019s tearful because of the tattered lace of her pastry. Noel comforts her tenderly. Steph looks like every remake of the Planet of the Apes films. If anyone knows what this is, I\u2019ll get naked.\u201d \u2013 Henry \u201cI\u2019ve heard of this.\u201d I love how David and Henry subvert expectations. Swotty-dressed Henry is the cheeky chancer, and jock-adjacent David has watched a lot of travel documentaries. These pies are made for Walking, and that\u2019s just what they\u2019ll Prue. Why do you all hate goat\u2019s cheese? I love it. Like a wire-haired hug from a bleaty kid. Henry\u2019s crab could pinch this you know. David\u2019s tart has a good bottom, but his body is bone dry. Steph disappoints shocker! SOGGY BOTTOMED ROSIE! I love that old bluegrass number. Thanks for your concern, all. Can confirm the sleep robot is no longer with me. The pram in the hallways is the enemy of art, when it contains a baby Darth Vader. Alice is \u201cdraining her super-sog.\u201d The most upsetting phrase we have yet encountered in this show? She\u2019s worried about her tart having \u201ca soggy middle.\u201d New, anxious twist on a classic. I think Alice actually has fetlocks. Alice holding a fan to her face and looking like she\u2019s in a Bonnie Tyler video. Iron Fringe Steph displaying supreme thigh strength as she adopts a low-split in front of the oven. David at a loose end, fashions a teatowel headscarf. It\u2019s probably meant to be Grace Kelly, but Sandi describes it as Mother Teresa. Anyone else who wants to \u201cmarry a well-made caramel with an appealing design\u201d: give me a call, yeah? Winkyface We are bang-on for MULTI soggy bottom action lads. UPDATE THE BINGO. Charge your glasses Rosie is cooking with black garlic, which for some reason I think of as pirate food. Tart tartan\u201d Noel not even attempting even half-French there. V Leave Could Alice be any more Sleeping Beauty? Surprised there aren\u2019t bluebirds on her shoulder. I guess there\u2019s a danger she\u2019d bake them in a pie. I could loosen my tie. I may not.\u201d Henry is a man with a brand. Or he has an offputting oesophagus. Why is Prue wearing a tabard, as if manning a temporary car park? Rosie distinguishing between the \u201croll, fold, roll, fold\u201d technique of full puff versus rough IS my ASMR. Wish I had my headphones on. Goosebumps. GOOSEBUMPS DRINKIT Tintin\u2019s trusted tea-time treat. Possibly YES David has warm hands and is a healthcare worker and can bake and is beautiful. BUT I bet he clogs up the drain with beard hairs. Maybe. There\u2019s gotta be something. @time4tee clearing cookies denies you live biscuits? Seems the definition of irony RIGHT I\u2019m weeping openly after that cancer research ad and I also have a cold and I also am not not tipsy, so LET\u2019S GET INTO THIS. Here we go. Soggy bottoms up! @demelzaza Can the dream Bake Off tent have more than one Selasi in it? The Accident looks good! But hasn\u2019t Sarah Lancashire suffered enough? Let the woman do a Jackanory or something. @snailywhaley please tell your sister to wrap it up quicksticks. @jdsworld StephDavidAlice final is a solid ticket. Which means there\u2019s prob a Henry-shaped heartbreak in store at some point. Strange to say that about the Star Baker. Bingo bango! Let\u2019s all drinka drink if and when: Paul sits in front of a fridge as if guarding the contents Prue watches a cake being hand-baked over four hours, then berates it as \u2018homemade\u2019 Tiny angels seen using Sandi\u2019s hair as a beach resort Henry undermined by breaking voice while back-chatting Hollywood David sculpts a working model of the cosmos in marzipan and doesn\u2019t win Brethren, let us bingo. Hello! Welcome to the only Great British Bake Off blog that failed its A levels but enrolled on a sports nutrition course through clearing.

Corbyn has repeatedly said he will vote and whip for an election as soon as a no-deal Brexit is off the table. The earliest an election could be scheduled is 28 November if Johnson tabled a motion for one next week and enough opposition MPs supported it to give him a two-thirds majority. There are then only two subsequent Thursday dates \u2013 5 December or 12 December \u2013 on which an election could be held given that a date any closer to Christmas would be logistically impractical, according to civil service advice. If Corbyn were to try to get an election by tabling a motion of no confidence in the prime minister, a two-week period would follow in which various parties could try to form a government, ending in an election automatically being triggered if none could be found. This would result in a December election date. However, senior Labour figures involved in planning for an election are worried about the motivation levels of their activists and voters so close to Christmas, as well as the increased possibility of bad weather on a winter polling day. Ian Lavery, the party\u2019s chair, and Andrew Gwynne, the national election coordinator, received a sceptical reception from MPs when they outlined the party\u2019s election plans on Monday night. One Labour MP said: \u201cOne of the things to come out of that was there is no proper organisation for an election and no appetite for an election among MPs.\u201d Several Conservative cabinet sources said they believed it was now just as likely that an election would get shifted to early next year, raising the prospect of a minority Johnson government limping through another three months without being able to pass most legislation. However, this would depend on either a Brexit deal having been passed, a technical extension to pass a deal or a longer extension from the EU than three months. Caution in Labour party ranks embraces a number of shadow cabinet figures who are pushing for a second referendum to come first to get Brexit out of the way. There are concerns that Labour is behind the Conservatives in the polls because the Liberal Democrats have won support from remain-backing voters. The uncertainty over an election comes at a time of internal wrangling over the selection of candidates for key marginals and seats being vacated by MPs. Local candidates and campaigners said they were being overlooked and bumped off longlists drawn up by the party\u2019s ruling body. However, Labour denied this was happening and said it was obvious unsuccessful candidates were going to be disappointed. More than 140 members in Liverpool West Derby have written to the party\u2019s national executive in protest that longstanding campaigner, councillor and national president of the centre-left Co-operative party, Nick Crofts, did not make the longlist. With current MP Stephen Twigg standing down at the next election, there was an uproar that leftwing councillor Ian Byrne did make it on to the list. Byrne, a Corbyn supporter, was forced to publicly apologise in September after it emerged he had made offensive jokes on social media. In a letter of complaint written to the party entitled Stop the Stitch-up, the members said Crofts deserved to be on the list because he had campaigned in the area for 11 years. Stephen Pound, the outgoing Labour MP for Ealing North in London, said he was keeping a close eye on the longlisting process for his constituency and was concerned that someone with no connection to the area could be parachuted in. He added his name to a letter sent to Jennie Formby, the Labour general secretary, by local councillors expressing their upset that councillor Bassam Mahfouz did not appear to have been selected. In Bassetlaw, Nottinnghamshire, there were complaints that Simon Greaves, who has led Bassetlaw council since 2012, had not been included. Josie Potts, a Labour councillor in Bassetlaw, said: \u201cThis is not a stitch-up, it\u2019s a bloody tapestry.\u201d A Labour party source said: \u201cThe purpose of longlists is to narrow the field, so clearly not everyone can be on that list. This is a hotly contested seat with many high-quality applications and of course unsuccessful candidates will be disappointed. Obviously if we didn\u2019t narrow them down, we would never pick a single candidate.\u201d Labour said a very large number of high-quality applications had been received. A candidate\u2019s application forms and personal statements, their background and experience and their record of Labour party activity are all considered in the longlisting process, a source said.",

But the shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has seized on the figures \u2013 which follow a downgrade in April \u2013 to call on the government to provide fiscal stimulus and invest in infrastructure to support the economy and improve productivity, in line with IMF advice. The IMF downgraded its global growth forecast by 0.3% since April to 3% for 2019, its lowest level since 2008-09. \u201cMonetary policy cannot be the only game in town and should be coupled with fiscal support where fiscal space is available,\u201d it said.

A draft text of the agreement could now be published today if Downing Street gives the final green light, according to senior EU and British sources. It is understood that the negotiating teams have agreed in principle that there will be a customs border down the Irish Sea. A similar arrangement was rejected by Theresa May as a deal that no British prime minister could accept. Johnson will still have to win over parliament on the basis that, under the deal, Northern Ireland will still legally be within the UK\u2019s customs territory. \u201cNorthern Ireland would <em>de jure</em> be in the UK\u2019s customs territory but <em>de facto</em> in the European Union\u2019s,\u201d one diplomatic source said of the tentative agreement.</p> <p><strong>Music festivals, cemetery upgrades and a virtual gym are among the projects to receive federal grants under the Drought Communities Program.</strong> As the government fends off criticism of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/16/drought-funding-used-for-music-festivals-cemetery-upgrades-and-a-virtual-gym\">national drought response</a>, a Guardian Australia analysis of $100m in grants awarded under the program in 2019 shows that while many shires have used it for water infrastructure projects, much of the funding has been spent on events, the purchase of equipment and maintenance work. Winton council in Queensland used part of its grant funding to provide $820,000 to the Way Out West fest \u2013 a music festival that includes high-profile international acts. Gunnedah council spent about $40,000 on \u201ctwo great country music events\u201d. </p> <p><strong>At least five people are applying for every entry-level position advertised</strong> as Australia\u2019s most disadvantaged jobseekers are forced to compete against growing numbers of underemployed people for a dwindling number of suitable jobs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/16/anglicare-finds-five-jobseekers-applying-for-every-entry-level-position\">a report has found</a>.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 16 October. Top stories Boris Johnson appears to be on the brink of reaching a Brexit deal after making major concessions to EU demands over the Irish border. A draft text of the agreement could now be published today if Downing Street gives the final green light, according to senior EU and British sources. It is understood that the negotiating teams have agreed in principle that there will be a customs border down the Irish Sea. A similar arrangement was rejected by Theresa May as a deal that no British prime minister could accept. Johnson will still have to win over parliament on the basis that, under the deal, Northern Ireland will still legally be within the UK\u2019s customs territory. \u201cNorthern Ireland would de jure be in the UK\u2019s customs territory but de facto in the European Union\u2019s,\u201d one diplomatic source said of the tentative agreement. Music festivals, cemetery upgrades and a virtual gym are among the projects to receive federal grants under the Drought Communities Program. As the government fends off criticism of its national drought response, a Guardian Australia analysis of $100m in grants awarded under the program in 2019 shows that while many shires have used it for water infrastructure projects, much of the funding has been spent on events, the purchase of equipment and maintenance work. Winton council in Queensland used part of its grant funding to provide $820,000 to the Way Out West fest \u2013 a music festival that includes high-profile international acts. Gunnedah council spent about $40,000 on \u201ctwo great country music events\u201d. At least five people are applying for every entry-level position advertised as Australia\u2019s most disadvantaged jobseekers are forced to compete against growing numbers of underemployed people for a dwindling number of suitable jobs, a report has found. Anglicare\u2019s Annual Jobs Availability Snapshot found that one in seven jobseekers faced difficulties getting into work, such as a disability or minimal education. As the government rejects calls to lift Newstart, the charity\u2019s report said people were being trapped in poverty and receiving welfare penalties for failing to effectively look for work because they were forced to \u201ccompete for jobs that simply do not exist\u201d. World A man and his six grown children have been found after living in the cellar of remote Netherlands farmhouse for years \u201cwaiting for the end of time\u201d, local media have reported. The group of six were discovered after the oldest son, 25, visited a local bar. On the first occasion, 10 days ago, he \u201cordered and drank five beers on his own\u201d, the owner, Chris Westerbeek, told broadcaster RTV Drenthe. When the man reappeared last Sunday, he \u201clooked confused\u201d, Westerbeek said. \u201cHe was unkempt, with long tangled hair. We got talking. He said he had run away and needed help, and that he had never been to school. Then we called the police.\u201d Russian units have begun patrolling territory separating Turkish-backed Syrian rebels from the Syrian army around the flashpoint town of Manbij in north-east Syria, in a clear sign that Moscow has become the de facto powerbroker in the region after the evacuation of US troops. A British family of seven were arrested in the US and subject to the \u201cscariest experience\u201d of their lives at the hands of the immigration authorities after inadvertently crossing the border from Canada. The Booker prize judges\u2019 decision to break the rules and award the prize to Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo has been criticised, with detractors pointing out that the first black woman to win Britain\u2019s most prestigious literary award has had to share it \u2013 while receiving half the usual money. Opinion and analysis If you get arrested at a rally, what do you do? Police powers differ slightly across the states and territories. Policing styles, rally permits, laws of assembly and the names of charges vary. But broadly, the process of getting arrested across Australia is fairly similar. \u201cAt the very basic level, all police need to do is tell you you are under arrest and touch you. They don\u2019t need to do much more,\u201d says Anthony Kelly of Melbourne Activist Legal Support, who has also been arrested 18 times. \u201cThey also need to tell you why unless there are extenuating circumstances.\u201d He\u2019s one of several veteran protesters who spoke to Guardian Australia about Extinction Rebellion and getting arrested. More than 60% of the Guardian Essential poll sample rate the performance of the Coalition and Labor as excellent, good or fair. The latest survey of 1,088 respondents shows 63% are positive about the Coalition\u2019s performance post-election and 62% say the same about Labor, although Coalition voters are more positive about the government than Labor voters are about Labor, with 93% of Coalition voters affirming the government and 83% of Labor voters affirming the opposition. Scott Morrison remains comfortably ahead of Anthony Albanese as preferred prime minister, although the Labor leader has made up ground. Sport Australia have continued their perfect start to World Cup qualifying with a 7-1 hammering of a spirited Taiwan side in Kaohsiung. The win keeps Australia comfortably on top of Group B with three victories in as many matches before November\u2019s clash with Jordan in Amman. Uefa has charged the Bulgarian football union over the racist behaviour of its fans at Monday\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier against England. The coaching rivalry between Michael Cheika and Eddie Jones will reach a climax on Saturday when the Wallabies meet England in the World Cup quarter-final in Oita. Thinking time: the \u2018internet SS\u2019 The gunman who killed two people outside a synagogue in Halle in Germany at one point stops during a video feed he streamed on Twitch, smirks to the camera and says \u201cnobody expects the internet SS\u201d. Increasingly, we should. The Halle murders follow a template of violence, one established by the massacre of 51 people in two mosques in New Zealand in March this year, and imitated by fascists since.

      "bodyText": "Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, has claimed \u201cthe votes are now there\u201d for Boris Johnson to pass a Brexit deal through parliament. Rees-Mogg, a close ally of Johnson, who is responsible for legislation in the Commons, made the bold claim on the radio station LBC, despite the fact the prime minister is yet to secure a deal with Brussels. To win a vote, the prime minister would need the support of almost all Eurosceptics in the Conservative party, as well as most of the former Tories from whom he withdrew the whip and either the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) or a bloc of Labour MPs. Johnson is edging closer to the number he needs, with more prominent Eurosceptics now on board with his plans. Steve Baker, the leader of the European Research Group (ERG), sounded positive after a meeting in No 10: \u201cThe mood of the Eurosceptics meeting here tonight was that we do, we can and we must trust the PM.\u201d However, the DUP, which has reservations over plans to leave Northern Ireland in close alignment with the EU, has still not publicly declared its backing and was reserving judgment on Tuesday night. Pro-deal Labour MPs would need reassurances about workers\u2019 rights, environmental protections and the future relationship \u2013 and will come under pressure from their party not to vote with the government. Despite the fact that Theresa May\u2019s deal was rejected three times by the Commons, Rees-Mogg said: \u201cIf a deal is agreed with the European Union, it will get through, in my view, the House of Commons because everybody\u2019s desperate to finish this.\u201d Shedding more light on the process, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this for three and a half years; it can\u2019t go on forever. We are near a conclusion and parliament, once it\u2019s agreed something, can legislate very quickly. So, if the meaningful vote goes through, then the legislation will merely be the ratification in domestic law of the treaty and that, I think, is a relatively easy bill to pass, if there is a deal.\u201d He claimed some \u201cbig changes\u201d have happened since May failed to get her deal with the EU through parliament, including a shift in the mood towards getting Brexit done and Brussels agreeing to reopen the withdrawal agreement. However, the former cabinet minister Amber Rudd, who resigned over Johnson\u2019s lack of progress towards a deal, said she thought there was a \u201cwhiff of sexism\u201d about Eurosceptics in the European Research Group being prepared to vote for the prime minister\u2019s potential deal after rejecting May\u2019s agreement. She told BBC Radio 5 Live\u2019s Emma Barnet: \u201cIt is difficult to fillet it out, how much is about a more trusting relationship that they clearly have with Boris Johnson, because he himself was very much part of that ERG group in terms of wanting a harder Brexit than the former prime minister wanted, but I do feel as a woman who\u2019s active in politics myself, that there is a whiff of sexism, as you put it, as well.\u201d When asked why Conservative MPs could vote for a potential Johnson deal when they rejected May\u2019s deal, Rudd said: \u201cThere are certain behaviours that particularly men in politics want to see, that women don\u2019t so much, that Boris did adopt, which has given the ERG members a lot of confidence. \u201cSo, for instance, I was very opposed to the prime minister expelling 21 colleagues from the party as MPs, and I felt very strongly that Ken Clarke, who had been in Margaret Thatcher\u2019s cabinet, should have a place in Boris Johnson\u2019s party. \u201cBut he took a different view, and I thought that was a very aggressive thing to do, and unnecessary, and has had the effect of radicalising the 21 \u2013 which I have now joined.

A similar arrangement was rejected by Theresa May as a deal that no British prime minister could accept.</p> \n<p>Johnson will still have to win over parliament \u2013 including the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) and the hardline Tory Brexiters of the European Research Group (ERG) \u2013 on the basis that, under the deal, Northern Ireland will still legally be within the UK\u2019s customs territory.</p> \n<p>One Eurosceptic source close to both camps indicated that such an arrangement would be \u201cextremely difficult for the DUP to swallow\u201d, but neither the DUP nor ERG publicly made any criticism of Johnson\u2019s efforts.</p> \n<p>The prime minister will brief his cabinet on the situation at 4pm on Wednesday before addressing a scheduled meeting of the 1922 Committee in the evening.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"73f497f7-48ef-4d47-95b2-af2d926d1a48\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Counties and customs</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.<br></p>\n    <p>Britain\u2019s exit from the EU \u2013 taking Northern Ireland with it \u2013 risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety.</p>\n    <p>The 'backstop' in Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a 'trap' to keep the UK in the EU's customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There are an estimated 72m road vehicle crossings a year between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and about 14% of those crossings are consignments of goods, some of which may cross the border several times before they reach a consumer.

The \u201cbackstop\u201d is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU.</p>\n    <p>Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements.</p>\n    <p>Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament.</p>\n    <p>If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/daniel-boffey\"><b>Daniel Boffey</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>After the meeting, Belgium\u2019s deputy prime minister, Didier Reynders, said: \u201cIf we have an agreement tonight, it will be possible to go to the [European] council and then again to the British parliament. But it\u2019s not easy. We have some red lines, they are well known by all the partners.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson appears to be on the brink of reaching a Brexit deal after making major concessions to EU demands over the Irish border. A draft text of the agreement could now be published on Wednesday if Downing Street gives the final green light, according to senior EU and British sources. It is understood that the negotiating teams have agreed in principle that there will be a customs border down the Irish Sea. A similar arrangement was rejected by Theresa May as a deal that no British prime minister could accept. Johnson will still have to win over parliament \u2013 including the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) and the hardline Tory Brexiters of the European Research Group (ERG) \u2013 on the basis that, under the deal, Northern Ireland will still legally be within the UK\u2019s customs territory. One Eurosceptic source close to both camps indicated that such an arrangement would be \u201cextremely difficult for the DUP to swallow\u201d, but neither the DUP nor ERG publicly made any criticism of Johnson\u2019s efforts. The prime minister will brief his cabinet on the situation at 4pm on Wednesday before addressing a scheduled meeting of the 1922 Committee in the evening. Steve Baker, the leader of the ERG, emerged from a meeting in No 10 saying he was \u201coptimistic that it is possible to reach a tolerable deal that I am able to vote for\u201d and later told fellow Eurosceptics to \u201ctrust in\u201d the prime minister. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, was due to see Johnson again on Tuesday night, and told reporters ahead of the meeting that she would \u201cdo what\u2019s best for the union\u201d. In a statement released to the BBC after a 90 minute meeting at No 10 on Tuesday night, the DUP said they could not give detailed commentary amid ongoing negotiations but \u201cit would be fair to indicate gaps remain and further work is required\u201d. Under his proposals, the prime minister would be able to boast that the UK \u201cwhole and entire\u201d had left the European Union. \u201cNorthern Ireland would de jure be in the UK\u2019s customs territory but de facto in the European Union\u2019s,\u201d one diplomatic source said of the tentative agreement. Sources in Brussels said they were confident that the commission and UK negotiating team would land the deal overnight. But as negotiations continue, there was nervousness in Paris and Berlin about the rush to find a deal for the EU27 leaders to sign off at Thursday\u2019s European council summit in Brussels. Speaking in Paris, a senior French official advised \u201cextreme prudence\u201d about the chances of a deal being struck that would satisfy the EU\u2019s capitals. \u201cIt\u2019s not the Irish who will make the deal,\u201d the official said. \u201cYes, there are better atmospherics, but what matters is the content, and we have seen nothing yet. Whatever it is, we will want to look at it in very serious detail.\u201d German government officials said reaching a deal this week was an ambitious target and that agreeing on the technical issues could require another two months of talks, unless the UK made significant enough concessions. The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, sought to reassure EU capitals who were fearful a deal was being rushed. \u201cI would never ask the commission or the member states to compromise the single market, because our jobs and our economy and our security depends on that too,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to see how the next few days develop. If we can get to an agreement, on Thursday or Friday, and if the House of Commons is able to vote in favour of an indicative vote in favour of that agreement on Saturday, it may not be necessary to even consider an extension.\u201d Varadkar expressed cautious optimism, telling reporters in Ireland that \u201cinitial indications are that we are making progress, that the negotiations are moving in the right direction\u201d. Foster warned that Northern Ireland must remain in the UK customs union, but did not pour cold water on the deal on the table. \u201cWe are in a negotiation. It is right to give negotiators time and space to do all this. It\u2019s all speculation. People have to get real. We\u2019re not under pressure at all. We\u2019re not the ones under pressure,\u201d she told RT\u00c9 News. Asked later whether she would concede a customs border in the Irish Sea, she told BBC Newsline: \u201cNo. We must remain within the UK\u2019s customs union. It is a principle we have ... and that will forever be there. We have to be integrally within the UK.\u201d Earlier on Tuesday, Michel Barnier had set Johnson a midnight deadline to concede to EU demands and agree to a customs border in the Irish Sea or be left with nothing to take to the Commons. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator advised the EU27 would announce on Wednesday afternoon whether negotiations on an agreement would have to continue into next week. Barnier said the starting point for a deal would be the Northern Ireland-only backstop, keeping the province in the EU\u2019s single market for goods and creating a customs border down the Irish Sea. After the meeting, Belgium\u2019s deputy prime minister, Didier Reynders, said: \u201cIf we have an agreement tonight, it will be possible to go to the [European] council and then again to the British parliament. But it\u2019s not easy. We have some red lines, they are well known by all the partners. I\u2019m hoping it will be possible today to make some progress.\u201d In a phone call with Johnson on Tuesday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, acknowledged the momentum towards reaching a deal, but raised the possible need for a \u201ctechnical\u201d Brexit extension beyond 31 October to allow talks to bear fruit. The bloc has insisted the EU27 leaders will not negotiate when they meet. \u201cThe European council will be a political moment to tell the story, not to make detailed technical negotiations,\u201d said one French official. \u201cIt cannot be a catch-up. We do not do things urgently.\u201d The thorny issue of how to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland has dogged the negotiations. The UK has accepted that Northern Ireland will remain in the EU\u2019s single market for goods, although it is seeking to find a way to time-limit the arrangement through a consent mechanism for the assembly in Stormont. Barnier told ministers the UK had dropped the original Stormont lock idea tabled by the prime minister on 1 October, which would have, in effect, given the DUP a veto on arrangements for avoiding a hard border coming into force and staying in force. Under the new thinking, a majority of both nationalists and unionists would need to give consent at a point later in time. Downing Street last week accepted there would not be a customs border on the island of Ireland. The government has been seeking a way to avoid one in the Irish Sea on the basis that it would represent an economic dislocation of the country. But the EU rejected the UK\u2019s proposal of a dual customs system at Northern Ireland\u2019s ports and airports that would involve tracking goods entering from Great Britain and applying differential treatment depending on their final destination. Barnier has instead pushed the UK to accept a model closer to a Northern Ireland-only backstop. Under the deal being negotiated, Northern Ireland would not be part of the EU\u2019s customs territory, but the bloc\u2019s full customs code would have to be enforced in the Irish Sea. The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, who was also in Luxembourg and briefly met Barnier on Tuesday morning, had earlier insisted a deal was \u201cstill very possible\u201d when speaking to reporters. \u201cThe talks are ongoing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to give them space to proceed but detailed conversations are under way.\u201d If Johnson does emerge with a deal, he would probably try to pass it through parliament very quickly on a historic Saturday sitting.

In the next breath, they suggested their jobs were always near-impossible because \u00a3150m in interest costs had to be paid every year to banks and bondholders.</p> \n<p>Neither the former chief executive Peter Fankhauser, nor Frank Meysman, who was chairman for eight years, explained why they did not de-risk the balance sheet when they had the chance. As recently as May 2018, remember, Thomas Cook\u2019s equity was worth \u00a32bn, which was an opportunity to cajole shareholders into backing a decent-sized rights issue to take a chunk out of a debt pile that eventually surpassed \u00a31bn.</p> \n<p>Meysman\u2019s account of that period was particularly feeble. He said a plan to reduce debt by \u00a3100m a year looked solid in late 2017 and early 2018 \u201cif there would continue to be progress\u201d in operations. The conditional \u201cif\u201d was the critical word.

If the possibility of safer funding exists, grab it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5c304d94-202d-42a4-bc1b-a6569a95dc54\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Brexit</b><br>\u201cThere is now little doubt that the Brexit process has led many UK customers to delay their holiday plans for this summer,\u201d said the chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, in May. But it cannot be the whole story - arch-rival Tui has coped because its finances are healthier.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Weather</b><br>The summer heatwave of 2018 encouraged would-be holidaymakers to stay at home, undermining prices in the \u201clates\u201d market where operators try to clear unsold holidays. There seems to have been a hangover into 2019, with customers calculating that waiting to book is a productive strategy.</p>\n    <p><b>Competition</b><br>A pincer movement of Airbnb and budget holidays has changed consumer behaviour, though Thomas Cook still managed to sell 11m package holidays last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Banks and debt</b><br>The tour operator has been attempting to shoulder a&nbsp; huge pile of debt for the past decade \u2013 \u00a31.7bn worth at the last count. Successive managements failed to remove meaningful chunks. The banks argue they have supported an overstretched company for years and the details of why it could not be saved may have to await the report from the Insolvency Service.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Bad management</b><br>Thomas Cook\u2019s borrowings were too high. The moral of the tale is that tour operators should fund themselves conservatively. If your balance sheet is fragile, you are at the mercy of events in an industry where most of the cash arrives in the summer and then flows out in the winter.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nilspratley\"><b>Nils Pratley</b></a>, financial editor</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Meysman pointed to a few debt-reduction measures he did oversee. The largest was a \u00a3425m placing and rights issue \u2013 but that was back in 2013. The second largest was the sale of \u00a3350m worth of businesses, but that was clearly insufficient given Thomas Cook\u2019s need to invest in new hotels.</p> \n<p>After a summer heatwave in the UK, the optimism of spring 2018 was replaced within six months by a crisis in the form of \u201cenhanced monitoring\u201d by the Civil Aviation Authority.

Both he and Fankhauser seemed incapable of understanding that, if backers will not commit until they see public money at risk, the plan is fundamentally weak.</p> \n<p>There is no doubt that lenders\u2019 late demand for the \u00a3200m backstop was a serious and sudden setback, but being taken by surprise seems to have been a regular occurrence in Thomas Cook\u2019s boardroom over the years. The trick is to have a plan B. Listening to the directors\u2019 testimony, one could understand why ministers declined to back a bailout. It is hard to justifying risking money when financial visibility is so poor.</p> \n<p>Fankhauser, at least, conceded that different choices could have been made, such as putting the airline up for sale earlier. But, as if to sum up proceedings, he did not foresee the obvious question about whether he will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/14/no-more-than-1m-will-be-recouped-from-thomas-cook-chiefs\">pay back the cash element</a> of his last bonus.

      "bodyText": "Long before the footballers of Bulgaria and England walked on to the pitch of Sofia\u2019s Stadion Vasil Levski on Monday evening, their Euro 2020 qualifying match had become a test of something far more important than sporting prowess. Parts of the stadium had been closed off after previous incidents of racist abuse at international games. Yet warnings by the Chelsea forward, Tammy Abraham, that England would consider leaving the pitch if there was a repeat, drew the ire of the president of Bulgaria\u2019s football federation, Borislav Mihaylov. Bulgaria, he said, had less of a problem with racism than England, and Abraham\u2019s remarks had been \u201cderogatory\u201d and \u201coffensive\u201d. In fact they turned out to be prescient. Before and during the match, black English players were booed and subjected to monkey chants by sections of the crowd. Far-right ultras repeatedly made Nazi salutes. The defender Tyrone Mings, making his international debut, was a particular target, after pausing to stare in the direction of some of the most virulent abuse. The shameful, hateful spectacle has inevitably raised questions of whether the match should have been abandoned. It was paused twice during the first half, after England reported the abuse to the referee, Ivan Bebek, following to the letter a new Uefa protocol.

      "bodyText": "The prime minister\u2019s office was aware of a financial rescue plan that could have saved Thomas Cook but \u201cdidn\u2019t want to set a precedent\u201d by lending the company money, its former boss told MPs, as an inquiry into the tour operator\u2019s collapse got under way. In a sometimes bruising encounter with the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee, Thomas Cook bosses drew stinging criticism for their role in the demise of the 178-year-old travel company. The committee chair, Rachel Reeves, said its directors were guilty of a \u201cseries of misjudgments\u201d that \u201cguided\u201d the company \u201cinto the rocks\u201d. She called on them to resign from any other boardroom jobs they held and reflect on whether to hand back bonuses that \u201cyou have not earned but you have received\u201d. The company\u2019s chief executive before it collapsed, Peter Fankhauser, declared himself \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d over the company\u2019s descent into liquidation but refused to commit to returning his bonuses, saying he had worked \u201ctirelessly\u201d in his efforts to save the company. Fankhauser was paid \u00a38.4m during his tenure, including \u00a34.6m in bonuses, but the majority was paid in shares that he did not sell and are now worthless. The cash element of his bonuses was worth \u00a31.1m but under the terms of his contract only \u00a3558,000 can be forcibly reclaimed. Fankhauser insisted the company could have had a \u201cbright future\u201d under his leadership if the government had not refused to support a \u00a31.1bn financial rescue package. He said the proposal was \u201con the table of ministers and it was in No 10\u201d. \u201cWe made an estimate of how much a collapse could cost and that was far higher than what we requested.\u201d Fankhauser told the committee: \u201cI was awfully sad when I had the high official on the phone about five o\u2019clock in the evening [on the day before the collapse], because I knew, now I have to throw in the towel.\u201d He said he wouldn\u2019t \u201cdare criticise the government \u2026 [but] we knew that we needed something that was strong because without it we knew we couldn\u2019t take off again on Monday because the business was on its knees\u201d. Speaking to the Guardian outside the hearing, Fankhauser said Thomas Cook would have been one of Europe\u2019s best-funded leisure businesses if the rescue had gone ahead. The restructuring involved a \u00a3900m injection from the Chinese tourism business Fosun, banks and bondholders. Spanish hoteliers, backed by their government, were understood to be ready to contribute half of a further \u00a3200m demanded by the banks in the weeks before the company\u2019s collapse. The deal would have cut Thomas Cook\u2019s \u00a31.2bn debt by \u201cat least\u201d half, Fankhauser said, reducing annual debt interest payments from \u00a3150m to \u00a350m. Thomas Cook\u2019s chairman, Frank Meysman, told the committee the funding package was in place at 4pm the day before the company collapsed but the government\u2019s refusal to provide \u00a3200m in loans to underpin the deal led to other investors pulling out. \u201cSome other governments have made a different choice,\u201d he said. Fankhauser also revealed that while he had spoken to the tourism ministers of Germany, Spain, Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria in the week leading up to Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse, no British government minister contacted him during the period. In a separate BEIS committee hearing, the business minister, Andrea Leadsom, defended her department\u2019s role after the Guardian revealed she and her officials did not meet with company chiefs in the weeks leading up to the collapse. \u201cThere has been a clear dereliction of duty by the government,\u201d said the shadow business minister, Rebecca Long-Bailey. \u201cIt is shameful that ministers failed to make contact with Thomas Cook at such a vital time when other international governments were stepping in, and failed to examine the excessive bonus culture when it was very publicly facing difficulties. \u201cThere must be a full public inquiry into the government\u2019s handling of this scandal.\u201d Manuel Cortes, the general secretary of transport workers union TSSA, said Leadsom\u2019s position was \u201cuntenable\u201d. During an evidence session that lasted more than two hours, MPs repeatedly criticised Thomas Cook\u2019s directors for their part in the company\u2019s downfall. Fankhauser admitted he was \u201cnot fast enough\u201d to revive the company\u2019s fortunes, partly due to the constraints of debt racked up under his predecessors. But MPs said he and his directors could have done more to rescue the company. Committee member, the Tory MP Antoinette Sandbach criticised the board for valuing the company\u2019s \u201cgoodwill\u201d \u2013 an accounting measure of a company\u2019s future trading prospects \u2013 at \u00a32.5bn. Customers deserted the company after it reported a \u00a31.5bn loss earlier this year, partly due to a \u00a31.1bn goodwill writedown on the value of the UK package holiday unit MyTravel. MPs said the company could have raised cash by accepting offers for divisions such as its airline. Directors did not respond to a demand from Reeves that they hand back the cash element of bonuses they received from the company. The maximum that can be forcibly recouped under the terms of their contracts is \u00a31m, due to a two-year time limit on so-called \u201cclawback\u201d provisions.",

Ofqual, which oversees school exams in England, said it had levied its largest ever fine on AQA after 50,000 appeals for exam papers to be reviewed or re-marked, spread across three years between 2016 and 2018, were carried out by AQA staff who had already marked the same papers.

In the most significant case, Ofqual found that AQA \u2013 the UK\u2019s largest exam board, awarding more than 3m certificates each year \u2013 had overlooked internal warnings in 2016 and 2017 and failed to alert the regulator that re-marks were sometimes carried out by the same people who conducted the initial marking. AQA will have to pay a \u00a3350,000 fine and give compensation worth \u00a3755,000 to the exam centres where the reviews or re-marks originated, as well as paying Ofqual\u2019s costs for its investigation.

There are nerves in Berlin and Paris at the pace of developments but the European commission is keen to get a deal done.</p> <h2><strong>What does the EU want?</strong></h2> <p>Barnier has said the UK needs to table a legal text, and it needs to be based on the February 2018 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/19/brexit-and-the-irish-border-question-explained\">Northern</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/19/brexit-and-the-irish-border-question-explained\"> Ireland-only backstop</a>. That proposal \u2013 rejected by Theresa May as a constitutional outrage that no British prime minister could accept \u2013 would keep Northern Ireland in the single market for goods and the EU\u2019s customs territory. The arrangement would cease to be in force if a future trade deal offered an alternative solution for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.</p> <p>Barnier is open to tweaking that model, however. A consent mechanism, under which Stormont has a say over alignment with the EU, could ensure that both nationalist and unionist communities give their approval for continued alignment with the EU. On the tentative deal on customs, Northern Ireland could <em>de jure</em> remain in the UK\u2019s customs territory rather than the EU\u2019s. But Northern Ireland would <em>de facto</em> remain under the EU\u2019s full customs code. It would in practice be a thick border in the Irish Sea.</p> <h2><strong>Could it go wrong?</strong></h2> <p>Yes. A similar deal was killed off by the Democratic Unionist party and the Brexiter European Research Group MPs in 2018. But both seem to be giving Johnson more leeway than they afforded May. Any arrangement that creates checks and controls, and potentially a tariff border between Britain and Northern Ireland, is problematic. But the UK would establish a rebate system to ensure businesses in Northern Ireland are not financially disadvantaged. They could also arguably claim that the UK, \u201cwhole and entire\u201d, would leave the EU\u2019s customs territory.</p> <h2><strong>What if a deal is not agreed by </strong><strong>the summit on Thursday?</strong></h2> <p>There are two possibilities: deadlock if Johnson decides to attack Brussels for intransigence, or further negotiations to talk around the problem next week. The latter would open up the possibility of a second EU summit, perhaps on 29 October, for a potential deal to be signed off by leaders. A Brexit extension beyond 31 October is inevitable either way.</p> <h2><strong>What is the most likely outcome?</strong></h2> <p>For all the noise from Downing Street, Johnson has been a pliant negotiator with Brussels in recent days. There is some evidence that he now wants to put a deal to parliament on 19 October, come what may.

      "bodyText": "Nicola Sturgeon has urged Scotland to \u201creclaim its independence\u201d, confirming in an upbeat party conference address that she intends to hold a second independence referendum in 2020 and will demand that the Westminster government transfer the powers to do so by the end of this year. But Scotland\u2019s first minister did not offer a practical alternative route to a referendum should the request for a section 30 order, which transfers the requisite legal power to Holyrood, be rebuffed. The SNP leader told the packed conference hall in Aberdeen that a Westminster refusal was not sustainable. \u201cThe question should be demanded of the Westminster parties: what gives you any right to deny people in Scotland our ability to choose our own future?\u201d \u201cWe can already see the cracks appearing. The Labour leaderships in London and Wales have recognised our right to choose \u2026 Just like us, they know there is going to be a referendum.\u201d Downing Street used Monday\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech to double down on Boris Johnson\u2019s previous insistence that the 2014 independence referendum was \u201conce-in-a-generation\u201d, while the Labour leadership has most recently insisted there should be no electoral pact or deal with the SNP, and that a referendum should not happen within the \u201cformative years\u201d of a Labour administration. Telling delegates that the party already had \u201ca cast iron mandate for an independence referendum\u201d, Sturgeon reiterated the importance of holding a vote that is legal and internationally recognised. On the first day of conference, an expected rebellion over a proposed \u201cplan B\u201d \u2013 the option of demanding independence without a legally-constituted referendum \u2013 was swiftly quashed by an overwhelming majority of delegates. In what was a mainly relaxed and humorous address, which quoted Billy Connolly and Robert Burns, Sturgeon took the opportunity to warn delegates about the conduct of a coming independence campaign. She said: \u201cWe will win our independence. But not the Brexit way. Not by undermining democracy, demonising those who disagree, and plastering lies on the side of a bus. We will win by inspiring and persuading. So let us resolve today that how we campaign for independence will always reflect the open, tolerant, inclusive and democratic nation we are determined to build.\u201d Announcing a raft of domestic policies and potential manifesto commitments, including giving police the power to remove abusers from the family home, scrapping all non-residential social care charges and expanding free childcare into the school holidays for primary pupils from the poorest backgrounds, Sturgeon said that a general election \u201ccannot come soon enough\u201d. \u201cWhen it does our message will be clear, simple and unambiguous. Vote SNP to demand independence and secure Scotland\u2019s right to choose.\u201d Guaranteeing that, in the event of a hung parliament, the SNP will never put the Tories into power, she added: \u201cI have a message for any Westminster party that wants SNP support. If you don\u2019t respect Scotland\u2019s right to choose our own future at a time of our own choosing, don\u2019t even bother picking up the phone.\u201d Describing Brexit as a disaster, she railed against the unfairness of a potentially differentiated deal for Northern Ireland, saying: \u201cWales will have voted to leave.

I don\u2019t sell stuff to make money. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the idea, really.\u201d Because clearing out is the aim, she tends to bundle smaller items together, then sells them for a low price. She\u2019ll group clothes by season and homewares by category. \u201cAnd I sell them for between one and five dollars.\u201d Not everyone is a fan of her strategy but she still thinks it\u2019s a good idea. \u201cSometimes people will say, \u2018I don\u2019t like this, can I swap it for this?\u2019 They\u2019d rather pay $1 for one piece of clothing, and I find that quite amusing.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/15/tinker-tailors-the-grassroots-movement-reclaiming-the-right-to-repair\">Tinker tailors: the grassroots movement reclaiming the right to repair</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Visual merchandising matters<br></strong>Before she retired, Troccaz was a regular at Sydney\u2019s market in the Rocks where she\u2019d sell handmade goods infused with eucalyptus oil. She takes a market-style approach to organising her garage sale goods. Starting at her front door, she arranges everything by size. \u201cI put the garden stuff on one side, the homewares I stack \u2026 with small things at the front, medium sized things in the middle and big things at the back.\u201d</p> <p><strong>You can make friends with pot plants \u2026<br></strong>Throughout the year Troccaz saves the planters she gets from garden centres, and reuses them to pot up cuttings and extra plants she has been growing. \u201cI have a little backyard, and my plants are very happy there.\u201d Since she started selling plants, she has developed a particular rapport with her customers. \u201cWe have nice chit-chat.

I start pricing plants from 50 cents, up to $5 or $10. This year I have a Japanese maple which I repotted. It\u2019s really healthy and happy, so I might sell it for more.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Expect to want less<br></strong>Troccaz has lived in the same home for more than 35 years. She held her first garage sale eight years ago after seeing a flyer at a bus shelter. \u201cThe funny thing is, I wasn\u2019t able to be there. So I left the things outside and I left a note with them saying, \u2018Will you just slide the money under the front door,\u2019 and people did! It was very honest. The following year I did the same thing. Then after I stopped working, I continued doing the garage sales.\u201d She\u2019s found the process of tidying and decluttering for sales has changed her attitude to shopping. \u201cI think I\u2019ll run out of things to sell. Hopefully! It\u2019s the idea that I clear and declutter, but then I make sure I don\u2019t buy new things.

      "bodyText": "About 400,000 people around Australia are projected to shop during this year\u2019s Garage Sale Trail on 19 and 20 October. But experts on both sides of the garage sale table advise it is fun, not money, that should motivate buyers and sellers. Guardian Australia interviewed one of the Garage Sale Trail\u2019s \u201cmost seasoned\u201d sellers, 67-year-old Chantal Troccaz, and The Collector\u2019s auctioneer Adam Truscott \u2013 who\u2019s been in the business of appraising used goods for 25 years \u2013 to find out how to have a successful garage sale, whether you\u2019re selling or buying. Tips for sellers Embrace the bundle Though she\u2019s never read anything by Marie Kondo, Troccaz uses her annual garage sale mainly to \u201csell stuff which I don\u2019t use any more. I don\u2019t sell stuff to make money. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the idea, really.\u201d Because clearing out is the aim, she tends to bundle smaller items together, then sells them for a low price. She\u2019ll group clothes by season and homewares by category. \u201cAnd I sell them for between one and five dollars.\u201d Not everyone is a fan of her strategy but she still thinks it\u2019s a good idea. \u201cSometimes people will say, \u2018I don\u2019t like this, can I swap it for this?\u2019 They\u2019d rather pay $1 for one piece of clothing, and I find that quite amusing.\u201d Visual merchandising matters Before she retired, Troccaz was a regular at Sydney\u2019s market in the Rocks where she\u2019d sell handmade goods infused with eucalyptus oil. She takes a market-style approach to organising her garage sale goods. Starting at her front door, she arranges everything by size. \u201cI put the garden stuff on one side, the homewares I stack \u2026 with small things at the front, medium sized things in the middle and big things at the back.\u201d You can make friends with pot plants \u2026 Throughout the year Troccaz saves the planters she gets from garden centres, and reuses them to pot up cuttings and extra plants she has been growing. \u201cI have a little backyard, and my plants are very happy there.\u201d Since she started selling plants, she has developed a particular rapport with her customers. \u201cWe have nice chit-chat. I explain to people how to care for their plants, and give them tips.\u201d \u2026 especially if they\u2019re affordable \u201cI think my sale\u2019s popular because it\u2019s very cheap,\u201d Troccaz says. \u201cAnd something different. I start pricing plants from 50 cents, up to $5 or $10. This year I have a Japanese maple which I repotted. It\u2019s really healthy and happy, so I might sell it for more.\u201d Expect to want less Troccaz has lived in the same home for more than 35 years. She held her first garage sale eight years ago after seeing a flyer at a bus shelter. \u201cThe funny thing is, I wasn\u2019t able to be there. So I left the things outside and I left a note with them saying, \u2018Will you just slide the money under the front door,\u2019 and people did! It was very honest. The following year I did the same thing. Then after I stopped working, I continued doing the garage sales.\u201d She\u2019s found the process of tidying and decluttering for sales has changed her attitude to shopping. \u201cI think I\u2019ll run out of things to sell. Hopefully! It\u2019s the idea that I clear and declutter, but then I make sure I don\u2019t buy new things. When I\u2019m tempted to buy crockery or a dress, I put my foot down and tell myself \u2018No, I\u2019ve got plenty\u2019.\u201d Treat money as a pleasant surprise On rainy years, Troccaz says the crowd at her sales is more like \u201ca trickle\u201d but she makes hay (and bank) when the sun shines. \u201cOn a sunny day I\u2019ll make between $200 and $300, which is a surprise because I tell people to give me coins!\u201d Tips for buyers Pick something you\u2019ll actually use \u2026 In the last few years household items like old mixing bowls have become very collectable. \u201cFive years ago no one wanted old pottery and mixing bowls,\u201d Adam Truscott says.

In the past week alone, more than 200 people have been arrested at Extinction Rebellion rallies in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth.</p> \n<p>If you get arrested at a rally, what do you do? Police powers differ slightly across the states and territories. Policing styles, rally permits, laws of assembly, and the names of charges vary. But broadly, the process of getting arrested across Australia is fairly similar.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt the very basic level, all police need to do is tell you you are under arrest and touch you. They don\u2019t need to do much more,\u201d says Anthony Kelly, spokesperson for Melbourne Activist Legal Support, who has also been arrested 18 times. \u201cThey also need to tell you why unless there are extenuating circumstances.\u201d</p> \n<p>He says police can use \u201cappropriate levels\u201d of force to move a person during a protest. \u201cYou aren\u2019t obligated to co-operate with your own arrest,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople can decide to stand up and go along or people can remain seated and go \u2018limp\u2019 or passively resist.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b1c4a761-9c9e-431a-806b-c2058be5b201\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dDuV8OseSHc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Kelly has been training activists in nonviolent protest since the late 1990s.

It causes a lot of stress,\u201d he says \u201cIt\u2019s really easy for people to do something inadvertently, which opens up to other charges.\u201d He cites the example of going \u201climp\u201d and accidentally flinging an arm, which can lead to police assault charges.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2019/oct/12/parliamentarians-deserve-our-wrath-for-30-years-of-inaction-not-climate-protesters\">Parliamentarians deserve our wrath for 30 years of inaction, not climate protesters | Greg Jericho</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Margaret Pestorius, 55, an antiwar activist and devout Catholic, \u201cthinks\u201d she has been arrested 11 or 12 times.

They can do a pat-down. The police will also try to ask questions but there is no obligation to answer them. Kelly says the only thing people have to say is their name and address. \u201cPeople are often advised to say \u2018no comment\u2019 from here on in. That\u2019s a very important centuries-old right that people have,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Morning mail\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Protestors under arrest are usually driven to a police station in a van. Once there, they must hand over personal possessions, including jewellery, belts and glasses. Anti-Adani protester Matilda Heselev, 21, was arrested in July this year, alongside Emily Starr, after they locked themselves to a concrete barrel at Abbot Point coal terminal in central Queensland. They were taken to Bowen watch house.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/12/extinction-rebellion-who-are-the-protesters-and-why-are-they-doing-it\">Extinction Rebellion: who are the protesters, and why are they doing it?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed to wear my glasses,\u201d she says. \u201cMy advice to people who wear glasses is to wear contacts if they are planning on getting arrested.\u201d She and Starr also had to hand over clothes with draw strings \u2013 a hoodie and a pair of trousers. It was cold in the cell.</p> \n<p>For a few years now, Pestorius has disguised ear plugs as nipples in her bra, which police never seem to find when she gets a pat-down. She finds jail very noisy. \u201cClangy,\u201d she says. \u201cOther people in there can be very upset \u2026 It can be quite disturbing. Ear plugs are a great boon for a good sleep.\u201d While you don\u2019t have to say a word to police, Pestorius likes to talk. \u201cYou try to connect with the people you come in touch with and explain why you are there.\u201d</p> \n<p>Waiting for bail can take hours. Pestorius says she has used the time to exercise, sleep, meditate, sing songs and pray. \u201cOne of the things I often do is make sure I have some hymns written on my arm on a piece of Band Aid material. You usually have a phone number of the lawyer on your arm too.\u201d</p> \n<p>Queenslanders do not have the right to a phone call if they are in jail for a simple offence. In Victoria, people are allowed two phone calls. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the right to notify someone of your whereabouts and you\u2019ve got a right to legal advice,\u201d says Kelly. If you don\u2019t have legal support, police can find it for you. He says Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander people have other rights, which include contacting the Custodial Notification Service, a 24-hour legal advice and RU OK phone line.</p> \n<p>The police will eventually show you a list of your charges and bail conditions. The charges are usually minor, and may be anything from obstruction to trespass. Pestorius has long refused to agree to the bail conditions, which can include bans on meeting up with fellow protestors or returning to protest sites. \u201cThe role of repression is to tighten the political space and shift you out of the political space,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>Refusing bail conditions means you must stay in jail and wait to see a magistrate. This can take hours or days. Heselev and Starr refused their conditions and slept in jail overnight. When they saw a magistrate, Legal Aid wasn\u2019t at the hearing. To the pair\u2019s shock, their bail restrictions were tightened \u2013 they were banned from Bowen altogether.</p> \n<p>In the aftermath of her arrest, did Heselev learn anything? \u201cI feel like if you treat the police with some sort of level of decency, they will return the favour. Sometimes it\u2019s hard when you know what they stand for and the systemic issues that they represent,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a scary process but it\u2019s obviously different for everyone.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s hard to keep track of how many people have been arrested in the past year at climate rallies. In the past week alone, more than 200 people have been arrested at Extinction Rebellion rallies in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth. If you get arrested at a rally, what do you do? Police powers differ slightly across the states and territories. Policing styles, rally permits, laws of assembly, and the names of charges vary. But broadly, the process of getting arrested across Australia is fairly similar. \u201cAt the very basic level, all police need to do is tell you you are under arrest and touch you. They don\u2019t need to do much more,\u201d says Anthony Kelly, spokesperson for Melbourne Activist Legal Support, who has also been arrested 18 times. \u201cThey also need to tell you why unless there are extenuating circumstances.\u201d He says police can use \u201cappropriate levels\u201d of force to move a person during a protest. \u201cYou aren\u2019t obligated to co-operate with your own arrest,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople can decide to stand up and go along or people can remain seated and go \u2018limp\u2019 or passively resist.\u201d Kelly has been training activists in nonviolent protest since the late 1990s. He says it is crucial people stay calm. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive power differential when it comes to getting arrested. It causes a lot of stress,\u201d he says \u201cIt\u2019s really easy for people to do something inadvertently, which opens up to other charges.\u201d He cites the example of going \u201climp\u201d and accidentally flinging an arm, which can lead to police assault charges. Margaret Pestorius, 55, an antiwar activist and devout Catholic, \u201cthinks\u201d she has been arrested 11 or 12 times. She says the challenge for nonviolent protesters is calmly \u201cholding the space\u201d against repression, as she describes it, while trying to cooperate with police. The moment of arrest is dynamic. Sometimes she is \u201cengaged and friendly\u201d with police as she is led to the police wagon. She sings and prays. In 2016, when she was arrested with four friends for trespassing at Pine Gap, the US surveillance station in the Alice Springs desert, she kept playing her viola. The police eventually told her to stop. \u201cI gave the viola to the police inspector and asked him to look after it for me.\u201d But in August, when she lay in front of prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s car at the Coag meeting in Cairns, the situation was different and she became flustered. She claims the police grabbed her and threw her on the grass. Two of them knelt on her. \u201cI got rattled. I didn\u2019t cooperate with them,\u201d she says. Once arrested, police have the right to search, and can seize your mobile phone and wallet. They can do a pat-down. The police will also try to ask questions but there is no obligation to answer them. Kelly says the only thing people have to say is their name and address. \u201cPeople are often advised to say \u2018no comment\u2019 from here on in. That\u2019s a very important centuries-old right that people have,\u201d he says. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Protestors under arrest are usually driven to a police station in a van. Once there, they must hand over personal possessions, including jewellery, belts and glasses. Anti-Adani protester Matilda Heselev, 21, was arrested in July this year, alongside Emily Starr, after they locked themselves to a concrete barrel at Abbot Point coal terminal in central Queensland. They were taken to Bowen watch house. \u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed to wear my glasses,\u201d she says. \u201cMy advice to people who wear glasses is to wear contacts if they are planning on getting arrested.\u201d She and Starr also had to hand over clothes with draw strings \u2013 a hoodie and a pair of trousers. It was cold in the cell. For a few years now, Pestorius has disguised ear plugs as nipples in her bra, which police never seem to find when she gets a pat-down. She finds jail very noisy. \u201cClangy,\u201d she says. \u201cOther people in there can be very upset \u2026 It can be quite disturbing. Ear plugs are a great boon for a good sleep.\u201d While you don\u2019t have to say a word to police, Pestorius likes to talk. \u201cYou try to connect with the people you come in touch with and explain why you are there.\u201d Waiting for bail can take hours. Pestorius says she has used the time to exercise, sleep, meditate, sing songs and pray. \u201cOne of the things I often do is make sure I have some hymns written on my arm on a piece of Band Aid material. You usually have a phone number of the lawyer on your arm too.\u201d Queenslanders do not have the right to a phone call if they are in jail for a simple offence. In Victoria, people are allowed two phone calls. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the right to notify someone of your whereabouts and you\u2019ve got a right to legal advice,\u201d says Kelly. If you don\u2019t have legal support, police can find it for you. He says Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander people have other rights, which include contacting the Custodial Notification Service, a 24-hour legal advice and RU OK phone line. The police will eventually show you a list of your charges and bail conditions. The charges are usually minor, and may be anything from obstruction to trespass. Pestorius has long refused to agree to the bail conditions, which can include bans on meeting up with fellow protestors or returning to protest sites. \u201cThe role of repression is to tighten the political space and shift you out of the political space,\u201d she says. Refusing bail conditions means you must stay in jail and wait to see a magistrate. This can take hours or days. Heselev and Starr refused their conditions and slept in jail overnight. When they saw a magistrate, Legal Aid wasn\u2019t at the hearing. To the pair\u2019s shock, their bail restrictions were tightened \u2013 they were banned from Bowen altogether. In the aftermath of her arrest, did Heselev learn anything? \u201cI feel like if you treat the police with some sort of level of decency, they will return the favour. Sometimes it\u2019s hard when you know what they stand for and the systemic issues that they represent,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a scary process but it\u2019s obviously different for everyone.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Three-quarters of federal parliamentarians want caps placed on both donations and election spending to help restore Australians\u2019 trust in the democratic process. On Wednesday, Democracy2025 will release the results of a survey of 98 out of 226 politicians in the last term of parliament, which shows while most politicians are satisfied with Australian democracy (61%) compared with the public at large (41%), they are still concerned about lack of trust and a growing disconnect with the public. The initiative of the Museum of Australian Democracy asked the politicians to nominate their greatest dislike about Australian democracy. The most common responses were misrepresentation by the media (23%), integrity issues including corruption (13%) and short-termism and the three-year election cycle (12%). By comparison the Australian public\u2019s biggest concerns were the poor behaviour of politicians (19%), poor leadership (18%) and adversarial politics (14%). The politicians nominated Australia\u2019s rates of political participation (34%), free and fair elections (31%) and compulsory voting (21%) as its best features. The survey also asked politicians to rate a series of proposed reforms to improve democracy. Caps on donations and election spending topped the list with 76% in favour, followed by candidates lodging detailed election pledges (58%) and e-petitions triggering debates in parliament (55%). No other proposals got majority support, although members having more say in their party leader, allowing dual citizens to run for parliament and more free votes in parliament had more than 40% approval. Forms of direct democracy \u2013 such as postal votes on contentious questions (15%) and citizen juries (14%) \u2013 received low support. The least popular solutions were quotas for seats in the Australian parliament based on gender (12%), ethnicity (8%) and age (4%). The survey was not representative of the 45th federal parliament as a whole, with more female respondents than male and more respondents from Labor (39%) than the Coalition (35%) and crossbench (27%). The survey did not ask about Indigenous constitutional recognition or an Australian republic, labelling these proposed reforms \u201chighly politicised\u201d. In a report presenting the results, Democracy2025 director Mark Evans and University of Canberra Institute for Governance and Police Analysis centenary professor Gerry Stoker said that institutions including the Australian public service, parties and parliaments are \u201cfailing to various degrees\u201d to drive engagement in the political process. \u201cPolitical parties are struggling to deliver the political functions of aggregating and cohering community interests,\u201d the report said. \u201cThey have also neglected the role of talking directly to the public.\u201d The report argued that rather than a \u201cbinary choice\u201d between representative democracy and greater public participation \u201cit is increasingly evident\u201d that citizens and politicians think a mix of both will enhance trust. \u201cOn balance [parliamentarians\u2019] preference is not to rush to forms of participatory citizen-centred democracy but instead to adjust and strengthen the way that representative democracy works; to make parties better at performing their three roles in providing community linkages, effective governance and democratic integrity.\u201d The joint standing committee on electoral matters \u2013 which helped design the Democracy2025 survey \u2013 is currently conducting a review of the 2019 election. The review has heard from civil society groups which called for spending caps on elections, citing Clive Palmer\u2019s record $60m expenditure on the election; Coalition MPs who want a shorter pre-poll period; and Labor, which wants social media giants subjected to more scrutiny for failing to take down false material.",

They can\u2019t afford the feed, they can\u2019t afford the water and they can\u2019t afford the freight,\u201d Jones said in a fiery interview on Tuesday.</p> <p>In response, Morrison said the government was not able to make life \u201cas it was before the drought\u201d, but defended the Coalition\u2019s response.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/06/water-resources-minister-totally-accepts-drought-linked-to-climate-change\">Water resources minister 'totally' accepts drought linked to climate change</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe government, whether it\u2019s state, federal or anyone else, we can do a lot of things to help people try to get through this.

As the government fends off criticism of its national drought response, a Guardian Australia analysis of $100m in grants awarded under the program in 2019 shows that while many shires have used the grant program for water infrastructure projects, much of the funding has been spent on events, the purchase of equipment and maintenance work. The Winton council in Queensland used part of its grant funding to provide $820,000 to the Way Out West fest \u2013 a music festival that includes high-profile international acts that has been running since 2018. Gunnedah council spent about $40,000 on \u201ctwo great country music events\u201d that were supported by the Gunnedah Show Society and Gunnedah Rugby Club, including a \u2018Day with the Devils\u2019 and \u20185th Annual Country Music Muster\u2019. Guidelines for the DCP previously prohibited grants from being used on \u201cstaging events, exhibiting a display or for filming\u201d, but this was dropped from the most recent guidelines. Under the new broad guidelines of the program, which provides up to $1m for each drought-affected community, councils must provide information about how projects are expected to lead to the employment of locals, and the \u201cextent to which farmers and/or farm labourers/staff/contractors are expected to be employed\u201d. If a project does not meet this criteria, it must show that projects provide either economic activity or \u201cbusiness retention\u201d in a drought-affected community. The guidelines state that the funding cannot be used for \u201ca council\u2019s core or business-as-usual operations, which council rates and other government funding usually funds\u201d. Among the grants are many that appear to be routine maintenance and improvement works, including community hall upgrades, road maintenance and grading, and the installation of toilets in public areas. The Murweh Shire secured $200,000 for the redevelopment of Augathella Aged Care Residence, which was for \u201cstructural renovations and bathroom upgrades to cater for those with disability\u201d. The Gwydir shire council spent $37,000 on a new toilet for the Warialda cemetery and more than $100,000 on fencing for the Warialda airstrip. Winton council also received $220,000 for a virtual gym, which provided video teleconferencing equipment so remote teachers could lead group fitness classes, including Zumba, yoga, pilates and dance. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In a media release about the funding, the drought minister, David Littleproud, said the local community had endured extreme drought and severe flooding. \u201cWhile the locals are certainly feeling the strain from such a wet event, I hope that down the track, when things settle down, they will be able to fully utilise the town\u2019s virtual gym,\u201d he said. Littleproud told Guardian Australia that the government had asked communities affected by drought \u201cwhat we could do to help them economically and emotionally\u201d. \u201cThey identified the funding that would best employ locals, bring money into their towns, give emotional support by bringing them together and leave a lasting legacy of hope for the future,\u201d he said. But the Labor MP Ed Husic questioned whether the grants should be going directly to farmers. \u201cAt a time when farming families are seeing payments being stopped and others struggling to even get them from this government the general public will be stunned to think that drought aid isn\u2019t going to these people, but is being used to support events like music festivals,\u201d Husic said. \u201cI am sure those things have a place but the public would rightly expect the government to provide financial support to farmers who are actively thinking of leaving the land because of the drought.\u201d The government has been defending its drought response, with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, coming under fire from the broadcaster Alan Jones for not doing enough to support farmers. Jones said the government was facing a backlash in the bush for not doing enough to ensure livestock was kept alive to help farmers survive the drought. \u201cThey are sending the breeding stock to the sale yard to be slaughtered. They\u2019re walking off their farms. They need cash now, now, just as we gave a billion dollars to Indonesia over a tsunami. This is a drought tsunami and they need cash to feed their breeding stock so they don\u2019t have to sell. They can\u2019t afford the feed, they can\u2019t afford the water and they can\u2019t afford the freight,\u201d Jones said in a fiery interview on Tuesday. In response, Morrison said the government was not able to make life \u201cas it was before the drought\u201d, but defended the Coalition\u2019s response. \u201cThe government, whether it\u2019s state, federal or anyone else, we can do a lot of things to help people try to get through this. But the government cannot make it rain,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cWe want the farmers and the communities to be able to get through this drought but we can\u2019t kid ourselves that there is a magic wand and a magic cash splash that is going to make this thing totally solved.\u201d When Morrison spruiked the $115m spent through the Drought Communities Program, Jones said: \u201cHow does that feed a cow? PM, how does that feed a cow?\u201d In question time on Tuesday, Morrison was also asked to defend the amount of federal funding allocated to a recent dam announcement and the lack of money flowing directly to farmers from the Future Drought Fund. Morrison said the drought fund, which accounts for $5bn of the government\u2019s $7bn drought package, was not intended to provide direct financial assistance payment to farmers. \u201cIt\u2019s there to provide direct support for water resilience projects, to fund for the future,\u201d he said.",

But at every step, the apolitical complaints of the school shooter could be replaced with the rhetoric of classical fascism.</p> <p>That meant choosing symbolic targets, adorning guns with slogans, and writing political manifestos. In particular, it meant ensuring fascists on 8chan and elsewhere knew they were being addressed directly, by the use of their favourite memes and through livestream video over which they could exult.</p> <p>If racial murder were gamified murder, terrorism itself could become a meme, a concept that would replicate and spread online, so that fascist gun massacres became a constant temptation for the damaged young men already committed to far-right ideas.</p> <p>The Halle events reveal something of how that might work.</p> <p>Even in the very different conditions prevailing in Germany, the perpetrator followed the model established in English-speaking countries.</p> <p>He, too, wrote a manifesto, in which he set himself game-like targets to achieve (\u201cKill a Muslim and a Jew\u201d, \u201ckill someone with a pipe bomb\u201d). He, too, streamed the violence, in footage in which he, perhaps inadvertently, revealed the pathetic desperation underlying the chan milieu.</p> <p>\u201cI killed a couple, I tried,\u201d he mutters at one point. \u201cThen I die. As the loser that I am.\u201d</p> <p>As news of the murders broke, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, sent his condolences, describing the attack carried out on Yom Kippur as \u201canother expression of rising anti-Semitism in Europe\u201d.</p> <p>He\u2019s right, of course.</p> <p>But the murderer\u2019s casual shift from attacking a synagogue to executing a crying man in a kebab shop shows, once again, how antisemitism and Islamophobia reinforce each other.</p> <p>The contemporary Jew-baiter and the modern Islamophobe make almost identical assertions: the Jew/Muslim wears strange clothes, eats distinctive foods, fosters violence and transforms the culture.

      "bodyText": "At one point during the video feed he streamed on Twitch, the gunman who killed two people outside a synagogue in Halle in Germany smirks to the camera, \u201cnobody expects the internet SS\u201d. Increasingly, we should. The Halle murders follow a familiar template of violence, one established by the massacre of 51 people in two mosques in New Zealand in March this year, and then repeatedly imitated by fascists since. In April, a young man shot up a synagogue in Poway. Beforehand, he published a manifesto hailing the 8chan bulletin board and then tried to livestream his violence. In August, another fascist murdered 22 people in a racist attack on a Walmart in Texas. He, too, posted a document on 8chan praising the NZ massacre and its perpetrator. The latest killer begins his Twitch stream with the now customary shout out to the anonymity of chan culture. \u201cMy name is Anon and I think the Holocaust never happened,\u201d he says. To understand the \u201cinternet SS\u201d \u2013 these men mouthing online injokes as they commit murder \u2013 it\u2019s important to grasp just what such killers seek to achieve. They see individual terrorism as a method for channelling into action the remarkable support that fascists enjoy on the darker recesses of the internet. The architects of this strategy know that the sullen, unhappy young men attracted to 8chan already obsessed over the ever more frequent school shootings and workplace massacres in America, imagining them as moments of transformation in which a sad loser becomes, even for a few instants, an avenging god, his diminished potency and status miraculously redeemed by the weapon with which he mows down his enemies. For ideologically-committed fascists, it makes sense to harness the dark allure of gun massacres for political ends. Genuine fascism distinguishes itself from rightwing populism not so much by ideas but by action \u2013 in particular, by a commitment to violence, intended both to eliminate enemies and to restore the mystical soul of the nation. But, in the United States, the attempt to build a fascist movement collapsed after the murder of Heather Heyer at the Unite the Right event in Charlottesville. The Australian fascist grouplets fared little better. So instead of trying to organise further rallies, another option was to follow the script established by apolitical rage killers: stockpiling weapons, writing a list of grievances and meticulously planning a final confrontation. But at every step, the apolitical complaints of the school shooter could be replaced with the rhetoric of classical fascism. That meant choosing symbolic targets, adorning guns with slogans, and writing political manifestos. In particular, it meant ensuring fascists on 8chan and elsewhere knew they were being addressed directly, by the use of their favourite memes and through livestream video over which they could exult. If racial murder were gamified murder, terrorism itself could become a meme, a concept that would replicate and spread online, so that fascist gun massacres became a constant temptation for the damaged young men already committed to far-right ideas. The Halle events reveal something of how that might work. Even in the very different conditions prevailing in Germany, the perpetrator followed the model established in English-speaking countries. He, too, wrote a manifesto, in which he set himself game-like targets to achieve (\u201cKill a Muslim and a Jew\u201d, \u201ckill someone with a pipe bomb\u201d). He, too, streamed the violence, in footage in which he, perhaps inadvertently, revealed the pathetic desperation underlying the chan milieu. \u201cI killed a couple, I tried,\u201d he mutters at one point. \u201cThen I die. As the loser that I am.\u201d As news of the murders broke, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, sent his condolences, describing the attack carried out on Yom Kippur as \u201canother expression of rising anti-Semitism in Europe\u201d. He\u2019s right, of course. But the murderer\u2019s casual shift from attacking a synagogue to executing a crying man in a kebab shop shows, once again, how antisemitism and Islamophobia reinforce each other. The contemporary Jew-baiter and the modern Islamophobe make almost identical assertions: the Jew/Muslim wears strange clothes, eats distinctive foods, fosters violence and transforms the culture. More importantly, when bigots warn against an Islamic plot to transform the continent into \u201cEurabia\u201d, they popularise a conspiracism akin to the old libel about the Elders of Zion secretly running the world. The methodology matters more than particular details. If you think the Holocaust never happened, you might equally believe in a Muslim Brotherhood plan to introduce sharia by stealth, probably perpetuated with the assistance of Cultural Marxists. An attack on mosques, we\u2019ve now seen, can inspire murder in a synagogue \u2013 and, for that matter, the killing of Mexican immigrants in El Paso. That\u2019s surely one lesson from the Halle murders: the normalisation of racial populism must end. When politicians \u2013 and Netanyahu\u2019s a particularly notorious example \u2013 embrace xenophobia and Islamophobia, they facilitate a hatred that will be vented on the bodies of all kinds of scapegoats. If ever there was a time for Jews and Muslims to unite, it\u2019s now. But we also need to think about the \u201cinternet SS\u201d. For obvious historical reasons, fascism in Europe looks very different from the tiny grouplets active in Australia and the US. The far right in Germany boasts electoral successes as yet unimaginable in the English-speaking world. Nonetheless, the creation of a mass fascist movement still depends on a normalisation of political violence, something that, as yet, hasn\u2019t taken place. The misfits embarking on racial murder sprees to the cheers of their online pals will not create a fascist revolution. They might, however, reinforce an association between far-right ideas and actual violence, opening up the fissures between racial populism and genuine fascism in a way that encourages a move from one to another. That, at least, is what the killers hope. On the sites on which fascists gather, the Halle murderer has not, so far, received the acclaim he sought. The anons have mocked his appearance and his ineptitude, with many \u2013 in the usual logic of conspiracists \u2013 dismissing his actions as a so-called \u201cfalse flag\u201d. Even so, again and again, the discussions come back to the single question: how might he have done better? The implications are obvious \u2013 and terrifying.

      "body": "<p>It was clear that things were not going to plan when, just half an hour before the guests began to arrive, the judges of this year\u2019s Booker prize had yet to make a decision. Five hours after they had begun their deliberations, they finally emerged in a state of \u201cjoyful mutiny\u201d to announce that they had decided to break with convention, throw out the rule book and anoint two winners rather than the usual one.</p> \n<p>By happy coincidence, Bernardine Evaristo is the same age that Margaret Atwood was when, in 2000, she first won the Booker prize with The Blind Assassin. \u201cAnd I\u2019m happy that we\u2019ve both got curly hair,\u201d quipped Atwood as they took to the stage arm in arm. They talk about it again the following morning, comparing notes about hair etiquette and handy products for curls. They agree that it is a political issue. \u201cPeople used to review my hair back in the day,\u201d says Atwood.</p> \n<p> At first glance, the two prizewinning novels seem worlds apart. Evaristo\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/08/girl-woman-other-by-bernardine-evaristo-review\" title=\"\">Girl, Woman, Other</a> is a polyphonic look at the lives of 12 black British women that spans the past 100 years, while Atwood\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/10/the-testaments-by-margaret-atwood-review\" title=\"\">The Testaments</a> plunges us back into Gilead, the totalitarian state she created in 1985, when Evaristo was a radical lesbian theatremaker still in her 20s. Did the younger woman read The Handmaid\u2019s Tale when it first came out?</p> \n<p>\u201cObviously I knew about it, because lots of women around me had read it,\u201d says Evaristo<strong>,</strong> \u201cbut I didn\u2019t read it until the late 90s because I was reading African American women in my 20s, as they were the ones who I needed to read: Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Audre Lorde. They\u2019re the ones who spoke to me. But when I did read it, I just thought it was a fantastic, chilling story. And so powerfully feminist.\u201d</p> \n<p>Both winning novels continue that feminist tradition, though both could also be seen to contain critiques of it. In The Testaments, as in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, women are oppressed by women \u2013 notably the scary Aunt Lydia \u2013 while in Girl, Woman, Other, the teenage Yazz dismisses her mother as a feminazi: \u201cTo be honest, even being a woman is pass\u00e9 these days,\u201d she sneers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d443b323-079d-4526-8765-3f6cb8641082\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BA26hZHnz4c?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Both authors laugh: \u201cSo, yeah, she\u2019s a teenager,\u201d says Evaristo. \u201cOf course she has to counter the mom,\u201d agrees Atwood. \u201cAnd, in fact, the same thing happened in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale back in 1985. Offred has this feminist mom of the 60s and 70s who she considers really extreme and pass\u00e9, and her mother keeps saying: \u2018Just you wait.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Yazz\u2019s mother is Amma, who is a theatremaker, as Evaristo once was. We meet the character on the eve of her big success \u2013 a premiere of her play The Last Amazon of Dahomey, at the National Theatre \u2013 but the novel traces her back to a 1980s London of squats and lesbian collectives. How autobiographical is it all?</p> \n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s a version of my younger self,\u201d confirms Evaristo. \u201cI wanted to write about that 1980s era of, particularly, black women feminists who were creating art together, who felt like outsiders in society and who were very brave and also very confrontational \u2013 you know, because that was a very confrontational era. I used to heckle; Amma heckles. And Amma is lesbian. And I was lesbian in the 80s.</p> \n<p>\u201cA lot of the women creating theatre and art and dance and so on were lesbian or bisexual and working in a quite segregated way, but feeling empowered by each other \u2013 not having to explain themselves to other people, not feeling that they needed to bring men in. Then, I think, a lot of people reach a stage where they no longer need that; and also sexuality changes; my own sexuality changed.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ef44dd34fbb64e38b6474044f9bce58e6dbc0017\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef44dd34fbb64e38b6474044f9bce58e6dbc0017/180_156_1197_1605/746.jpg\" alt=\"Bernardine Evaristo performing in the 1980s\" width=\"746\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernardine Evaristo performing in the 1980s.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @BernadineEvari/Twitter</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Evaristo was the fourth of eight children born to an English mother and a Nigerian father in south-east London in 1959. Although Atwood grew up in Canada 20 years earlier and spent her early childhood running wild during field trips with her entomologist father, there are similarities in their upbringings, not least in the traditional attitudes to gender in schools. \u201cIn the 50s and early 60s, girls took home economics, boys took woodwork and never the twain would meet,\u201d says Atwood. \u201cThat\u2019s the education I had. But, since I grew up in the woods and had a tomboy mother, who was not interested in those things at all, it didn\u2019t take on me.\u201d Evaristo says: \u201cI went to a girls grammar school and did domestic science, and my brothers did woodwork or whatever they called it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Both women grew up in the heydey of the nuclear family, and their novels are an examination of less conventional families. In Gilead nobody is brought up by their birth mother, but it doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t mothered, while Evaristo creates all sorts of domestic set-ups. \u201cI have a gay man and a gay woman who raise a child separately; they\u2019re not living together. I wanted to present a sort of queer family,\u201d she says. \u201cAmma has a support network around her; she chooses lots of people to be godparents so that she always has babysitters, for example. </p> \n<p>\u201cBut,\u201d she adds, \u201cin the black British community, there is a bit of an issue with single-parent families \u2013 women raising children on their own. I do have one woman in the book who is raising her children on her own because her man is going off. But I also have some nuclear families.\u201d</p> \n<p>The nuclear family, Atwood chips in, was part of the burden of the 20th century. \u201cIn the 19th century, families were very extended. And then it became nuclear, which was actually very hard on women because they were expected to be in this house all by themselves with their Hoover and their washing machine. And that was supposed to be enough, but it meant that they didn\u2019t have any support.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo I think extended families and families that you make, rather than those you are handed on a plate, give people much more support. And, for instance, if you go to indigenous society, you will find a lot more generational support. So, grandmothers and elders are pretty important.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fa682431aba4579f6334347f98d9f52cfda0aec8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa682431aba4579f6334347f98d9f52cfda0aec8/0_0_988_1660/595.jpg\" alt=\"Atwood with her novel The Blind Assassin, which won the Booker prize in 2000\" width=\"595\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Atwood with her novel The Blind Assassin, which won the Booker prize in 2000.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Dempsey/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Which brings us to the role of older women in the novels. Aunt Lydia could hardly be described as a positive role model, Atwood agrees, \u201cbut all occupying forces raise a contingent from within the people being oppressed to do the controlling, because it\u2019s more effective and a lot cheaper. So of course they would raise a contingent of women. And so it has been throughout colonial history. As I say, nothing went into the book that didn\u2019t have precedent in real life. Somebody reading the original Handmaid\u2019s Tale once said: \u2018This book was just like my girls school.\u2019 Well, that\u2019s nuns, you know \u2026\u201d</p> \n<p>In Evaristo\u2019s world, three of the strongest and most endearing women are elderly. \u201cI really wanted to write an intergenerational novel, and to have women at every stage in their lives. I wanted them all to have their faculties intact and to be, to a certain extent, enjoying their lives and enjoying their independence.</p> \n<p>\u201cOlder women don\u2019t really feature much in fiction, which is such a shame, because we\u2019re actually much more interesting than younger women, because we\u2019ve lived full lives. But when young women write older women, they\u2019re usually mad!\u201d</p> \n<p>Atwood nods. \u201cWhen I went to the US right after the Trump election, these younger women were saying: \u2018This is the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened.\u2019 No, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not. Many worse things have happened.</p> \n<p>\u201cI also say that if your heart is broken when you\u2019re 18, by 28, you\u2019ve got some perspective; at 38, you\u2019ll probably think it\u2019s funny. And when you\u2019re my age, you cannot remember who it was who broke your heart.\u201d</p> \n<p>Which brings both writers to their own ages. \u201cAm I middle-aged now?\u201d wonders Evaristo, who was at the Booker ceremony with her husband, whom she met on a dating site 13 years ago. \u201cYou know,\u201d she ponders, \u201cthere\u2019s this myth that old people don\u2019t have energy. I think that if you look after yourself, you have energy.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cActually,\u201d adds Atwood, \u201cyou often have more energy, because it isn\u2019t going into the things it goes into when you\u2019re younger such as\u201d \u2013 she breaks into a loud stage whisper \u2013 \u201chormonal changes every month. There\u2019s a middle period when you\u2019re taking care of everybody \u2013 your kids, your parents \u2013 and you are really stretched. Then, as you get older, bad things happen, people die, but you are no longer caregiving to such an extent.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>What I find is that when young women write older women, they\u2019re usually mad</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Role models are key, says Evaristo. \u201cIt\u2019s good for younger women to see older women who are leading fulfilled lives. I had a friend who was in her 90s who had been movement tutor at my drama school. And she was still teaching into her late 80s, working in Europe and running workshops. And she always had plans.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was so important for me to show that ageing is something to be welcomed and enjoyed. Because what can you do about it? I know that sounds really idealistic, but that\u2019s what I try to tell myself, especially now that I\u2019m 60.\u201d</p> \n<p>The forms that both women have chosen to express all these themes are also energetic. \u201cWell,\u201d says Atwood drily, \u201cwhen you have totalitarianism, you\u2019re going to have a lot of plot, because totalitarianism generates plots. And I don\u2019t mean just the plot of the novel.\u201d</p> \n<p>Evaristo writes in a style which she calls \u201cfusion fiction\u201d. \u201cI wanted to tell 12 women\u2019s stories, so I had to find a form to fit that. It\u2019s kind of patterned on the page, a bit like poetry, and there were very few full stops, but there are gaps between the lines that indicate some kind of breathing spaces. It allowed me to write each woman\u2019s story in a way that was inside their heads and outside. And also to go back into the past and forward to the present.\u201d</p> \n<p>Although she has not written a play since the 80s, Evaristo acknowledges theatre\u2019s influence on her work and says she is hoping to go back to it. When I wonder what influence the TV adaptation of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale has had on Atwood\u2019s work, Evaristo points out that diversity quotas in casting have literally altered the complexion of Gilead. We also know that the TV series of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale introduced the character of the missing baby Nicole, whose wherebouts is a central mystery in The Testaments.</p> \n<p>Atwood doesn\u2019t disagree: \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of discussion of the TV series, that they didn\u2019t go the whole hog \u2013 because they would then have sent all the black people off to national homelands, as the South Africans did during apartheid. Perhaps North Dakota. I don\u2019t know what you know about North Dakota, but it\u2019s an inhospitable place to have a national homeland.\u201d</p> \n<p>Does television change the sort of stories that are told? \u201cIt changes the way stories are <em>seen</em>,\u201d says Atwood. \u201cIt\u2019s not like radio, where you can\u2019t actually tell what colour the person is. If The Handmaid\u2019s Tale were on radio, it wouldn\u2019t work. You wouldn\u2019t have all these protesters dressed as handmaids. It\u2019s very visual.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d says Evaristo, \u201cI think, in terms of TV drama and stage drama, cross-casting, as they call it, has been incredible. Especially recently.

      "bodyText": "It was clear that things were not going to plan when, just half an hour before the guests began to arrive, the judges of this year\u2019s Booker prize had yet to make a decision. Five hours after they had begun their deliberations, they finally emerged in a state of \u201cjoyful mutiny\u201d to announce that they had decided to break with convention, throw out the rule book and anoint two winners rather than the usual one. By happy coincidence, Bernardine Evaristo is the same age that Margaret Atwood was when, in 2000, she first won the Booker prize with The Blind Assassin. \u201cAnd I\u2019m happy that we\u2019ve both got curly hair,\u201d quipped Atwood as they took to the stage arm in arm. They talk about it again the following morning, comparing notes about hair etiquette and handy products for curls. They agree that it is a political issue. \u201cPeople used to review my hair back in the day,\u201d says Atwood. At first glance, the two prizewinning novels seem worlds apart. Evaristo\u2019s Girl, Woman, Other is a polyphonic look at the lives of 12 black British women that spans the past 100 years, while Atwood\u2019s The Testaments plunges us back into Gilead, the totalitarian state she created in 1985, when Evaristo was a radical lesbian theatremaker still in her 20s. Did the younger woman read The Handmaid\u2019s Tale when it first came out? \u201cObviously I knew about it, because lots of women around me had read it,\u201d says Evaristo, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t read it until the late 90s because I was reading African American women in my 20s, as they were the ones who I needed to read: Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Audre Lorde. They\u2019re the ones who spoke to me. But when I did read it, I just thought it was a fantastic, chilling story. And so powerfully feminist.\u201d Both winning novels continue that feminist tradition, though both could also be seen to contain critiques of it. In The Testaments, as in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, women are oppressed by women \u2013 notably the scary Aunt Lydia \u2013 while in Girl, Woman, Other, the teenage Yazz dismisses her mother as a feminazi: \u201cTo be honest, even being a woman is pass\u00e9 these days,\u201d she sneers. Both authors laugh: \u201cSo, yeah, she\u2019s a teenager,\u201d says Evaristo. \u201cOf course she has to counter the mom,\u201d agrees Atwood. \u201cAnd, in fact, the same thing happened in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale back in 1985. Offred has this feminist mom of the 60s and 70s who she considers really extreme and pass\u00e9, and her mother keeps saying: \u2018Just you wait.\u2019\u201d Yazz\u2019s mother is Amma, who is a theatremaker, as Evaristo once was. We meet the character on the eve of her big success \u2013 a premiere of her play The Last Amazon of Dahomey, at the National Theatre \u2013 but the novel traces her back to a 1980s London of squats and lesbian collectives. How autobiographical is it all? \u201cShe\u2019s a version of my younger self,\u201d confirms Evaristo. \u201cI wanted to write about that 1980s era of, particularly, black women feminists who were creating art together, who felt like outsiders in society and who were very brave and also very confrontational \u2013 you know, because that was a very confrontational era. I used to heckle; Amma heckles. And Amma is lesbian. And I was lesbian in the 80s. \u201cA lot of the women creating theatre and art and dance and so on were lesbian or bisexual and working in a quite segregated way, but feeling empowered by each other \u2013 not having to explain themselves to other people, not feeling that they needed to bring men in. Then, I think, a lot of people reach a stage where they no longer need that; and also sexuality changes; my own sexuality changed.\u201d Evaristo was the fourth of eight children born to an English mother and a Nigerian father in south-east London in 1959. Although Atwood grew up in Canada 20 years earlier and spent her early childhood running wild during field trips with her entomologist father, there are similarities in their upbringings, not least in the traditional attitudes to gender in schools. \u201cIn the 50s and early 60s, girls took home economics, boys took woodwork and never the twain would meet,\u201d says Atwood. \u201cThat\u2019s the education I had. But, since I grew up in the woods and had a tomboy mother, who was not interested in those things at all, it didn\u2019t take on me.\u201d Evaristo says: \u201cI went to a girls grammar school and did domestic science, and my brothers did woodwork or whatever they called it.\u201d Both women grew up in the heydey of the nuclear family, and their novels are an examination of less conventional families. In Gilead nobody is brought up by their birth mother, but it doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t mothered, while Evaristo creates all sorts of domestic set-ups. \u201cI have a gay man and a gay woman who raise a child separately; they\u2019re not living together. I wanted to present a sort of queer family,\u201d she says. \u201cAmma has a support network around her; she chooses lots of people to be godparents so that she always has babysitters, for example. \u201cBut,\u201d she adds, \u201cin the black British community, there is a bit of an issue with single-parent families \u2013 women raising children on their own. I do have one woman in the book who is raising her children on her own because her man is going off. But I also have some nuclear families.\u201d The nuclear family, Atwood chips in, was part of the burden of the 20th century. \u201cIn the 19th century, families were very extended. And then it became nuclear, which was actually very hard on women because they were expected to be in this house all by themselves with their Hoover and their washing machine. And that was supposed to be enough, but it meant that they didn\u2019t have any support. \u201cSo I think extended families and families that you make, rather than those you are handed on a plate, give people much more support. And, for instance, if you go to indigenous society, you will find a lot more generational support. So, grandmothers and elders are pretty important.\u201d Which brings us to the role of older women in the novels. Aunt Lydia could hardly be described as a positive role model, Atwood agrees, \u201cbut all occupying forces raise a contingent from within the people being oppressed to do the controlling, because it\u2019s more effective and a lot cheaper. So of course they would raise a contingent of women. And so it has been throughout colonial history. As I say, nothing went into the book that didn\u2019t have precedent in real life. Somebody reading the original Handmaid\u2019s Tale once said: \u2018This book was just like my girls school.\u2019 Well, that\u2019s nuns, you know \u2026\u201d In Evaristo\u2019s world, three of the strongest and most endearing women are elderly. \u201cI really wanted to write an intergenerational novel, and to have women at every stage in their lives. I wanted them all to have their faculties intact and to be, to a certain extent, enjoying their lives and enjoying their independence. \u201cOlder women don\u2019t really feature much in fiction, which is such a shame, because we\u2019re actually much more interesting than younger women, because we\u2019ve lived full lives. But when young women write older women, they\u2019re usually mad!\u201d Atwood nods. \u201cWhen I went to the US right after the Trump election, these younger women were saying: \u2018This is the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened.\u2019 No, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not. Many worse things have happened. \u201cI also say that if your heart is broken when you\u2019re 18, by 28, you\u2019ve got some perspective; at 38, you\u2019ll probably think it\u2019s funny. And when you\u2019re my age, you cannot remember who it was who broke your heart.\u201d Which brings both writers to their own ages. \u201cAm I middle-aged now?\u201d wonders Evaristo, who was at the Booker ceremony with her husband, whom she met on a dating site 13 years ago. \u201cYou know,\u201d she ponders, \u201cthere\u2019s this myth that old people don\u2019t have energy. I think that if you look after yourself, you have energy.\u201d \u201cActually,\u201d adds Atwood, \u201cyou often have more energy, because it isn\u2019t going into the things it goes into when you\u2019re younger such as\u201d \u2013 she breaks into a loud stage whisper \u2013 \u201chormonal changes every month. There\u2019s a middle period when you\u2019re taking care of everybody \u2013 your kids, your parents \u2013 and you are really stretched. Then, as you get older, bad things happen, people die, but you are no longer caregiving to such an extent.\u201d Role models are key, says Evaristo. \u201cIt\u2019s good for younger women to see older women who are leading fulfilled lives. I had a friend who was in her 90s who had been movement tutor at my drama school. And she was still teaching into her late 80s, working in Europe and running workshops. And she always had plans. \u201cIt was so important for me to show that ageing is something to be welcomed and enjoyed. Because what can you do about it? I know that sounds really idealistic, but that\u2019s what I try to tell myself, especially now that I\u2019m 60.\u201d The forms that both women have chosen to express all these themes are also energetic. \u201cWell,\u201d says Atwood drily, \u201cwhen you have totalitarianism, you\u2019re going to have a lot of plot, because totalitarianism generates plots. And I don\u2019t mean just the plot of the novel.\u201d Evaristo writes in a style which she calls \u201cfusion fiction\u201d. \u201cI wanted to tell 12 women\u2019s stories, so I had to find a form to fit that. It\u2019s kind of patterned on the page, a bit like poetry, and there were very few full stops, but there are gaps between the lines that indicate some kind of breathing spaces. It allowed me to write each woman\u2019s story in a way that was inside their heads and outside. And also to go back into the past and forward to the present.\u201d Although she has not written a play since the 80s, Evaristo acknowledges theatre\u2019s influence on her work and says she is hoping to go back to it. When I wonder what influence the TV adaptation of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale has had on Atwood\u2019s work, Evaristo points out that diversity quotas in casting have literally altered the complexion of Gilead. We also know that the TV series of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale introduced the character of the missing baby Nicole, whose wherebouts is a central mystery in The Testaments. Atwood doesn\u2019t disagree: \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of discussion of the TV series, that they didn\u2019t go the whole hog \u2013 because they would then have sent all the black people off to national homelands, as the South Africans did during apartheid. Perhaps North Dakota. I don\u2019t know what you know about North Dakota, but it\u2019s an inhospitable place to have a national homeland.\u201d Does television change the sort of stories that are told? \u201cIt changes the way stories are seen,\u201d says Atwood. \u201cIt\u2019s not like radio, where you can\u2019t actually tell what colour the person is. If The Handmaid\u2019s Tale were on radio, it wouldn\u2019t work. You wouldn\u2019t have all these protesters dressed as handmaids. It\u2019s very visual.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d says Evaristo, \u201cI think, in terms of TV drama and stage drama, cross-casting, as they call it, has been incredible. Especially recently. For example, Adjoa Andoh, a friend of mine, recently played Richard II at the Globe.\u201d Both novels end on a note of optimism. Does this reflect the writers\u2019 own attitudes. \u201cWhat we think of as a family has changed,\u201d says Atwood. \u201cIt\u2019s been a big fight in in North America and especially for gay people. But in Canada we have gay marriage now.\u201d Evaristo shakes her head. \u201cI think we\u2019re in difficult political times. I normally have a very positive perspective on everything. But, at the moment, I find it very hard to have a positive perspective on the political climate in this country, let alone anywhere else. \u201cBut with the characters I did not want to present 12 black women who are defeated by life, even though that is sometimes the case. So there is definitely hope in each of their narratives without it getting saccharine.\u201d Atwood agrees: \u201cA pessimistic ending would be you kill everybody off. The ending of The Testaments is not optimistic for everybody in the story, but it does signal the beginning of the end. Or as Churchill said: \u2018This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.\u2019 Maybe the end of the beginning is optimistic enough under the circumstances.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The first room says it all. By which I mean it shows you all the work by Nam June Paik you need to understand his contribution to modern art. There you will see, among other things, his masterpiece: TV Garden, an array of different-sized monitors embedded among greenery, their multicoloured screens blossoming like flowers in a gorgeous electronic pastoral.</p> <p>The more you think about this installation, the more insidiously provocative it is. Paik, who died in 2006 at the age of 73, was a polymath philosopher who prophesied our technological age. In 1974, he predicted the coming of an \u201celectronic super highway\u201d that would link everyone on Earth. Move over, Tim Berners-Lee. In 1994, when his vision was coming true, Paik celebrated it with a work called Internet Dreams, in which multiple ever-changing screens glory in information overload.</p> <p>Tate Modern\u2019s retrospective of this Korean-born American visionary should be a blast of futuristic beauty, but instead it smothers Paik in seriousness. Trying to make him more than he was simply turns him into less.</p> <p>The power of Paik\u2019s art lies in its lightheartedness. His message is that TV unites us and the journey to the future is sheer bliss. I treasure the memory of seeing his work <a href=\"https://americanart.si.edu/artwork/electronic-superhighway-continental-us-alaska-hawaii-71478\">Electronic Superhighway</a> in a gallery on Canal Street in New York. This huge map of the US glowed with optimism: it seemed to perfectly reflect the city around it, from neon bar signs to the twin towers of the World Trade Center standing tall in a perfect blue sky.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7b6a556ae8c9ac1a5bc74121afbfbd3db60e3491\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b6a556ae8c9ac1a5bc74121afbfbd3db60e3491/509_211_2661_1598/1000.jpg\" alt=\"TV Garden 1974-1977.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A gorgeous electronic pastoral \u2026 TV Garden 1974-1977.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: estate of Nam June Paik</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paik\u2019s gleeful beauty gets buried in this doomed attempt to turn him into a mighty modern artist on the scale of, say, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/robert-rauschenberg\">Robert Rauschenberg</a>. After that teasing glimpse of his magical way with video, you have to drag yourself through room after room, each revisiting his early career as a member of the international 1960s group Fluxus in impenetrable detail. To read every single poster, flyer and magazine \u2013 all assiduously assembled in vitrines and dwelling on long-forgotten happenings in Darmstadt \u2013 would take a lifetime. And I\u2019ve got TV to watch.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that Fluxus was boring. It\u2019s just that you clearly had to be there. It must have been hilarious to witness Paik\u2019s performance Etude for Piano Forte in 1960 at Atelier Mary Bauermeister, with iconoclastic composer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/john-cage\">John Cage</a> in the audience. After playing Chopin, Paik, who trained in classical composition, produced a pair of scissors and cut off Cage\u2019s tie.</p> <p>They became friends, Cage\u2019s ideas dovetailing with the Fluxus movement. In the 1950s, far-thinking musicians and artists rediscovered the then-forgotten, but still cheekily alive, Marcel Duchamp \u2013 in particular, his belief that art could be made by chance. Cage and the Fluxus crew used random instructions, obstacles and interruptions to make art. Or sometimes they just had a laugh. Paik once connected a dildo to an old gramophone and put it in his mouth so he could feel music through his jawbone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His friend Joseph Beuys keeps intruding memorably into the show</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s funny to read about, almost 60 years on, but hard to make sense of from the relics here. I just wish Tate Modern would curb its obsession with the extremely elusive history of Fluxus. There\u2019s too much of it in its free collection and too much in this show.</p> <p>One early work, in the Paik show, is mysteriously moving in a way that exposes the ephemerality of a lot of the stuff around it. Paik\u2019s Prepared Piano from 1962-63 is what survives of a series of instruments to which he added objects along lines inspired by Cage. Its upright wooden body is deliberately scratched and battered, its keys covered in strange stains. It is sad and pungent. It has become, over the past six decades, a great sculpture.</p> <p>Maybe great art has to contain something tragic. Yet Paik only let in tragedy by accident. His Prepared Piano is reminiscent of the art of another friend of his who keeps intruding memorably, and destructively, in this show. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/beuys\">Joseph Beuys</a> was, like Paik, a member of Fluxus \u2013 but he turned the movement\u2019s cerebral fixations into something more expressive and a lot more melancholy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"819e5142b7a05c48acf4e123ca739939d2e3db31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/819e5142b7a05c48acf4e123ca739939d2e3db31/0_0_2246_4244/529.jpg\" alt=\"Robot K-456, 1964.\" width=\"529\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gleeful and lighthearted \u2026 Robot K-456, 1964.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: estate of Nam June Paik</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Paik\u2019s exhibition of prepared pianos, the audience were invited to interact: Beuys physically attacked one of them. Great, said Paik, or words to that effect. Paik would almost certainly have been nicer to know \u2013 a gregarious collaborator with an optimistic outlook. But in a room dedicated to their friendship, the Nosferatu-like Beuys steals the show. In a performance in which Beuys howls like a coyote to Paik\u2019s piano accompaniment you can\u2019t help fixating on the former Stuka pilot\u2019s burn scars and inhuman grunts into the mic.</p> <p>Only time, decay and the sublime sustain great art like that of Beuys. The contrast is damning. In his inexhaustible belief in progress, Paik threw himself into technological experiments that simply elicit a shrug today. When, in the late 1960s, he worked at Bell Laboratories, then the most cutting-edge computer research centre around, he produced the most ambitious digital artwork anyone had yet come up with: a dot moving on a screen.</p> <p>Tate Modern obsessively assembles all Paik\u2019s pioneering yet archaic experiments, including his use of magnets to distort images on 1960s TV screens by interfering with cathode-ray tubes. Anyone remember them?</p> <p>It\u2019s a shame to see Paik so exposed, just through undue reverence. His finest art is completely alive and of our moment. Paik at his best revealed the wonder of our stupid world. In Bye Bye Kipling, a global broadcast originally transmitted live in 1986 with a Boston TV station, a Russian rockabilly punk band perform with Glasnost abandon while, back in the US, an alien visitor watches the proceedings to decide if humanity deserves to exist. The entire programme is addictive in the same way as TV itself. I watched it for so long, I forgot to read the Fluxus memorabilia.</p> <ul> <li><p>At <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/nam-june-paik\">Tate Modern, London</a>, from 17 October to 9 February.</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "The first room says it all. By which I mean it shows you all the work by Nam June Paik you need to understand his contribution to modern art. There you will see, among other things, his masterpiece: TV Garden, an array of different-sized monitors embedded among greenery, their multicoloured screens blossoming like flowers in a gorgeous electronic pastoral. The more you think about this installation, the more insidiously provocative it is. Paik, who died in 2006 at the age of 73, was a polymath philosopher who prophesied our technological age. In 1974, he predicted the coming of an \u201celectronic super highway\u201d that would link everyone on Earth. Move over, Tim Berners-Lee. In 1994, when his vision was coming true, Paik celebrated it with a work called Internet Dreams, in which multiple ever-changing screens glory in information overload. Tate Modern\u2019s retrospective of this Korean-born American visionary should be a blast of futuristic beauty, but instead it smothers Paik in seriousness. Trying to make him more than he was simply turns him into less. The power of Paik\u2019s art lies in its lightheartedness. His message is that TV unites us and the journey to the future is sheer bliss. I treasure the memory of seeing his work Electronic Superhighway in a gallery on Canal Street in New York. This huge map of the US glowed with optimism: it seemed to perfectly reflect the city around it, from neon bar signs to the twin towers of the World Trade Center standing tall in a perfect blue sky. Paik\u2019s gleeful beauty gets buried in this doomed attempt to turn him into a mighty modern artist on the scale of, say, Robert Rauschenberg. After that teasing glimpse of his magical way with video, you have to drag yourself through room after room, each revisiting his early career as a member of the international 1960s group Fluxus in impenetrable detail. To read every single poster, flyer and magazine \u2013 all assiduously assembled in vitrines and dwelling on long-forgotten happenings in Darmstadt \u2013 would take a lifetime. And I\u2019ve got TV to watch. It\u2019s not that Fluxus was boring. It\u2019s just that you clearly had to be there. It must have been hilarious to witness Paik\u2019s performance Etude for Piano Forte in 1960 at Atelier Mary Bauermeister, with iconoclastic composer John Cage in the audience. After playing Chopin, Paik, who trained in classical composition, produced a pair of scissors and cut off Cage\u2019s tie. They became friends, Cage\u2019s ideas dovetailing with the Fluxus movement. In the 1950s, far-thinking musicians and artists rediscovered the then-forgotten, but still cheekily alive, Marcel Duchamp \u2013 in particular, his belief that art could be made by chance. Cage and the Fluxus crew used random instructions, obstacles and interruptions to make art. Or sometimes they just had a laugh. Paik once connected a dildo to an old gramophone and put it in his mouth so he could feel music through his jawbone. That\u2019s funny to read about, almost 60 years on, but hard to make sense of from the relics here. I just wish Tate Modern would curb its obsession with the extremely elusive history of Fluxus. There\u2019s too much of it in its free collection and too much in this show. One early work, in the Paik show, is mysteriously moving in a way that exposes the ephemerality of a lot of the stuff around it. Paik\u2019s Prepared Piano from 1962-63 is what survives of a series of instruments to which he added objects along lines inspired by Cage. Its upright wooden body is deliberately scratched and battered, its keys covered in strange stains. It is sad and pungent. It has become, over the past six decades, a great sculpture. Maybe great art has to contain something tragic. Yet Paik only let in tragedy by accident. His Prepared Piano is reminiscent of the art of another friend of his who keeps intruding memorably, and destructively, in this show. Joseph Beuys was, like Paik, a member of Fluxus \u2013 but he turned the movement\u2019s cerebral fixations into something more expressive and a lot more melancholy. In Paik\u2019s exhibition of prepared pianos, the audience were invited to interact: Beuys physically attacked one of them. Great, said Paik, or words to that effect. Paik would almost certainly have been nicer to know \u2013 a gregarious collaborator with an optimistic outlook. But in a room dedicated to their friendship, the Nosferatu-like Beuys steals the show. In a performance in which Beuys howls like a coyote to Paik\u2019s piano accompaniment you can\u2019t help fixating on the former Stuka pilot\u2019s burn scars and inhuman grunts into the mic. Only time, decay and the sublime sustain great art like that of Beuys. The contrast is damning. In his inexhaustible belief in progress, Paik threw himself into technological experiments that simply elicit a shrug today. When, in the late 1960s, he worked at Bell Laboratories, then the most cutting-edge computer research centre around, he produced the most ambitious digital artwork anyone had yet come up with: a dot moving on a screen. Tate Modern obsessively assembles all Paik\u2019s pioneering yet archaic experiments, including his use of magnets to distort images on 1960s TV screens by interfering with cathode-ray tubes. Anyone remember them? It\u2019s a shame to see Paik so exposed, just through undue reverence. His finest art is completely alive and of our moment. Paik at his best revealed the wonder of our stupid world. In Bye Bye Kipling, a global broadcast originally transmitted live in 1986 with a Boston TV station, a Russian rockabilly punk band perform with Glasnost abandon while, back in the US, an alien visitor watches the proceedings to decide if humanity deserves to exist. The entire programme is addictive in the same way as TV itself. I watched it for so long, I forgot to read the Fluxus memorabilia. At Tate Modern, London, from 17 October to 9 February.",

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap: The former executives of Thomas Cook have faced heavy criticism from MPs today, over the collapse of the world\u2019s oldest travel company. The BEIS committee criticised the company for failing to cut its debt pile faster, failing to update its business model, failing to provide accounts that clearly showed its financial position, and failing to write off goodwill on its books sooner. Former CEO Peter Fankhauser was urged to do the right thing and return some of the bonuses he received during his time at the company. Clawback rules mean that \u00a3558,000 of his 2017 bonus could be seized by the insolvency service. Ex-chairman Frank Meysman came in for particular criticism; he was labeled deluded, and urged to show some humility over the collapse Meysman tried to pin some of the blame on the UK government, saying that the \u00a3900m rescue deal could have been revived if ministers had provided a backstop. It emerged during the hearing that Thomas Cook spoke to ministers from Germany, Spain, Turkey, Bulgaria and Greece in its final days, but no-one from Westminster. Thomas Cook\u2019s former leadership team also tried to blame the 2018 heatwave, and Brexit uncertainty, for undermining its recovery plan. But chair Rachel Reeves dismissed the idea that Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse was a tragedy: A tragedy, though, speaks of something that is out of your hands. I don\u2019t think this was out of the hands of the company. On the contrary, I would say that that the collapse of Thomas Cook was due to the decisions of the board, including you, Mr Meysman. Business secretary Andrea Leadsom has defended the government\u2019s refusal to provide financial help last month, saying it would have \u201cthrown good money after bad\u201d. The opposition Labour party, though, say ministers neglected their duty - at a time when thousands of jobs were at stake. They want a public inquiry. In other news.... Optimism that a last-minute draft Brexit deal could be agreed tonight has driven the pound to its highest level since May, at nearly $1.28. But some sources are urging caution, as any UK concessions on the Irish border might not be approved by parliament. The IMF has cut its growth forecasts: Royal Mail is facing a strike over the Christmas period. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned the global investors are fuelling the climate crisis. Investors in Neil Woodford\u2019s troubled Equity Income fund have been told the fund is being liquidated, rather than unfrozen. That means they won\u2019t receive any money until January, and could suffer substantial losses. That\u2019s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The FTSE 250 index has closed at its highest level in a year, as traders cling onto hopes of a Brexit breakthrough. Energy, consumer goods and services companies, banks and utilities all led the rally. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index ended the day flat. Banks and housebuilders held their gains, but multinational companies fell - due to the strong pound. Hold that optimism! The Guardian\u2019s reporting that the UK has made a key concession, that in principle that there will be a customs border down the Irish Sea after Brexit. EU officials are now downplaying talk of a Brexit breakthrough...... Shares in banks and house-builders are rising very sharply too in late trading. Bloomberg\u2019s claim that negotiators are \u2018closing in\u2019 on a draft deal has sent Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group up by at least 6.5%. Construction firms are also benefitting, with Barratt Development up 7% and Persimmon gaining 5.9%. This sudden burst of Brexit optimism has also lifting shares in UK-focused companies. The FTSE 250 index has surged by 1.8%, to a one-year high. Back in the markets, the pound has suddenly jumped to its highest level in nearly four months. Sterling has gained one and a half cents to $1.275 for the first time since 25 June, after Bloomberg reported that the UK and the EU were close to a last-minute draft Brexit deal. Bloomberg says: U.K. and European Union negotiators in Brussels are closing in on a draft Brexit deal with optimism that there will be a breakthrough before the end of Tuesday, according to two EU officials, Bloomberg News reports. Any draft legal text will hinge on whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson believes he has the support of the U.K. Parliament, with the backing of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party crucial. This has lifted the pound by around one and a half cents today, a substantial move. It means it\u2019s gained five cents in less than a week. My colleague Andy Sparrow is tracking all the Brexit action, as we head towards a crunch EU summit on Thursday and Friday; Q: Thomas Cook\u2019s CEO spoke to five government ministers in the run-up to its collapse, but none of them were from the British government. Shouldn\u2019t you or Grant Shapps have met the company? Andrea Leadsom says that transport secretary Shapps did speak to the company in September. He also had to build an airline \u2018from the ground up\u2019 to bring holidaymakers home, she adds. Leadsom adds that she\u2019s \u201cvery proud\u201d of the government\u2019s operation, despite the committee\u2019s attempts to find problems in it. Alex Chisholm then suggests that foreign ministers were scrambling to catch up at the last minute, unlike the well-prepared UK; I\u2019m not sure Reeves is 100% convinced by that one! Q: Did any officials from the business department meet with Thomas Cook in the run-up to its collapse? Leadsom says there was \u201csignificant engagement\u201d, yes, looking at what needed to be done in the event of its failure. She then adds that the collapse of Thomas Cook was a \u201ctruly devastating experience for all those people who lost their jobs, and very worrying for those who were on holiday.\u201d I was in frequent contact with Grant Shapps during the company\u2019s last weekend, Leadsom adds, and also in contact with the insolvency service, and asking banks to show forbearance to Thomas Cook staff. Q: Were the plans submitted by Thomas Cook to government on 17th September (a week before it collapsed) compliant with state aid rules? All government decisions are compliant with state aid rules, replies Leadsom smoothly. Reeves won\u2019t be put off that easily. Q: Were the plans submitted by Thomas Cook compliant? Leadsom says she isn\u2019t sure. Permanent secretary Alex Chisholm says the issue didn\u2019t arise, as the government didn\u2019t believe the proposal was feasible in the first place. Andrea Leadsom\u2019s top civil servant, permanent secretary Alex Chisholm, takes the controls. He tells Rachel Reeves that contingency plans were drawn up across Whitehall with a co-ordinated plan, in case Thomas Cook collapsed. Q: But was there any planning to avoid the collapse of the company?! Chisholm says there were various meeting about Thomas Cook\u2019s funding needs, which changed substantially over the months. There were talks with the government about what they could do to help. The government decided not to intervene with a financial bailout. It felt it was not a situation that was viable and sustainable.... Q: Who made that decision? \u201cThe lead cabinet minister responsible\u201d, Chisholm replies, \u201cin consultation with colleagues\u201d. [That appears to put the blame on Grant Shapps.....] Q: Why would the transport secretary make that decision, rather than the business secretary? Leadsom intervenes, and attempts to bat the blame over to the Treasury! The Treasury took a very close look at the situation, the business secretary says, and concluded it would be \u201cthrowing good money after bad\u201d. It wouldn\u2019t be possible to restore the company to health, she insists. With excellent timing, Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom is in front of the BEIS committee, to discuss her department\u2019s work. Thomas Cook isn\u2019t officially on the agenda, but chair Rachel Reeves makes it the first order of business! Q: When were you first made aware that Thomas Cook was seeking government help? Leadsom says he was first aware of its significant problems \u201cprobably a month before Thomas Cook finally went into liquidation\u201d [so mid-August?]. At that time, she was also being briefed on a huge number of other issues, including other companies in trouble and various policy briefs. [Leadsom was appointed on 24 July 2019, so this would be early in her tenure]. Q: Who told you? Leadsom can\u2019t quite remember, but suspects it was a policy update in her ministerial box. Q: What discussions did you have with transport secretary Grant Shapps? Leadsom says she sees Shapps most days at various committee meetings, so they\u2019d had a number of conversations. The week before Thomas Cook went into liquidation, there was a cabinet office meeting on the contingency plans, she adds. Q: Peter Fankhauser told us that he was told to only deal with the Department for Transport. Why? Leadsom says there is a \u2018lead department\u2019 for all major companies. The DfT is responsible for Thomas Cook, while BEIS officials were working closely with it. The Press Association have spoken to some of Thomas Cook\u2019s former staff, and it\u2019s fair to say they\u2019re not impressed by this morning\u2019s performance. George, who spent four-and-a-half years as cabin crew for Thomas Cook, said CEO Peter Fankhauser, chairman Frank Meysman sounded \u201cdeluded\u201d. \u201cWe were consistently told that everything was okay - \u2018everything was going to be fine, it\u2019s all going through, everything\u2019s going to be fine\u2019.\u201d Lynn McKeller, who spent 31 years as Thomas Cook cabin crew, was very disappointed that the company didn\u2019t seek UK government help. \u201cThe fact Peter Fankhauser didn\u2019t do anything to contact any government minister, that\u2019s hard. Elaine Coxhall, 48, from East Grinstead, West Sussex, who worked for three years as air crew from Gatwick, said: \u201c[Thomas Cook executives] should never be on the board of any company again.\u201d \u201cEven on the Saturday before it went under we got an email saying \u2018It\u2019s going to be fine, business as usual, there\u2019s going to be a little bit of noise in the media but it\u2019s going to be fine\u2019.\u201d Speaking of Brexit... the pound has been jittery today after Britain was given a midnight deadline to make new concessions to get a deal done. Our Brussels bureau chief Daniel Boffey explains: Michel Barnier has set Boris Johnson a midnight deadline to concede to EU demands and agree to a customs border in the Irish Sea or be left with nothing to take to the Commons. According to sources, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator told ministers that, as it stood, there was little prospect of a deal being signed off by leaders at a summit on Thursday, before a special sitting of the UK parliament on Saturday. Legal text had yet to be tabled by the British negotiators, Barnier told ministers in Luxembourg. Sterling hit a five-month high against the euro this morning, at \u20ac1.151, on hopes that a no-deal can be avoided. The IMF\u2019s chief economist, Gina Gopinath, has predicted that a no-deal Brexit would cut the size of the UK economy by 3%. Another clip from this morning\u2019s hearing: Just in: The International Monetary Fund has cut its growth forecasts. The Fund now expects global growth to be 3% in 2019 \u2013 down from 3.6% last year and a 0.3 percentage point cut from its April forecast. US is forecast to be the fastest growing of the G7 industrial nations this year, at 2.4%. Britain\u2019s growth rate is predicted to be 1.2%, the same as France, but stronger than Japan (0.9%), recession-threatened Germany (0.5%) and Italy (0%). The IMF has also warned that protectionism, such as the US-China trade war, is hurting the world economy, forcing policymakers to use scarce ammunition to stimulate growth. More here: Rebecca Long Bailey MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Business Secretary, has accused the government of dereliction of duty, over the collapse of Thomas Cook last month. She\u2019s appalled to hear today that no ministers spoke directly with the company in its final days, although tourism ministers from Spain, Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey were all in touch (as explained earlier in this blog). Long Bailey says: \u201cThere has been a clear dereliction of duty by the government. \u201cIt is shameful that ministers failed to make contact with Thomas Cook at such a vital time when other international governments were stepping in, and failed to examine the excessive bonus culture when it was very publicly facing difficulties. \u201cThere must be a full public inquiry into the government\u2019s handling of this scandal.\u201d Reeves 1-0 Meysman..... BEIS committee member Anna Turley MP is appalled to hear that no government ministers spoke to Thomas Cook in its final days (as we heard earlier) Here\u2019s a great clip of the BEIS committee putting Thomas Cook\u2019s bosses on the spot: BEIS committee member Peter Kyle is discussing this morning\u2019s hearing on Sky News now. He says MPs are going to \u201cgo very deep\u201d in its inquiry into Thomas Cook (they\u2019ll hear from its auditors next week, plus former CEOs Harriet Green and Manny Fontenla-Novoa). Kyle says he\u2019s concerned that Thomas Cook was carrying so much goodwill on its accounts, until it was forced to reduce it by \u00a31bn. This is a theme in recent business failures, he warns, pointing to the recent collapse of construction firm Carillion, which was carrying \u00a33bn of goodwill. This is very hard to assess, and not an asset that can be sold or lent against. What about Thomas Cook\u2019s heavy use of one-off special items and underlying profits?Kyle fears the company has attempted to \u201cscatter\u201d the difficulties it faced, making it hard to see the true picture. Yahoo Finance have also written about the heavy criticism dumped on the heads of Thomas Cook\u2019s ex-board. They say: Rachel Reeves, chair of the the Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) select committee, on Tuesday called Thomas Cook chairman Frank Meysman \u201cdeluded\u201d about the state of the business before its collapse. \u201cFrank Meysman talked about the tragedy that happened on that Sunday in September when the company went out of business \u2014 tragedy, though, speaks of something that is out of your hands,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is something that was out of the hands of the board of the company. On the contrary, I would say that the collapse of Thomas Cook was due to the decisions of the board of the company, including you Mr Meysman and Peter Fankhauser.\u201d Rachel Reeves has spoken to Sky\u2019s Paul Kelso outside Portcullis House, and repeated her call for Thomas Cook\u2019s board to hand back some of their pay. Peter Fankhauser faced fresh questions about his bonuses as he left today\u2019s hearing, from journalists waiting outside Portcullis House in Westminster. Thomas Cook\u2019s former CEO didn\u2019t say much new, beyond repeating that he won\u2019t make any decision today on whether to hand back some of his pay, before being pursued into a waiting taxi in a flurry of microphones, TV cameras and snappers. BALPA, the pilots\u2019 union, has criticised Peter Fankhauser and crew for their performance before the BEIS committee today. BALPA General Secretary, Brian Strutton, says: \u201cIt is right that those at the top of Thomas Cook are held to account for the company\u2019s collapse. Sadly, today, in response to excellent questioning by the committee, we heard lots of obfuscation, and precious little remorse from executives. \u201cWe also place significant blame with the UK Government who could have backed a temporary bridging facility to keep this company going, saving the thousands of jobs which have been lost. \u201cWe continue to support Thomas Cook pilots in finding new work but the scars of this collapse will no doubt run deep with them for many years to come.\u201d Here\u2019s The Times\u2019 take on the Thomas Cook hearing: Bosses of Thomas Cook were \u201crewarded for failure\u201d after attempting to hide the true scale of the company\u2019s losses as it teetered on the brink of collapse, MPs said today. Members of the tour giant\u2019s board were strongly criticised today as they were hauled before MPs for the first time since the 178-year-old firm was placed in compulsory liquidation last month. The cross-party business committee accused managers of attempting to effectively massage the books over eight years by withholding \u00a31.8 billion-worth of spending from its headline financial results. Rachel Reeves, the committee\u2019s Labour chairman, said the company\u2019s debts were an \u201cawful lot worse than the figures you were trying to present to the market\u201d, adding that this \u201call caught up with you in the end\u201d. More here: Mark Carney added that that some people in the financial markets will make money whichever direction Brexit takes. The governor told the Treasury committee (on a busy morning for committees) that: \u201cOn no-deal some people will become wealthier as a consequence of that, yes. Others will become poorer - they [winners] will be outnumbered by the number who become poorer.\u201d And on Facebook\u2019s Libra, Carney said the cryptocurrency is either going to be regulated properly globally \u201cor it\u2019s not going to happen\u201d - and he says he\u2019s confident that will be the view of the G7 and G20 financial stability board. \u201cThis will not be like social media. This will not be a case where something gets up and starts running and then the system tries to figure out after the fact how it\u2019s going to regulate it. \u201cIt\u2019s either going to be regulated properly, overseen properly, or it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d While the BEIS committee was eviscerating Thomas Cook\u2019s failures, Bank of England governor Mark Carney was being quizzed about climate change. This continued from his comments in our exclusive interview at the weekend. In stark analysis of the world\u2019s financing of carbon-intensive assets, he says the global capital markets - where companies sell their bonds and shares to investors to fund their activities - are on a track to lift the temperature of the planet by more than 4 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. That\u2019s double the target of the Paris climate agreement is to keep temperature rises well below 2c to avert catastrophe. Carney says he based the assessment on fund management firms that have analysed the climate-linked assets in their portfolios, including the massive $1.6tn Japan Pension Fund, which he says holds assets consistent with a 3.7 degrees rise. The fund is attempting to manage that down, he says. Axa, another investment manager, prices US government debt at \u201c5.4C\u201d, he says, reflecting the carbon intensive nature of the US economy. The UK is much lower, he says. Some companies are ahead of the game, Carney says, but many others are waiting for policies to change: \u201cPolicy is not yet consistent with stabilising temperatures below 2c. There are some companies out ahead, either because of their stakeholders, or because they\u2019re anticipating that that will change. But there are others that are waiting for the policies to adjust\u201d Here\u2019s a snap summary of the key points from today\u2019s blistering inquiry: Finally, Rachel Reeves MP chastises the former Thomas Cook bosses for their failure to run the company properly, or to show dignity at today\u2019s inquiry. A travel company is a simple business at heart, the BEIS committee chair says. You send people on holiday, make sure they have a good time, and bring them back. Thomas Cook couldn\u2019t get that right, so it failed - and that failure touched a lot of people a lot harder than it touched the five well-paid executives in front of the committee. You\u2019ve all given your apologies, Reeves continues. But frankly, as seen time and time again on this committee, apologies are the easy bit. The hard bit is to resign from other other directorships, and recognised you have a lot to learn. And... to: Give back some of the huge rewards that you have not earned, Mr Peter Fankhauser, but you have received. And with a final flourish, she urges Peter Fankhauser, Frank Meysman, Martine Verluyten, Sten Daugaard and Warren Tucker to reflect on the dignity which other Thomas Cook workers have shown, but which the committee has not seen today. And with that, they\u2019re dismissed... Rachel Reeves rounds the session up, with a scathing, magisterial dismissal of some of the excuses we\u2019ve heard this morning. She begins by dismissing former chairman Frank Meysman claim that a \u201ctragedy\u201d occurred one Saturday in September, when Thomas Cook went under. Reeves says: A tragedy, though, speaks of something that is out of your hands. I don\u2019t think this was out of the hands of the company. On the contrary, I would say that that the collapse of Thomas Cook was due to the decisions of the board, including you, Mr Meysman. Reeves says \u201ca series of misjudgements made by management\u201d led to the inevitable collapse of the world\u2019s oldest travel firm, namely: A failure to deal with the debt, not accumulated by Peter Fankhauser, but not dealt with in the five years he was in charge, or under Meysman\u2019s chairmanship A failure to write down goodwill. It \u201ccan\u2019t be true\u201d that goodwill was worth \u00a32.5bn one minute and \u00a31.5bn the next -- and now worth nothing. The use of special disclosed items in the financial accounts seem to be \u201canything but special, as they occurred year after year.\u201d All of the special events -- good weather, terrorism, volcanic ash -- every year there was some special item that helped to hide the underlying problems, rather than reveal the underlying state of the company. Failure to sell parts of the business that could have saved other parts; including the failure to sell the airline, failure to sell the travel agencies, the failure to raise the extra \u00a3200m needed. She then dismisses Meysman\u2019s claim that Thomas Cook was \u201calmost there\u201d with its rescue plan. Then looking to the back of the room, Reeves points out that former Thomas Cook staff have attending the hearing, in their uniforms, showing their commitment to the company. They do your company proud, and you should reflect, Mr Fankhauser, what you can do to put something back and say sorry to the people whose jobs you have taken and whose holidays you have ruined. I hope you will go away and reflect on the huge salaries you have earned, and what you can do to put right what you\u2019ve done wrong, she adds. Anna Turley MP turns to pensions. Q: How is it fair that Peter Fankhauser got a pension contribution of 30% of his salary? Fankhauser says that\u2019s a matter for the remuneration committee, but adds he faces a \u201cconsiderable impairment\u201d of his pension accumulated between 2001 and 2013 in Germany, when he was running Thomas Cook\u2019s European operations. He reiterates that he won\u2019t defend his pay - that\u2019s was set by the company - and adds that he has lost \u00a34m of shares. Warren Tucker confirms that Thomas Cook\u2019s executive pay packets were \u201clarge by any standard\u201d and when compared to average pay at the company (a fine statement of the bleedin\u2019 obvious). Turley points out that Thomas Cook\u2019s workers face uncertainty over their own pensions, and the committee needs to keep a close eye on this. BEIS committee chair Rachel Reeves circles back to the pay question -- how much of the \u00a320m of board bonuses paid out in the last five years be clawed back? Warren Tucker says that Peter Fankhauser received \u00a31.7m in bonuses. One third has been lost, and the clawback procedures means the rest of the 2017 bonus could be clawed back, if the liquidator decides it is appropriate. It could be \u00a3558,000. Fankhauser\u2019s \u00a34m of shares has already been lost. Q: What about other bonuses? Tucker says the finance director received a \u00a3400k bonus in 2017 - and it could also be clawed back. Q: So should they be clawed back? That\u2019s up to the people running the business now, says Tucker. There are four criteria that have to be met -- Statement of the accounts, reputational damage, gross misconduct and financial failure. Well, the financial failures and reputational damage boxes have been \u201cabsolutely ticked\u201d says Reeves triumphantly. Q: So shouldn\u2019t the bonuses be clawed back, in your view? Tucker argues that Fankhauser worked \u201cexhaustively\u201d to save the company..... Reeves (who doesn\u2019t appear very impressed by the witnesses) lets rip again: Q: What\u2019s the point of clawback policies if you can\u2019t claw back a bonus when a company collapses, taking jobs, taxpayers money and the hopes and dreams of your customers. You put those facilities in place! Tucker says the bonuses can be clawed back - it\u2019s up to the liquidator. Back in the Grimond Room, the BEIS committee want to know whether Thomas Cook accepts it shouldn\u2019t have paid such large bonuses. Q: With hindsight, have you learned anything or would you have done the same thing? Warren Tucker, who was responsible as remuneration committee chair, concedes that bonuses were mis-structured - there was too much focus on profits, and not on cash-flow generation. With hindsight, we wouldn\u2019t have paid the 2% pay rises either. Q: You\u2019re a non-executive director at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office - has anyone asked you about your suitability for that role? Tucker says he left the board in May, so \u201cnone of these events\u201d coincided with his time at the FCO. I just checked, and he started at the FCO in 2015..... Q: What about other former Thomas Cook executives? Frank Meysman says he has tendered his resignation from two other boards,and been asked to stay on. Martine Verluytem says the same happened to her - the two boards she serves on believes she provides value. \u201cThat is fascinating\u201d, Kyle tells the pair -- which may be a polite way of saying \u201csurprising\u201d. Catherine McKinnell, the temporary chair of the Treasury committee, asks Mark Carney about financial firms betting on the outcome of Brexit on the currency markets. It\u2019s a politically-charged question for the governor - given Boris Johnson has received political donations from hedge fund bosses who back Brexit. Carny reels through the (relatively new) rules for the $6tn global currency market, which was found to be a hotbed of insider trading and manipulation a few years back in a major scandal. Under the Bank\u2019s \u201csenior managers regime,\u201d finance industry managers have direct personal responsibility for conduct up and down their organisations, he says. The governor says Brexit developments are driving movements in the currency at the moment, and that the pound will certainly move up or down over the coming days and weeks. While financial stability can be maintained, he adds: \u201cThere will be some financial institutions and maybe some individuals associated with those institutions who have correctly predicted, or got lucky, on which direction sterling ends up going. And they will potentially make a lot of money.\u201d Elsewhere in Westminster Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England is answering questions from the Treasury Select Committee. The MPs have taken questions from the public, including on Twitter, to quiz the governor. First up: When will your successor be recruited and hired? Carney highlights two things: Sajid Javid\u2019s recent comment that the process is on track, but that parliament is \u201cquite occupied with some urgent affairs of state\u201d. He says there is however ample time for the government to hire his successor and that a wide range of qualified candidates are there to pick from. \u201cWhereas I was appointed several months before I took office, there are examples, including of the ECB, where the most recent president, Mario Draghi was appointed a few weeks in advance of taking office.\u201d \u201c[Britain] will have a highly qualified governor, a more highly qualified governor, in the new year.\u201d Carney says there will be an orderly transition, adding: \u201cThe government and this process has encouraged a very wide range of high quality people to apply. It\u2019s afforded a good set of options for the government to consider.\u201d Peter Kyle returns to the Thomas Cook bonuses. Q: The collapse of your company has created real suffering for your employees. You\u2019ve not suffered the same way. Why have you not put your hand into your own pocket? Peter Fankhauser says he won\u2019t defend his pay, compared to ordinary workers. But he repeats that he worked \u201cexhaustively and very hard\u201d to try to rescue the company -- adding that he wasn\u2019t paid in September. [Reminder: Fankhauser received \u00a38.4m during his tenure as chief executive at Thomas Cook, including \u00a34.6m in bonuses] Q: How can chairman Frank Meysman justify receiving over \u00a34m over the years? Meysman says he was paid \u00a3275,000 per year, over his six years, plus \u00a330,000 in expenses as he lives in Belgium. Q: OK, but can you justify that. Meysman says that\u2019s for others to judge, but insists he did the job \u201cfor pleasure\u201d, and had also bought shares with his own money. Q: Does Warren Tucker (remuneration committee chair) agree that bonuses were paid as a reward for failure? Tucker tries to defend the use of underlying profits for bonuses, but \u201cAbsolutely, at the end I agree\u201d that the company failed. Peter Kyle MP asks how the board addressed the rising crisis that subsumed Thomas Cook. Former chair Frank Meysman says board members discussed how to cut its debt levels, and devised a plan to cut the pile by \u00a3100m per year. Q: But your plans didn\u2019t work, so was the crisis \u2018normalised\u2019? Meysman says Thomas Cook did raise \u00a3400m through a rights issue, sold \u00a3350m of assets. Steps were taken, he insists. Q: But that just shows you were reacting to the crisis! Meysman says the company had a strategic plan - managing more of its own hotels, a new tie-up in China with Fosun, and a focus on Russia. But the overriding priority was to lower debts, thus the restructuring plan. Q: But you\u2019re travelling around the world, asking people to lend you more money. You look like a gambling addict, trying to open more credit cards to keep your addiction running. Meysman tried to sweep this aside. He says the \u00a3900 rescue plan was a \u201cgreat plan\u201d, saving employees and hoteliers, and not costing the government anything (he claims) - until it collapsed on 22 September when the government refused to provide help. Q: But you wanted \u00a3200m of support, and that would have been swallowed up by your \u00a3150m debt servicing costs, postponing the inevitable. Meysman says those debt repayments were a \u201cheavy heavy load\u201d. Fankhauser adds that he was in \u2018close contact\u2019 with UK government bodies, with around 100 meetings in the last year. That included a meeting with Grant Shapps, transport secretary, on 9th September, when Fankhauser told Shapps that TC\u2019s banks were seeking additional financing to underpin the rescue plan. Q: Did you have any contact with the business department in the run-up to your collapse? Fankhauser says no, because the transport department told him not to! We covered this last month: Rachel Reeves asks whether Thomas Cook spoke to government ministers in other countries. Apparently they spoke to lots! Peter Fankhauser says he spoke to the tourism ministers of Spain, Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece, who were concerned about the situation. He says that he knows that some of them contacted the UK government, and were told they\u2019d \u201cSee you on Monday in New York\u201d. That, I think, must refer to the UN Climate Summit which began on Monday 23rd, attended by Boris Johnson. Fankhauser adds that Thomas Cook engaged intensively with the government, at the highest level, in the days before its collapse. We were \u201cpretty confident\u201d, he says, but then on Sunday 22nd September the company realised that it faced a cliff-edge - without government support, the game was up. Fankhauser says that at 5pm that day he realised he \u201chad to throw in the towel\u201d when he spoke to a \u201chigh official\u201d on the phone, and learned that the government wouldn\u2019t support the plan. Q: Did you speak to any ministers on that Sunday? No, Fankhauser replies. We were clearly told earlier that week that the point of contact was the officials who were sitting in our meetings. The committee look astonished. Q: Didn\u2019t you try to challenge this? Fankhauser says no, but adds that the company did have contact with officials in Number 10 Downing Street. The other Thomas Cook executives confirm that they didn\u2019t speak to a minister either! Q: Do you regret that, Mr Meysman? (former TC chair). Meysman suggests that with hindsight, things could have been different (not the first time he\u2019s cited hindsight). Q: Who did you speak to at Fosun? The chairman. Q: But when it comes to the government, you only spoke to an official? Yes. Q: Would it have been in the taxpayers\u2019 interest to rescue Thomas Cook? Former chair Frank Meysman says that this is a matter for governments, but points out that other governments have taken a different view. Germany, for example, has bailed out the Condor airline (which is profitable). He then throws an elbow at the government for simply sending an email on Sunday 22nd September (the day before the collapse) saying it wouldn\u2019t provide support. I wish someone from the government would have come and sat down with us, and the chairs of its banks - who were in the country - Meysman says. Former CEO Peter Fankhauser agrees that government support on that Sunday would have been vital. He says Thomas Cook had worked out that the cost of its collapse to the taxpayer was higher than the amount of extra money it needed to keep going. Q: But wouldn\u2019t a bailout have simply delayed the inevitable? We would have been one of the best funded travel companies in Europe if the recapitalision plan had gone ahead, Fankhauser insists, waving his hands in the air as he insists the company could have had a bright future. Q: But what would have changed? Fankhauser says Thomas Cook would have had a new rolling credit facility, money from the bondholders, maybe new investment from elsewhere (if Fosun allowed it). Plus, enough money to get through the winter, expand in China, expand its online business, because the debt burden would have been lifted. Frank Field MP, Chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, has urged Thomas Cook\u2019s former top brass to do the right thing, and hand their bonuses to the firm\u2019s pension fund. Field says: \u201cThomas Cook workers now face a long wait to find out exactly how much they\u2019ve lost from their life savings, and while their former bosses might argue that this isn\u2019t another BHS, Carillion or British Steel, they will have a hard time justifying the millions they pocketed, one eye on the door, while the company collapsed around them. \u201cIf they\u2019ve had a chance to check how their own pensions are affected, perhaps the high-paid executives responsible would like to bolster the retirement of some of the workers they left behind, and give some of it back?\u201d Former chairman Frank Meysman blames the UK government\u2019s lack of support for driving Thomas Cook to the wall three weeks ago. He claims that all the parties were still committed to the \u00a3900m rescue deal at 4pm on \u201cthat famous, tragic Sunday\u201d [the day before the company failed]. But only if the government would step in with a backstop to underwrite the rescue plan on the table. The representatives of the banks and Fosun (the Chinese investors) told us that \u201cwe are still supporting this deal, providing the government has a role to play in the project\u201d, Meysman insists. Rachel Reeves (an opposition Labour MP) isn\u2019t impressed by this argument -- the government didn\u2019t build up Thomas Cook\u2019s debt pile! Q: What did Fosun and the banks want the government to do? Meysman says Thomas Cook had three requests: Either \u00a3150m-\u00a3250m, or exert power to bring the parties together, or allow it to use the current infrastructure to bring holidaymakers back, if the company collapsed Reeves says the demand for a backstop shows that Fosun and the banks didn\u2019t believe in the rescue plan at all. Why wouldn\u2019t they provide this extra \u00a3200m of support? Meysman says he doesn\u2019t know, expect that the banks and Fosun believed they were already making an appropriate contribution to the plan. [Explainer: Under this plan, Fosun was paying \u00a3450m for a majority stake in Thomas Cook\u2019s tour-operating business and a stake in its airline. Banks and bondholders provided the other \u00a3450m, taking the remaining stake in the tour operator and a 75% stake in the airline. The banks had also agreed to write off more than \u00a31.7bn of debt in return for a stake in the business.] The committee are now asking about Thomas Cook\u2019s last few weeks, when it became clear it needed more money. Q: When did you learn that the banks required \u00a3200m of extra funding? Which date in August? Fankhauser agrees to report back which date he was told about a \u201cdowncase scenario\u201d which would require extra funding of \u00a3150m-\u00a3200m. He says he knew that this scenario existed on 28 August when Thomas Cook announced it had agreed a \u00a3900m rescue deal that will give the Chinese conglomerate Fosun. But, he says it wasn\u2019t a formal request from the banks at that stage. This is a crucial issue -- this extra funding demand cause the collapse of the Fosun deal. Q: But why didn\u2019t the lenders provide the extra funding? Fankhauser says he doesn\u2019t know. My colleague Rob Davies is tweeting the key points from the hearing: Q: Why didn\u2019t Thomas Cook\u2019s management realise that its rescue plan was going wrong? Peter Fankhauser insists he believed the plan would work - the company tested \u201cevery day at four o\u2019clock\u201d that the deal could work. Q: So every day at four o\u2019clock you were wrong? With hindsight you can say that, Fankhauser replies. Q: Why did Thomas Cook underestimate the amount of money it needed to save it? Fankhauser says the company tried to sell its airline, to generate cash to help tide it through this winter, along with fresh bank financing. But it then realised that this plan wouldn\u2019t work, because the company wasn\u2019t generating enough cash. Q: But wasn\u2019t this just a fantasy sale, it would never have worked? Fankhauser denies it, he says Thomas Cook devised a complicated refinancing plan. But then the company came under pressure this summer from suppliers, and from credit card merchants. Plus, the refinancing costs were putting pressure on cashflow, Fankhauser says. He then explains how Thomas Cook\u2019s financial needs spiralled: On 12 July, we said we needed \u00a3750m in recapitalisation. Then on 12 August we saw that would not work, so we needed another \u00a3150m to \u00a3900m. Then we were stuck. Q: Can\u2019t you see that this looks like a company out of control, and downplaying the difficulties you faced to your investors, and your staff? It could look that way, Fankhauser agrees, but he insists that\u2019s not what happened. Rachel Reeves MP turns to the sale of Thomas Cook\u2019s shops to Hays Travel, a family owned firm (excellently profiled here). Q: Can they make a success of it? \u201cI wish they can. I honestly do,\u201d Peter Frankhauser replies. The former Thomas Cook CEO says that \u201cone of the brighter days in recent weeks\u201d was when he learned that Hays would take on the stores and save around 2,000 jobs. The retail business runs on commissions - he explains, so if Hays can renegotiate leases, create a much leaner debt structure, then \u201cfor sure\u201d it can be successful. I wish them all the luck, he adds. Reeves homes in on the debt issue. Surely Hays, which doesn\u2019t have a large debt pile, is doing things right - and Thomas Cook did it wrong. Fankfauser says Thomas Cook already had a big debt pile when he arrived in 2014 -- but he wasn\u2019t fast enough in reducing it. But he insists that Thomas Cook, with its large operations including an airline, is much more complicated than a simple travel agent. But the insolvency service has taken decisive steps in three weeks, Reeves replies scathingly. You had five years! Fankhauser says he was trying to save the whole business, rather than simply selling assets off in bits. But look what happened in the end, Reeves hits back. The whole company collapsed, stranding 150,000 people. Back to the bonuses, and Warren Tucker (former remuneration committee chair) confirms that underlying profitability was used to set bonuses. Why?! Tucker claims they didn\u2019t want to \u201cdisincentivise\u201d executives from taking necessary investment decisions which would hit earnings. Stephen Kerr MP says this smells very fishy -- wouldn\u2019t it be great if everyone could just ignore irritating costs they\u2019d rather ignore? This board was rewarded for failure, Kerr insists. The former Thomas Cook executives are claiming that their business was complicated, needed turning around, so it was right to class some losses as \u2018one-off\u2019 items on its balance sheet. Chair Rachel Reeves dispute the argument -- she argues that Thomas Cook used exceptional items to burnish its balance sheet, and give a rosier picture. Q: In the end, this focus on underlying profits caught up with you, didn\u2019t it? Chairman Frank Meysman denies it -- saying there was \u201ca lot of effort\u201d underway to reduce debts, offer exciting new holidays. He tries to paint a picture of success....saying the firm had 20 million happy customers, exciting new routes, a joint venture in China was looking good. There was a lot of restructuring underway, he insists.... Reeves has heard enough! She reminds Meysman that he has been summoned to the committee because 9,000 people have lost their jobs, and 150,000 holidaymakers had to be brought home at a cost to the taxpayer. With all respect, Mr Meysman, you can point to as many successes as you like, but you have brought down a 178 year old business with huge repercussions for customers, staff, and taxpayers. So you can point to the successes, but I\u2019ll point to the failures and they hugely outweigh the successes. Reeves points out that Meysman and his former colleagues began the session by apologising, but was that contrition genuine?.... I think you\u2019re deluded about the business you ran. You chaired a business that has gone under because of the decisions made collectively by your management team. When you point to your successes, maybe show a little more humility. Ouch! Stephen Kerr MP takes issue with the claim that Thomas Cook was trading well. You only made a profit in 2015, he insists -- every other year recently was a loss. Q: So how can you justify bonuses? Fankhauser says that some bonus payments came from a \u201clong-term incentive plan\u201d, to reward turning the UK business around. Kerr points out that Thomas Cook regularly classed losses as \u201cexceptional items\u201d, allowing it to report an underlying loss. Q: You did this for eight years -- and eventually your auditors raised concerns, so how can they be valid? Former chair Frank Meysman agrees that this is a \u201chigh value\u201d, but insist they were valid. Q: Buy you needed to use underlying profitability to give confidence to your banks and investors... Meysman insists that there was no deceit, everyone knew the situation. Former chairman Frank Meysman is now challenged -- why did Thomas Cook not write down its goodwill earlier? Meysman argues that trading looked strong, so there was no need to. But wasn\u2019t it a serious mistake to wait until May 2019 to booking a \u00a31.1bn goodwill impairment relating to the merger with MyTravel, a decade ago? Meysman denies it -- he claims that it wasn\u2019t clear in 2018 that Thomas Cook couldn\u2019t hit the growth targets it aimed for. He insists that Thomas Cook\u2019s \u00a31.2bn debt pile was the ultimate cause of its demise. Once \u201cthe heatwave\u201d in 2018 came, and \u201cthe anxiety of Brexit\u201d, the company realised it needed a new business plan, Meysman adds. That led to the profit warning in November 2018. Antoinette Sandbach MP turns to Thomas Cook\u2019s accounts. She points out that Thomas Cook\u2019s last full accounts included \u00a32.5bn of goodwill. That was based on strong earnings growth (28% per year, for three years) . Q: A few months later, the company slashed \u00a31bn off its goodwill -- so was it a mistake not to write down earlier? Audit committee chair Martine Verluyten says the company honestly believed trading would strengthen after a tough 2017. Q: But what was earnings growth in 2018? There was a decrease in earnings, due to a \u201closs of faith in the business\u201d, Verluyten replies. Q: Don\u2019t you think slashing \u00a31bn off your goodwill contributed to this loss of faith? Verluyten reiterates that the company believed its forecasts were accurate. Q: Why were the debts so high? Peter Fankhauser says Thomas Cook\u2019s debts were high when he joined in 2014, so he tried to bring them down. By May 2018 we were in a good position, he insists, with good bookings and cash generation. But he (then claims) that the summer heatwave hit trading hard. Q: So it was a trading failure, not a financial one? Fankhauser argues that tougher trading made it harder to tackle the financial challenges from the debt pile. He claims the company was taking the right steps. Former CFO Sten Daugaard says he joined the company in 2018, after two profit warnings. He says the company\u2019s \u201cvery high\u201d debt made it hard to execute the turnaround plan. Plus, the company wasn\u2019t generating enough cash to pay down debts. Q: So was Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse inevitable? Daugaard says he has been through five successful restructurings in his career. He believe Thomas Cook could have been turned around, by cutting costs and becoming more efficient. But, the high debt levels and debt servicing costs made it harder. Warren Tucker, former chair of the remuneration committee, says he is also sorry that Thomas Cook couldn\u2019t be rescued. Former CFO Sten Daugaard also associates himself with Fankhauser\u2019s opening contrite statement, as does former chair Frank Meysman and former audit chair Martine Verluyten. She says \u201cI always feel terribly sorry about what happened\u201d. Committee chair Rachel Reeves turns to the issue of bonuses. Q: Some \u00a320m was paid to executives in the last five years -- so will Peter Fankhauser repay his bonuses? Fankhauser says he worked \u201cextremely hard and exhaustively\u201d to earn his basic pay, and didn\u2019t get any bonus in 2018 and 2019. Half of my pay was in shares, he adds, and he\u2019s never sold a single one (they\u2019re now worthless). He also confirms that board rules mean that only bonuses from the last two years could be clawed back. Q: What was your bonus in 2017? Fankhauser says he received around \u00a3750,000 - 30% in shares. He won\u2019t say whether he\u2019ll hand it back. Although he \u201cfully understands\u201d the sentiment, and the views of the public, he also argues that he \u201cworked tirelessly\u201d to try to save the company during his five years as CEO. Reeves presses him hard on this -- the company went into the rocks on his watch, so how can he justify a bonus? Saying sorry is one thing, but we\u2019re not seeing much practical contrition. Fankhauser, sensing the mood in the room, says he will \u201ctake it back, and consider what is right, but I will not decide today\u201d. Former CEO Peter Fankhauser speaks first. He tells the committee that he is \u201cdeeply sorry that we couldn\u2019t save this iconic brand, and this company with a long, long history.\u201d I\u2019m deeply sorry about this failure, and deeply sorry for the distress to customers, and suppliers, he says, adding: I\u2019m especially sorry to all my colleagues who worked tirelessly to make Thomas Cook a better company. He adds that he\u2019s grateful for the professional work that the CAA has done to bring holidays home, and especially proud of the 2,000 colleagues who helped -- showing the company\u2019s commitment to its customers. Q: But what are you actually sorry for, Mr Fankhauser? Not not being able to turn around the company \u201cat pace\u201d, and to reduce Thomas Cook\u2019s debt pile, Fankhauser replies. He says the debt pile made the job much harder -- saying \u00a31.2bn was paid in interest and refinancing costs. Imagine what a better place Thomas Cook would be in, if only half of it had been re-invested, he adds. Q: What would you have done differently? Fankhauser says he would have pushed the transformation faster. The business committee\u2019s inquiry is underway. MPs will hear from Peter Fankhauser (former CEO); Frank Meysman (former chairman); Sten Daugaard (former CFO); Martine Verluyten (former chair of the audit committee); and Warren Tucker (former chair of the remuneration committee). Several former Thomas Cook cabin crew are in the room. You can watch it live, here (right-click to open in a new tab). While we\u2019re waiting in the departure lounge for the inquiry to begin, do check out our interview with John and Irene Hays. They\u2019re the husband and wife team who bought Thomas Cook\u2019s 555 high street travel agencies this week, and hope to hire thousands of workers who lost their jobs when the firm collapsed. Here\u2019s a flavour: \u201cPeople have portrayed us as country bumpkins,\u201d says John, 70, who founded Sunderland-based Hays Travel from the back of his mother\u2019s childrenswear shop in 1980. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what they think in a couple of years\u2019 time.\u201d The pair have a Herculean task ahead of them, picking up at least some of the pieces left over from one of the worst corporate failures in UK history. The demise of Thomas Cook has so far resulted in 8,123 redundancies. The official receiver is still paying 931 staff to help with the wind down. But the Hayses now want to recruit around 2,500 of those who have lost their jobs, quadrupling the size of their business in the process. It\u2019s a daunting prospect but the reality is that the couple behind this family-run operation, which unlike Thomas Cook is profitable and free of debt, are nobody\u2019s fools. \u201cMy husband is a clever boy, he\u2019s got a brain the size of an elephant,\u201d says Irene, 65, who chairs the business. The evidence from the last few weeks \u2013 and their four decades in business \u2013 suggests she and her husband know exactly what they are doing. In the final stage of negotiations, they triumphed over two US private equity companies to take control of Thomas Cook\u2019s high street network for an undisclosed sum. More here: A group of Thomas Cook cabin crew have arrived at parliament too, to hear Fankhauser and ex-colleagues questioned. Yesterday, ITV published the letter which the Department for Transport sent to Thomas Cook on 22nd September - explaining that it wouldn\u2019t provide financial assistance. The letter explained that government intervention would \u201ccreates a significant precedent risk to the private sector in future restructurings.\u201d In other words, more struggling companies would demand similar help in future.... so it was better to let market forces take their course, even at the cost of thousands of jobs and major disruption for holidaymakers. More here. Peter Fankhauser, former CEO of Thomas Cook, has arrived at parliament for the Thomas Cook inquiry, where he was collared by journalists. Joel Hills of ITV News is there, and reports that Fankhauser said he is \u201cstill devastated\u201d, and \u201cdeeply regret\u201d not saving the company. Some early reaction to the Woodford news: Ah. Neil Woodford has said he \u201ccannot accept\u201d the closure of his flagship fund this morning. He claims it isn\u2019t in the \u201clong-term interests\u201d of investors in Woodford Equity Income, and blamed the decision on Link (the fund\u2019s administrators). Link, though, feared another dash to the exits if the fund had been unfrozen, giving investors the option to cash out. LFS has concluded that an orderly realisation of the fund\u2019s assets allows the return of money through interim payments to investors more quickly than if the fund had remained suspended for a longer period of time. Big investment news this morning: Neil Woodford\u2019s \u00a33.5bn flagship fund is being wound up and the cash (what\u2019s left of it) returned to investors. The former star fund manager has effectively been sacked by the administrators of the fund, Link Asset Services. The fund has been frozen since 3 June; it was suspended after investors scrambled to get their money out after a series of Woodford investments performed badly. Woodford had been trying to rebalance the fund, out of illiquid assets and into more easily traded ones, so that it could be reopened -- and charging \u00a365,000 per day in management fees. Link, though, has concluded that it\u2019s better to wind the whole thing up -- another blow to Woodford\u2019s reputation. Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse ruined many people\u2019s holiday plans, and left many thousands more facing delays and uncertainty as they tried to get home. But there was a happy ending for one couple, Sharon Cook and Andrew Aitchison of Liverpool. They has booked Thomas Cook to fly them to Las Vegas for their wedding, and were facing having to cancel -- ruining a year\u2019s planning. Fortunately Delta Airlines and Caesars Palace came to their rescue by arranging new flights.... only for rock singer Sir Rod Stewart to appear for a surprise performance at the ceremony. If only Thomas Cook had such a happy ending.... Ever helpful, the Guardian have drawn up some crucial questions for MPs to ask Thomas Cook this morning. Will executives hand back bonuses? How did the business rack up \u00a31.2bn of debt? Who knew what \u2013 and for how long \u2013 about the company\u2019s problems? Could Thomas Cook have been saved? Should the UK government have bailed it out? Is the package holiday doomed? Here\u2019s the terms of reference of the Thomas Cook inquiry: The management, governance and stewardship of Thomas Cook Group plc; The remuneration policy and practice of Thomas Cook Group plc; The accounting practices of Thomas Cook Group plc and the audits conducted by PwC and EY; The role of regulators such as the Financial Reporting Council and Insolvency Service following Thomas Cook Group plc\u2019s collapse; The impact of the collapse of Thomas Cook Group plc on small businesses and suppliers, and the support available Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Why did the world\u2019s oldest travel company collapse? Why didn\u2019t a rescue plan work? Who is to blame? A committee of MPs will seek answers to these questions today when they grill some of the former top executives from Thomas Cook, which lurched into liquidation three weeks ago. The business committee will hear from five senior figures today including Peter Fankhauser, who was running Thomas Cook when it collapsed on 23 September, triggering the largest repatriation of UK holidaymakers ever. The committee say: Tuesday morning\u2019s evidence hearing is expected to focus on questions around Thomas Cook\u2019s rescue plan, corporate governance and the role of the Thomas Cook board, the debt taken on by the company, accounting practices, and the setting of CEO pay. Fankhauser has already said he\u2019s \u201cdevastated\u201d and \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for the demise of the company \u2013 and we may hear fresh contrition this morning. But Thomas Cook\u2019s former top brass may also blame the government for not providing vital financial help. A \u00a31.1bn rescue deal has been on the table, but vanished when the company couldn\u2019t raise another \u00a3200m Thomas Cook\u2019s executives are already facing calls to return some of the large pay and bonus packages they received in recent years. Fankhauser, and his two predecessors Manny Fontenla-Novoa and Harriet Green, received more than \u00a335m in pay and bonuses between them over the last 12 years. Surely this money should be returned? But this may not happen \u2013 due to a two-year limit on the \u201cclawback\u201d powers written into the contract of directors, if they are deemed responsible for the firm\u2019s financial downturn. My colleague Rob Davies explains: Peter Fankhauser was paid \u00a38.4m during his tenure as chief executive at Thomas Cook, including \u00a34.6m in bonuses, but the majority was paid in shares that he did not sell and are now worthless. Of the remainder, only one year\u2019s cash bonus falls within the two-year clawback limit, meaning the maximum he could be forced to return is \u00a3558,000. The same applies to former finance director Michael Healy, who could only be forced to give back \u00a3465,000, a combined total of just over \u00a31m. That is less than the \u00a31.5m than the Civil Aviation Authority is understood to have collected from Thomas Cook for providing advisors in the year leading up to its failure. Here\u2019s the details of the hearing, in the Grimond Room at Portcullis House, Westminster: Witnesses: Peter Fankhauser, former Thomas Cook CEO Frank Meysman, former Chairman Sten Daugaard, former Chief Financial Officer Martine Verluyten, former Chair of Audit Committee Warren Tucker, former Chair of Remuneration Committee The committee are planning to hear from Thomas Cook\u2019s auditors next week, with Fontenla-Novoa and Green also expected to be questioned soon. Also coming up today Bank of England governor Mark Carney is appearing before the Treasury committee to discuss financial stability this morning, and can expect plenty of questions about Brexit and trade wars. That session clashes with the Thomas Cook one, but we\u2019ll keep an eye on both. New UK unemployment data is expected to show the jobless rate remained at 3.8% in the last quarter, very low by historic standards. But basic pay growth may have slowed to 3.7%, from 3.8% a month ago. The International Monetary Fund publishes its latest World Economic Outlook later today. Its new boss, Kristalina Georgieva, has already said growth forecasts will be cut. The agenda 9am BST: BEIS Committee hearing into the collapse of Thomas Cook 9.30am BST: Treasury Committee hearing with the Bank of England 9.30am BST: UK unemployment report. 2pm BST: IMF to publish its World Economic Outlook",

      "bodyText": "The governor of the Bank of England has warned that the global financial system is backing carbon-producing projects that will raise the temperature of the planet by over 4C \u2013 more than double the pledge to limit increases to well below 2C contained in the Paris Agreement. In a stark warning over global heating, Mark Carney said the multitrillion-dollar international capital markets \u2013 where companies raise funds by selling shares and bonds to investors \u2013 are financing activities that would lift global temperatures to more than 4C above pre-industrial levels. World leaders agreed in the Paris climate accords to keep the temperature rise this century well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the rise to 1.5C. But in a stark illustration of the scale of the decarbonisation challenge facing the world economy, Carney suggested companies had already secured financing from investors in the global capital markets \u2013 worth $85tn (\u00a367.2tn) for stocks and $100tn for bonds \u2013 that will keep the world on a trajectory consistent with catastrophic global heating. The risks associated with temperatures at or above 4C include a 9-metre rise in sea levels \u2013 affecting up to 760 million people \u2013 searing heatwaves and droughts, serious food supply problems and half of all animal and plant species facing local extinction. Speaking to MPs on the Commons Treasury committee, Carney did not give a timescale for the temperature rise, but said: \u201cThe objectives are there, but policy is not yet consistent with stabilising temperatures below 2C. \u201cThere are some companies out ahead, either because of stakeholders, or because they\u2019re anticipating that that will change. But there are others that are waiting for the policies to adjust.\u201d Carney sounded the alarm in the wake of the Guardian last week revealing the 20 biggest companies behind a third of all carbon emissions. The Bank\u2019s governor said the financial system was now starting to wake up to the risks of global heating. He said some investment companies have analysed the carbon-linked assets in their portfolios, including Japan\u2019s $1.6tn Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF). Carney told the committee that GPIF\u2019s analysis showed it held assets consistent with 3.7C heating, and that the fund was now trying to manage this down.

It\u2019s at least 3C or 3.75C, it\u2019s probably north of 4C. That tells you something in terms of the sum of global climate policy.\u201d The Bank\u2019s governor has spoken at length about the need for the financial system to accelerate its efforts to tackle the climate emergency, warning that firms that ignore the crisis will go bankrupt. He said that banks should be forced to disclose their climate-linked risks within the next two years, and said that more information would prompt investors to penalise and reward firms accordingly. Threadneedle Street is currently drafting a stress test for the UK\u2019s banks based on their climate exposures, he added. However, the governor said the transition to a low-carbon world economy would still require investors to back firms with significant carbon footprints, given the scale of the adjustment required. \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as saying, \u2018Well I\u2019m going to invest in only renewable energy.\u2019 The system as a whole cannot invest only in renewable energy. \u201cThe contribution of manufacturing or an industrial company in terms of lowering their carbon footprint over the next decade, a big reduction in that, can be as significant if not more significant than further development in the short term on renewables,\u201d he said. Carney also dropped a heavy hint that the government would shake-up the Bank\u2019s remit for financial supervision to take account of climate risks at the budget on 6 November. \u201cRemits normally come with the budget, so we\u2019ll see what is in that \u2026 Every indication is there is a comprehensive strategy being developed consistent with the objective of net-zero [carbon emissions],\u201d he added.",

On Tuesday, the group protested at the Department for Transport, had a spontaneous gathering in Trafalgar Square, and demonstrated at Millbank Tower. Five protesters have told the Guardian why they have defied the ban and continued demonstrating.

      "body": "<h2><strong>THE STATE OF IT</strong></h2> <p>The Fiver preferred it when Borislav Mihaylov was best known in this country for his funny little syrup. Now he will probably be remembered as the face of a governing body that made itself the embarrassment of world football before, during and after Monday night\u2019s match against England. Mihaylov, the president of the Bulgarian Football Union, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/15/bulgaria-football-president-to-resign-after-racist-abuse-england-borislav-mihaylov\">has resigned</a> in response to the large-scale racist abuse that completely overshadowed England\u2019s 6-0 win in Sofia. He was given little option by the Bulgarian prime minister. \u201cIt is unacceptable that Bulgaria \u2013 which is one of the most tolerant states in the world and where people of different ethnic and religious background peacefully live together \u2013 should be associated with racism,\u201d tweeted Boyko Borissov, before suggesting that Mihaylov might wish to consider an alternative career path at his earliest convenience.</p> <p>Mihaylov had written an open letter to Uefa last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/10/bulgarian-football-union-president-borislav-mihaylov-accuses-england\">criticising England</a> for responding to questions about how they would react to any racist abuse during the game. Their stance was put to the test, wearyingly and inevitably, with the match halted twice in the first half after England players complained about a spectrum of abuse including monkey chants and Nazi salutes. The collection of wrong\u2019uns congregating behind one goal, in particular, looked like they had been teleported to the match from the Stone Age.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/14/six-minutes-added-time-racism-england-bulgaria-euro-2020\">England's vile and disturbing night in Sofia will live long in sporting infamy | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most Bulgarians were ashamed. The captain, Ivelin Popov, spent half-time appealing to the better nature of some of the home supporters. His coach, Krassimir Balakov, meanwhile, achieved the rare feat of having his fingers in his ears while his head was in the sand. \u201cIf our captain spoke to the fans, it was probably because of the way the team was performing, and the whole topic in the build-up to the game,\u201d he said, putting the crass in Krassimir. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything. If something happened, I\u2019m sure it was a small group of people who were really were out of their minds because it was unacceptable, if it happened of course. I also have to say the unacceptable behaviour was not only on the behalf of Bulgarian fans but also the English fans, who were whistling and chanting during the national anthem and used words against our fans in the second half which I found unacceptable.\u201d England fans called the home supporters \u201cracist ba$tards\u201d via the medium of song.</p> <p>The goalkeeper, Plamen Iliev, also said the home fans \u201cbehaved well\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/15/bulgaria-goalkeeper-plamen-iliev-praises-home-fans-and-says-england-players-overreacted-euro-2020\">and that England \u201coverreacted\u201d</a>. The reality, of course, is that England and everyone else have underreacted to racism in football for decades. It soon became clear on Monday, however, after the visceral revulsion, that a precedent had been set and something profound had occurred. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly proud of the players and all the staff,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/14/gareth-southgate-england-bulgaria-major-statement-racism\">said Gareth Southgate</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s such a difficult area as not everyone will agree we\u2019ve gone far enough but I still believe we\u2019ve made a huge statement. The game was stopped twice \u2013 I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s happened in international football.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever England do under Southgate, they have surely left a legacy as a team who did more than pay lip service to the fight against racism \u2013 not just in Bulgaria, but in England and everywhere else; 14 October 2019 already feels like one of the more significant dates in the history of the England national team. Of course, the most famous moment in English football occurred when some people were on the pitch, thinking it was all over. On Monday night, another landmark moment occurred when some players weren\u2019t on the pitch. And while nobody thinks racism is all over, we can only hope it took one hell of a beating.</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Will Unwin from 7.45pm for hot clockwatch coverage of the day\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifiers</a>.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p><strong>10 January 2002:</strong> \u201cWhat a relief it must be for [Tony] Blair to get out of England.

      "bodyText": "THE STATE OF IT The Fiver preferred it when Borislav Mihaylov was best known in this country for his funny little syrup. Now he will probably be remembered as the face of a governing body that made itself the embarrassment of world football before, during and after Monday night\u2019s match against England. Mihaylov, the president of the Bulgarian Football Union, has resigned in response to the large-scale racist abuse that completely overshadowed England\u2019s 6-0 win in Sofia. He was given little option by the Bulgarian prime minister. \u201cIt is unacceptable that Bulgaria \u2013 which is one of the most tolerant states in the world and where people of different ethnic and religious background peacefully live together \u2013 should be associated with racism,\u201d tweeted Boyko Borissov, before suggesting that Mihaylov might wish to consider an alternative career path at his earliest convenience. Mihaylov had written an open letter to Uefa last week, criticising England for responding to questions about how they would react to any racist abuse during the game. Their stance was put to the test, wearyingly and inevitably, with the match halted twice in the first half after England players complained about a spectrum of abuse including monkey chants and Nazi salutes. The collection of wrong\u2019uns congregating behind one goal, in particular, looked like they had been teleported to the match from the Stone Age. Most Bulgarians were ashamed. The captain, Ivelin Popov, spent half-time appealing to the better nature of some of the home supporters. His coach, Krassimir Balakov, meanwhile, achieved the rare feat of having his fingers in his ears while his head was in the sand. \u201cIf our captain spoke to the fans, it was probably because of the way the team was performing, and the whole topic in the build-up to the game,\u201d he said, putting the crass in Krassimir. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything. If something happened, I\u2019m sure it was a small group of people who were really were out of their minds because it was unacceptable, if it happened of course. I also have to say the unacceptable behaviour was not only on the behalf of Bulgarian fans but also the English fans, who were whistling and chanting during the national anthem and used words against our fans in the second half which I found unacceptable.\u201d England fans called the home supporters \u201cracist ba$tards\u201d via the medium of song. The goalkeeper, Plamen Iliev, also said the home fans \u201cbehaved well\u201d and that England \u201coverreacted\u201d. The reality, of course, is that England and everyone else have underreacted to racism in football for decades. It soon became clear on Monday, however, after the visceral revulsion, that a precedent had been set and something profound had occurred. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly proud of the players and all the staff,\u201d said Gareth Southgate. \u201cIt\u2019s such a difficult area as not everyone will agree we\u2019ve gone far enough but I still believe we\u2019ve made a huge statement. The game was stopped twice \u2013 I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s happened in international football.\u201d Whatever England do under Southgate, they have surely left a legacy as a team who did more than pay lip service to the fight against racism \u2013 not just in Bulgaria, but in England and everywhere else; 14 October 2019 already feels like one of the more significant dates in the history of the England national team. Of course, the most famous moment in English football occurred when some people were on the pitch, thinking it was all over. On Monday night, another landmark moment occurred when some players weren\u2019t on the pitch. And while nobody thinks racism is all over, we can only hope it took one hell of a beating. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Will Unwin from 7.45pm for hot clockwatch coverage of the day\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifiers. QUOTE OF THE DAY 10 January 2002: \u201cWhat a relief it must be for [Tony] Blair to get out of England. It is said that the Queen has come to love the Commonwealth, partly because it supplies her with regular cheering crowds of flag-waving piccaninnies \u2026 They say he is shortly off to the Congo. No doubt the AK47s will fall silent, and the pangas will stop their hacking of human flesh, and the tribal warriors will all break out in watermelon smiles to see the big white chief touch down in his big white British taxpayer-funded bird\u201d \u2013 Boris Johnson in the Telegraph. 15 October 2019: \u201cUefa needs to face up to facts. This stain on football is not being adequately dealt with. Racism and discrimination must be driven out of football once and for all\u201d \u2013 Boris Johnson\u2019s official spokesman, there. FIVER LETTERS \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Mike Hall\u2019s indifference to this email (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters) cannot be real. If he was truly indifferent, he would not have been able to summon the effort to re-sign to The Fiver\u201d \u2013 Steve Burton. \u201cHas Mike re-signed to receive The Fiver, or is he simply resigned to getting it again? Join the club\u201d \u2013 Mike Wilner. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport.

NEWS \u2026 AND ONE BIT AND ONE BOB In what is quite a day for the Bulgarian Football Union, more than 20 police officers swept into its headquarters in Sofia on Tuesday afternoon. \u201cI can confirm the presence of police officers but I can\u2019t provide more details at the moment,\u201d tooted a BFU spokeswoman. Derby County pair Tom Lawrence and Mason Bennett have avoided prison after they admitted drink-driving in a crash that left Richard Keogh seriously injured. \u201cYou are both intelligent and talented young men who have brought shame upon yourselves, your family, your profession and your club,\u201d said district judge Jonathan Taaffe. Paul Gascoigne wept as he denied sexually assaulting a woman on a train, claiming he wanted to boost her confidence after she was called \u201cfat and ugly\u201d. The trial continues. Turkey\u2019s players have defied Uefa with a military salute in their 1-1 draw with France on Monday, three days after they made the same gesture during a 1-0 win over Albania. The salutes are understood to be in support of Turkey\u2019s military in Syria \u2013 another footballer has been released from German club St Pauli for posting similar messages of support online. As expected, North and South Korea played out a goalless World Cup qualifier, but fans were left in the dark with Pyongyang refusing to broadcast the game live. North Korea had promised to provide footage of the match on DVD, the South\u2019s unification ministry said. \u201cWe would need time for technical checks, but despite some delays, our people will be able to watch the game,\u201d said a ministry official. Southend have scrapped plans to appoint Henrik Larsson as their manager. And Cristiano Ronaldo has now scored 700 career goals. RECOMMENDED LISTENING Football Weekly is right here, yo.

      "body": "<p>In possibly the final performance of her world championships career, Simone Biles stepped up to the floor on Sunday and prepared to open her routine with the skill that has become one of the most memorable sights in sport.Showcasing her triple twisting-double, the Biles II, she flew high into the sky, her legs tightly tucked as she twisted in the air. When she landed with her chest upright and just a small hop, her face burst into a wide smile that illuminated the rest of her gold-medal floor routine.</p> <p>Biles\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/13/simone-biles-gymnastics-24th-medal-world-championship-beam-balance-gold\">25th world championship gold medal</a> extended her lead as the most decorated gymnast of all time. She finished with five gold medals in the all-around, team, vault, balance beam and floor competitions. It was the most successful world championships of her career. She continues to compete only against herself in a league of her own, and the quality of that one woman league is only increasing. Her 2.1 points buffer in the all-around final was the largest victory margin of her career, and she won her gold medal on the floor exercise by a point \u2013 meaning she could have fallen and <em>still</em> won.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/08/simone-biles-skills-scoring-world-championships\">Why Simone Biles is even better than her scores tell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Biles has always won competitions by full points in a sport of tenths, but the gap only continues to widen as she improves at a faster rate than her rivals. At the Rio Olympics she grabbed the beam and last year in Doha she fell, but on Sunday she produced possibly the greatest beam routine of her career to win gold. Nowhere is Biles more prone to rolling her eyes than on the uneven bars, but as gymnasts flatlined around her in both the team and all-around finals, Biles was a rock. \u201cThis is probably my best worlds performance I\u2019ve ever put out,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The ease of Biles\u2019s gymnastics only tells part of the story. Entering every competition with the understanding that she can only lose if she makes a mistake is a brutal burden in a sport where mistakes are always a millimetre away. Only a disaster stood between Biles and gold at the 2016 Games in Rio, so she and her then-coach, Aimee Boorman, tackled the pressure of her first Olympic cycle by being conservative and valuing consistency. Although she has always thrived under pressure, Biles wasn\u2019t always comfortable with it.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone was like, \u2018Oh, you have to three-peat, you have to do this,\u2019\u201d <a href=\"https://theundefeated.com/features/the-difficulty-of-being-simone-biles/\">she said </a>after her third straight all-around gold at the 2015 world championships. \u201cAfter every event, everyone was just like, \u2018Is she going to do it?\u2019 So after I finished floor and I saw my [winning] score, I was like, \u2018OK, you guys have this stupid three-peat. There!\u2019 It stressed me out so much.\u201d</p> <p>After achieving everything she dreamed of in the sport over the past two years, Biles has had to find new motivation. It was her new coaches, Laurent and Cecile Landi, who nudged her out of her comfort zone and in the direction of performing her ballistic new skills. She was weary at first, but now there appears to be no greater thrill for Biles than pushing herself and gymnastics to unimaginable heights, ensuring that when the shine of her trophies fade, her name will be indelibly written into the fabric of the sport.</p> <p>When Biles was asked before the competition if breaking records, winning medals or having skills named after her was more exciting, she was clear: \u201cFor me, getting the skills named after me is really exciting. Just to go out there and prove to myself that I can do them, especially under all of the pressure that will be there.\u201d</p> <p>One of the joys of sport is witnessing an athlete\u2019s journey as they mature on and off the podium, becoming more savvy with their skills and more expressive with their words. This is still a rare sight in gymnastics, where the careers of most top all-around female gymnasts are fleeting. Biles has been the exception. Her extended time at the top has allowed her to slowly come to understand the potency of her voice. She now speaks out frequently and loudly, from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYjTQBVrFrQ\">poignantly addressing</a> her trauma over the Larry Nassar scandal to unabashedly asserting her greatness.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to teach our female youth that it\u2019s OK to say, \u2018Yes, I am good at this,\u2019 and you don\u2019t hold back,\u201d Biles <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/nancy-armour/2019/10/12/simone-biles-world-championships-gymnastics-titles-tokyo-olympics/3945703002/\">said</a> recently to USA Today. \u201cYou only see the men doing it.

      "bodyText": "In possibly the final performance of her world championships career, Simone Biles stepped up to the floor on Sunday and prepared to open her routine with the skill that has become one of the most memorable sights in sport.Showcasing her triple twisting-double, the Biles II, she flew high into the sky, her legs tightly tucked as she twisted in the air. When she landed with her chest upright and just a small hop, her face burst into a wide smile that illuminated the rest of her gold-medal floor routine. Biles\u2019 25th world championship gold medal extended her lead as the most decorated gymnast of all time. She finished with five gold medals in the all-around, team, vault, balance beam and floor competitions. It was the most successful world championships of her career. She continues to compete only against herself in a league of her own, and the quality of that one woman league is only increasing. Her 2.1 points buffer in the all-around final was the largest victory margin of her career, and she won her gold medal on the floor exercise by a point \u2013 meaning she could have fallen and still won. Biles has always won competitions by full points in a sport of tenths, but the gap only continues to widen as she improves at a faster rate than her rivals. At the Rio Olympics she grabbed the beam and last year in Doha she fell, but on Sunday she produced possibly the greatest beam routine of her career to win gold. Nowhere is Biles more prone to rolling her eyes than on the uneven bars, but as gymnasts flatlined around her in both the team and all-around finals, Biles was a rock. \u201cThis is probably my best worlds performance I\u2019ve ever put out,\u201d she said. The ease of Biles\u2019s gymnastics only tells part of the story. Entering every competition with the understanding that she can only lose if she makes a mistake is a brutal burden in a sport where mistakes are always a millimetre away. Only a disaster stood between Biles and gold at the 2016 Games in Rio, so she and her then-coach, Aimee Boorman, tackled the pressure of her first Olympic cycle by being conservative and valuing consistency. Although she has always thrived under pressure, Biles wasn\u2019t always comfortable with it. \u201cEveryone was like, \u2018Oh, you have to three-peat, you have to do this,\u2019\u201d she said after her third straight all-around gold at the 2015 world championships. \u201cAfter every event, everyone was just like, \u2018Is she going to do it?\u2019 So after I finished floor and I saw my [winning] score, I was like, \u2018OK, you guys have this stupid three-peat. There!\u2019 It stressed me out so much.\u201d After achieving everything she dreamed of in the sport over the past two years, Biles has had to find new motivation. It was her new coaches, Laurent and Cecile Landi, who nudged her out of her comfort zone and in the direction of performing her ballistic new skills. She was weary at first, but now there appears to be no greater thrill for Biles than pushing herself and gymnastics to unimaginable heights, ensuring that when the shine of her trophies fade, her name will be indelibly written into the fabric of the sport. When Biles was asked before the competition if breaking records, winning medals or having skills named after her was more exciting, she was clear: \u201cFor me, getting the skills named after me is really exciting. Just to go out there and prove to myself that I can do them, especially under all of the pressure that will be there.\u201d One of the joys of sport is witnessing an athlete\u2019s journey as they mature on and off the podium, becoming more savvy with their skills and more expressive with their words. This is still a rare sight in gymnastics, where the careers of most top all-around female gymnasts are fleeting. Biles has been the exception. Her extended time at the top has allowed her to slowly come to understand the potency of her voice. She now speaks out frequently and loudly, from poignantly addressing her trauma over the Larry Nassar scandal to unabashedly asserting her greatness. \u201cIt\u2019s important to teach our female youth that it\u2019s OK to say, \u2018Yes, I am good at this,\u2019 and you don\u2019t hold back,\u201d Biles said recently to USA Today. \u201cYou only see the men doing it. And they\u2019re praised for it and the women are looked down upon for it.\u201d Biles left Stuttgart having proved plenty to herself by winning medals and securing her eponymous skills with relative ease. But some of Biles\u2019 most memorable moments were simply her reactions \u2013 from opening her floor routines with her triple double and then beaming through the rest, to the way she applauded herself and then flitted from the podium in glee upon landing her double double dismount off the beam. \u201cI really don\u2019t know how I do it sometimes,\u201d Biles said after her all-around victory. \u201cSometimes I wonder how I do it. I feel like it\u2019s just like not me. I wish I could have an out-of-body experience to witness it because sometimes I think I\u2019m going crazy.\u201d At some point, Biles learnt how to truly enjoy competing against herself, and now she too can marvel at her greatness as it unfolds.",

According to the conspiracy theory, in 2016 Joe Biden, in his official role as vice-president, forced the firing of Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor in order to stymie an investigation into Burisma and Hunter Biden\u2019s role within it. However, several top Ukrainian officials have made clear the investigation was dormant by that time and there is no evidence the younger Biden did anything illegal. Hunter Biden told ABC coming under fire from Trump and Giuliani felt \u201clike living in some kind of Alice in Wonderland where you are up in the real world and then you fall down the rabbit hole and the president is the Cheshire Cat asking you questions about crazy things that don\u2019t bear any resemblance to the reality of anything that has to do with me\u201d. The timing of Biden\u2019s interview has raised eyebrows, just hours before the fourth Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio. Joe Biden will take the stage on Tuesday night at the centre of 12 Democratic candidates in the first such debate since the impeachment inquiry was launched last month. Several Democratic strategists have questioned the wisdom of Hunter speaking out at this critical moment. The fear is that it might switch the focus away from Trump\u2019s efforts to enlist the help of the Ukraine government and on to the president\u2019s home ground: his unsubstantiated claims of corruption on the part of the Bidens. Hunter Biden also used the ABC interview to deny Trump\u2019s unfounded allegation that he made $1.5bn from his work on a Chinese investment company. He said he had made \u201cnot one cent\u201d from that relationship. \u201cLook, this literally has no basis in fact,\u201d he said. Asked about a 2013 trip to China in which he accompanied his father on an official vice-presidential flight, he said he had gone to accompany Joe and his daughter Finnegan. He said he had not discussed any business matters at any point. The ABC interview is part of what appears to be a coordinated attempt by both Bidens to lance the boil of the Trump/Giuliani conspiracy theories. On Sunday Hunter announced he was stepping down from the board of the Chinese investment company. He also said he would desist from any foreign contracts were his father to win the presidency. \u201cI have committed I won\u2019t serve on any boards,\u201d Hunter Biden told ABC. \u201cI won\u2019t work directly for any foreign entities when dad becomes president.\u201d Earlier in the month, Trump stood in front of news cameras and openly encouraged China to look into the activities of his political rival and son. Also on Sunday, Joe Biden pledged that were he to win the presidential election next year no one in his family would have any business dealings with foreign companies. He then attempted to turn the ethical spotlight back on Trump by saying that none of his relatives would \u201chave an office in the White House\u201d \u2013 a dig at Trump\u2019s senior adviser, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and his wife Ivanka Trump.",

We were never contacted about being credited for the use of the parts of \u201cHealthy\u201d (melody, lyrics, and chords) that appear in \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d. After reaching out to Ricky Reed and Lizzo\u2019s team about fixing it, we put the song in dispute in 2017 when it came out. We\u2019ve tried to sort this out quietly for the last two years, only asking for 5% each but were shutdown every time.  Coming forward publicly to family, friends, artists, and colleagues seems to be the only way at this point in relieving some of our emotional distress caused by this. The last thing we want to do is throw any negativity toward Lizzo\u2019s momentum and movement as a cultural figure. If we believe in what she\u2019s preaching, believing in ourselves &amp; our own voices is something we thought she\u2019d understand.  Shout out to the singer Mina Lioness ( @minalioness ) for tweeting \u201cI just did a DNA test turns out I\u2019m 100% that bitch\u201d. A meme of that came up in our writing session &amp; inspired the lyric and melody we wrote together. If Ricky and Lizzo\u2019s team decide to settle this dispute with us, we would like to share some of the proceeds with Mina for her influence on Healthy. The clip below shows a video &amp; photos from the day we wrote \u201cHealthy\u201d along with the comparisons between the two works.

      "bodyText": "Lizzo has been accused for a second time of plagiarism over her hit single Truth Hurts, which recently spent six weeks at No 1 in the US charts. Songwriter and producer Justin Raisen has posted a video on Instagram comparing Truth Hurts to a song called Healthy that he and others wrote with Lizzo in 2017. The two songs share an opening line \u2013 \u201cI just took a DNA test, turns out I\u2019m 100% that bitch\u201d \u2013 as well as the same melody, sung in a different key. \u201cWe were never contacted about being credited for the use of the parts of Healthy (melody, lyrics, and chords) that appear in Truth Hurts\u201d, Raisen wrote in a caption to the video. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to sort this out quietly for the last two years, only asking for 5% [songwriting royalties] each, but were shut down every time.\u201d Raisen said he was making his accusation public owing to \u201cemotional distress \u2026 The last thing we want to do is throw any negativity toward Lizzo\u2019s momentum and movement as a cultural figure.\u201d Lizzo has not responded to the claims. The Guardian was told by Lizzo\u2019s record label that she and they would not be making a comment. Lizzo\u2019s debut album was released in 2013, but her breakthrough came with her third album, Cuz I Love You, this year. Truth Hurts was released in 2017 but reached the top of the US charts last month, and is her biggest hit to date. She has appeared in the hit movie Hustlers, and has been widely celebrated for her championing of body positivity. She was first accused of plagiarism in February 2018 by British singer Mina Lioness for the \u201c100% that bitch\u201d lyric, which Lioness originally tweeted in full in February 2017. \u201cEveryone believes those were your words, when in fact they were mine. My creativity, my wit and my comedy,\u201d Lioness tweeted at Lizzo, who replied that she had never seen the tweet and that she was \u201cinspired\u201d by a meme she had seen on Instagram. In June this year, Lizzo attempted to copyright the phrase \u201c100% that bitch\u201d for use on merchandise. In August, Lioness tweeted: \u201cWhat I cannot get over is how brazen Lizzo and her team have been in ignoring my whole presence. They\u2019re doing it because they know I have no capital to address her. I\u2019m just the poor Black girl from London that don\u2019t have a dog in the fight.\u201d Raisen acknowledged Lioness\u2019s tweet in his Instagram post this week, saying: \u201cIf [producer] Ricky [Reed] and Lizzo\u2019s team decide to settle this dispute with us, we would like to share some of the proceeds with Mina for her influence on Healthy.\u201d",

His targets encompassed Michel Foucault, multiculturalism and a miscellaneous horde of \u201ccamp-followers afflicted by the French diseases, the mock-feminists, the commissars, the gender-and-power freaks, the hosts of new historicists and old materialists\u201d. He reserved more than a little scorn (richly reciprocated) for the \u201cwretched\u201d <a href=\"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/english-literature-and-creative-writing/about-us/staff/terry-eagleton\" title=\"\">Terry Eagleton</a>, leader of the \u201crabblement of lemmings\u201d and the \u201cSchool of Resentment\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe Resenters prate of power,\u201d he wrote (in <a href=\"http://www.bestamericanpoetry.com/pages/volumes/?id=1988-1997\" title=\"\">The Best of the Best American Poetry 1988-1997</a>), \u201cas they do of race and gender: these are careerist stratagems and have nothing to do with the insulted and injured, whose lives will not be improved by our reading the bad verses of those who assert that they are the oppressed. Our schools as much as our universities are given away to these absurdities.\u201d </p> <p>Born in the East Bronx, New York, Bloom grew up in a poor Yiddish-speaking family, the son of Paula (nee Levi) and her husband, William Bloom. His father worked in tailoring shops and was frequently unemployed. Fiercely intelligent, Bloom claimed to have taught himself to read Yiddish by the age of three, and Hebrew by four. A lifelong passion for English poetry began in childhood.</p> <p>He attended the Bronx high school of science and won a scholarship to Cornell. After taking his BA, he went to Yale for postgraduate study. It was an uncomfortable experience for \u201ca young fellow, still a rough Yiddisher boy from the Bronx, and a proletarian too\u201d. Winning the support of the Boswell scholar <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/frederick-pottle\" title=\"\">Frederick Pottle</a>, he overcame considerable hostility to become a teaching fellow in 1955, and a full professor in 1965.</p> <p>In the 50s, the English department at Yale was the epicentre of the New Criticism, noted for its resistance to biographical, historical or cultural approaches to literary texts. The department was male and high church; Bloom knew very well that he did not fit in. He was too brilliant and prolific to be denied tenure at Yale. But Bloom wanted out, and resigned from all duties within the department in 1976, though he continued teaching. Unwilling to lose him to another university, Yale rewarded his declaration of separation from the English department with promotion to the highest rank, Sterling professor of the humanities. </p> <p>In 1988 he had a joint appointment as Berg professor at New York University, with a teaching schedule that allowed him to teach alternate weeks in New Haven and New York. He tartly regarded both institutions as equally filled with hypocrites and charlatans. </p> <p>He delighted in overturning academic orthodoxies of any and every persuasion, taunting feminists with gusto. His relations with his female students were a subject of rumour at Yale and elsewhere, surfacing in 2004 when the author Naomi Wolf <a href=\"http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/features/n_9932/\" title=\"\">described how Bloom \u201csexually encroached\u201d</a> upon her when she was an undergraduate two decades before.</p> <p>Admission into his Shakespeare class at Yale was fiercely competitive. The writer Wendy Moffat, who studied with Bloom in the 1980s, recalled him as \u201ca leonine, melancholy presence\u201d who gave \u201can air of almost dissipated exhaustion when he was listening to students. He could, and did, quote extraordinarily long passages from memory. The class was like ether \u2013 when I was in his class I felt as though I understood something amazingly deeply and well, and then the sense of understanding would dissipate when I left. Only the sense of awe remained. He connected us to a great, old, almost rabbinical tradition of sacred reverence for the word. It was self-enclosed: no deconstruction, or history, or politics \u2013 just the words.\u201d</p> <p>Bloom\u2019s later books made the New York Times bestseller charts. No American literary critic had ever reached so wide an audience. Beginning with The Western Canon (1994), he showed the non-academic reader what the canon was, and what it had to teach. Sweeping aside the fashionable \u201cisms\u201d and ideologies of the day, scorning the politically correct demand for what he regarded as the second rate, Bloom magisterially reaffirmed the centrality of the great works of literature in western culture.</p> <p>Addressing a broader audience seems to have loosened some of the scruples of academic discourse. Generalisations came fast and furious in his later books, larded with striking and sometimes bizarre opinions. Undergraduate readers of Bloom\u2019s Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human (1998) might have enjoyed the notion that Bassanio and Lorenzo in The Merchant of Venice were \u201ctwo Venetian playboys in search of heiresses\u201d, but the further suggestion that Bassanio, a charming and lightweight fellow, as Bloom describes him, was bisexual, with a nice line in homoeroticism, was pure showboating.</p> <p>In 2000 Bloom published <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/aug/20/classics\" title=\"\">How to Read and Why</a>, which explained, with impressive powers of oversimplification, what reading was and why it mattered. He suggested that the best way to read poetry was to do so out loud, and that readers should commit as much verse to memory as possible. </p> <p>He argued in The American Religion (1992) that denominational lineages, established doctrines and theological distinctions meant less in America than an Emersonian theology of unmediated experience of the self as God. His notably sympathetic account of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/mormon/history/josephsmith_1.shtml\" title=\"\">Joseph Smith</a>, founder of the Mormons, as a \u201creligious genius\u201d and \u201ccreative misreader\u201d of scripture, was urged without irony.</p> <p>Bloom called himself an \u201cunbelieving Jew of strong Gnostic tendencies\u201d. His deepening engagement with gnosticism brought religion explicitly to the centre of his work. He was driven by spiritual hunger and found in literature, and particularly in Shakespeare, the form which transcendence might take in our time. </p> <p>Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human is the place where a lifetime\u2019s love for literature found its most fervent expression. At more than 700 pages, it had little argument other than the idea that the modern sense of selfhood had been invented by Shakespeare. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/05/anatomy-influence-harold-bloom-review\" title=\"\">The Anatomy of Influence: Literature As a Way of Life</a> (2011) reiterated his central belief: \u201cFor me, Shakespeare is God.\u201d</p> <p>He continued to teach at Yale and remained a prolific writer, publishing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/13/the-daemon-knows-harold-bloom-review-a-man-of-great-literary-faith\" title=\"\">The Daemon Knows: Literary Greatness and the American Sublime</a> in 2015 and in his last years a series of portraits of Shakespearean characters.</p> <p>Bloom is survived by his wife, Jeanne Gould, whom he married in 1958, and their sons, Daniel and David.</p> <p>\u2022 Harold Bloom, literary critic, born 11 July 1930; died 14 October 2019</p>",

Already on the table are the platters of sizzling chorizo, the slabs of blue cabrales cheese, the plates of brine-cured ham \u2026</p> <p>Each of Spain\u2019s 17 \u201cautonomous communities\u201d has its own distinctive eating habits but some, you might say, are more distinctive than others. The region of Asturias, tucked between Galicia and Cantabria on the north coast, has a reputation in Spain for simple, hearty eating and, above all, for its fabulous raw materials \u2013 notably fish from its rich Atlantic waters, vegetables from its well-watered gardens, and cheese and meat from its lush mountain pastures.</p> <p>Traditional Asturian cooking has its roots in the landscape of this still predominantly agricultural community. Take <em>fabada</em>, Asturias\u2019 signature dish and an edible symbol of the region. Pork and beans: nothing could be simpler, yet there\u2019s more to this glorious dish than meets the eye. For a start, the legumes in question are not just any old bean, but <em>fabes</em>, the big white bean you\u2019ll see growing in vegetable patches all over the principality, whose thin skin (meaning greater digestibility) and creamy texture are without rival. The meats used are Asturian morcilla and chorizo, traditionally smoked to aid conservation in this damp northern climate, and a good chunk of bacon. A pinch of saffron, and hours of unhurried simmering. It sounds simple, but <em>fabada </em>is a great deal more than the sum of its parts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"048ecd0de5f8e2596aa733f940c3da8821ef147e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/048ecd0de5f8e2596aa733f940c3da8821ef147e/0_0_4288_2848/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fabada, one of the most representative dishes of Asturias\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fabada, Asturias\u2019 signature dish.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Monica R Goya/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Fabada, Asturias\u2019 signature dish</p></li> </ul> <p>It also stands or falls, like any number of Asturian dishes, on the freshness and quality of its ingredients. <em>Pitu de caleya</em>, a casseroled chicken like a Spanish version of coq au vin, is only worth making with a rooster that has lived and pecked happily in the open air. <em>Arroz con leche</em>, the classic local take on rice pudding, wouldn\u2019t be the same without full-cream fresh milk from the dairy cows that live like queens on Asturias\u2019 rolling pastureland. To be truly authentic, <em>pixin frito</em> \u2013 fried monkfish chunks \u2013 needs fish that has been landed just that morning \u2013 but the superlative quality of Asturian seafood in general is par for the course. Seaside restaurants such as <a href=\"https://gueyumar.es/\" rel=\"nofollow\">G\u00fceyu Mar</a> (behind the beach at Playa de Vega) and <a href=\"http://rompeolastazones.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">El Rompeolas</a> in Tazones specialise in wild, line-caught fish, confirming this coastal strip as one of the prime seafood destinations in the whole of Spain.</p> <p>Proper Asturian food is nothing if not democratic: there\u2019s good eating to be done here at every price-level and moment of the day. If it\u2019s innovative modern cuisine you\u2019re after, the region has a total of eight Michelin stars of which its best restaurant, <a href=\"https://www.casamarcial.com/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Casa Marcial</a>, in Parres, has two. Here, chef and owner Nacho Manzano has taken his childhood home \u2013 yes, the house he actually grew up in \u2013 and converted it into a temple of new Asturian cuisine, where tradition and outstanding local produce happily coexist with the chef\u2019s up-to-date culinary sensibility. On the long menu here, ham <em>croquetas</em> and <em>ll\u00e1mpares a la sidra</em> (limpets cooked in cider) jostle with innovative creations such as <em>fabes roxes</em> (red beans) with beef and olives, or sea anemones with nettles, lambs\u2019 brains and fennel pur\u00e9e.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"3ed971a06264a98bd78ec79714f1156ff0091f54\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ed971a06264a98bd78ec79714f1156ff0091f54/0_0_3333_4167/800.jpg\" alt=\"Queso Cabrales Noe, Baranda Cedida Por Tourism de Asturias campaign\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cabrales, the local blue cheese.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tourism Asturias</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"a2031d01eb196192a7120724d6fbc5f1bec89215\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2031d01eb196192a7120724d6fbc5f1bec89215/638_0_1336_1669/800.jpg\" alt=\"Primavera, Casa Marcial restaurant, Asturias\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Casa Marcial restaurant, Asturias</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>At Casa Marcial, chef Nacho Manzano combines tradition with innovative creations</p></li> </ul> <p>Several rungs down from these lofty heights are the traditional eating-houses where you might find rib-sticking regional classics such as <em>pote asturiano</em> (a take-no-prisoners stew of cabbage, beans and mixed meats) and <em>arroz con leche</em> on the daily menu. Then come the cider-houses with their typical range of <em>raciones</em> \u2013 cheeses, chorizo in cider, <em>pixin</em> \u2013 and the rural <em>tiendas-bar</em> (grocery shops that also serve drinks) where you might want to pop in for a slice of ham and a beer. The tapas habit is as big as anywhere in Spain, and if <em>fabada</em> is the Sunday-lunch special among Asturian dishes, the <em>cachopo</em>, a tender slice of fillet steak filled with ham and cheese, bread-crumbed and fried in olive oil, is the universal choice for laid-back snacking at any time of day or night.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/spains-secret-coast/2019/oct/15/secret-beaches-sacred-sites-and-sidra-the-10-best-things-do-in-asturias\">Secret beaches, sacred sites and sidra: the 10 best things do in Asturias</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And if there\u2019s one thing that unites <em>asturianos</em> of all ages and conditions, it\u2019s a sweet tooth. Among the universe of pastries and confectionaries, some, like the popular <em>casadielles</em>, a sugary mini-turnover stuffed with walnut paste, can be found in all good confiterias. But every town and city has its speciality, from the <em>carbayones</em> of Oviedo (almond paste in puff pastry), to the <em>charlotas</em> of Gij\u00f3n (cherry and chocolate sponge) and the l<em>etizias</em> of Ribadesella. This last is a buttery biscuit named after Queen Letizia of Spain, who was born in Oviedo and became Princess of Asturias after marrying the heir to the Spanish throne, King Felipe VI.</p> <p>The butter in those biscuits is bound to be local, because Asturias is dairy central. The verdant pastures of the principality are the source of the milk that half of Spain consumes in its caf\u00e9 con leche, but the region\u2019s true pride and joy are its cheeses. With an estimated 40 different types produced within its borders, four of which have Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen Protegida status, few places in the world can boast such a variety over such a modest surface area. Highlights are Gamon\u00e9u (a crumbly raw-milk blue cheese of superb quality) and Afuega\u2019l Pitu (creamy with a kick of piquancy; the name means something like \u201cfires in the throat\u201d), but the king of Asturian cheeses is surely Cabrales. Hailing from the Picos de Europa where it\u2019s aged in damp caves, this veined blue cow\u2019s-milk cheese is certainly a match for roquefort and stilton \u2013 and might be stronger-smelling than either.</p> <p>What should you drink with a good cabrales? This powerful cheese poses a challenge for would-be wine matchers, but luckily Asturias has the perfect accompaniment, and it happens to be another iconic local product. La sidra is central to the lifestyle of a region where apple orchards replace vineyards and <em>sidrer\u00edas</em> are the equivalent of wineries, but with rustic restaurants attached.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e4c13b375d2bdae91109df51fa3a1644a8cd2a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e4c13b375d2bdae91109df51fa3a1644a8cd2a9/0_0_4591_3036/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A reveller pours cider as he takes part in the annual Fiesta de la Sidra Natural.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A reveller pours cider as he takes part in the annual Fiesta de la Sidra Natural.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miguel Riopa/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Sidra, poured <em>escanciado</em></p></li> </ul> <p>For a full-on experience of local fermented-apple culture at its height, it\u2019s worth spending an evening on the cider-crazy Calle Gascona in Oviedo. But nowhere in Asturias are you very far from a <em>sidreria</em>.</p> <p>The cider-house rules are the same wherever you go. Rule one: let your waiter do the serving, unless you fancy your prowess in the art of <em>escanciado</em> (cider pouring). Rule two: order a <em>cachopo</em>, a bowl of fresh clams and some cheese to go with it. And rule three: be sure to gulp the cider down in one, leaving a little in the bottom of the glass, which you should tip out on the floor or into the receptacle provided. The practice is thought to derive from the Celtic belief in giving something back to Mother Nature \u2013 but it might just as well be a tribute to Asturias itself, the generous provider of all this deliciousness.</p> <p><em>Hungry?

To be truly authentic, pixin frito \u2013 fried monkfish chunks \u2013 needs fish that has been landed just that morning \u2013 but the superlative quality of Asturian seafood in general is par for the course. Seaside restaurants such as G\u00fceyu Mar (behind the beach at Playa de Vega) and El Rompeolas in Tazones specialise in wild, line-caught fish, confirming this coastal strip as one of the prime seafood destinations in the whole of Spain. Proper Asturian food is nothing if not democratic: there\u2019s good eating to be done here at every price-level and moment of the day. If it\u2019s innovative modern cuisine you\u2019re after, the region has a total of eight Michelin stars of which its best restaurant, Casa Marcial, in Parres, has two. Here, chef and owner Nacho Manzano has taken his childhood home \u2013 yes, the house he actually grew up in \u2013 and converted it into a temple of new Asturian cuisine, where tradition and outstanding local produce happily coexist with the chef\u2019s up-to-date culinary sensibility. On the long menu here, ham croquetas and ll\u00e1mpares a la sidra (limpets cooked in cider) jostle with innovative creations such as fabes roxes (red beans) with beef and olives, or sea anemones with nettles, lambs\u2019 brains and fennel pur\u00e9e. At Casa Marcial, chef Nacho Manzano combines tradition with innovative creations Several rungs down from these lofty heights are the traditional eating-houses where you might find rib-sticking regional classics such as pote asturiano (a take-no-prisoners stew of cabbage, beans and mixed meats) and arroz con leche on the daily menu. Then come the cider-houses with their typical range of raciones \u2013 cheeses, chorizo in cider, pixin \u2013 and the rural tiendas-bar (grocery shops that also serve drinks) where you might want to pop in for a slice of ham and a beer. The tapas habit is as big as anywhere in Spain, and if fabada is the Sunday-lunch special among Asturian dishes, the cachopo, a tender slice of fillet steak filled with ham and cheese, bread-crumbed and fried in olive oil, is the universal choice for laid-back snacking at any time of day or night. And if there\u2019s one thing that unites asturianos of all ages and conditions, it\u2019s a sweet tooth. Among the universe of pastries and confectionaries, some, like the popular casadielles, a sugary mini-turnover stuffed with walnut paste, can be found in all good confiterias. But every town and city has its speciality, from the carbayones of Oviedo (almond paste in puff pastry), to the charlotas of Gij\u00f3n (cherry and chocolate sponge) and the letizias of Ribadesella. This last is a buttery biscuit named after Queen Letizia of Spain, who was born in Oviedo and became Princess of Asturias after marrying the heir to the Spanish throne, King Felipe VI. The butter in those biscuits is bound to be local, because Asturias is dairy central. The verdant pastures of the principality are the source of the milk that half of Spain consumes in its caf\u00e9 con leche, but the region\u2019s true pride and joy are its cheeses. With an estimated 40 different types produced within its borders, four of which have Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen Protegida status, few places in the world can boast such a variety over such a modest surface area. Highlights are Gamon\u00e9u (a crumbly raw-milk blue cheese of superb quality) and Afuega\u2019l Pitu (creamy with a kick of piquancy; the name means something like \u201cfires in the throat\u201d), but the king of Asturian cheeses is surely Cabrales. Hailing from the Picos de Europa where it\u2019s aged in damp caves, this veined blue cow\u2019s-milk cheese is certainly a match for roquefort and stilton \u2013 and might be stronger-smelling than either. What should you drink with a good cabrales? This powerful cheese poses a challenge for would-be wine matchers, but luckily Asturias has the perfect accompaniment, and it happens to be another iconic local product. La sidra is central to the lifestyle of a region where apple orchards replace vineyards and sidrer\u00edas are the equivalent of wineries, but with rustic restaurants attached. Sidra, poured escanciado For a full-on experience of local fermented-apple culture at its height, it\u2019s worth spending an evening on the cider-crazy Calle Gascona in Oviedo. But nowhere in Asturias are you very far from a sidreria. The cider-house rules are the same wherever you go. Rule one: let your waiter do the serving, unless you fancy your prowess in the art of escanciado (cider pouring). Rule two: order a cachopo, a bowl of fresh clams and some cheese to go with it. And rule three: be sure to gulp the cider down in one, leaving a little in the bottom of the glass, which you should tip out on the floor or into the receptacle provided. The practice is thought to derive from the Celtic belief in giving something back to Mother Nature \u2013 but it might just as well be a tribute to Asturias itself, the generous provider of all this deliciousness.

Pre-Romanesque architecture in Oviedo Top: the steeple and interior of the church of San Juli\u00e1n de los Prados; below: the enchanting medieval church of Santa Mar\u00eda del Naranco Oviedo \u2013 or in the local parlance, Uvi\u00e9u \u2013 is the capital of Asturias, and harbours some of Spain\u2019s most venerable buildings, including the magical C\u00e1mara Santa (holy chamber), part of Oviedo cathedral, and San Juli\u00e1n de los Prados, a tiny church dating from the 8th century whose richly coloured interior reminds you what a debt Christianity owes to the Orient. The triple arches of Santa Mar\u00eda del Naranco, a pre-Romanesque masterpiece set in green pastures above the city, have become an emblem of Asturian history and culture. Chapel, palace, hunting lodge, or pleasure-dome? Santa Maria was built for King Ramiro I in the mid-9th century, but the true purpose of this enigmatic building may never be known. Fabada asturiana Fabada asturiana, the local rich stew of beans and sausage The faba is a type of large white bean indigenous to Asturias and symbolic of the region\u2019s honest-to-goodness, flavour-packed cuisine. A common sight in vegetable gardens, where the plants climb on poles, these big beans are the main ingredient of a potent stew with morcilla (blood sausage), chorizo and smoked bacon: the fabada asturiana. Around the dish bubbles a rich local culture of anecdote and myth, mostly based around its (in)digestibility. Finding fabada is no problem \u2013 you\u2019ll see it on menus everywhere \u2013 but Casa Gerardo in Prendes and Casa Marcial in Parres, two of the region\u2019s best restaurants, offer exquisite updated versions. Desfiladero del Rio Cares Winding gorge-side paths in the Picos de Europa national park Hikers and trekkers are spoiled for choice in the principality, but here is a sure-fire highlight. This easy seven-mile walk follows the Cares River down a dramatic mountain gorge. The route begins at Poncebos and ends in the village of Ca\u00edn \u2013 which for centuries was largely cut off from the outside world. The Cares gorge itself is a gloomy canyon with a walking path carved out of the rock face. From below comes the muffled thunder of the river, while far above the cliffs can be glimpsed the sparkling summits of the Picos de Europa. Playa de Torimbia The golden sands of the Playa de Torimbia Asturian beaches commonly feature on lists of Spain\u2019s most perfect playas. There\u2019s Barayo, for instance, a pristine coastal valley where a river reaches the sea in a majestic arc of sand; and Playa del Silencio, aptly named, with dramatic rock formations encircling a lonely beach. Loveliest of all is surely Torimbia (near the village of Llanes), a curving bay of fine golden sand, unspoilt and sublimely beautiful. Like many of the world\u2019s best beaches, this one can only be reached on foot (it\u2019s an easy 15-minute walk down). Bring whatever you need, but you might not need to have clothes or swimmers on your list \u2013 naturists as well as nature-lovers are welcome here. Sidra Pouring cider escanciada; the region is known for its orchards Apple orchards replace vineyards in this temperate northern region, where the drink of choice is not wine, but cider. Here it\u2019s served escanciada: the barman pours the cider from head height or higher into a glass held at the waist, oxygenating the drink for a kick of freshness that Asturians love. (The sidra is downed in one, but a little is always left at the bottom of the glass, custom dictating that this must be thrown out on to the floor.) Sidrer\u00edas are classic local institutions serving bottles of fresh cider along with plates of fried monkfish, smoked chorizo, and slabs of delicious local cheese. Parador de Corias An 11th-century monastery among the woodlands and rivers of Asturias\u2019 deep south houses, this hotel is a recent addition to the state-run Parador chain. The building is a lofty expression of regional art and culture \u2013 especially the monastery church, which contains the austerely beautiful 12th-century Cristo de la Cantonada, a long-haired and gold-crowned figure of Christ. The Parador also brings you up close with one of Spain\u2019s most astounding landscapes: the astonishingly verdant Muniellos, home to Europe\u2019s largest extension of virgin oak forest. Niemeyer in Avil\u00e9s The Niemeyer Centre in Avil\u00e9s The city of Avil\u00e9s was once an industrial powerhouse: then came pollution and post-industrial neglect. Now, a futuristic cultural centre designed by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, which opened in 2011, signals the immense positive changes that have come to the city. A series of curvaceous white forms includes an auditorium for open-air concerts, a viewing tower with a spiral staircase and a spectacular domed exhibition space \u2013 all arranged around a central plaza that the great Brazilian (103 at the time) described as \u201ca place for cohabitation, education, culture and peace\u201d. Niemeyer has done for Avil\u00e9s what Guggenheim did for Bilbao. Cabrales Cabrales, one of the region\u2019s many cheeses, is aged in caves Blessed with rich pastures and a temperate climate, Asturias is a rich hunting-ground for cheese-freaks. With an estimated 40 different types produced within its borders, three of which have Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen Protegida status, few places in the world can boast such a variety of cheeses over such a modest geographical area. Deep-flavoured cabrales is up there with roquefort and stilton as one of the world\u2019s great blue cheeses. It packs a powerful punch, and often benefits from a good draught of sidra to soften its piquant aftertaste. You\u2019ll find this fragrant fromage all over the region, but the town of Cabrales itself, among the Picos de Europa mountains, has Asturias\u2019 largest concentration of artisan cheesemakers. \u2018El surf\u2019 San Lorenzo beach is the perfect place to learn to surf Ever since the 1960s when surf culture kicked off in the region, Asturias has been an international draw for riders of big Atlantic waves. There are all-year-round scenes at prime surf-sites like Rodiles (in Villaviciosa), Santa Marina (Ribadesella) and the gorgeous swathe of wild beach that is Pe\u00f1arronda (Castropol). Playa de la Grande, in Tapia de Casariego at the region\u2019s western end, often hosts European surfing championships. Meanwhile San Lorenzo, in the surf-mad coastal city of Gij\u00f3n (or Xix\u00f3n in Asturian), is a good choice for beginners thanks to its reliable breakers, great facilities, and \u201csurf camps\u201d such as Siroko, 10 minutes from the beach.

      "bodyText": "The number of households living in temporary accommodation in England is at its highest level in more than a decade, recent government statistics show. Overall there are an estimated 320,000 people homeless in Britain \u2013including both rough sleepers and those in temporary accommodation \u2013 according to research by the housing charity Shelter.

It is a look that is absolutely everywhere \u2013 so much so, that you have probably stopped noticing it. It is in my wardrobe and \u2013 as a glance around the Guardian office confirms \u2013 in a whole lot of other wardrobes too. The formula is simple: flowers of any variety bloom against a dark-coloured background. Perhaps on a blouse, possibly a trousersuit or an evening gown, but most likely on a dress or a skirt.</p> <p>Without much fuss or fanfare, dark floral has lodged itself into modern life. Like the Breton stripe a decade before it, it has become style shorthand for looking current. And for looking good, but not looking as if you thought about it too much. Alessandro Michele\u2019s super-maximalist aesthetic at Gucci has amped up the resting pulse rate of fashion, so you need a bit of print and colour for an outfit to feel really contemporary. On the other hand, the mood music of the #MeToo era doesn\u2019t lend itself to a bunting-and-cupcakes vibe, so viewing the traditional femininity of the floral print through a darker lens feels right. And as fashion moves towards a more sustainable, less fast-moving model, a print that is a bit summery (because, flowers) and at the same time autumnal in its colours also feels right for now.</p> <p>Erdem Moralioglu has been making winter florals look super-chic for most of his career. For his autumn 2009 collection, he embroidered tiny, intensely coloured chrysanthemums and violets on to black dresses. Explaining how his colour scheme had taken a moody turn that season, he said at the time that the muse he had previously imagined \u201crunning free and romantic in the meadows\u201d had now \u201cvisited nightclubs and gone home on the bus\u201d. Ten years later, he is still into a moody bloom: this season\u2019s Reese dress, \u00a3520, has tightly furled peonies and sprigs of cherry blossom against a black background.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7ec4cf133ed9bf60625e7b2ac1e599979fad4fc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ec4cf133ed9bf60625e7b2ac1e599979fad4fc7/2_0_8885_5333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dresses from (from left) Boden, Marks &amp; Spencer, and Sezane Penelope\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dresses (from left) <a href=\"https://www.boden.co.uk/en-gb/francesca-jersey-midi-dress/sty-j0483\">Boden</a>, <a href=\"https://www.marksandspencer.com/floral-print-shirt-midi-dress/p/p60287440?color=NAVYMIX\">Marks &amp; Spencer</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.sezane.com/en/product/autumn-collection/penelope-dress-\">Sezane Penelope</a></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been fascinated by women and all things that imply femininity,\u201d he says. \u201cFlowers are an extension of that \u2013 beautiful, complex, sometimes dangerous.

Equally our current consumption levels are a disaster \u2013 with growing obesity and environmental damage due to high levels of emissions. \u201cThe solution lies in a more plant-dominated diet but with a modest amount of high-quality livestock product \u2013 which is valued for the key nutrients it contains, its soil-improving properties and the landscape we all want to support and live in,\u201d he said. A spokesperson for the European Livestock Voice said: \u201cIt is well known that a section of the European population over consume animal products, but there is no evidence to suggest that reducing production will lead to any decrease in consumption. The consequences of a drastic reduction on consumption of animal products by replacing them with \u2018meat substitutes\u2019 or other activities could well be worse than the benefits of meat consumption, without leading to a significant environmental or health improvement.\u201d",

This is the opposite of the leadership demanded by millions of climate strikers and activists around the world,\u201d said Alex Doukas of the NGO Oil Change International. \u201cWe are in the middle of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/09/revealed-20-firms-third-carbon-emissions\">climate emergency</a>, so it shouldn\u2019t be hard to say no to more public money for fossil fuels.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/13/divestment-bank-european-investment-fossil-fuels\">Divestment works \u2013 and one huge bank can lead the way | Bill McKibben</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Between 2013-17, the EIB provided almost \u20ac12bn (\u00a310.4bn) in loans to fossil fuel projects, almost all for gas. Supporters of the gas industry argue it is a \u201ctransition\u201d fuel that reduces demand for higher-carbon oil and coal while providing energy security. Climate campaigners say gas projects release high levels of methane, which has a far greater greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide, and that they will delay the transition to zero-carbon renewables such as wind and solar power.</p> <p>The EIB says it has provided more than \u20ac65bn of new financing for renewable energy projects, but the bank\u2019s president, Werner Hoyer, has called for more urgency. \u201cWe believe that gas emissions are too high and cannot be maintained. We must move out of these fossil fuels. We are aware it takes a transition period. We are aware that it takes help for the regions that are dependent on coal and gas. But one should not hide behind these arguments in order to perpetuate the use of these types of materials,\u201d he said in a <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/world-not-doing-enough-to-combat-climate-change-eib/av-50599488\">recent interview</a>.</p> <p>EU leaders plan to describe global heating as an \u201cexistential threat\u201d, according to a leaked copy of a summit communique, but there are divisions over the speed of action. Poland and Hungary are among a handful of countries that oppose the setting of an EU-wide zero-carbon target by 2050. Germany reportedly believes gas is necessary for energy security, at least on an interim basis as it moves away from coal and nuclear power.</p> <p>The clamour for urgent action is increasingly loud, spearheaded by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/23/greta-thunberg-speech-un-2019-address\">Greta Thunberg</a>, student climate strikers, Extinction Rebellion protesters and influential establishment voices such as David Attenborough and the Church of England. Scientists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\">warned last year</a> there was little over a decade to transform energy systems if the world was to have any chance of keeping global heating to a relatively safe level.</p> <p>Yet the world of finance continues to move in the opposite direction, particularly in the private sector. In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-polluters\">weeklong investigation</a>, the Guardian revealed the world\u2019s largest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/13/top-investment-banks-lending-billions-extract-fossil-fuels\">investment banks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/12/top-three-asset-managers-fossil-fuel-investments\">asset management companies</a> had aggressively expanded into new coal, oil and gas projects since the 2016 Paris climate agreement. The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/13/firms-ignoring-climate-crisis-bankrupt-mark-carney-bank-england-governor\">warned</a> that many of these assets will be left stranded, leading to bankruptcies and a growing risk of a global financial crash.</p>",

Executives of the bank, which is owned by EU member states, said the plan was still on course and would probably be approved next month. \u201cThe new energy lending policy is a milestone on the EIB\u2019s road to transform itself into the EU Climate Bank. I am pleased about the important progress made today and am confident of securing a final approval in November,\u201d said Andrew McDowell, the EIB vice-president responsible for energy. But climate campaigners fear the measures will be delayed further and weakened. \u201cThis delay is a direct result of Germany and the European commission pushing to add more fossil fuels back into the policy. This is the opposite of the leadership demanded by millions of climate strikers and activists around the world,\u201d said Alex Doukas of the NGO Oil Change International. \u201cWe are in the middle of a climate emergency, so it shouldn\u2019t be hard to say no to more public money for fossil fuels.\u201d Between 2013-17, the EIB provided almost \u20ac12bn (\u00a310.4bn) in loans to fossil fuel projects, almost all for gas. Supporters of the gas industry argue it is a \u201ctransition\u201d fuel that reduces demand for higher-carbon oil and coal while providing energy security. Climate campaigners say gas projects release high levels of methane, which has a far greater greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide, and that they will delay the transition to zero-carbon renewables such as wind and solar power. The EIB says it has provided more than \u20ac65bn of new financing for renewable energy projects, but the bank\u2019s president, Werner Hoyer, has called for more urgency. \u201cWe believe that gas emissions are too high and cannot be maintained. We must move out of these fossil fuels. We are aware it takes a transition period. We are aware that it takes help for the regions that are dependent on coal and gas. But one should not hide behind these arguments in order to perpetuate the use of these types of materials,\u201d he said in a recent interview. EU leaders plan to describe global heating as an \u201cexistential threat\u201d, according to a leaked copy of a summit communique, but there are divisions over the speed of action. Poland and Hungary are among a handful of countries that oppose the setting of an EU-wide zero-carbon target by 2050. Germany reportedly believes gas is necessary for energy security, at least on an interim basis as it moves away from coal and nuclear power. The clamour for urgent action is increasingly loud, spearheaded by Greta Thunberg, student climate strikers, Extinction Rebellion protesters and influential establishment voices such as David Attenborough and the Church of England. Scientists warned last year there was little over a decade to transform energy systems if the world was to have any chance of keeping global heating to a relatively safe level. Yet the world of finance continues to move in the opposite direction, particularly in the private sector. In a weeklong investigation, the Guardian revealed the world\u2019s largest investment banks and asset management companies had aggressively expanded into new coal, oil and gas projects since the 2016 Paris climate agreement. The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has warned that many of these assets will be left stranded, leading to bankruptcies and a growing risk of a global financial crash.",

They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.<br></p>\n    <p>On 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region. Two days later, 750 foreign women affiliated to Isis and their children managed to break out of a secure annex in the Ain Issa camp for displaced people, according to SDF officials.</p>\n    <p>It is unclear which detention sites the SDF still controls and the status of the prisoners inside.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The strategically located town of Manbij, a US base for three years, remains a major military target for Turkey, its president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, said on Tuesday. Shelling between Turkish proxy Syrian rebel forces and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) positions continued at intervals throughout the day, although there have been no reports yet of fighting inside the city itself.</p> \n<p>Moscow\u2019s special envoy to Syria, Alexander Lavrentyev, said on Tuesday Russia opposed the Turkish operation and would not allow direct clashes between Nato member Turkey\u2019s troops and Syrian forces.

      "bodyText": "Russian units have begun patrolling territory separating Turkish-backed Syrian rebels from the Syrian army around the flashpoint town of Manbij in north-east Syria, in a clear sign that Moscow has become the de facto power broker in the region after the evacuation of US troops. Oleg Blokhin, a Russian journalist usually attached to mercenaries in Syria, posted a video on social media on Tuesday from a deserted US military base in the village of al-Saadiya, near Manbij. \u201cThey [the US] were here yesterday, we are here today,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019ll see how they were living and what they were doing.\u201d Meanwhile, the flag of the Syrian regime was raised above Manbij for the first time in years, Syrian state media reported, after Kurdish officials agreed a deal allowing their former opponents to protect both the contested town and nearby Kobane from a six-day-old Turkish assault. Regime troops entered Manbij on Monday night and, at the same time, Syrian rebel proxies loyal to Turkey massed to the west ahead of a planned attack. The strategically located town of Manbij, a US base for three years, remains a major military target for Turkey, its president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, said on Tuesday. Shelling between Turkish proxy Syrian rebel forces and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) positions continued at intervals throughout the day, although there have been no reports yet of fighting inside the city itself. Moscow\u2019s special envoy to Syria, Alexander Lavrentyev, said on Tuesday Russia opposed the Turkish operation and would not allow direct clashes between Nato member Turkey\u2019s troops and Syrian forces. The two sides stopped short of a direct confrontation when Ankara first put boots on the ground in Syria in 2016 to seize the area around Jarablus from Isis, in the process hampering the expansion of the SDF. \u201c[Fighting between Turkey and Syria] would simply be unacceptable \u2026 And therefore we will not allow it, of course,\u201d Lavrentyev said during a visit to the United Arab Emirates, adding that Turkey and the regime were in direct contact \u2013 a major reversal since the early years of Syria\u2019s war, in which Ankara backed calls for the removal of Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad. Erdo\u011fan spoke to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Tuesday about the need to prevent armed clashes between Turkish and Syrian regime troops. According to the Kremlin, Putin invited the Turkish leader for a working visit to Moscow \u201cin the coming days\u201d and Erdo\u011fan accepted. As Putin exercised his enhanced influence in Syria, Washington was scrambling to limit the damage of Donald Trump\u2019s acquiescence in the Turkish offensive. After announcing sanctions that critics described as ineffective, Trump dispatched key figures to Ankara including his vice president, Mike Pence, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, and special envoy on Syria, James Jeffrey. A White House statement said Pence would \u201creiterate President Trump\u2019s commitment to maintain punishing economic sanctions on Turkey until a resolution is reached.\u201d Erdo\u011fan has so far refused to ease military operations, boasting on Tuesday that his troops had seized 1,000 sq km (400 sq miles) of territory from the SDF, an alliance that Ankara has long maintained is an offshoot of the militant Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK). The SDF was America\u2019s ground partner in the five-year campaign against Isis and lost 11,000 troops in the long battle. Trump has attempted to rebut accusations even from his most loyal supporters that the move amounted to a betrayal. Despite the prospect of losing the area\u2019s semi-autonomous status, Kurdish officials struck a Russian-brokered deal with Damascus on Sunday for reinforcements to protect Kurdish-held border positions. There are unconfirmed reports that talks are still under way to implement a Russian-enforced no-fly zone over the area. Syrian state media showed residents cheering the arrival of troops loyal to Assad in Manbij and Ain Issa, waving flags and throwing rice before the path of soldiers. The regime flag was also briefly raised above the famous clocktower square in Islamic State\u2019s former capital of Raqqa on Monday night, a source in the city said, before it was taken down again by the SDF. Heavy fighting in the border towns of Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ayn as well as airstrikes and shelling of other Kurdish-controlled roads and towns has displaced 160,000 people from their homes and killed at least 165 civilians. SDF counterattacks over the border have left 20 Turkish civilians dead, including a Syrian baby. Erdo\u011fan said that despite the threat of US and EU sanctions, as well as European arms embargos, Ankara would press on with the creation of a proposed 20-mile-deep (32km) \u201csafe zone\u201d on its border stretching from Manbij to Iraq, in which Turkey wants to resettle up to 2 million Syrian refugees. Turkey denies the resettlement of mainly Arab Syrians from other parts of the country would amount to demographic engineering.

      "bodyText": "Thirty years on, few people in Europe\u2019s former eastern bloc regret the monumental political, social and economic change unleashed by the fall of communism \u2013 but at the same time few are satisfied with the way things are now, and many worry for the future. A Pew Research Center survey of 17 countries, including 14 EU member states, found that while most people in central and eastern Europe generally embraced democracy and the market economy, support was far from uniformly strong. Up to 85% of people approved of the shift in Poland, eastern Germany and the Czech Republic, for example, but fewer than 55% did so in Bulgaria, Ukraine and Russia. This broadly mirrored very different perceptions of how individual countries had progressed since the momentous events of 1989-91, when a wave of optimism swept Europe as walls and regimes fell, ushering in more open societies and markets, the survey\u2019s authors said. Most Poles, Czechs and Lithuanians, and more than 40% of Hungarians and Slovaks, for example, said they felt most people in their countries were better off than 30 years ago; in Russia, Ukraine and Bulgaria, more than half felt things were worse. Asked how they felt their countries had advanced, central and eastern Europeans were most positive about education (65%), living standards (61%) and national pride (58%). They were less happy about about law and order (44%) and family values (41%), and a majority (53%) said healthcare had got worse in the post-communist era. But across all the former communist nations surveyed, people were \u201cmostly pessimistic about the functioning of the political system, and about specific economic issues like jobs and inequality\u201d, the survey\u2019s authors said. There was widespread frustration with political elites, perceived as out of touch with average citizens, with 69% of people in the EU nations surveyed disagreeing with the statement that elected officials \u201ccare about what people like me think\u201d, and a majority sharing the same view in Russia and Ukraine. Central and eastern European nations also harboured a widespread view that politicians, and to some extent businesspeople, had benefited personally and excessively from the fall of communism, while \u201cordinary people\u201d had largely not. When it came to economic prospects for the future, however, former eastern bloc countries were more optimistic than the west: about 60% of Ukrainians, Poles and Lithuanians thought children in their country would be better off than their parents, against fewer than 25% in Greece, Spain, Italy, the UK and France. Central and eastern European nations that joined the EU generally appreciated the institution and felt it had been good for their countries, the survey found, with the highest approval ratings \u2013 more than 80% \u2013 found in the former communist states of Poland and Lithuania. In two that did not join, Russia and Ukraine, the situation looked very different, the authors said. \u201cThey are less approving of the shifts to democracy and capitalism, less supportive of specific democratic principles, and less satisfied with their lives,\u201d they said. The survey, which also included the US and was carried out among 18,979 people from May to August this year, found those who expressed a favourable opinion of the rightwing populist parties that have made significant advances across Europe in recent years were more likely to disapprove of the EU, feel Europe\u2019s economic integration had been bad for their countries, and hold negative views of minority groups. It also revealed a sharp east-west divide on attitudes to some social issues, with western Europeans expressing far more progressive views: 94% of Swedes and 89% of Spaniards said homosexuality should be accepted by society, for example, against 28% of Lithuanians and 14% of Ukrainians. The survey found major differences remaining between east and west Germany, with east Germans less satisfied with their country\u2019s overall direction and how democracy was working there than those in the west. But life satisfaction in east Germany and in most central and east European countries has rocketed in the years since a comparable survey in 1991, when the former eastern bloc countries were grappling with the transition to democracy and a market economy. Then, for example, just 12% of Poles, asked to give their lives a rating out of 10, gave a 7, 8, 9 or 10. Today, the figure is 56%.",

He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/09/matt-lauer-alleged-rape-ronan-farrow-book-catch-and-kill\">discloses</a> that a former NBC News employee, Brooke Nevils, accused Matt Lauer, NBC\u2019s towering star on the morning Today show until his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/business/media/nbc-matt-lauer.html\">downfall</a> in November 2017, of raping her at the Sochi Olympics in 2014.</p> <p>Lauer has denied the allegation as \u201ccategorically false\u201d.</p> <p>Catch and Kill recounts how Canosa met Weinstein for the first time at Soho House in Hollywood when she worked as an event planner. In a meeting soon afterwards he took her to a hotel suite where he beguiled her with the prospect of a career as a movie actor before asking her to kiss him; she said no.</p> <p>In a later encounter he said he wanted her to be his collaborator on a biopic about the jazz and blues singer Eva Cassidy. It was during discussions about that exciting prospect that Weinstein took Canosa to his hotel room and asked her to take a shower with him; she declined again but to her distress he proceeded to masturbate while she was in the next room.</p> <p>The carrot he dangled in front of her of industry rewards was coupled on other occasions with the stick of displays of anger, foul language and crying. Farrow writes that Canosa told him Weinstein began weeping after news broke that his film company Miramax was being sold by Disney.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking refuse me when I\u2019m crying,\u201d the movie producer was said to have roared at her.</p> <p>Farrow recalls that Canosa told him that Weinstein had gone on to rape her. Despite the alleged attack she kept in touch with him and began to work formally for his company, with a role on the Netflix series Marco Polo, of which he was executive producer.</p> <p>She held back from doing something about the alleged abuse she witnessed, both personally and against others, because she feared his wrath. \u201cThe number of times I\u2019ve seen people have their lives threatened, or their wives threatened, or their reputation threatened,\u201d she said in the Farrow interview, according to his book.</p> <p>Farrow in the end did not tell the Weinstein story through NBC. He claims that the network ordered him off the story partly under pressure from Weinstein (the network denies that), forcing him to take his work to the New Yorker, where his <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories\">first explosive article</a> ran on 10 October 2017.</p> <p>Two months later, Canosa <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/02/harvey-weinstein-netflix-alexandra-canoso-marco-polo\">lodged a lawsuit</a> against Weinstein and his company in which she alleged 11 incidents of rape, physical assault and verbal bullying over many years. The lawsuit said that Weinstein had made it clear that if she rejected his advances or told anybody about unwanted behavior \u201cthere would be retaliation, including humiliation, the loss of her job and loss of any ability to work in the entertainment business\u201d.</p> <p>At the time the lawsuit was disclosed, Weinstein said through his lawyers that Canosa was someone he had thought of as \u201ca good friend\u201d. He said her allegations were \u201cdeeply upsetting\u201d to him.</p>",

Lauer has denied the allegation as \u201ccategorically false\u201d. Catch and Kill recounts how Canosa met Weinstein for the first time at Soho House in Hollywood when she worked as an event planner. In a meeting soon afterwards he took her to a hotel suite where he beguiled her with the prospect of a career as a movie actor before asking her to kiss him; she said no. In a later encounter he said he wanted her to be his collaborator on a biopic about the jazz and blues singer Eva Cassidy. It was during discussions about that exciting prospect that Weinstein took Canosa to his hotel room and asked her to take a shower with him; she declined again but to her distress he proceeded to masturbate while she was in the next room. The carrot he dangled in front of her of industry rewards was coupled on other occasions with the stick of displays of anger, foul language and crying. Farrow writes that Canosa told him Weinstein began weeping after news broke that his film company Miramax was being sold by Disney. \u201cDon\u2019t fucking refuse me when I\u2019m crying,\u201d the movie producer was said to have roared at her. Farrow recalls that Canosa told him that Weinstein had gone on to rape her. Despite the alleged attack she kept in touch with him and began to work formally for his company, with a role on the Netflix series Marco Polo, of which he was executive producer. She held back from doing something about the alleged abuse she witnessed, both personally and against others, because she feared his wrath. \u201cThe number of times I\u2019ve seen people have their lives threatened, or their wives threatened, or their reputation threatened,\u201d she said in the Farrow interview, according to his book. Farrow in the end did not tell the Weinstein story through NBC. He claims that the network ordered him off the story partly under pressure from Weinstein (the network denies that), forcing him to take his work to the New Yorker, where his first explosive article ran on 10 October 2017. Two months later, Canosa lodged a lawsuit against Weinstein and his company in which she alleged 11 incidents of rape, physical assault and verbal bullying over many years. The lawsuit said that Weinstein had made it clear that if she rejected his advances or told anybody about unwanted behavior \u201cthere would be retaliation, including humiliation, the loss of her job and loss of any ability to work in the entertainment business\u201d. At the time the lawsuit was disclosed, Weinstein said through his lawyers that Canosa was someone he had thought of as \u201ca good friend\u201d. He said her allegations were \u201cdeeply upsetting\u201d to him.",

On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a>&nbsp;and its allies.

With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why does Turkey oppose the Kurds?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a>.</p>\n    <p>Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF\u2019s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are Turkey\u2019s objectives on its southern border?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/07/us-withdrawal-from-syria-leaves-fate-of-isis-fighters-and-families-in-detention-uncertain\">recent announcement</a>&nbsp;that American soldiers would withdraw from the region.</p>\n    <p>Erdo\u011fan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this \u201csafe zone\u201d, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How would a Turkish incursion impact on Isis?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria.</p>\n    <p>SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey. They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.<br></p>\n    <p>On 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region.

      "bodyText": "The UK is suspending the granting of arms export licences to Turkey for weapons that might be used during military operations in Syria, the foreign secretary has said. Dominic Raab also condemned Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria, saying it risked worsening the humanitarian crisis and undermined the international effort to focus on defeating Islamic State terrorism. \u201cThis is not the action we expected from an ally. It is reckless. It is counterproductive and plays straight into the hands of Russia, and indeed the Assad regime,\u201d he told MPs. Turkish troops entered north-east Syria last week in an offensive against the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which Ankara has long maintained is an offshoot of the militant Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK). The assault was triggered by Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that US troops would withdraw from the Kurdish-held area. The UK has supplied \u00a31.1bn of arms to Turkey since 2014 and it is not clear how UK trade officials will be able to determine if the arms could be used in Syria. Raab also said the UK would consider possible economic sanctions against Turkey, but said the balance of opinion within the EU at this stage was that it was doubtful whether they would achieve the goal of ending the Turkish offensive. He ruled out a no-fly zone in northern Syria as impractical. Trump\u2019s announcement just over a week ago that he was withdrawing US troops has been widely viewed as a historic foreign policy blunder. Raab implicitly criticised Trump, saying the withdrawal had sent the wrong message to the US\u2019s allies and destabilised broader efforts to fight Isis. A threat by the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, to flood Europe with refugees was totally unacceptable and \u201cnot the kind of language we expect from a Nato ally\u201d, Raab added. Raab also said the UK was looking to give safe passage back to the UK for unaccompanied British children and orphans of Isis fighters, but conceded the British policy of seeking to prosecute foreign fighters in the region had been made more difficult by the arrival of Syrian regime forces. The government was criticised by Labour and Scottish National party MPs for initially resisting a push at the EU foreign affairs council on Monday to condemn the Turkish offensive. He countered that the British aim had been to produce a balanced EU statement that acknowledged Turkish security concerns about the presence of Kurds belonging to the PKK \u2013 which Turkey, the UK, the US and others consider a terrorist group \u2013 in Kurdish-administered north-east Syria. He also warned against \u201cdoing anything that might drive Turkey further into the arms of Russia and President Putin\u201d. The British stance at the EU has been seen by some as a glimpse of a post-Brexit British foreign policy in which the search for markets, and trade deals, will need to be put ahead of solidarity with any European human rights foreign policy. The exchanges in parliament on Tuesday were remarkable for the degree of Conservative backbench criticism of Trump. Tom Tugenhadt, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, asked Raab if he could think of any decision by an ally that \u201chas so exposed our troops in combat, weakened our alliances in the region, undermined our essential security partnership in Nato and empowered our enemies in Russia and Iran\u201d. The former defence minister Tobias Ellwood said Trump\u2019s action had triggered a tragic chain of events that could change the ethnic makeup of Syria and give Russia and Iran ever greater leverage. Direct conflict between Russia and Turkey was coming ever closer, he warned. The former cabinet minister David Davis described the episode as a geo-strategic disaster. Earlier Jeremy Hunt, the former foreign secretary, said Trump had made a profound strategic mistake by abandoning the Kurds. \u201cWe are probably looking at an end game where Assad has much more territory, Russia has another vassal state and the west\u2019s role \u2013 particularly America\u2019s \u2013 is dramatically reduced,\u201d he said. Arms trade campaigners welcomed the British move, and said the UK had \u201cclearly been shamed\u201d into action after other European countries made a similar decision. Andrew Smith from the Campaign Against Arms Trade said any suspension could not only be limited to future arms sales and must also affect the hundreds of millions of pounds worth of arms that have been licensed over recent years. \u201cThis should also mark a turning point in UK foreign policy in Turkey,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIn 2018 Turkish forces bombed Afrin and it made no difference to arms sales or military collaboration. If this move is to be more than symbolic then there can be no return to business as usual. It\u2019s time that the rights of Kurdish people were finally put ahead of arms company profits.\u201d",

Then he regained everything a hundred times over, becoming the world\u2019s richest and most beloved star in a string of films that made heavy use of his personality. And now comes the next stage, in which he does a bizarre Welsh accent at a polar bear in a hat. That\u2019s right, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEf412bSPLs\">the trailer for Dolittle</a> is out.</p> <p>In Dolittle, Robert Downey Jr plays Doctor Dolittle, a man who can converse with animals. It\u2019s based on Hugh Lofting\u2019s book The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle, and not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/feb/25/buildingachildrenslibrary.booksforchildrenandteenagers\">The Story of Doctor Dolittle</a>.

      "bodyText": "The number of hate crimes reported to police has more than doubled since 2013, according to government figures, which also showed a large increase last year in offences against people based on sexual orientation. The majority of hate crime offences recorded by police forces in England and Wales were racial \u2013 78,991 \u2013 which increased by 11% in the past year. Transgender identity hate crimes \u2013 the least commonly recorded hate crime in 42 of 44 forces \u2013 increased by 37% to 2,333 last year. The Home Office figures also recorded a 25% rise in offences linked to sexual orientation (14,491) while disability hate crimes rose by 14% to 8,256. The steady rise in recent years is partly because of improvements in crime recording, but there were spikes after events such as the referendum on Britain\u2019s EU membership and terrorist attacks in 2017. Part of the increase over the last year may reflect \u201ca real rise\u201d in hate crimes, the Home Office said. Just under half (47%) of religious hate crime offences were targeted against Muslim people (3,530 offences), a similar proportion to last year. However, hate crimes against Jewish people more than doubled, with 18% of religious hate crime offences targeting Jewish people (1,326 offences), compared with 672 in the previous year. Meanwhile a large survey by an umbrella organisation of faith and community groups suggested the Home Office figures potentially showed only the tip of the iceberg, after seven in 10 participants said they never reported hate crimes to the police. Citizens UK, which carried out the survey, released a statement by 18 rabbis, bishops, imams and charity CEOs who expressed \u201cdeep concern at the rising tide of fear and division in society and the erosion of trust in public institutions.\u201d They are also calling for inclusion of misogyny as a hate crime. Matthew Bolton, the executive director of Citizens UK, said: \u201cCommunities from across the UK are increasingly concerned that we aren\u2019t going fast enough or far enough to strengthen hate crime protections. \u201cPolitical, media and institutional decision-makers need an action plan to stop the toxic mix of scare stories on social media and a divisive political environment, which is providing a breeding ground for hate.\u201d One elements that emerged from focus groups Citizens UK conducted in a range of cities was how political rhetoric found its way into abusive language on the street. An example was the use of the word \u201cletterboxes\u201d by hate crime perpetrators after Boris Johnson had used it in a Daily Telegraph column to describe women wearing the burqa, according to Dr Farhan Samanani, an academic who oversaw the study. There were 103,379 hate crimes offences recorded by police last year, the majority of which (76%) were race related. More than half, (54%) of the hate crimes recorded by the police were for public order offences, a third (36%) involved violence, while 5% were recorded as criminal damage and arson. Twelve per cent of hate crime offences were estimated to have more than one motivation, with the majority of these being both race and religion. The rise is partly due to improvements in the way crimes are recorded, but there were spikes after events such as the EU referendum and the terrorist attacks in 2017. The increases in hate crime against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people may have been caused by higher confidence in reporting, according to the charity Stonewall, but it also said the figures were likely to represent a tip of an iceberg. Laura Russell, Stonewall\u2019s director of campaigns, policy and research, said: \u201cFrom our research into hate crime, we know that four in five anti-LGBT hate crimes go unreported, with younger people particularly reluctant to go to the police. \u201cWe have long been concerned about the impact debates on LGBT-inclusive education and trans equality in the media, online and in the streets would have on our community.

CASE STUDIES Alicia* Alicia, a Jewish student in her twenties living in Manchester, was walking down a street this summer when two men approached and said: \u201cWe need you to run our business.

      "body": "<p>This sequel has got a great cast. It\u2019s not just Angelina Jolie reprising her post-fairytale turn as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/28/maleficent-review-angelina-jolie-sleeping-beauty-horns-vinegar\">Maleficent from the 2014 film</a>, the wicked witch from the Sleeping Beauty story who isn\u2019t quite as wicked as all that and whose reputed wickedness may simply be a function of patriarchal mythology. There\u2019s also the estimable Elle Fanning back again as Aurora, the demure heroine who has now made up with Maleficent, regarding her as a godmother. Plus we now get Michelle Pfeiffer on decent form as Queen Ingrith and Robert Lindsay as King John \u2013 the nation\u2019s rulers, and parents of Prince Phillip. The three digitised pixies are back \u2013 Imelda Staunton, Juno Temple and Lesley Manville \u2013 and Chiwetel Ejiofor now has a cameo as one of the horned, winged creatures from the Moors, that disputed land adjacent to the humans\u2019 kingdom where Maleficent hails from. Sam Riley returns as Diaval, Maleficent\u2019s raven-turned-humanoid familiar.</p> <p>But the awful truth is that despite all this star-power, Maleficent 2 is a bit weak, and it runs out of narrative steam before the halfway mark. Maleficent is not the mistress of evil: most of the evilness has now been deconstructed out of her, and the mistress-of-evil position is clearly going to be usurped from Maleficent by a certain someone else, someone who will be presented to us as genuinely bad but whose evident depravity may yet be explained or backstoried away in Maleficent 3. For now, it\u2019s a question of being plain bad, and therefore a bit of a scene-stealer. Maleficent herself has become about as scary or revisionist as one of the Addams Family films. Mistress of Evil increasingly explains her reputation in terms of her coming from the Moors: a tribal or ethnic difference: she is alienated, marginalised, othered.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9315R6nJkE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j9315R6nJkE?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The situation now is that Aurora\u2019s boyfriend, young Prince Phillip (played now by Harris Dickinson, taking over from Brenton Thwaites) has now proposed marriage, infuriating Maleficent, and somewhat disconcerting King John and Queen Ingrith. With some misgivings, they suggest a peacemaking engagement-celebration dinner at their castle, at which Aurora and Maleficent will be the honoured guests. But this diplomacy ends in calamity.</p> <p>The main problem is that the film gradually collapses, as if in a sort of storytelling entropy, into a final battle \u2013 like an awful lot of MCU movies. What began as a visceral contest of personalities, with actors given interesting or funny things to say or do, becomes a big CGI warfare scene: a clash of digitally created armies making for a big ho-hum spectacle. Jolie\u2019s character is also less interesting this time around, and the digitisation of her face, with its Max-Headroom-type flat cheekbones, further flattens her performance.

      "bodyText": "This sequel has got a great cast. It\u2019s not just Angelina Jolie reprising her post-fairytale turn as Maleficent from the 2014 film, the wicked witch from the Sleeping Beauty story who isn\u2019t quite as wicked as all that and whose reputed wickedness may simply be a function of patriarchal mythology. There\u2019s also the estimable Elle Fanning back again as Aurora, the demure heroine who has now made up with Maleficent, regarding her as a godmother. Plus we now get Michelle Pfeiffer on decent form as Queen Ingrith and Robert Lindsay as King John \u2013 the nation\u2019s rulers, and parents of Prince Phillip. The three digitised pixies are back \u2013 Imelda Staunton, Juno Temple and Lesley Manville \u2013 and Chiwetel Ejiofor now has a cameo as one of the horned, winged creatures from the Moors, that disputed land adjacent to the humans\u2019 kingdom where Maleficent hails from. Sam Riley returns as Diaval, Maleficent\u2019s raven-turned-humanoid familiar. But the awful truth is that despite all this star-power, Maleficent 2 is a bit weak, and it runs out of narrative steam before the halfway mark. Maleficent is not the mistress of evil: most of the evilness has now been deconstructed out of her, and the mistress-of-evil position is clearly going to be usurped from Maleficent by a certain someone else, someone who will be presented to us as genuinely bad but whose evident depravity may yet be explained or backstoried away in Maleficent 3. For now, it\u2019s a question of being plain bad, and therefore a bit of a scene-stealer. Maleficent herself has become about as scary or revisionist as one of the Addams Family films. Mistress of Evil increasingly explains her reputation in terms of her coming from the Moors: a tribal or ethnic difference: she is alienated, marginalised, othered. The situation now is that Aurora\u2019s boyfriend, young Prince Phillip (played now by Harris Dickinson, taking over from Brenton Thwaites) has now proposed marriage, infuriating Maleficent, and somewhat disconcerting King John and Queen Ingrith. With some misgivings, they suggest a peacemaking engagement-celebration dinner at their castle, at which Aurora and Maleficent will be the honoured guests. But this diplomacy ends in calamity. The main problem is that the film gradually collapses, as if in a sort of storytelling entropy, into a final battle \u2013 like an awful lot of MCU movies. What began as a visceral contest of personalities, with actors given interesting or funny things to say or do, becomes a big CGI warfare scene: a clash of digitally created armies making for a big ho-hum spectacle. Jolie\u2019s character is also less interesting this time around, and the digitisation of her face, with its Max-Headroom-type flat cheekbones, further flattens her performance. This Maleficent is disappointing, although Jolie certainly sells it hard, as does Fanning, who takes it as seriously as anything else in her career. This article was amended on 16 October 2019. An earlier version described Queen Ingrith as Aurora\u2019s mother and King John as her stepfather. This has been corrected.",

Gopinath repeated the warning \u2013 first given by the IMF six months ago \u2013 that a no-deal Brexit would reduce growth in the UK by between 3% and 5% over two years, depending on the level of disruption. The WEO\u2019s forecasts for the UK in 2019 and 2020 have remained unchanged since April, with the IMF saying that the modest growth reflects the combination of a negative impact from weaker global growth and ongoing Brexit uncertainty and a positive impact from higher public expenditure announced in the recent spending review. Gopinath said subdued growth was a consequence of \u201crising trade barriers; elevated uncertainty surrounding trade and geopolitics; idiosyncratic factors causing macroeconomic strain in several emerging market economies; and structural factors, such as low productivity growth and ageing demographics in advanced economies. \u201cIt is important to keep in mind that the subdued world growth of 3% is occurring at a time when monetary policy has significantly eased almost simultaneously across advanced and emerging markets. The absence of inflationary pressures has led major central banks to move pre-emptively to reduce downside risks to growth and to prevent de-anchoring of inflation expectations, in turn supporting buoyant financial conditions.\u201d Gopinath added that there was too much reliance on central banks and singled out Germany as a country that could use fiscal policy \u2013 tax cuts and higher public spending \u2013 to boost activity. Although global economic cooperation is currently at a low ebb, Gopinath said an internationally coordinated fiscal response, tailored to the circumstances of individual countries, could be required if growth weakened further.",

      "body": "<p>The high profile career of investment manager Neil Woodford appears to be over after the one-time star stockpicker was fired from his flagship fund and quit as manager of his remaining two funds.</p> \n<p>Woodford was sacked on Tuesday morning from his \u00a33.1bn Equity Income fund, which will be wound up in an effort to return cash to investors more than four months after its shock suspension.</p> \n<p>The move was a major embarrassment to the former City investment guru, once referred to as the \u201cOracle of Oxford\u201d, and on Tuesday evening he stepped down from his Income Focus Fund and the Woodford Patient Capital investment trust.</p> \n<p>Woodford said he was closing down his business, based at an Oxford business park, which he started in 2015 after earning his reputation over 25 years at Invesco Perpetual. His three-decade career as a high-profile money manager now looks over.</p> \n<p>Woodford said: \u201cWe have taken the highly painful decision to close Woodford Investment Management. We will fulfil our fund management responsibilities to WPCT and the LF Woodford Income Focus Fund and once completed will close the company in an orderly fashion.\u201d</p> \n<p>Losing the management fees from running the Equity Income Fund, which generated \u00a365,000 a day, would have left the company unable to cover the group\u2019s \u00a312m salary and pension costs.</p> \n<p>The business has generated millions for Woodford and his partner Craig Newman. In the 2017 financial year alone the pair shared \u00a336.5m. Over the past four years he himself has collected \u00a363m. Investors in his Equity Income Fund have lost 37% of their investments over the past three years.</p> \n<p>Woodford added on Tuesday night: \u201cI personally deeply regret the impact events have had on individuals who placed their faith in Woodford Investment Management and invested in our funds.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Equity Income fund\u2019s administrators, Link Fund Solutions (LFS), said the decision to shut down the Woodford Equity Income Fund was in the best interest of investors. They will start receiving payouts after the wind-up begins in January 2020.</p> \n<p>It is understood that Woodford was first told about Link\u2019s plans on Monday. He opposed the move, which removed him as investment manager with immediate effect, and in a statement issued on Tuesday he insisted it was a bad decision which \u201cI cannot accept, nor believe is in the long-term interests of LF Woodford Equity Income Fund investors.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a34ab7fd-7b6c-4631-aeaf-bc0eebcb4675\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/neil-woodford\">Neil Woodford</a>&nbsp;was once the UK\u2019s biggest star fund manager, personally managing a \u00a325bn mountain of money on behalf of pension funds and other investors at Invesco Perpetual. When he decided to quit Invesco and go it alone in 2013 it was a huge shock for the fund management industry. Invesco shares slumped by 7% on the day he announced his departure.</p>\n    <p>At Invesco Woodford held control of huge stakes in some of the UK\u2019s biggest firms, and his opinions mattered. His criticism of AstraZeneca chief executive David Brennan in the 2012 shareholder spring was widely regarded to have cost him his job, and his critique of BAE\u2019s attempted \u00a328bn merger with Airbus is acknowledged as one of the reasons the deal collapsed.</p>\n    <p>Woodford, who was widely referred to in the media as an investment \u201chero\u201d and fund management \u201cstar\u201d, had done exceedingly well over his quarter century there. A \u00a31,000 investment placed when he started at the firm in 1988 would have risen to \u00a323,000 by the time he left.</p>\n    <p>Woodford accidentally fell into fund management and hadn\u2019t heard of the term until he rocked up in the City in the 1980s sleeping on his brother\u2019s floor while looking for a job. He got his first break in insurance, before drifting into fund management. He had left school wanting to fly fighter jets but couldn\u2019t pass the RAF\u2019s aptitude test, and instead read economics and agricultural economics at the University of Exeter.</p>\n    <p>Feeling he had outgrown Invesco Perpetual, he set up his own firm Woodford Investment Management in 2014, on an industrial estate near Oxford. Within two weeks of launching, he had raised \u00a31.6bn, a UK record, and it quickly grew to \u00a316bn. In its first full year his flagship fund returned 16% and Woodford, a devotee of veteran US investor Warren Buffett, was dubbed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-27/oracle-of-oxford-sees-red-as-stock-picking-powers-misfire\">\u201cOracle of Oxford\u201d</a>.</p>\n    <p>Asked if he ever doubted his judgment, Woodford once said: \u201cDaily. You must never, as a fund manager, stick your head in the sand saying \u2018everybody go away, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right\u2019. You\u2019ve always got to expose yourself to criticism and the analysis that you may be wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p>Woodford went on to say that the secret of successful fund management was a balance of arrogance and humility. \u201cYou have to have a sufficiently strong arrogant gene to back your judgment, back your conviction. If you didn\u2019t, you would end up with a portfolio that looks very much like the index. But, equally, you must have the humility to accept that you will get things wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rupertneate\"><b>Rupert Neate</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In a <a href=\"https://woodford.linkfundsolutions.co.uk/media/yr2dbqm2/15th-october-2019-investor-letter-regarding-the-winding-up-of-the-lf-woodford-equity-income-fund.pdf\">letter to investors,</a> LFS said cash would be returned to investors \u201cat the earliest opportunity\u201d \u2013 although it was unable to say how much of their original investment would be salvaged.</p> \n<p>The amount that can be returned will depend on how much fund manager BlackRock and investment banking firm PJT Partners, which have been appointed to wind-up the fund, can raise from selling the remaining assets, minus the fees charged for their work.

      "bodyText": "The high profile career of investment manager Neil Woodford appears to be over after the one-time star stockpicker was fired from his flagship fund and quit as manager of his remaining two funds. Woodford was sacked on Tuesday morning from his \u00a33.1bn Equity Income fund, which will be wound up in an effort to return cash to investors more than four months after its shock suspension. The move was a major embarrassment to the former City investment guru, once referred to as the \u201cOracle of Oxford\u201d, and on Tuesday evening he stepped down from his Income Focus Fund and the Woodford Patient Capital investment trust. Woodford said he was closing down his business, based at an Oxford business park, which he started in 2015 after earning his reputation over 25 years at Invesco Perpetual. His three-decade career as a high-profile money manager now looks over. Woodford said: \u201cWe have taken the highly painful decision to close Woodford Investment Management. We will fulfil our fund management responsibilities to WPCT and the LF Woodford Income Focus Fund and once completed will close the company in an orderly fashion.\u201d Losing the management fees from running the Equity Income Fund, which generated \u00a365,000 a day, would have left the company unable to cover the group\u2019s \u00a312m salary and pension costs. The business has generated millions for Woodford and his partner Craig Newman. In the 2017 financial year alone the pair shared \u00a336.5m. Over the past four years he himself has collected \u00a363m. Investors in his Equity Income Fund have lost 37% of their investments over the past three years. Woodford added on Tuesday night: \u201cI personally deeply regret the impact events have had on individuals who placed their faith in Woodford Investment Management and invested in our funds.\u201d The Equity Income fund\u2019s administrators, Link Fund Solutions (LFS), said the decision to shut down the Woodford Equity Income Fund was in the best interest of investors. They will start receiving payouts after the wind-up begins in January 2020. It is understood that Woodford was first told about Link\u2019s plans on Monday. He opposed the move, which removed him as investment manager with immediate effect, and in a statement issued on Tuesday he insisted it was a bad decision which \u201cI cannot accept, nor believe is in the long-term interests of LF Woodford Equity Income Fund investors.\u201d In a letter to investors, LFS said cash would be returned to investors \u201cat the earliest opportunity\u201d \u2013 although it was unable to say how much of their original investment would be salvaged. The amount that can be returned will depend on how much fund manager BlackRock and investment banking firm PJT Partners, which have been appointed to wind-up the fund, can raise from selling the remaining assets, minus the fees charged for their work. Their fees have not been disclosed. The shutdown comes more than four months after Woodford was forced to block investors from withdrawing their money from the Equity Income fund, following a string of bad investment bets that prompted a surge in redemptions that he could not fulfil. The fund, which was once worth more than \u00a310bn is now worth only around \u00a33bn, due to withdrawals and a raft of poorly performing investments, including online estate agent Purplebricks, finance firm Burford and doorstep lender Provident Financial. He once said the key to successful investing was to \u201chave a sufficiently strong arrogant gene to back your judgment, back your conviction.\u201d The fund manager has been criticised since the fund was gated for failing to suspend his firms management fees. He argued the fees were needed to pay wages and other costs while he shifted investments away from smaller, illiquid assets into larger publicly quoted companies. Ryan Hughes, the head of active portfolios at the investment platform AJ Bell, said: \u201cInvestors will still be incurring high costs for the winding-up of the fund, particularly selling off the illiquid assets.

      "body": "<p>Extinction Rebellion has said it will fight a ban on activists protesting in London in court, as the capital\u2019s mayor, a key ally of the police, distanced himself from the crackdown.</p> \n<p>The environmental pressure group said its lawyers had sent the Metropolitan police a letter threatening legal action. It is a prelude to a judicial review and Extinction Rebellion (XR) described the ban as a \u201cdisproportionate and unprecedented attempt to curtail peaceful protest\u201d.</p> \n<p>Politicians, civil rights campaigners and environmentalists have condemned the police crackdown on the protests, saying the London-wide ban was \u201cchilling and unlawful\u201d.</p> \n<p>Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, issued a statement that appeared to distance himself from the Met\u2019s decision to ban further protests.</p> \n<p>A City Hall source said they feared the ban could backfire and be struck down if legally challenged. Sources also said that the protests, which are in their second week, were petering out but could galvanise as a result of the ban.</p> \n<p>Khan said: \u201cI am seeking further information from senior officers about the operational decision to impose a section 14 order on the Extinction Rebellion Autumn Uprising \u2013 including at Trafalgar Square \u2013 and why this was necessary.</p> \n<p>\u201cI believe the right to peaceful and lawful protest must always be upheld. However, illegal action by some protesters over the past eight days has put undue pressure on already overstretched police officers, and demonstrators should bear this in mind when considering any further actions.\u201d</p> \n<p>The attempt to end the week-long demonstrations began when hundreds of police officers cleared protesters from Trafalgar Square on Monday night.

      "bodyText": "Extinction Rebellion has said it will fight a ban on activists protesting in London in court, as the capital\u2019s mayor, a key ally of the police, distanced himself from the crackdown. The environmental pressure group said its lawyers had sent the Metropolitan police a letter threatening legal action. It is a prelude to a judicial review and Extinction Rebellion (XR) described the ban as a \u201cdisproportionate and unprecedented attempt to curtail peaceful protest\u201d. Politicians, civil rights campaigners and environmentalists have condemned the police crackdown on the protests, saying the London-wide ban was \u201cchilling and unlawful\u201d. Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, issued a statement that appeared to distance himself from the Met\u2019s decision to ban further protests. A City Hall source said they feared the ban could backfire and be struck down if legally challenged. Sources also said that the protests, which are in their second week, were petering out but could galvanise as a result of the ban. Khan said: \u201cI am seeking further information from senior officers about the operational decision to impose a section 14 order on the Extinction Rebellion Autumn Uprising \u2013 including at Trafalgar Square \u2013 and why this was necessary. \u201cI believe the right to peaceful and lawful protest must always be upheld. However, illegal action by some protesters over the past eight days has put undue pressure on already overstretched police officers, and demonstrators should bear this in mind when considering any further actions.\u201d The attempt to end the week-long demonstrations began when hundreds of police officers cleared protesters from Trafalgar Square on Monday night. It came as the Metropolitan police issued a revised section 14 order stating \u201cany assembly linked to the Extinction Rebellion \u2018Autumn Uprising\u2019 ... must now cease their protests within London (MPS and City of London Police Areas)\u201d. Despite the ban, XR protests continued on Tuesday as civil liberty groups and MPs condemned the police strategy. XR announced a direct challenge to the police ban, promising a large rally in Trafalgar Square on Wednesday to put police and government \u201cin a dilemma as to whether they are going to arrest public figures for peaceful, democratic assembly\u201d. The civil rights group Liberty said banning the protests was \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d and an \u201cassault on the right to protest\u201d, while Amnesty said it was \u201can unlawful restriction on the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly \u2026 that would have a chilling effect on rights\u201d. Labour\u2019s shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, tweeted: \u201cThis ban is completely contrary to Britain\u2019s long-held traditions of policing by consent, freedom of speech, and the right to protest.\u201d The Green MEP Molly Scott Cato said the home secretary, Priti Patel, was behind the move, calling it \u201ca terrible sight in a democracy\u201d. The shadow Treasury minister, Clive Lewis, said the right to protest must be protected, tweeting: \u201cThe action by police overnight is a huge overreach of statutory power.\u201d On Tuesday, climate campaigners appeared determined to continue demonstrating. One of the organisation\u2019s co-founders, Gail Bradbrook, led a protest at the Department for Transport, where she was arrested for climbing on to the entrance to highlight the contradiction between the expansion of roads and airports and the need to reach zero carbon emissions. Another group of XR protesters was later arrested near the MI5 building, on Millbank, where people were gathering for a demonstration to highlight the impact of the crisis on food supplies in the UK. Later in the day, the XR grandparents group was planning its launch and XR academics were due to stage another action. At one of the remaining camps, at Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, protesters were quietly packing away tents on Tuesday after police had apparently enacted a \u201cfive-step warning\u201d with the threat of arrest if they failed to leave. One protester said: \u201cThey said we don\u2019t have the right to peaceful protest anywhere in the city of London, which is against our human rights as citizens of this country \u2026 people will stay in their tents and be arrested, as they have done at every other site that\u2019s been taken. If we lose then everyone loses.\u201d Activists at the site said they would set up camp elsewhere in the city, and keep relocating until the end of the week, when the scheduled two-week rebellion is due to finish. The non-violent protests aim to highlight the escalating climate and ecological emergency, and a total of 1,489 arrests have been made over the past week. The Met police said 92 protesters have been charged with offences including failing to comply with a condition imposed under section 14 of the Public Order Act 1986, criminal damage, and obstruction of a highway. They have drawn support from scientists, doctors, grandparents and religious leaders \u2013 many of whom were among those arrested. The group has three demands: for the UK government to tell the truth about the climate and ecological emergency; for it to adopt a target of zero carbon by 2025 and for the government to set up a citizens assembly to decide future policy on the environment. At the London assembly\u2019s police and crime committee on Tuesday morning, the Met deputy commissioner, Sir Stephen House, denied a suggestion by the Green member Sian Berry that the revised order was disproportionate. \u201cWe are not saying, Extinction Rebellion you cannot protest in future.

So yes, squad depth is definitely something we\u2019ve reflected on and acted on.\u201d</p> <p>Last summer City recruited to bolster the areas shown to be the weakest in the previous campaign. \u201cWe\u2019ve acted on different areas where we feel we may have lost physical fitness and freshness,\u201d he reflected. \u201cBecause not only did we play 40-plus games last year (City also got to the League Cup final and the semi-finals of the Women\u2019s FA Cup that season), but our players also played every international fixture.\u201d</p> <p>It made a difference.

      "bodyText": "It was telling that it was two substitutes combining to deliver Chelsea\u2019s 2-1 humbling of the reigning Women\u2019s Super League champions Arsenal on Sunday. The strategy of the Chelsea manager, Emma Hayes, has always been to build a strong, deep squad, not just to have quality on the bench but also to provide as competitive an environment in training as possible. That paid off in 2017-18 as Chelsea won the double, Nick Cushing\u2019s Manchester City struggling to keep up with the Londoners as they fought relatively comfortably on all fronts. At the end of that season Cushing pointed to the difficulties posed by the switch from a summer to winter season but also to the lack of depth in his squad. \u201cListen, people will always question the teams that don\u2019t win because ultimately the standard is set by the teams that win, I get that,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we learnt a little bit about the season last year, changing to a winter season meant we played Champions League football within our season which meant that we played an extra eight to 10 games than we did the year before. So yes, squad depth is definitely something we\u2019ve reflected on and acted on.\u201d Last summer City recruited to bolster the areas shown to be the weakest in the previous campaign. \u201cWe\u2019ve acted on different areas where we feel we may have lost physical fitness and freshness,\u201d he reflected. \u201cBecause not only did we play 40-plus games last year (City also got to the League Cup final and the semi-finals of the Women\u2019s FA Cup that season), but our players also played every international fixture.\u201d It made a difference. In came Lauren Hemp, Gemma Bonner, Caroline Weir, Tessa Wullaert and Janine Beckie and City romped to a domestic cup double last season. They also pushed Arsenal to the penultimate game of the season. This time, it was Arsenal\u2019s squad that almost buckled under the pressure of a freakishly large injury list, but they crawled over the line to lift a first league title in seven years. Except unlike Cushing, after a season of being stretched to breaking point, Arsenal manager Joe Montemurro has chosen not to significantly bolster his numbers.

A unusually frustrated Montemurro pointed to the strength of the Chelsea squad as a reason why they should be challenging when he said: \u201cWith the individual talent they\u2019ve got and with the size of the squad that they\u2019ve got they should be up there every year.

      "body": "<p>Food is at the heart of Majeda Khoury\u2019s story. Imprisoned in Syria for feeding displaced people, she later came to the UK and became a chef at <a href=\"https://www.migrateful.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Migrateful</a>, a social enterprise that organises cookery classes run by refugees. It was a vital stepping stone: today she runs her own catering company \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.schoolandcollegelistings.com/GB/London/387703075108082/The-Syrian-Sunflower\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Syrian Sunflower</a>.</p> <p>Khoury is not alone: across the world, refugee and migrant women are finding employment and empowerment through cooking, as a growing number of businesses seek to use their culinary skills to help generate income and connect them with new communities.</p> <p>\u201cSuch interventions can play an important role in lifting refugees out of poverty, by creating opportunities that they wouldn\u2019t have had access to otherwise,\u201d says Nazila Vali, deputy team lead at Business Call to Action, which works to accelerate progress towards the sustainable development goals, in part by helping their members \u201cbetter articulate and increase their social impact\u201d.</p> <p>But such support also makes business sense: Vali points to research that shows refugee populations generate economic opportunities. \u201cThe inaccurate perception of refugees being a drain on resources needs to change,\u201d she says.</p> <p>From New York to London, Beirut to Glasgow, a growing number of entrepreneurs are getting the message. Here\u2019s a taste of the trend:</p> <h2>Mu\u2019ooz, Brisbane</h2> <p>Nestled in Brisbane\u2019s West End, this unassuming restaurant has had a big impact on hundreds of lives. Since 2008, more than 230 African refugees, mostly from Eritrea and Ethiopia, have come through <a href=\"https://www.muooz.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mu\u2019ooz</a> for training and employment, staying for an average of eight to 12 months, and almost all going on into jobs or to set up their own businesses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e9adb03f507698c8aa08111752980314c29c715b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9adb03f507698c8aa08111752980314c29c715b/0_0_2310_1106/1000.png\" alt=\"Saba Abraham in Brisbane\u2019s Mu\u2019ooz.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"479\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saba Abraham in Brisbane\u2019s Mu\u2019ooz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Lehn/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f1ad9710ace36ab4c2e986ed621a3551d5404963\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1ad9710ace36ab4c2e986ed621a3551d5404963/0_0_2310_1106/1000.png\" alt=\"Saba Abraham in Brisbane\u2019s Mu\u2019ooz.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"479\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saba Abraham in Brisbane\u2019s Mu\u2019ooz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Lehn/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Saba Abraham in Brisbane\u2019s Mu\u2019ooz</p></li> </ul> <p>Saba Abraham, a former Eritrean freedom fighter, is the figure behind it. Arriving as a refugee in Australia in the 1990s, she was astonished by the support she received, but nonetheless fell into a deep depression. \u201cNo matter how positive the welcome, the language and culture and system barriers always affect you,\u201d she says.</p> <p>To help others break that isolation, she started doing small-scale catering with a group of refugees. The point was simply to cook together and connect, but in year two they made $27,000 profit, says Abraham, and decided it was a viable business. The result was Mu\u2019ooz.</p> <p>Many of the women who have passed through the business were brought up only to work in the home, with little education, and have been traumatised by war, says Abraham. But at Mu\u2019ooz they gain vital confidence, and leave a legacy of delicious food: a goat recipe introduced by a former employee from the Congo remains one of Mu\u2019ooz\u2019s most popular dishes.</p> <h2>Migrateful, London</h2> <p>Jess Thompson got the idea for Migrateful while teaching English to refugee women: \u201cWe went around the room asking about skills and they all said they loved to cook and would love to teach people to cook.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e6d4d567bf987c614395baa3f4f94beac6bc06f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6d4d567bf987c614395baa3f4f94beac6bc06f0/0_0_2310_1106/1000.png\" alt=\"Migrateful chef Elizabeth Kolawole Johnson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"479\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Migrateful chef Elizabeth Kolawole Johnson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Pushinsky/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"977059a2dbf6d871c448c26a16aaa8e07e88cfe5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/977059a2dbf6d871c448c26a16aaa8e07e88cfe5/0_0_2310_1106/1000.png\" alt=\"Migrateful chef Elizabeth Kolawole Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"479\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Migrateful chef Elizabeth Kolawole Johnson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Pushinsky/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Migrateful chef Elizabeth Kolawole Johnson cooking up the perfect jollof at her class at Farewell Cafe &amp; Kitchen</p></li> </ul> <p>Thompson had just returned to the UK from work at refugee camps in Morocco and Dunkirk, and was looking for a way to continue to support refugees in London. After trying out a class at home with an Iranian woman and a bunch of friends, she decided this was it. In the two years since, Migrateful chefs have given 376 classes to more than 3,700 customers.</p> <p>Before they start teaching, the chefs go through a training programme that covers everything from storytelling to class structure. The idea is not just to help them meet immediate needs (they are paid an average of \u00a365, with expenses for travel and ingredients, for a 2.5-hour class) but also forge a path for the future. Five Migrateful alumni, including Majeda Khouri, have gone on to launch their own businesses.</p> <p>Migrateful is already expanding out of London, with some classes running in Tunbridge Wells and a chef training programme launching in Bristol. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple model,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to replicate.\u201d</p> <h2>Flavours of Hope, Vancouver</h2> <p>Trixie Ling had lived in four countries by the time she was 10. Through all the changes, she found that one thing enabled her to find her feet: \u201cFood was what helped introduce me to new people and to feel like I fitted in.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"67a7c9bf5d9333073efd92c48d0ca81995fdedb9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67a7c9bf5d9333073efd92c48d0ca81995fdedb9/0_0_2310_1106/1000.png\" alt=\"Trixie Ling with Flavours of Hope vendors in Vancouver.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"479\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trixie Ling with Flavours of Hope vendors in Vancouver.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachel Pick/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ff22b8e131c5de2f9d853db159f91ccdb8c7009d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff22b8e131c5de2f9d853db159f91ccdb8c7009d/0_0_2310_1106/1000.png\" alt=\"Trixie Ling with Flavours of Hope vendors in Vancouver.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"479\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trixie Ling with Flavours of Hope vendors in Vancouver.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachel Pick/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Trixie Ling with Flavours of Hope vendors in Vancouver</p></li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s a lesson she has taken into adulthood. Last year, Ling \u2013 whose family ultimately settled in Canada \u2013 founded <a href=\"https://www.flavoursofhope.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flavours of Hope</a>. It\u2019s a social enterprise that organises pop-up dinners at which immigrant women share their food and stories; it also sells condiments at markets around Vancouver. In fact, its Venezuelan salsa has proven so popular, says Ling, that local grocery stores have started asking to stock it.</p> <p>Like others in this space, Flavours of Hope is pushing back against industry norms by paying women a living wage. And if decent pay can help to empower them, says Ling, so too can the act of cooking itself: \u201cThis is the message that we need to give to refugees. But I think we also need to receive.

      "bodyText": "Food is at the heart of Majeda Khoury\u2019s story. Imprisoned in Syria for feeding displaced people, she later came to the UK and became a chef at Migrateful, a social enterprise that organises cookery classes run by refugees. It was a vital stepping stone: today she runs her own catering company \u2013 The Syrian Sunflower. Khoury is not alone: across the world, refugee and migrant women are finding employment and empowerment through cooking, as a growing number of businesses seek to use their culinary skills to help generate income and connect them with new communities. \u201cSuch interventions can play an important role in lifting refugees out of poverty, by creating opportunities that they wouldn\u2019t have had access to otherwise,\u201d says Nazila Vali, deputy team lead at Business Call to Action, which works to accelerate progress towards the sustainable development goals, in part by helping their members \u201cbetter articulate and increase their social impact\u201d. But such support also makes business sense: Vali points to research that shows refugee populations generate economic opportunities. \u201cThe inaccurate perception of refugees being a drain on resources needs to change,\u201d she says. From New York to London, Beirut to Glasgow, a growing number of entrepreneurs are getting the message. Here\u2019s a taste of the trend: Mu\u2019ooz, Brisbane Nestled in Brisbane\u2019s West End, this unassuming restaurant has had a big impact on hundreds of lives. Since 2008, more than 230 African refugees, mostly from Eritrea and Ethiopia, have come through Mu\u2019ooz for training and employment, staying for an average of eight to 12 months, and almost all going on into jobs or to set up their own businesses. Saba Abraham in Brisbane\u2019s Mu\u2019ooz Saba Abraham, a former Eritrean freedom fighter, is the figure behind it. Arriving as a refugee in Australia in the 1990s, she was astonished by the support she received, but nonetheless fell into a deep depression. \u201cNo matter how positive the welcome, the language and culture and system barriers always affect you,\u201d she says. To help others break that isolation, she started doing small-scale catering with a group of refugees. The point was simply to cook together and connect, but in year two they made $27,000 profit, says Abraham, and decided it was a viable business. The result was Mu\u2019ooz. Many of the women who have passed through the business were brought up only to work in the home, with little education, and have been traumatised by war, says Abraham. But at Mu\u2019ooz they gain vital confidence, and leave a legacy of delicious food: a goat recipe introduced by a former employee from the Congo remains one of Mu\u2019ooz\u2019s most popular dishes. Migrateful, London Jess Thompson got the idea for Migrateful while teaching English to refugee women: \u201cWe went around the room asking about skills and they all said they loved to cook and would love to teach people to cook.\u201d Migrateful chef Elizabeth Kolawole Johnson cooking up the perfect jollof at her class at Farewell Cafe &amp; Kitchen Thompson had just returned to the UK from work at refugee camps in Morocco and Dunkirk, and was looking for a way to continue to support refugees in London. After trying out a class at home with an Iranian woman and a bunch of friends, she decided this was it. In the two years since, Migrateful chefs have given 376 classes to more than 3,700 customers. Before they start teaching, the chefs go through a training programme that covers everything from storytelling to class structure. The idea is not just to help them meet immediate needs (they are paid an average of \u00a365, with expenses for travel and ingredients, for a 2.5-hour class) but also forge a path for the future. Five Migrateful alumni, including Majeda Khouri, have gone on to launch their own businesses. Migrateful is already expanding out of London, with some classes running in Tunbridge Wells and a chef training programme launching in Bristol. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple model,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to replicate.\u201d Flavours of Hope, Vancouver Trixie Ling had lived in four countries by the time she was 10. Through all the changes, she found that one thing enabled her to find her feet: \u201cFood was what helped introduce me to new people and to feel like I fitted in.\u201d Trixie Ling with Flavours of Hope vendors in Vancouver It\u2019s a lesson she has taken into adulthood. Last year, Ling \u2013 whose family ultimately settled in Canada \u2013 founded Flavours of Hope. It\u2019s a social enterprise that organises pop-up dinners at which immigrant women share their food and stories; it also sells condiments at markets around Vancouver. In fact, its Venezuelan salsa has proven so popular, says Ling, that local grocery stores have started asking to stock it. Like others in this space, Flavours of Hope is pushing back against industry norms by paying women a living wage. And if decent pay can help to empower them, says Ling, so too can the act of cooking itself: \u201cThis is the message that we need to give to refugees. But I think we also need to receive. And with cooking, the women are the ones in power. When they\u2019re cooking, they know what they\u2019re doing, they\u2019re making this delicious food and they can represent themselves and their stories.\u201d Yalla Trappan, Malm\u00f6 For nine years, Yalla Trappan has been creating catering, tailoring and cleaning jobs for immigrant women in the Swedish city of Malm\u00f6. This worker-owned co-operative, which has its own restaurant plus sewing workshops in Ikea and H&amp;M, started off with six members and now boasts 37, all of whom have a share of the business and an equal say in how it\u2019s managed. Yalla Trappan, Malm\u00f6, and founder Christina Merker-Siesj\u00f6 (above right) Chair and founder Christina Merker-Siesj\u00f6 explains how she developed a methodology for building up women\u2019s self-esteem \u2013 \u201cthe Yalla Trappan way\u201d \u2013 by combining half a day of language and cultural training with half a day of practical work.

Most recently, fans of the cult Netflix show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/09/the-oa-cancelled-netflix-brit-marling-telepathic-octopus\">The OA</a> have mounted a global campaign to have it reinstated after it was cancelled in August.

The television fan movement was arguably born with the 1966 campaign to keep a little-known new series named Star Trek on air. After low ratings for the first two seasons, NBC was ready to relegate the show to the trashpile. Hearing the news, husband and wife Betty Jo and John Trimble organised one of the first grassroots fan campaigns, kicking off a letter-writing chain that amassed over 110,000 missives and which led to the renewal of the show.</p> <p>Other fans have been far more extreme.

Cancelled after two seasons, the show built a dedicated following with many fans identifying with the diverse characters, including transgender Buck and disabled Dr Marlow Rhodes. When the cancellation was announced, \u201cdiscord groups\u201d sprung up to organise flash mob protests at Netflix offices and coordinate calls to the company, as well as fundraise $5,000 for a huge #SavetheOA billboard in New York\u2019s Times Square.

      "body": "<p>The Daily Telegraph has stopped giving away bottles of water with copies of its newspaper at branches of WH Smith, as the company focuses on selling website subscriptions rather than shoring up sales of its print product.</p> <p>The decision, which ends the routine of Britons being offered a copy of the broadsheet when they buy a drink at the high-street newsagent chain, was confirmed as Telegraph Media Group revealed pre-tax profits fell 94% from \u00a314.3m to \u00a3900,000 last year.</p> <p>Nick Hugh, the chief executive of the Brexit-backing newspaper group, said advertisers were tempted to hold back spending due to Brexit but it was also driving more readers to the company\u2019s sites in search of news.</p> <p>\u201cFor us as a business, obviously the main challenge isn\u2019t from Brexit itself, it\u2019s from the uncertainty. The number one requirement is that there is certainty about what happens. Equally, that uncertainty is not unhelpful from a reader perspective,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Hugh also said the main concern was increasing the number of paying subscribers to the company\u2019s digital offering rather than keeping the print circulation artificially high with promotions.</p> <p>The Telegraph said it had 400,000 paying subscribers across print and digital, although independent circulation figures suggest fewer than half of these are from the company\u2019s digital subscriptions. This suggests the audience for much of its website content <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/oct/03/telegraph-to-put-politics-business-and-rugby-news-behind-paywall\">behind a paywall</a> is only reaching a couple of hundred thousand readers, at a time when print circulations continue to fall heavily.</p> <p>Hugh pointed towards the growing number of people registering free of charge to read a limited number of articles, which allows more targeted advertising and potential digital subscription sales, despite concerns over whether users are signing up with their <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/markdistefano/telegraph-fake-email-registrations\">real details</a>.

      "bodyText": "The Daily Telegraph has stopped giving away bottles of water with copies of its newspaper at branches of WH Smith, as the company focuses on selling website subscriptions rather than shoring up sales of its print product. The decision, which ends the routine of Britons being offered a copy of the broadsheet when they buy a drink at the high-street newsagent chain, was confirmed as Telegraph Media Group revealed pre-tax profits fell 94% from \u00a314.3m to \u00a3900,000 last year. Nick Hugh, the chief executive of the Brexit-backing newspaper group, said advertisers were tempted to hold back spending due to Brexit but it was also driving more readers to the company\u2019s sites in search of news. \u201cFor us as a business, obviously the main challenge isn\u2019t from Brexit itself, it\u2019s from the uncertainty. The number one requirement is that there is certainty about what happens. Equally, that uncertainty is not unhelpful from a reader perspective,\u201d he said. Hugh also said the main concern was increasing the number of paying subscribers to the company\u2019s digital offering rather than keeping the print circulation artificially high with promotions. The Telegraph said it had 400,000 paying subscribers across print and digital, although independent circulation figures suggest fewer than half of these are from the company\u2019s digital subscriptions. This suggests the audience for much of its website content behind a paywall is only reaching a couple of hundred thousand readers, at a time when print circulations continue to fall heavily. Hugh pointed towards the growing number of people registering free of charge to read a limited number of articles, which allows more targeted advertising and potential digital subscription sales, despite concerns over whether users are signing up with their real details. The former Yahoo executive, appointed to turn around the Telegraph in 2017, said he would increase the paying subscriber base by 25% this year. Hugh also said the company benefited financially from having a clear identity as a rightwing news outlet under the Daily Telegraph editor, Chris Evans. \u201cThe fact that Chris and the editorial team have a clear opinion and clear perspective that is right-of-centre allows to focus our commercial efforts. That\u2019s what we have been about for a long time and will continue to be,\u201d he said. The company\u2019s accounts, which were filed two weeks after the legal deadline for undisclosed reasons, show that in 2018, the group\u2019s overall revenue fell 3% to \u00a3271m at a time of decline in print advertising revenue, while staff costs grew substantially. Hugh said the company had invested in hiring about 80 journalists in the past two years, although many long-serving employees have taken redundancy and production staff have been outsourced. Newsroom sources report improved morale following years at rock bottom during multiple redundancy rounds, while the company has won plaudits for giving all its staff six months\u2019 paid parental leave. The financial returns next year will also be bolstered by the absence of the \u00a3275,000-a-year salary paid to its former star columnist Boris Johnson, while he takes a leave of absence from the Daily Telegraph to serve as prime minister. The outlet is owned by the Barclay brothers, reclusive Brexit-backing billionaires whose advancing ages have led to continued speculation \u2013 despite their denials \u2013 that they could be looking to offload their media interests in the Telegraph and the Spectator. The City analysts Liberum recently suggested the Daily Mail\u2019s owner, DMGT, would be a natural purchaser for the Daily Telegraph because \u201cpolitically and demographically, there is a similar profile between the two papers\u201d. Hugh insisted he had not been involved in any discussions about the Telegraph being up for sale.",

      "bodyText": "American Media and the National Enquirer tabloid newspaper shredded sensitive documents about Donald Trump shortly before the 2016 election, the reporter Ronan Farrow alleges in a book published on Tuesday. In Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators, Farrow writes that the shredding happened in the first week of November 2016, on the day the Wall Street Journal reported a Playboy model\u2019s claim to have had an affair with Trump and American Media\u2019s role in keeping the story quiet. That process is referred to in the title of Farrow\u2019s book. According to Farrow, Dylan Howard, then editor of the Enquirer, ordered a staffer to \u201cget everything out of the safe\u201d and said \u201cwe need to get a shredder down there\u201d. Farrow writes: \u201cThe staffer opened the safe, removed a set of documents, and tried to wrest it shut. Later, reporters would discuss the safe like it was the warehouse where they stored the Ark of the Covenant in Indiana Jones, but it was small and cheap and old.\u201d Farrow quotes an employee of the Enquirer as saying \u201ca larger than customary volume of refuse\u201d was collected from the Enquirer offices later the same day. He also quotes a \u201csenior AMI employee\u201d as saying: \u201cWe are always at the edge of what\u2019s legally permissible. It\u2019s very exciting.\u201d On CNN on Monday morning, Farrow said the safe contained details of alleged consensual affairs and payoffs and also allegations of assault by Jill Harth, who in a 1997 complaint accused Trump of \u201cattempted \u2018rape\u2019\u201d. In October 2016, amid a flood of allegations of sexual misconduct by Trump, she stood by that allegation in an interview with the Guardian. The Enquirer endorsed Trump and published negative stories about his opponent, Hillary Clinton. Farrow\u2019s claims were reported before the book\u2019s publication by outlets including Politico, CNN and the Daily Beast. An attorney for Howard said in a statement the former editor would not comment, \u201cwhile all legal options and jurisdictions are being considered\u201d. A spokesman for American Media said in a statement: \u201cMr Farrow\u2019s narrative is driven by unsubstantiated allegations from questionable sources and while these stories may be dramatic, they are completely untrue.\u201d Catch and Kill has also sparked intense controversy over its coverage of sexual assault allegations against the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and NBC host Matt Lauer, which both men deny. The book is the subject of legal threats around the world but still went on sale on Tuesday. In an interview with the Guardian published last weekend, Farrow said the factchecking process had been so rigorous, one factchecker \u201cgot a stress nosebleed\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ll let the reporting in the book stand on its own,\u201d Farrow told CNN. Farrow writes that the safe which held the Trump material belonged to Barry Levine, then executive editor of the Enquirer. Levine is now co-author, with Monique El-Faizy, of the forthcoming book All the President\u2019s Women: Donald Trump and the Making of a Predator.

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s financial watchdog is cracking down on the way car dealers and car finance brokers make commission on sales, a move that it says will save drivers \u00a3165m.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-acts-protect-those-buying-motor-finance\">The Financial Conduct Authority said</a> it would ban the way some car retailers and brokers received commission linked to the interest rate customers paid on the loan they took out to buy a car. The arrangement means the higher the interest rate, the more commission is payable.</p> <p>The seller can set the rate and the FCA found that \u201cthe widespread use of this type of commission creates an incentive for brokers to act against customers\u2019 interests\u201d.</p> <p>Banning this kind of commission would remove the financial incentive for brokers to increase the interest rate paid by customers, and give lenders more control over the prices customers pay for their motor finance, the watchdog said.</p> <p>Christopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA, said: \u201cWe have seen evidence that customers are losing out due to the way in which some lenders are rewarding those who sell motor finance. By banning this type of commission, we believe we will see increased competition in the market which will ultimately save customers money.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/29/uk-fca-car-loans-market\">The FCA has been investigating the fast-growing car finance market</a> for two years and <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/multi-firm-reviews/our-work-on-motor-finance-final-findings.pdf\">published a report</a> in March, which found that \u201csome motor dealers are overcharging unsuspecting customers over a thousand pounds in interest charges in order to obtain bigger commission payouts for themselves\u201d.</p> <p>Sarah Nield, financial services risk and regulation director at PwC, said: \u201cGiven the largest commissions received by brokers tend to come via the models set to be banned, it will be interesting to see how lenders, brokers and dealerships react. Although we expect firms to comply with the spirit of the changes, it could result in unintended consequences including increased flat fee commission payments, car prices and bundled product costs.\u201d</p> <p>The FCA is also proposing changes to the way customers are told about the commission to ensure they receive \u201cmore relevant information\u201d. These changes would apply to many types of credit brokers and not just those selling motor finance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business email signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The watchdog is consulting on the new rules until 15 January 2020 and plans to publish final rules later next year.</p> <p>Sue Robinson, director of the National Franchised Dealers Association, said: \u201cClear rules are positive for the industry but we would urge that they are proportionate so there is a satisfactory outcome for both consumers and retailers.\u201d</p> <p>Scott Cargill, chief executive of Admiral Financial Services, said: \u201cCar buyers need to know that they don\u2019t have to pay these big commissions and do have the option of taking out car finance directly from other lenders \u2013 potentially saving thousands of pounds in interest.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s financial watchdog is cracking down on the way car dealers and car finance brokers make commission on sales, a move that it says will save drivers \u00a3165m. The Financial Conduct Authority said it would ban the way some car retailers and brokers received commission linked to the interest rate customers paid on the loan they took out to buy a car. The arrangement means the higher the interest rate, the more commission is payable. The seller can set the rate and the FCA found that \u201cthe widespread use of this type of commission creates an incentive for brokers to act against customers\u2019 interests\u201d. Banning this kind of commission would remove the financial incentive for brokers to increase the interest rate paid by customers, and give lenders more control over the prices customers pay for their motor finance, the watchdog said. Christopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA, said: \u201cWe have seen evidence that customers are losing out due to the way in which some lenders are rewarding those who sell motor finance. By banning this type of commission, we believe we will see increased competition in the market which will ultimately save customers money.\u201d The FCA has been investigating the fast-growing car finance market for two years and published a report in March, which found that \u201csome motor dealers are overcharging unsuspecting customers over a thousand pounds in interest charges in order to obtain bigger commission payouts for themselves\u201d. Sarah Nield, financial services risk and regulation director at PwC, said: \u201cGiven the largest commissions received by brokers tend to come via the models set to be banned, it will be interesting to see how lenders, brokers and dealerships react. Although we expect firms to comply with the spirit of the changes, it could result in unintended consequences including increased flat fee commission payments, car prices and bundled product costs.\u201d The FCA is also proposing changes to the way customers are told about the commission to ensure they receive \u201cmore relevant information\u201d. These changes would apply to many types of credit brokers and not just those selling motor finance. The watchdog is consulting on the new rules until 15 January 2020 and plans to publish final rules later next year. Sue Robinson, director of the National Franchised Dealers Association, said: \u201cClear rules are positive for the industry but we would urge that they are proportionate so there is a satisfactory outcome for both consumers and retailers.\u201d Scott Cargill, chief executive of Admiral Financial Services, said: \u201cCar buyers need to know that they don\u2019t have to pay these big commissions and do have the option of taking out car finance directly from other lenders \u2013 potentially saving thousands of pounds in interest. The car finance industry has been slow to catch up with other sectors and this has been to the detriment of the car-buying public.\u201d",

Companies including the US credit-rating businesses Experian and TransUnion, as well as the outsourcing specialist Capita and Palantir, a data-mining firm co-founded by the Trump-supporting billionaire Peter Thiel, are selling machine-learning packages to local authorities that are under pressure to save money. A Guardian investigation has established that 140 councils out of 408 have now invested in the software contracts, which can run into millions of pounds, more than double the previous estimates. The systems are being deployed to provide automated guidance on benefit claims, prevent child abuse and allocate school places. But concerns have been raised about privacy and data security, the ability of council officials to understand how some of the systems work, and the difficulty for citizens in challenging automated decisions. It has emerged North Tyneside council has dropped TransUnion, whose system it used to check housing and council tax benefit claims. Welfare payments to an unknown number of people were wrongly delayed when the computer\u2019s \u201cpredictive analytics\u201d erroneously identified low-risk claims as high risk. Meanwhile, Hackney council in east London has dropped Xantura, another company, from a project to predict child abuse and intervene before it happens, saying it did not deliver the expected benefits. And Sunderland city council has not renewed a \u00a34.5m data analytics contract for an \u201cintelligence hub\u201d provided by Palantir. A spokesperson for the Local Government Association, which represents councils, said: \u201cGood use of data can be hugely beneficial in helping councils make services more targeted and effective \u2026 But it is important to note that data is only ever used to inform decisions and not make decisions for councils.\u201d But Silkie Carlo, the director of the campaign group Big Brother Watch, said the increasing use of algorithms was leaving vulnerable people at the whim of \u201cautomated decisions \u2026 they have no idea about and can\u2019t challenge\u201d. Gwilym Morris, a management consultant who works with IT providers to the public sector, said the complexity of the systems meant the leadership of local authorities \u201cdon\u2019t really understand what is going on\u201d and this raised questions about how citizens\u2019 data was used. North Tyneside stopped using TransUnion\u2019s system last month. It automatically processed data about claimants for housing and council tax benefit to determine the likelihood it was fraudulent \u2013 \u201crisk based verification\u201d. But most of the cases deemed high risk by the software were in fact lower risk, and benefit claims were wrongly delayed. A council report concluded: \u201cTransUnion provides no reason for a case meeting a high-risk category and it was found that in most cases, the reason for it being high risk could not be established \u2026 There was no reason for the payment to be withheld, but claims had been delayed.\u201d A spokesperson for TransUnion said the classification of risk groups was \u201cultimately a matter for the local authorities to decide\u201d. They added: \u201cEach local authority also determines what extra checks are required for claimants falling into any particular category, and can monitor for accuracy so that they can adapt their criteria if necessary. \u201cThe time spent on reviewing \u2018high-risk\u2019 claims will equally depend on each local authority\u2019s own policy in terms of processing the additional checks.\u201d TransUnion said it checked benefit claims for fraud for about 70 local authorities in the UK, and Xantura serves the same number of councils.

Far from being all-powerful, or even political wizards, the likes of Donald Trump, Matteo Salvini and Nigel Farage are little more than puppets of the working classes. The lowest socioeconomic groups may not realise they belong to a new proletariat, but they share a common understanding of the prevailing economic model.

In France, the working classes donned hi-vis vests to show they still existed. Their British counterparts seized on Brexit to send the City of London a wake-up call. All over the western world, globalisation\u2019s losers are pulling the strings of populist leaders in order to raise their own visibility. Far from being all-powerful, or even political wizards, the likes of Donald Trump, Matteo Salvini and Nigel Farage are little more than puppets of the working classes. The lowest socioeconomic groups may not realise they belong to a new proletariat, but they share a common understanding of the prevailing economic model. They are also convinced that they have been culturally and geographically sidelined; pushed out of the places where jobs and wealth are created. They haven\u2019t been manipulated politically, they\u2019ve reached an entirely rational diagnosis of the contemporary world. The risk of a return to the totalitarian ideologies of the 20th century is real, but the fundamental challenge of this century is the inclusion \u2013 economic and cultural \u2013 of ordinary people. That problem is the result of an economic model that concentrates wealth in the hands of the wealthiest urban dwellers. The big challenge for society and democracy is to reconcile Paris with peripheral France, London with Sheffield, New York with the rust belt, California with the flyover states. We simply have no choice. Despite being on a different political and cultural wavelength, blue- and white-collar workers, job-seekers, pensioners and small farmers have pulled off a seemingly impossible feat: they have altered the agenda of the man who claimed to lead the world\u2019s political progressives. The cultural independence of the working classes is forcing him to reassess this ideology, and to accept its limits. An Ipsos poll of French voters last month found that 61% believe a strong leader, capable of tearing up the existing rulebook, might improve their lot. Ahead of France\u2019s next presidential election in 2022, Macron could well take on that role. \u2022 Christophe Guilluy is the author of Twilight of the Elites: Prosperity, Periphery and the Future of France",

This is very much one of the smallest and most treasured group, the story of an event that threatened but ultimately failed to destroy hundreds of clubs across the country, is still regularly quoted in legal circles more than 70 years later, and also made 48-year-old Bessie Stone of Cheetham Hill, Manchester really quite upset.</p> <p>The story starts on 9 August 1947 when, midway through Denton St Lawrence CC\u2019s away match against Cheetham, Miss Stone left her house on Manchester\u2019s Beckenham Road and stopped for a chat with a neighbour. Meanwhile, over the road, beyond a 7ft fence, down a further 10ft of natural slope and across 75 yards of playing field, a certain Walter Leadbetter, teacher at a Southport school, was batting for the visitors. The bowler\u2019s name has been lost to history, which is probably as he would have wanted it: with one ball of his first and final over of the game remaining, Leadbetter had already hit two sixes and a four. The final delivery was no better than those that had preceded it, and Leadbetter swung his bat, connected sweetly, and sent the ball soaring.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/oct/08/the-hundred-sees-ecb-double-down-on-ludicrous-marketing-drivel-spin-cricket\">The Spin | The Hundred sees ECB double down on ludicrous marketing-drivel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The ball flew over the outfield, it screamed over the boundary, it cleared the fence and it sailed over Beckenham Road before landing, some 98 yards away from Leadbetter\u2019s bat, on Bessie Stone\u2019s head. So it was that when someone arrived to fetch the missing ball, they found it lying next to the prone body of a passing, and passed-out, neighbour.</p> <p>Stone was rushed to Manchester Northern hospital, where she was treated for shock and concussion.

And suddenly every cricket team, golf course and tennis club within hitting distance of the general public was at risk (or, at the very least, at risk of having to pay for costly insurance policies).</p> <p>She came up against a cricket-loving judge at Manchester Assizes, Mr Justice Oliver, who decided against her but, particularly given the lack of precedent on the issue \u2013 which he considered astonishing \u201csince balls are always flying out of all sorts of grounds in all sorts of places\u201d \u2013 he granted leave to appeal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Stone\u2019s case was Cheetham were guilty of negligence and nuisance for allowing humans to roam within six-hitting range</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And so it was that 70 years ago this week the court of appeal in London was hearing evidence about how far WG Grace could throw a cricket ball (about 150 yards, apparently), how far Albert Trott, then as now the only player to have cleared the pavilion at Lord\u2019s, could hit one, and discussing whether that would be a fair way to decide the minimum size of a club\u2019s grounds.</p> <p>Stone\u2019s case was that although Cheetham CC had come into existence in 1864, roughly 46 years before Beckenham Road, they were guilty of negligence and nuisance for allowing innocent humans to roam within six-hitting range. Even though several witnesses insisted that no one at Cheetham had ever struck the ball as far as Leadbetter, such feats were clearly possible, and a near-neighbour of Stone\u2019s \u2013 whose house was closer to the ground \u2013 testified that cricket balls did turn up in his front garden occasionally, even if he couldn\u2019t be quite sure how often. The crux of the argument, and the idea that really scared so many other clubs, was that if it was possible for a ball to be struck out of the ground and hit someone on the head then an offence was committed every time cricket was played, even if the ball remained grounded and heads unhit. \u201cI appreciate that goes a long way and seems to be an attack on cricket but it is the logical conclusion,\u201d Stone\u2019s lawyer insisted.</p> <p>It was clear that the case\u2019s importance was not confined to north Manchester, and when two of the three judges sided with Stone the situation was suddenly critical.

I would like a large cheese pizza with an ominous side of surveillance, please.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Domino\u2019s, the worldwide purveyor of mediocre pizza, introduced a snazzy tool called <a href=\"https://dompizzachecker.dominos.com.au/\" title=\"\">the D</a><a href=\"https://dompizzachecker.dominos.com.au/\" title=\"\">om Pizza Checker</a> to its Australia and New Zealand locations. According to its website, in-store cameras \u201cuse advanced machine learning, artificial intelligence and sensor technology to identify pizza type, even topping distribution and correct toppings\u201d. If your food doesn\u2019t match your order, or internal quality standards, workers are ordered to make it again. Basically, Big Brother is watching your pizza.</p> <p>At first glance, this may sound benign. The tech ensures customers receive consistent quality; what could be wrong with that? The answer, dear reader, is that it is 2019: everything is problematic \u2013 even pizza. Nick Knight, who runs Domino\u2019s in the region, provided more details about the tool at a recent investor day, revealing that it will be incorporated into a \u201c\u2018scorecard\u2019 bonus system\u201d for franchises and used to identify underperforming stores. In short, it is a workplace surveillance tool. Welcome to \u2013 as the tech website iTnews put it \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.itnews.com.au/news/dominos-turns-its-pizza-checker-ai-into-a-workplace-panopticon-532153\" title=\"\">\u201cthe great pizza panopticon</a><a href=\"https://www.itnews.com.au/news/dominos-turns-its-pizza-checker-ai-into-a-workplace-panopticon-532153\" title=\"\">\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Of course, Domino\u2019s would like you to know that there is nothing remotely creepy about this. \u201cDom Pizza Checker is a tool used to train our team members \u2026 not to punish those who make mistakes,\u201d a Domino\u2019s spokesperson told iTnews. But even if that is true, even if we give Domino\u2019s the benefit of the doubt, the Pizza Checker\u2019s all-seeing eyes and calculating AI should still give us pause for thought. Domino\u2019s, after all, is far from the only company tracking workers: workplace surveillance is becoming increasingly pervasive and worryingly sophisticated.</p> <p>In fact, there is a good chance your employer is watching you right now. According to the research firm Gartner, <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-future-of-employee-monitoring/\" title=\"\">50% of businesses monitor employees</a>, a figure it expects to rise to 80% by 2020. This monitoring takes a variety of forms. Your employer may be taking remote screenshots of your computer. It may be logging your keystrokes or recording your Google searches. It may be tracking the time you are spending reading this, so it can plug that data into an algorithm to analyse your behaviour and predict whether you are likely to quit. It may even be monitoring your facial expressions or tone of voice and gauging your mood.</p> <p>Many of us are resigned to \u2013 and perhaps even fine with \u2013 the idea that our employer can scan our emails or keep track of how much time we waste on social media. But we are entering a new world of workplace surveillance in which we are watched 24/7 and every move is scrutinised. And things are only going to get more intrusive as corporations treat us less like human beings and more like machines. Last year, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/31/amazon-warehouse-wristband-tracking\" title=\"\">Amazon patented an \u201cultrasonic bracelet\u201d </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/31/amazon-warehouse-wristband-tracking\" title=\"\">to be worn by workers</a> to \u201cmonitor performance of assigned tasks\u201d. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/technology/microchips-wisconsin-company-employees.html\" title=\"\">companies are implanting chips under workers\u2019 skin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/40565528/china-is-now-monitoring-employees-brainwaves-and-emotions\" title=\"\">China is monitoring employees\u2019 brain waves</a>. It won\u2019t be long until we have all been implanted with chips that keep track of our productivity and trigger a self-combustion protocol when we are no longer deemed useful to our AI overlords. But, hey, while the future may look bleak, at least there is consistently prepared pizza to look forward to.</p> <p>\u2022Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p>",

The tech ensures customers receive consistent quality; what could be wrong with that? The answer, dear reader, is that it is 2019: everything is problematic \u2013 even pizza. Nick Knight, who runs Domino\u2019s in the region, provided more details about the tool at a recent investor day, revealing that it will be incorporated into a \u201c\u2018scorecard\u2019 bonus system\u201d for franchises and used to identify underperforming stores. In short, it is a workplace surveillance tool. Welcome to \u2013 as the tech website iTnews put it \u2013 \u201cthe great pizza panopticon\u201d. Of course, Domino\u2019s would like you to know that there is nothing remotely creepy about this. \u201cDom Pizza Checker is a tool used to train our team members \u2026 not to punish those who make mistakes,\u201d a Domino\u2019s spokesperson told iTnews. But even if that is true, even if we give Domino\u2019s the benefit of the doubt, the Pizza Checker\u2019s all-seeing eyes and calculating AI should still give us pause for thought. Domino\u2019s, after all, is far from the only company tracking workers: workplace surveillance is becoming increasingly pervasive and worryingly sophisticated. In fact, there is a good chance your employer is watching you right now. According to the research firm Gartner, 50% of businesses monitor employees, a figure it expects to rise to 80% by 2020. This monitoring takes a variety of forms. Your employer may be taking remote screenshots of your computer. It may be logging your keystrokes or recording your Google searches. It may be tracking the time you are spending reading this, so it can plug that data into an algorithm to analyse your behaviour and predict whether you are likely to quit. It may even be monitoring your facial expressions or tone of voice and gauging your mood. Many of us are resigned to \u2013 and perhaps even fine with \u2013 the idea that our employer can scan our emails or keep track of how much time we waste on social media. But we are entering a new world of workplace surveillance in which we are watched 24/7 and every move is scrutinised. And things are only going to get more intrusive as corporations treat us less like human beings and more like machines. Last year, for example, Amazon patented an \u201cultrasonic bracelet\u201d to be worn by workers to \u201cmonitor performance of assigned tasks\u201d. Meanwhile, companies are implanting chips under workers\u2019 skin and China is monitoring employees\u2019 brain waves. It won\u2019t be long until we have all been implanted with chips that keep track of our productivity and trigger a self-combustion protocol when we are no longer deemed useful to our AI overlords. But, hey, while the future may look bleak, at least there is consistently prepared pizza to look forward to. \u2022Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist",

The aim has been to treat respiratory illness as if it were any other sporting injury.</p> <p>Dr James Hull, consultant respiratory physician at the Royal Brompton hospital and one of the initiative\u2019s lead researchers, said: \u201cWhen you look at all the athletes that travel to the Games and the problems that really scupper their chances or give them problems, nearly always top of the list are respiratory tract problems with infection at the top. So if you think about the strategies around what you might term as marginal gains, clearly you want to remove anything that might cause problems for them.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s akin to thinking about injury where you might use things like special shoes to reduce impact. We want to get better at trying to detect those who are at risk of respiratory problems and then to try and reduce that risk.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>This includes identifying potential triggers, such as sleep deprivation and psychological stress, while also mitigating the risks brought about by tasks athletes cannot avoid, such as travelling in confined spaces and shaking the hands of any number of strangers.</p> <p>\u201cWe spent a lot of time thinking about how we can reduce exposure,\u201d Hull said on Tuesday on what is, in fact, global handwashing day. \u201cIt sounds relatively easy to say it but essentially most people don\u2019t know how to wash their hands properly. Given the fact that most respiratory viruses are exposed and then shared through contact, it\u2019s vitally important.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/03/tokyo-olympics-athlete-protests\">Should athletes at the 2020 Olympics take political stances? | Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere is a system called SureWash which trains you electronically. You follow video and you have to go through the WHO hand-washing stages and it marks you on your ability to conduct those and it trains you. We\u2019re then able to assess the athletes to see if they are able to recall the stages and then be effective in remembering it.\u201d</p> <p>According to Hull, it is not necessarily that people do not know how to wash their hands properly, but that they quickly forget. \u201cWe\u2019ve done some work that shows people\u2019s recollection of how to wash their hands is actually very poor,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWithin a two\u2011week period you can hardly remember at all how to go through the stages. The other thing is that people are fairly unaware that the alcohol gels need a contact time of a minute. If you spray it on your hand and rub it off within 15 seconds it\u2019s not really been effective.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "British athletes will be taught how to wash their hands properly before Tokyo 2020, as hygiene becomes a new frontier in the hunt for marginal gains. The English Institute of Sport is to recommend that athletes use SureWash, an online training programme used by professionals in the NHS, before the Olympic and Paralympic Games next year. It follows long-term research which has found respiratory illness \u2013 including coughs and colds \u2013 to be the primary cause of lost training days among elite athletes. \u201cWe are working with the vast majority of Olympic and Paralympic sports on effective handwashing techniques in preparation for the Tokyo Games, which includes tools such as the SureWash training system and UV light boxes,\u201d said Craig Ranson, director of athlete health at the EIS. \u201cThis is hugely important given that respiratory and gastro-intestinal illnesses are two of the biggest health threats to athlete availability for preparation and performance.\u201d Funded by UK Sport, the EIS is based at Loughborough University, but pairs with academics from around the country in research that includes everything from biomechanics to finding the perfect amount of flex in canoeing paddles. The Athlete Respiratory Health initiative is a partnership between the EIS and Imperial College London set up last year in response to data showing that as many as 5,800 days of training were lost to respiratory illness in the two-year period to 20 July 2017. The aim has been to treat respiratory illness as if it were any other sporting injury. Dr James Hull, consultant respiratory physician at the Royal Brompton hospital and one of the initiative\u2019s lead researchers, said: \u201cWhen you look at all the athletes that travel to the Games and the problems that really scupper their chances or give them problems, nearly always top of the list are respiratory tract problems with infection at the top. So if you think about the strategies around what you might term as marginal gains, clearly you want to remove anything that might cause problems for them. \u201cIt\u2019s akin to thinking about injury where you might use things like special shoes to reduce impact. We want to get better at trying to detect those who are at risk of respiratory problems and then to try and reduce that risk.\u201d This includes identifying potential triggers, such as sleep deprivation and psychological stress, while also mitigating the risks brought about by tasks athletes cannot avoid, such as travelling in confined spaces and shaking the hands of any number of strangers. \u201cWe spent a lot of time thinking about how we can reduce exposure,\u201d Hull said on Tuesday on what is, in fact, global handwashing day. \u201cIt sounds relatively easy to say it but essentially most people don\u2019t know how to wash their hands properly. Given the fact that most respiratory viruses are exposed and then shared through contact, it\u2019s vitally important. \u201cThere is a system called SureWash which trains you electronically. You follow video and you have to go through the WHO hand-washing stages and it marks you on your ability to conduct those and it trains you. We\u2019re then able to assess the athletes to see if they are able to recall the stages and then be effective in remembering it.\u201d According to Hull, it is not necessarily that people do not know how to wash their hands properly, but that they quickly forget. \u201cWe\u2019ve done some work that shows people\u2019s recollection of how to wash their hands is actually very poor,\u201d he said. \u201cWithin a two\u2011week period you can hardly remember at all how to go through the stages. The other thing is that people are fairly unaware that the alcohol gels need a contact time of a minute. If you spray it on your hand and rub it off within 15 seconds it\u2019s not really been effective.\u201d",

Doris Lessing\u2019s 1962 novel is eminently quotable:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cFor with my intuition I knew that this man was repeating a pattern over and over again: courting a woman with his intelligence and sympathy, claiming her emotionally; then, when she began to claim in return, running away. And the better a woman was, the sooner he would begin to run.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe real revolution is women against men.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf we lead what is known as free lives, that is, lives like men, why shouldn\u2019t we use the same language.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne had to be much older than I was then to understand George\u2019s relationship with his wife. He had a fierce loyal compassion for her, the compassion of one victim for another.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>In addition to all the aphorisms, there\u2019s also some scorching dialogue \u2013 such as this conversation between two female friends about a married but impotent would-be-lover:</p> <blockquote> <p>And so this man spent a second night with Julia. With no better results.</p> <p>\u201cNaturally he left at four, so that the little woman could believe he had been working late.

The women are left holding the baby, literally and metaphorically, as the consequences of relationship problems fall harder on them. Meanwhile, the men unfailingly abuse their power. They present a physical threat, they have more money, and conventional society tends to take their side, no matter how awful their behaviour.</p> <p>When one useless, stupid, drunken husband publicly labels his wife as an \u201cugly whore\u201d and \u201cbarren bitch\u201d because she has had an affair, she just has to suck it up. \u201cShe lifted her ruin of a face to us,\u201d the narrator says, \u201cpulling at her lovely red hair with both hands, the tears dropping off her chin.\u201d Nobody does anything.

We\u2019ve only had a few minutes play but it\u2019s clear the landscape features remixed versions of classic areas such as Risky Reels and Pleasant Park, as well as totally new discoveries such as Craggy Cliffs, a small town with a range of olde worlde buildings and takeaways, and Sweaty Sands, a hotel and apartment complex complete with rooftop tanning areas. We\u2019ve already had a swim in a spa pool, sped around in a motorboat, found a fishing rod and seen a lighthouse on a distant shoreline. We noticed that the Playground and Creative modes have also been updated. So we\u2019re back in Fortnite again, sooner than expected, and with an impressively stable server experience. There\u2019s a lot to discover in this new if familiar environment, and fans will perhaps be relieved that this isn\u2019t a total reimagining of the beloved Fortnite world with its fluffy trees, rolling hills and eccentric architecture. It will be interesting to see how the new systems work, and how Fortnite Chapter 2 deals with the problem of rivals such as Apex Legends, which brought in the ability to revive downed teammates, putting Epic Games on the back foot. For Chapter 2, Fortnite is adding bandage bazookas, which you can fire at team mates to heal them, and the ability to carry knocked teammates to safety, adding new strategic elements to those frantic gun fights. Other features we\u2019re yet to see include hiding locations such as haystacks and dumpsters, allowing you to leap out on unsuspecting foes, and explosive gas tanks and barrels, to take out enemies when you don\u2019t have grenades. Most interesting is the addition of a weapon upgrade bench so you can tweak your guns with resources discovered during play. Right now, as we charge across a hillside trading gunfire with a man dressed as a golden medieval knight carrying a submachine gun, what\u2019s most striking is that this is very much Fortnite, just in a nice new playground, with fresh rides and the odd surprise. In other words, everything we wanted.",

On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a>&nbsp;and its allies. The deal effectively hands over control of huge swathes of the region to Damascus.</p>\n    <p>That leaves north-eastern&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\">Syria</a>&nbsp;divided between Syrian regime forces, Syrian opposition militia and their Turkish allies, and areas still held by the SDF \u2013 for now.</p>\n    <p>On 17 October Turkish president,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan\">Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan</a>, agreed with US vice-president Mike Pence, to suspend Ankara\u2019s operation for&nbsp; five days in order to allow Kurdish troops to withdraw. The following week, on 22 October, Erdo\u011fan and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/22/turkey-and-russia-agree-deal-over-buffer-zone-in-northern-syria\">agreed on the parameters of the proposed Turkish \u201csafe zone\u201d</a> in Syria.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the SDF come to control the region?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Before the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In late 2014, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/turkey-iraqi-kurds-kobani-isis-fighters-us-air-drops-arms\">Kurds were struggling</a>&nbsp;to fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobane, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why does Turkey oppose the Kurds?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a>.</p>\n    <p>Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF\u2019s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are Turkey\u2019s objectives on its southern border?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/07/us-withdrawal-from-syria-leaves-fate-of-isis-fighters-and-families-in-detention-uncertain\">recent announcement</a>&nbsp;that American soldiers would withdraw from the region.</p>\n    <p>Erdo\u011fan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this \u201csafe zone\u201d, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How would a Turkish incursion impact on Isis?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria.</p>\n    <p>SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey. They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.<br></p>\n    <p>On 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region. Two days later, 750 foreign women affiliated to Isis and their children managed to break out of a secure annex in the Ain Issa camp for displaced people, according to SDF officials.</p>\n    <p>It is unclear which detention sites the SDF still controls and the status of the prisoners inside.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces were in the forefront of the campaign to defeat Islamic State extremists, but Erdo\u011fan links them to separatist militants within Turkey. The Kurds have turned to a deal with Russian-backed Syrian president Bashar Assad to help fend off Turkey\u2019s invasion, creating a potential tinderbox.</p> \n<p>Along with Pence\u2019s upcoming trip, defense secretary Mark Esper said he would next week travel to Brussels to request that Nato allies punish Turkey over the invasion, which he said had \u201cresulted in the release of many dangerous ISIS detainees\u201d.</p> \n<p>The White House appears to have shifted to a strategy of claiming that the Turkish invasion was inevitable and it is merely moving US forces out of harm\u2019s way.</p> \n<p>On a Monday evening conference call, a senior administration official said: \u201cThis was something that was caused by an action of President Erdo\u011fan who, after repeated warnings that this was a bad idea, he shouldn\u2019t do it and the United States in no way endorsed this activity, took a very, very rash ill-calculated action that has had what, for him, were unintended consequences.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another official added: \u201cThe forces that the [defence] secretary withdrew from the northeast, the dozens of forces, were in an area that was 40 kilometres long and 30 kilometres deep. The idea that somehow those couple of dozen forces would somehow be in a position to stop an invading army is just not logical.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump has also maintained his argument that he made a campaign promise to stop endless, faraway wars and bring troops home. Shortly before his statement announcing sanctions, the president tweeted: \u201cAnyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte. I hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!\u201d</p> \n<p>The new sanctions may not be enough to satisfy Congress, which returns to session on Tuesday. Trump has faced a rare rebellion from congressional Republicans, who have habitually backed him to the hilt, and are currently defending him against an impeachment inquiry.</p> \n<p>Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader in the Senate, said the pullout of US troops from Syria threatens a \u201cstrategic calamity\u201d and \u201ccatastrophic outcome\u201d for American interests in the region, although he did not mention Trump by name.</p> \n<p>Three top Democratic senators called the sanctions \u201cgood and justified\u201d but also insufficient and warned that they would ask Republicans to join them in passing a resolution calling on Trump to reverse the pullout of US forces, viewed as unravelling five years of diplomatic graft.</p> \n<p>\u201cPresident Trump should use this moment to step up, do the right thing, and correct course,\u201d the top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, wrote in a joint statement along with Bob Menendez and Jack Reed, the senior Democrats on the Senate foreign relations and armed services committees.</p> \n<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier said she was forging ahead on a Turkey sanctions bill with Republican senator Lindsey Graham, who has been fiercely critical of the withdrawal.</p> \n<p>Graham said on Monday that he \u201cstrongly support[s]\u201d Trump\u2019s executive order sanctions and had joined the president and his team on phone calls with leaders in the conflict. \u201cPresident Trump gave Turkey the ability to undo the strategic damage they have already caused in a win-win fashion,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope they will accept his outreach.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jeremy Hunt, the former UK foreign secretary, said Trump had made a \u201cprofound strategic mistake\u201d and that he would be sympathetic to a UK arms sales embargo on Turkey. Unlike a host of other EU countries including France, Germany and Italy, the UK has not yet imposed an arms sale ban.</p> \n<p>Trump again warned Turkey it was responsible for the safety of civilians and minorities, and eventually the detention of Islamic State extremists held by Kurdish fighters. \u201cI have been perfectly clear with President Erdo\u011fan: Turkey\u2019s action is precipitating a humanitarian crisis and setting conditions for possible war crimes,\u201d Trump said.</p>",

But Trump\u2019s announcement just over a week ago that he was withdrawing US troops, who had served as an effective buffer against Turkish invasion, has been widely viewed as a historic foreign policy blunder and provoked an extraordinary backlash even from Republicans. As the situation in northern Syria spiralled out of control, and the White House scrambled to catch up, the president said he had issued an executive order to impose sanctions on current and former Turkish officials and was immediately freezing negotiations on a $100bn US-Turkey trade deal. Trump said he was also reimposing tariffs of 50% on Turkish steel \u2013 one of a series of measures taken last year to win the release of the American pastor Andrew Brunson from detention, which triggered a record-breaking 30% slide in the Turkish lira, sending inflation soaring and damaging living standards. In May, Trump scaled tariffs back to 25%. \u201cI am fully prepared to swiftly destroy Turkey\u2019s economy if Turkish leaders continue down this dangerous and destructive path,\u201d the president said on Monday. Erdo\u011fan was quoted as dismissing such threats as \u201cquips\u201d on Sunday, while the country\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva called a possible European Union arms embargo \u201ca joke.\u201d The Turkish lira slid 0.8% to its weakest position since May on Monday, but many traders and investors said in effect they would believe it when they see it, especially after US threats earlier this year to sanction Turkey over buying Russian S-400 missile defences failed to materialise. Trump\u2019s statement also confirmed that all 1,000 US troops in north-eastern Syria are pulling out entirely, although they will \u201credeploy and remain in the region\u201d. It added that a \u201csmall footprint\u201d of US forces are staying in At Tanf Garrison in southern Syria \u201cto continue to disrupt remnants\u201d of the Islamic State. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces were in the forefront of the campaign to defeat Islamic State extremists, but Erdo\u011fan links them to separatist militants within Turkey. The Kurds have turned to a deal with Russian-backed Syrian president Bashar Assad to help fend off Turkey\u2019s invasion, creating a potential tinderbox. Along with Pence\u2019s upcoming trip, defense secretary Mark Esper said he would next week travel to Brussels to request that Nato allies punish Turkey over the invasion, which he said had \u201cresulted in the release of many dangerous ISIS detainees\u201d. The White House appears to have shifted to a strategy of claiming that the Turkish invasion was inevitable and it is merely moving US forces out of harm\u2019s way. On a Monday evening conference call, a senior administration official said: \u201cThis was something that was caused by an action of President Erdo\u011fan who, after repeated warnings that this was a bad idea, he shouldn\u2019t do it and the United States in no way endorsed this activity, took a very, very rash ill-calculated action that has had what, for him, were unintended consequences.\u201d Another official added: \u201cThe forces that the [defence] secretary withdrew from the northeast, the dozens of forces, were in an area that was 40 kilometres long and 30 kilometres deep. The idea that somehow those couple of dozen forces would somehow be in a position to stop an invading army is just not logical.\u201d Trump has also maintained his argument that he made a campaign promise to stop endless, faraway wars and bring troops home. Shortly before his statement announcing sanctions, the president tweeted: \u201cAnyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte. I hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!\u201d The new sanctions may not be enough to satisfy Congress, which returns to session on Tuesday. Trump has faced a rare rebellion from congressional Republicans, who have habitually backed him to the hilt, and are currently defending him against an impeachment inquiry. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader in the Senate, said the pullout of US troops from Syria threatens a \u201cstrategic calamity\u201d and \u201ccatastrophic outcome\u201d for American interests in the region, although he did not mention Trump by name. Three top Democratic senators called the sanctions \u201cgood and justified\u201d but also insufficient and warned that they would ask Republicans to join them in passing a resolution calling on Trump to reverse the pullout of US forces, viewed as unravelling five years of diplomatic graft. \u201cPresident Trump should use this moment to step up, do the right thing, and correct course,\u201d the top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, wrote in a joint statement along with Bob Menendez and Jack Reed, the senior Democrats on the Senate foreign relations and armed services committees. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier said she was forging ahead on a Turkey sanctions bill with Republican senator Lindsey Graham, who has been fiercely critical of the withdrawal. Graham said on Monday that he \u201cstrongly support[s]\u201d Trump\u2019s executive order sanctions and had joined the president and his team on phone calls with leaders in the conflict. \u201cPresident Trump gave Turkey the ability to undo the strategic damage they have already caused in a win-win fashion,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope they will accept his outreach.\u201d Jeremy Hunt, the former UK foreign secretary, said Trump had made a \u201cprofound strategic mistake\u201d and that he would be sympathetic to a UK arms sales embargo on Turkey. Unlike a host of other EU countries including France, Germany and Italy, the UK has not yet imposed an arms sale ban. Trump again warned Turkey it was responsible for the safety of civilians and minorities, and eventually the detention of Islamic State extremists held by Kurdish fighters. \u201cI have been perfectly clear with President Erdo\u011fan: Turkey\u2019s action is precipitating a humanitarian crisis and setting conditions for possible war crimes,\u201d Trump said.",

Last week Human Rights Watch called on Qatar to \u201curgently investigate and publicise the underlying causes of migrant worker deaths\u201d.

Russia\u2019s influence grows as Syrian troops join Kurdish fight As the violence in northern Syria continued to escalate on Monday, Donald Trump imposed sanctions on Ankara and spoke to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, to demand an immediate ceasefire \u2013 a move seen as an attempt by the White House to mitigate a historic foreign policy blunder. But with Syrian troops joining the fight against Turkey\u2019s onslaught \u2013 under a deal between the Kurds and Damascus, brokered by Russia \u2013 a regional power shift from Washington to Moscow is well under way. Nuclear bombs. The tensions between Turkey and the Trump administration are complicated by the fact that the US has approximately 50 nuclear bombs stored at an American airbase in Turkey, which could become bargaining chips. Saudi concerns. The new Saudi ambassador to the UK has said the Turkish offensive in north-eastern Syria is a disaster that has dented Riyadh\u2019s confidence in the Trump administration. John Bolton \u2018sounded alarm\u2019 over Giuliani and Ukraine John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, was reportedly so alarmed by Rudy Giuliani\u2019s back-channel efforts to dig up dirt on the Bidens in Ukraine that he told one of his top aides to raise the matter with White House lawyers. Fiona Hill, formerly the administration\u2019s top expert on Russia, revealed Bolton\u2019s horror at Giuliani\u2019s shadow foreign policy in testimony to the congressional impeachment inquiry, saying Bolton told her: \u201cGiuliani\u2019s a hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up.\u201d Hunter Biden. Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter, whose links to a Ukrainian energy firm are at the heart of Giuliani\u2019s attempts to smear the former vice-president, has given an interview to ABC News that will air on Tuesday, hours before a Democratic presidential debate. Texas cop who killed Atatiana Jefferson charged with murder The Fort Worth police officer who shot dead a black woman in her own home on Saturday has been charged with murder. Atatiana Jefferson, 28, was killed in her bedroom when officer Aaron Dean fired at her through a window. Body camera footage released by police shows that Dean, who had arrived at Jefferson\u2019s home to conduct a welfare check, had not parked in front of the house, did not identify himself, and appears to have given her no time to respond to his initial command before opening fire. \u2018Wellness call\u2019. Jefferson had been playing video games with her eight-year-old nephew, Zion, when she was killed. The family\u2019s lawyer, Lee Merritt, said: \u201cIt\u2019s beyond me to begin to understand what kind of police force responds to a wellness call with the equivalent of Swat.\u201d WeWork set to sack 2,000 staff after IPO fiasco The office rental firm WeWork, until recently America\u2019s most highly valued private company, is expected to sack as many as 2,000 of its 15,000 staff as it tries to staunch massive losses and contain the fallout from a failed IPO. Though WeWork declined to comment, the Guardian obtained online chats among its staff, where much internal ire is being directed at co-founder Adam Neumann, who cashed in $700m of his own shares before the IPO was pulled in September, amid skepticism from prospective investors. Cancer risk. In a further headache for the firm, WeWork has been forced to close about 2,300 phone booths at its north American office spaces, after discovering elevated levels of formaldehyde that could pose a cancer risk. Cheat sheet Several high-profile figures have criticised Trump for failing to condemn a violent video, shown at an event for supporters at his Florida resort, which depicts the president shooting and stabbing dozens of his political opponents and media outlets. The Booker Prize for fiction has been split between two winners for the first time in almost 30 years, after judges were unable to choose between Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Testaments and Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo. Self-reported suicide attempts among black teenagers in the US have increased by 73% since the early 1990s, according to a study published in the medical journal Pediatrics. Russian investigators have staged nationwide raids on more than 200 offices belonging to the country\u2019s political opposition, as the Kremlin ramps up pressure on leading Putin critic Alexei Navalny and his allies. Must-reads The Americans haunted by zombie debt Tens of thousands of people have received demands from a faceless bureaucracy to repay alleged overpayments of government benefits, some of them decades old. For the Guardian\u2019s Automating Poverty series, Virginia Eubanks met the Americans struggling with zombie debt. Democrats battle for the suburbs in 2020 The latest Democratic presidential debate is taking place on Tuesday night in Westerville, Ohio, an affluent suburb north-east of the state capital, Columbus. Westerville, and other suburbs like it, will be \u201cground zero\u201d in 2020, the experts tell Lauren Gambino. The prescience and power of Fight Club, 20 years on When David Fincher\u2019s film adaptation of Fight Club arrived in cinemas in 1999, it generated widespread concern that it might inspire impressionable young men to commit violent acts. Two decades later, says Scott Tobias, its satirical ambiguities seem more like a warning than an incitement. Thomas Chatterton Williams: how and why to \u2018unlearn race\u2019 After years of examining race categories, the American writer Thomas Chatterton Williams has come to identify as an ex-black man. Being black in America \u201cis a category that\u2019s been hurting my family for generations,\u201d he tells Summer Sewell, \u201cbut it\u2019s not a real category and our society is damaged by insisting on it.\u201d Opinion The US, UK and Australian governments have asked Facebook to create a \u201cbackdoor\u201d to its encrypted messaging apps.

Balakov had a responsibility to his sport and to basic human decency. He failed on both counts.</p> \n<p>Somehow England played brilliantly in the middle of all this, a game that fell apart around them at times and against opponents who barely played at all. Who knows, perhaps this might come to seem like a righteous occasion.</p> \n<p>Racist abuse in football stadiums has been a source of unhappiness for as long as there has been racist abuse and football stadiums. There was at least some sense of action being taken in the enforcement of the under-enforced Uefa protocols at the fag end of so many inadequate fines and decisive measures never put in place. By the end, the spectacle of England playing on felt, rightly or wrongly, like a kind of resistance.</p> \n<p>A kind of history was made as for the first time football made a live intervention. The half\u2011time break was the third stoppage of the game. The first came just after England\u2019s second goal. As the England end celebrated the sounds of joy and exhilaration were replaced by chants of \u201cYou racist bastards, you know what you are\u201d. Provocative perhaps but also prescient and entirely accurate. The first monkey chants from the home crowd were heard shortly after.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9616d6b95bf97d834c816dd6985adb887dd934b7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9616d6b95bf97d834c816dd6985adb887dd934b7/219_0_4906_2944/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bulgaria fans leave the stadium early during the match against England.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bulgaria fans leave the stadium early during the match against England.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vadim Ghird\u0103/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>They were directed at Tyrone Mings, who took the ball by the touchline and was greeted by a small group of Bulgarians making the hated, hateful noises. Mings made his pass then turned and stared at the crowd. In that moment your heart broke slightly. Here was a man on his England debut, fielding with the utmost grace and composure not just vile abuse but a moment that will echo far beyond this shabby\u2011looking pitch.</p> \n<p>Moments later, Gareth Southgate could be seen talking to the Uefa official Danilo Filacchione, pointing over at the far side where the noise had come from. Filacchione spoke into his walkie-talkie. The game paused. And so we waited. Finally, the PA announcement came, a thin, anxious, hectoring voice that drew boos and shrieks from the home crowd.</p> \n<p>\u201cBecause of racist behaviour among spectators which is interfering with the game the referee has indicated he may have to suspend the match.</p> \n<p>\u201cPlease be under no mistake the game will be suspended and may be abandoned if the racist behaviour continues.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We crawled on, horribly. At 40 minutes there was more of the same as Mings took the ball. A three-way discussion followed between manager, referee and Filacchione. There were whistles, jeers, objects thrown from the ultras in black at the far end close to the Bulgaria goal.</p> \n<p>England shuffled together protectively. Finally, they walked back out to restart when they might have chosen to walk off, a decision that drew boos and whistles from the home crowd. Six minutes of stoppage time for racism, the board flashed up.</p> \n<p>There was time for more abuse and time also for another goal as Kieran Trippier and Harry Kane (playing a wonderful hand as a creator in the middle of all this poison) set up Raheem Sterling for 4-0.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"044ee5ab-318d-49f0-82b7-19e0fafc7de3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9aefYufO8CA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The second half felt like a wake, and not just for the idea of the game as a competitive exercise, as England scored six and might have had 10.</p> \n<p>Bulgaria had played like a rabble.

Presumably his apologies will be just as heartfelt as his complaints on Friday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/08/england-ready-walk-off-if-racism-sofia-tammy-abraham-bulgaria\" title=\"\">Tammy Abraham had been wide of the mark</a> in assuming all this would indeed come to pass in Bulgaria\u2019s national stadium.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/14/gareth-southgate-england-bulgaria-major-statement-racism\">Gareth Southgate praises England players for making \u2018major statement\u2019</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Will England ever want to come here again? Before kick-off their fans had filled their corner-slice of this sallow concrete bowl with the usual travelling pageantry of St George\u2019s flags. The rest of the stadium was a half-empty husk. No great hardship shutting parts of this ground: the end opposite the banned area remained a sea of empty seats.</p> \n<p>There will be a reckoning for the Bulgarian Football Association. Perhaps the protocols will now be used more often. What is a protocol anyway? A mode of behaviour, an attempt to civilise. What protocol did we see here? It isn\u2019t enough. For now, no other European nation should be asked to play in Sofia. Lock the gates. Let the plastic seating moulder, the concrete crack.</p> \n<p>Yet, beyond this, the idea Uefa can realistically staunch this kind of performative racist protest is laughable. These Bulgarians were not having a moment or allowing their usual high standards to slip. They were gleefully taking the opportunity to abuse black footballers and to demonstrate in some cases that they are fascists.</p> \n<p>One thing is certain: the England team can be hugely proud of their grace under pressure. There was something majestic about those red shirts, still abused periodically but determined to see this through. Football carried on. But this cannot be allowed to pass.</p>",

An hour after the final whistle, just as Greg Clarke, the chairman of the FA, had talked about, among other things, England\u2019s backroom staff being deeply upset by events on the pitch, Bulgarian journalists could be seen laughing and joking, greeting this horror show not with shame or remorse, but as though it was, at worst, an inconvenience. The statement from Bulgaria\u2019s manager, Krasimir Balakov, that he had not noticed anything, that he just wanted to talk about football, was an anatomy of cowardly dissembling. Balakov had a responsibility to his sport and to basic human decency. He failed on both counts. Somehow England played brilliantly in the middle of all this, a game that fell apart around them at times and against opponents who barely played at all. Who knows, perhaps this might come to seem like a righteous occasion. Racist abuse in football stadiums has been a source of unhappiness for as long as there has been racist abuse and football stadiums. There was at least some sense of action being taken in the enforcement of the under-enforced Uefa protocols at the fag end of so many inadequate fines and decisive measures never put in place. By the end, the spectacle of England playing on felt, rightly or wrongly, like a kind of resistance. A kind of history was made as for the first time football made a live intervention. The half\u2011time break was the third stoppage of the game. The first came just after England\u2019s second goal. As the England end celebrated the sounds of joy and exhilaration were replaced by chants of \u201cYou racist bastards, you know what you are\u201d. Provocative perhaps but also prescient and entirely accurate. The first monkey chants from the home crowd were heard shortly after. They were directed at Tyrone Mings, who took the ball by the touchline and was greeted by a small group of Bulgarians making the hated, hateful noises. Mings made his pass then turned and stared at the crowd. In that moment your heart broke slightly. Here was a man on his England debut, fielding with the utmost grace and composure not just vile abuse but a moment that will echo far beyond this shabby\u2011looking pitch. Moments later, Gareth Southgate could be seen talking to the Uefa official Danilo Filacchione, pointing over at the far side where the noise had come from. Filacchione spoke into his walkie-talkie. The game paused. And so we waited. Finally, the PA announcement came, a thin, anxious, hectoring voice that drew boos and shrieks from the home crowd. \u201cBecause of racist behaviour among spectators which is interfering with the game the referee has indicated he may have to suspend the match. \u201cPlease be under no mistake the game will be suspended and may be abandoned if the racist behaviour continues.\u201d We crawled on, horribly. At 40 minutes there was more of the same as Mings took the ball. A three-way discussion followed between manager, referee and Filacchione. There were whistles, jeers, objects thrown from the ultras in black at the far end close to the Bulgaria goal. England shuffled together protectively. Finally, they walked back out to restart when they might have chosen to walk off, a decision that drew boos and whistles from the home crowd. Six minutes of stoppage time for racism, the board flashed up. There was time for more abuse and time also for another goal as Kieran Trippier and Harry Kane (playing a wonderful hand as a creator in the middle of all this poison) set up Raheem Sterling for 4-0. The second half felt like a wake, and not just for the idea of the game as a competitive exercise, as England scored six and might have had 10. Bulgaria had played like a rabble. Their fans had disgraced their country and deeply embarrassed (it is to be hoped) their president, Boris Mikhailov. Presumably his apologies will be just as heartfelt as his complaints on Friday that Tammy Abraham had been wide of the mark in assuming all this would indeed come to pass in Bulgaria\u2019s national stadium. Will England ever want to come here again? Before kick-off their fans had filled their corner-slice of this sallow concrete bowl with the usual travelling pageantry of St George\u2019s flags. The rest of the stadium was a half-empty husk. No great hardship shutting parts of this ground: the end opposite the banned area remained a sea of empty seats. There will be a reckoning for the Bulgarian Football Association. Perhaps the protocols will now be used more often. What is a protocol anyway? A mode of behaviour, an attempt to civilise. What protocol did we see here? It isn\u2019t enough. For now, no other European nation should be asked to play in Sofia. Lock the gates. Let the plastic seating moulder, the concrete crack. Yet, beyond this, the idea Uefa can realistically staunch this kind of performative racist protest is laughable. These Bulgarians were not having a moment or allowing their usual high standards to slip. They were gleefully taking the opportunity to abuse black footballers and to demonstrate in some cases that they are fascists. One thing is certain: the England team can be hugely proud of their grace under pressure. There was something majestic about those red shirts, still abused periodically but determined to see this through. Football carried on. But this cannot be allowed to pass.",

It hopes this will encourage plastic producers to reduce the amount of virgin plastic they use and make their packaging easier to recycle. Chemical recycling, though still in its infancy, could also help to ensure more types of plastic are recycled in future. \u201cThere is ample opportunity for innovation to address plastic waste,\u201d says a spokesperson for the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, \u201cstarting with designing products that have a greater ability to be recycled and reused, as well as developing new recycling technologies and infrastructure.\u201d The Scottish government is also introducing a deposit return scheme for plastic bottles, cans and glass, with all retailers in the country required to comply and accept returns. This could boost recycling rates significantly if it was adopted across the whole of the UK. But until then, make sure you check to see what kind of plastic can be recycled in your area \u2013 and spare a thought for the long journey it might be about to go on.

      "bodyText": "The Spanish foreign minister has accused the pro-independence Catalan government of exhibiting a \u201ctotalitarian attitude\u201d by excluding and ignoring the 50% of Catalans who oppose breaking away from Spain. Josep Borrell, who is himself Catalan, made the remarks a day after nine senior Catalan leaders were jailed for sedition over their roles in the failed attempt for regional independence. The verdict prompted furious protests across Catalonia and led to angry clashes with police after demonstrators attempted to occupy Barcelona-El Prat airport. Borrell, who will soon become the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, said that while the central government would continue to seek a political solution to the independence crisis, the Catalan government of President Quim Torra could not carry on claiming to represent the views of all the region\u2019s people. \u201cI think the root of the problem is that the independence movement ignores the \u2018Catalanness\u2019 of those people who aren\u2019t in favour of independence,\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cWhen you exclude part of the population because they don\u2019t share your views and claim that only those who think like you are \u2018the people\u2019, that\u2019s a totalitarian attitude: \u2018You\u2019re only one of the people if you think like me.\u2019\u201d Catalan pro-independence parties have never managed to take 50% of the vote in regional elections, while popular support for seceding from Spain \u2013 which reached a record high of 48.7% in October 2017 \u2013 is currently at 44%, with 48.3% of Catalans in opposition. Borrell said the supreme court\u2019s sentence could not be seen as an attack on all Catalans. \u201cDon\u2019t abuse the word \u2018Catalans\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t exclude me from society \u2026 Catalan society is divided in two and one of those parts excludes the other.\u201d Borrell also said the seven supreme court judges had made it quite clear that they were dealing with a judicial matter and not trying to solve a political problem with their verdict. Speaking in Barcelona on Tuesday, Torra said the bid for independence had not increased division among Catalans, adding that independence was \u201cthe clearly expressed wish of the majority of Catalans\u201d. He also said the Spanish state had refused to come up with any proposals to resolve the conflict. Asked what proposal his government was putting forward, he said: \u201cOur proposal is to talk, end the repression and hold a referendum.\u201d Torra\u2019s comments came as the former Catalan vice-president jailed for 13 years over his part in the unsuccessful bid claimed a new referendum was unavoidable. Oriol Junqueras and eight other separatist leaders were jailed for sedition by the supreme court on Monday. In an emailed interview with Reuters, Junqueras, who was sentenced to 13 years, said he was convinced a political solution had to be found to end the bitter independence conflict. \u201cWhat I\u2019m sure of is that this conflict is to be resolved via ballot boxes \u2026 we are convinced that sooner or later a referendum is inevitable because otherwise, how can we give a voice to the citizens?\u201d he wrote from prison, adding that he did not regret organising the referendum in October 2017. Junqueras said he thought the supreme court\u2019s decision would serve only to galvanise the independence movement, which has lost momentum recently amid divisions over the best way to achieve a split from Spain. \u201cI\u2019m sure this sentence will not weaken the independence movement, quite the contrary,\u201d he said. The nine separatist leaders were convicted of a range of offences, including sedition, misuse of public funds and disobedience, but cleared of the most serious charge of violent rebellion. Hours after the verdicts were announced, an international arrest warrant was reissued for the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, who spearheaded the push for independence. The warrant said Puigdemont, who fled to Belgium to avoid arrest by the Spanish authorities, was wanted for alleged sedition and misuse of public funds. The verdict and sentences triggered angry protests, with demonstrations held around the region and skirmishes with police at El Prat, where around 110 flights were cancelled. Officers used baton charges and foam and rubber bullets to try to move protesters. Torra described the demonstrations at Barcelona airport and elsewhere as \u201ca normal response to the injustice of the sentences\u201d. Spain\u2019s acting interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, said Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic, the group that coordinated the action at the airport, was under investigation. Catalan health authorities said medical personnel had attended to 131 people on Monday. Twenty-four people were taken to hospital, including one man who suffered an eye injury that could have been caused by a rubber bullet. A spokeswoman for the central government\u2019s delegation in Catalonia said officers from the national police force had fired a \u201cvery small number\u201d of rubber bullets outside the airport after receiving a request for back-up from the Catalan force, the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra. The national police force are authorised to use rubber bullets but the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra use foam projectiles after rubber bullets were outlawed by the regional parliament five years ago. Of the 131 people who received medical attention, 26 were Catalan and 11 national police officers. The pro-independence Catalan National Assembly has called on its supporters for a massive show of force on Tuesday evening outside the offices of the Spanish government in Barcelona and three other Catalan cities.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a superhero,\u201d says Sue Armstrong Brown, chief executive of the charity Adoption UK, the leading voice of adoptive families.</p> <p>Armstrong Brown believes that many of the characteristics adoptive parents require are the same as those all parents need. \u201cWarmth, openness and a willingness to accept the unknown are key,\u201d she says. \u201cAdopters need to be emotionally mature, have resilience and problem-solving skills and the ability to prioritise family relationships. And a good sense of humour is essential.\u201d</p> <p>Adopted children\u2019s early experiences mean they can often struggle with relationships and day-to-day life. Many have suffered abuse or neglect, all have been separated from their birth families and most have spent time in the care system. They need love, understanding and patience to help them overcome their difficulties and go on to lead confident, happy lives.</p> <p>Although it can be challenging, being an adoptive parent is also hugely rewarding and adopters provide some of the UK\u2019s most vulnerable children with the stable homes they so desperately need.</p> <p>Heather and her husband, Dan, adopted Miles 15 months ago when he was just over a year old. Heather considers empathy to be the most important quality in an adoptive parent. \u201cThat is probably the biggest one,\u201d she says. \u201cReally understanding where children are coming from.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s important being able to admit to them if you don\u2019t get something right,\u201d Heather continues. \u201cAdopted children can mistrust adults even if they don\u2019t know where that comes from. Some have never had an adult meet their basic needs.\u201d</p> <p>Dan and Heather were an \u201cadoption first\u201d couple, meaning that they had not experienced infertility, but went straight for adoption to start their family.</p> <p>\u201cAt the time, I was working with children who were in care, and for some of the children their plan was adoption. It didn\u2019t feel right to us as a couple to have a baby when we knew so many children were waiting for families,\u201d says Heather.</p> <p>The fact that she was already working in nurseries and children\u2019s centres meant that there was no mystique for her around adoption. Dan had his reservations at first but once he went to a group for prospective adopters, those feelings disappeared.</p> <p>\u201cHe realised they were just children, there was nothing to be frightened of. They just needed a stable, loving home,\u201d Heather says.</p> <p>They also knew they had to work together as a couple, supporting each other, being flexible and communicating about any challenges. \u201cThe challenges that adoptive children bring are the same as for all children, but the approach has to be different,\u201d she says. \u201cMiles sometimes struggles with separation so it\u2019s about building up trust.\u201d</p> <p>Tanya Killick is a project worker at <a href=\"http://www.adopteens.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adopteens</a>, an online community for adopted young people aged 11 to 18 living in Yorkshire and the Humber region. She believes adopters with teenagers should be open to exploring their children\u2019s pasts. \u201cIt\u2019s about flexibility around the teenagers\u2019 emotional needs,\u201d she says. \u201cAn understanding of where they have come from is crucial in helping them form a strong sense of their own identity.\u201d</p> <p>Education poses many challenges to adopted children and their families. While GCSEs, A-levels, and going to college can be stressful for many young people, those who are adopted can find these life stages even more difficult. \u201cThey need a lot more support in school,\u201d says Killick. \u201cAdoption is not just a point in time, it is a part of you forever.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/you-can-adopt/2019/oct/14/olympian-tessa-sanderson-on-why-she-adopted-and-the-need-for-more-bame-adoptive-parents\">Olympian Tessa Sanderson on why she adopted \u2013 and the need for more BAME adoptive parents</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Claire is a single adoptive parent from north-east England who has two daughters, now aged five-and-a-half and three. She was in her early 30s when she first thought about adopting. \u201cI felt ready to have kids and wasn\u2019t in a relationship at the time. One of my parents was adopted, so it was something that I grew up with. It just seemed like the right way to do it.\u201d</p> <p>When she began to research adoption, she realised many of the children in the looked-after system had been exposed to alcohol during pregnancy. Claire made the conscious decision to openly accept that and look for sources of support after she had adopted. Both her children have foetal alcohol syndrome and have benefited from specialist therapies. Claire has been able to deal with the resulting challenges as they arise. \u201cIt just requires thinking in a different way, a different sort of parenting,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Armstrong Brown reiterates that adoption can be uniquely fulfilling. \u201cAdoptive parents find they have a deep love for their children that really enhances their lives, despite the challenges,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cIf you are interested, and feel drawn to adopt, just make an enquiry \u2013 it doesn\u2019t commit you to anything.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>If you are interested in finding out more about adoption, contact First4Adoption on 0300 222 0022 or visit </strong></em><strong><a href=\"https://www.first4adoption.org.uk/youcanadopt/\" rel=\"nofollow\">first4adoption.org.uk/youcanadopt</a></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a superhero,\u201d says Sue Armstrong Brown, chief executive of the charity Adoption UK, the leading voice of adoptive families. Armstrong Brown believes that many of the characteristics adoptive parents require are the same as those all parents need. \u201cWarmth, openness and a willingness to accept the unknown are key,\u201d she says. \u201cAdopters need to be emotionally mature, have resilience and problem-solving skills and the ability to prioritise family relationships. And a good sense of humour is essential.\u201d Adopted children\u2019s early experiences mean they can often struggle with relationships and day-to-day life. Many have suffered abuse or neglect, all have been separated from their birth families and most have spent time in the care system. They need love, understanding and patience to help them overcome their difficulties and go on to lead confident, happy lives. Although it can be challenging, being an adoptive parent is also hugely rewarding and adopters provide some of the UK\u2019s most vulnerable children with the stable homes they so desperately need. Heather and her husband, Dan, adopted Miles 15 months ago when he was just over a year old. Heather considers empathy to be the most important quality in an adoptive parent. \u201cThat is probably the biggest one,\u201d she says. \u201cReally understanding where children are coming from. \u201cI think it\u2019s important being able to admit to them if you don\u2019t get something right,\u201d Heather continues. \u201cAdopted children can mistrust adults even if they don\u2019t know where that comes from. Some have never had an adult meet their basic needs.\u201d Dan and Heather were an \u201cadoption first\u201d couple, meaning that they had not experienced infertility, but went straight for adoption to start their family. \u201cAt the time, I was working with children who were in care, and for some of the children their plan was adoption. It didn\u2019t feel right to us as a couple to have a baby when we knew so many children were waiting for families,\u201d says Heather. The fact that she was already working in nurseries and children\u2019s centres meant that there was no mystique for her around adoption. Dan had his reservations at first but once he went to a group for prospective adopters, those feelings disappeared. \u201cHe realised they were just children, there was nothing to be frightened of. They just needed a stable, loving home,\u201d Heather says. They also knew they had to work together as a couple, supporting each other, being flexible and communicating about any challenges. \u201cThe challenges that adoptive children bring are the same as for all children, but the approach has to be different,\u201d she says. \u201cMiles sometimes struggles with separation so it\u2019s about building up trust.\u201d Tanya Killick is a project worker at Adopteens, an online community for adopted young people aged 11 to 18 living in Yorkshire and the Humber region. She believes adopters with teenagers should be open to exploring their children\u2019s pasts. \u201cIt\u2019s about flexibility around the teenagers\u2019 emotional needs,\u201d she says. \u201cAn understanding of where they have come from is crucial in helping them form a strong sense of their own identity.\u201d Education poses many challenges to adopted children and their families. While GCSEs, A-levels, and going to college can be stressful for many young people, those who are adopted can find these life stages even more difficult. \u201cThey need a lot more support in school,\u201d says Killick. \u201cAdoption is not just a point in time, it is a part of you forever.\u201d Claire is a single adoptive parent from north-east England who has two daughters, now aged five-and-a-half and three. She was in her early 30s when she first thought about adopting. \u201cI felt ready to have kids and wasn\u2019t in a relationship at the time. One of my parents was adopted, so it was something that I grew up with. It just seemed like the right way to do it.\u201d When she began to research adoption, she realised many of the children in the looked-after system had been exposed to alcohol during pregnancy. Claire made the conscious decision to openly accept that and look for sources of support after she had adopted. Both her children have foetal alcohol syndrome and have benefited from specialist therapies. Claire has been able to deal with the resulting challenges as they arise. \u201cIt just requires thinking in a different way, a different sort of parenting,\u201d she says. Armstrong Brown reiterates that adoption can be uniquely fulfilling. \u201cAdoptive parents find they have a deep love for their children that really enhances their lives, despite the challenges,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you are interested, and feel drawn to adopt, just make an enquiry \u2013 it doesn\u2019t commit you to anything.\u201d If you are interested in finding out more about adoption, contact First4Adoption on 0300 222 0022 or visit first4adoption.org.uk/youcanadopt",

Yes, she won the popular vote, but that\u2019s the equivalent of having the crowd on your side in a game, but scoring fewer points than your opponent.

She likes her family near; they meet life\u2019s joys and challenges together.</p> <p>Before the letter came, they were doing pretty well.</p> <p>Then, last September, the Illinois department of human services, or IDHS, sent Dreama a letter claiming she had been overpaid $2,500 in cash assistance and $1,632 in food stamp benefits over a period of 10 months \u2013 in 1988 and 1989.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0b7aaf11ccdfa4b5f22f54650e6171f2b0ba5f4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b7aaf11ccdfa4b5f22f54650e6171f2b0ba5f4a/0_0_1191_791/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zombie debt letters received by case studies.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The agency alleged that Dreama failed to report teenaged Star\u2019s income from a part-time job at Taco Bell, which pushed the household\u2019s income over the earning cap for public assistance, making them ineligible.</p> <p>Every 10 years or so since then, Dreama lost a tax return to service the \u201cdebt\u201d, but she hadn\u2019t heard from IDHS since 2007. Now, the state was looking to recoup the final $1,323 they said the family owed.</p> <p>The household had 60 days to pay up, or they would withhold a portion of Dreama\u2019s social security check \u2013 her only source of income \u2013 until the alleged overpayment was satisfied.</p> <p>There was, however, a problem: in 1988 and 1989, Star wasn\u2019t living with her mom or contributing financially to her household.</p> <p>The \u201coverpayment\u201d was miscalculated. It was never a legitimate debt.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>In the private market, a zombie debt is a debt that is past its statute of limitations, not owed, paid in full, or otherwise contested, yet which has found its way into the hands of a collection agency intent on pursuing payment by any means necessary.</p> <p>Those agencies are known to harass, threaten and trick consumers into paying out-of-date private debts, which they buy for pennies on the dollar. In 1977, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act was passed to protect people against the aggressive tactics collection agencies use \u2013 calling at all hours, contacting employers, deception, publishing debtors\u2019 names \u2013 and to require that creditors prove that a debt is actually owed.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Team 3335, the \u201coverpayment\u201d they\u2019re battling is government debt; they enjoy none of these protections. If private zombie debt is surprisingly easy to kill \u2013 asking a collection agency for proof the debt exists <a href=\"https://www.thisamericanlife.org/532/transcript\">can often make it vanish forever</a> \u2013 government zombie debt is just the opposite, rising like a phoenix from the ashes of the most difficult times in people\u2019s lives, over and over again.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>When Dreama received the letter in September 2018, she almost agreed to pay. In her 70s, beginning to suffer from memory problems, and on a fixed income, the notice frightened and confused her. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand,\u201d she told me. \u201cThey explained it to me, but I still didn\u2019t understand. How do you argue with the government?

Star contacted a Chicago not-for-profit that agreed to provide the family free legal aid. With their support, Dreama filed an appeal against the 1989 household composition error that created the overpayment \u201cdebt\u201d.</p> <p>Dreama\u2019s attorney submitted a number of documents supporting her case, including a signed affidavit from Star\u2019s ex-husband attesting that she was not living with her mother when she was working for Taco Bell. The Illinois department of human services sent a casework manager to testify, but submitted no evidence.</p> <p>The hearing officer found for the state.</p> <p>Hearing officer Sheila King wrote in her decision that because Team 3335 filed their challenge more than 90 days after the \u201cmailing of the first notice of the department\u2019s action\u201d back in 1989, \u201cthe Bureau of Hearings does not have jurisdiction\u201d. She dismissed the appeal, allowing federal debt collection to move forward.</p> <p>If Dreama paid for a vacation with a credit card and then refused to pay, the credit card company would have to sue in order to collect. They would have to serve her with a summons and provide proof that she had received it \u2013 they couldn\u2019t just mail a notice and assume it found its way into her hands. She could demand proof that the debt actually existed and ask to see a record of any payments already made. In Illinois, the credit card company would have 10 years to file a lawsuit to collect the debt, one of the longest statutes of limitations in the country.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How do you argue with the government? How do you prove something from 30 years ago?</p> <footer> <cite>Dreama Richardson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>None of these protections applies to Dreama\u2019s alleged public benefits overpayment. There is no proof she ever received the 1989 notice. The state offered no evidence that her \u201cdebt\u201d was correctly calculated. They insist they can go on trying to collect it forever.</p> <p>To Star, it feels less like lawful debt collection and more like intimidation. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the means to defend yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re big bullies.\u201d</p> <p>It is unclear if a legal mechanism for garnishing Dreama\u2019s social security checks actually exists. But Team 3335 is still nervous. \u201cWe worry about how mom is going to do without her money,\u201d says Star. \u201cIf she wasn\u2019t living with me, I don\u2019t know where she\u2019d be. Without one of us, the whole deck of cards falls.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s robbery,\u201d she says, \u201cfrom our most vulnerable people \u2013 our seniors. And it\u2019s just not right.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Team 3335 is not alone. According to data obtained from the Illinois department of human services through an open records request, the agency sends out an average of 23,000 of these pre-offset notices every year.</p> <p>Though the department denied in 2016 that there\u2019s been any recent push to collect old debts, attempts to recoup are clearly increasing. In 2010, IDHS sent out 7,669 notices that they were referring overpayments to Treasury. In 2017, they sent 32,881.</p> <p>Back in 1996, sweeping changes to the public assistance system shifted how the government views administrative error. Two new acts included provisions that redefined overpayments of any kind \u2013 whether due to agency mistakes, client error or fraudulent misrepresentation \u2013 as debt.</p> <p>The acts expanded state agencies\u2019 power to collect overpayments from future benefits, unemployment compensation and federal pay, pensions or income tax refunds. They also created new collection programs, including the Treasury Offset Program, or Top.</p> <p>The process got a boost when, in the summer of 2008, the Farm Bill lifted the 10-year limit on collecting overpayments. That year, Top collected $3.3bn in federal non-tax debts, more than three and a half times the amount they collected a decade earlier.</p> <p>And then, in December 2010, the Claims Resolution Act passed. This historic piece of legislation settled an unresolved court case in favor of 75,000 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/29/why-have-americas-black-farmers-disappeared\">black farmers unjustly denied agricultural loans</a> in the 1980s and 1990s. Ironically, tucked into its 801st section was a provision to increase the \u201ccollection of past-due, legally enforceable state debts\u201d. It quietly expanded which debts could be referred to Treasury, from <em>only those due to fraud</em> to those resulting from unintentional errors.</p> <p>At the same time, the Affordable Care Act of 2010 required states to consolidate and modernize their public assistance eligibility processes into streamlined, integrated digital systems.</p> <p>The next year, in 2011, attempts by the Illinois department of human services to recoup overpayments rose by 475%. Over the next two years, collections soared. The addition of unemployment to the Top program in 2012 increased returns by $34.9m.</p> <p>Then, in the same year, Illinois signed what would eventually be a $288m contract with the accounting and risk-management firm Deloitte to replace an older automated intake system with the Integrated Eligibility System (IES).</p> <p>IES provides automated eligibility determinations for Medicaid, Snap and cash assistance. When the digital system processes claims, it searches various government and private data sources to verify income, household composition and other eligibility information, allowing the state to identify discrepancies that may be interpreted as overpayments. The state\u2019s own auditors found in 2017 that IDHS \u201cdid not have appropriate controls\u201d over IES: the system wasn\u2019t following established policy, the agency couldn\u2019t locate case files and other necessary documentation, 10-13% of eligibility redeterminations were overdue, and error-prone calculations were resulting in improper payments.</p> <p>And yet, in 2013, Top collected $46.4m in Snap and unemployment debt for the state of Illinois.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>So how do the tens of thousands of people Illinois department of human services accuses of receiving overpayments every year respond? Some, like 75-year-old Tim Pegues, do everything in their power to pay, even if it means skipping meals to try to make good on a debt created by the government\u2019s mistake.</p> <p>Pegues went through a rough patch in the early 2000s after a relationship disintegrated. He ended up unhoused. By the time his eldest daughter found him in Indiana, he had walking pneumonia. Back in Chicago and in the hospital, a social worker helped him apply for cash assistance and food stamps, which stabilized his life. \u201cI was doing good,\u201d he told me in July 2019. \u201cI got a chance to get back on my feet. I got a roof over my head. I\u2019m being a man.

Pegues was relaxing under a poster featuring Malcolm X, Dr Martin Luther King Jr and Nelson Mandela shooting pool. Despite a significant disability \u2013 due to a childhood injury, one of his legs is two and a half inches shorter than the other \u2013 Pegues worked for 30 years as a truck driver and raised four children.</p> <p>On 28 March 2003, he received a letter from IDHS warning he owed the agency a $7,866 overpayment. They openly admitted that the overpayment was their error. \u201cThe agency inadvertently issued you cash benefits you were not eligible to received [sic],\u201d the letter said. Nevertheless, it was Pegues\u2019s responsibility to pay up. If he did not, they threatened to refer his debt to a private collection agency or withhold his tax return.</p> <p>In a panic, Pegues called and set up a payment plan: $5 on the 25th of every month. At that rate, it would take him 131 years to clear the debt. Even this modest payment was a significant loss for him. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t think $5 is a lot of money,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t have it, it\u2019s like a million dollars. It could be a meal: a can of pork and beans, a loaf of bread.\u201d</p> <p>He wrote the check every month for the next 16 years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018You\u2019re just barely swimming, and they hand you a weight\u2019</p> <footer> <cite>Tim Pegues</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Then, he saw Mark Brown\u2019s articles in the Chicago Sun-Times and came to the same conclusion as Star and her family: he wasn\u2019t alone. \u201cCome to find out that there\u2019s maybe hundreds of thousands of people,\u201d he said. \u201cSounds like somebody got their hand in the cookie jar.\u201d An email from Brown to IDHS triggered a review of Pegues\u2019s case at the agency, and a few days later, he received a letter from the Bureau of Collections thanking him for his $5 payment in March 2018 and informing him that it was too late to appeal against the overpayment decision.</p> <p>\u201cYour only recourse,\u201d the letter read, underlining the point for emphasis, \u201cis to provide us with documentation to substantiate that your claims are not past due and/or legally enforceable or present your case to the circuit court.\u201d</p> <p>The letter concluded with a line Pegues interpreted as a veiled threat: \u201cWe will continue to accept your monthly payments. However, the agency will not accept your $5.00 payments as an official payment plan.\u201d He was asked to call the office to \u201cestablish a repayment plan which will fit your financial situation\u201d in order to avoid \u201cfuture involuntary withholds as well as other collection action by the department of human services\u201d. He called a lawyer instead.</p> <p>With the attorney\u2019s support, Pegues decided to stop paying the overpayment bill. He wrote his last check in June 2019. \u201cThe debt is still here,\u201d he told me a few weeks later. \u201cThis\u2019ll be the first month I don\u2019t give them a dime.\u201d I asked him how it felt to not write the check. \u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been worried if they try to take my house away from me.

Each time the agency evaluated his case, they continued granting him benefits. \u201cThey kept on re-evaluating me, but they kept sending me money. Then I got that letter that I owe them $7,500.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re just barely swimming, and they put more water on you. And then they hand you a weight. It\u2019s devastating. I\u2019m 75, about to be 76, and the fights I\u2019ve had wore me down. I\u2019m tired. They keep saying you\u2019re in the golden years, but I ain\u2019t found no gold.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>It\u2019s hard for a reasonable person to see the point in a government agency harassing an elderly man for $5 a month. After the cost of billing and postage, appeals and case management, Illinois is losing money collecting from people like Pegues. That\u2019s why state and federal governments are looking to new economies of scale offered by advances in predictive analytics.</p> <p>Technology companies \u2013 including industry heavyweights such as IBM, Oracle and Lexis Nexis \u2013 promise to use machine learning and artificial intelligence to change the fraud detection paradigm. In general, safety net programs operate on a \u201cpay and audit\u201d system, releasing benefits and then ferreting out the ineligible or dishonest with frequent interviews and recertifications.</p> <p>The new systems promise instead to predict fraud <em>before</em> payment occurs.</p> <p>For example, Pondera Solutions, a company based in Fulton, California, says it can search massive public and private databases, comb through social media and use proprietary (and secret) predictive models to rank every single applicant to a government program \u201cbased on their risk for fraud\u201d.</p> <p>In Illinois, increases in government zombie debt recoupment follow technological shifts as well as policy changes. After the 2013 peak in collections, returns declined: Top collected $133.3m that year, but only $101.2m in 2017. But collections began to increase again in 2018, after IDHS rolled out a major technology enhancement to the Integrated Eligibility System in October 2017.</p> <p>For applicants, the upgrade has been plagued with problems. Tens of thousands of families didn\u2019t receive their Snap benefits during that holiday season. By June 2018, the system had a backlog of 15,000 nursing home residents waiting for Medicaid eligibility decisions.</p> <p>While digital eligibility is a nightmare for public assistance applicants, it has been great at chasing down dormant debts.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Andrew Dorliae, 44, lives in north-west Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in a neighborhood full of window tinting shops and Mexican restaurants. On his door is a sign that reads: \u201cTrust in the Lord with all your heart.\u201d</p> <p>Before starting a home tax preparation business, Dorliae, a Liberian immigrant, was employed by Whirlpool Corporation, working his way up from assembler on a production line making refrigerators to inspector first class. In 2017, he took a $5-an-hour pay cut, from $21.43 to $17.40, to secure a weekend shift \u2013 5am to 5pm every Friday, Saturday and Sunday \u2013 that allowed him to be at home with his children at night and to go to school during the week.</p> <p>But in early 2018, Whirlpool closed the weekend shift. The company offered him a five-day-a-week overnight shift instead: midnight to 7am, Monday through Friday. Dorliae told his employer of more than six years that there was no way he could fill this shift: his wife also worked overnights and his daughter had a health condition requiring night-time care.</p> <p>In March, he received notice from Whirlpool: he had been terminated. He applied for unemployment insurance benefits with Iowa workforce development (IWD) on 5 April, was found eligible, and received $490 each week in May. Then, Whirlpool challenged Dorliae\u2019s initial unemployment eligibility, contesting their responsibility to pay a portion of his benefits. On 11 June, IWD conducted a fact-finding investigation that reversed the earlier eligibility decision, finding that Dorliae voluntarily left Whirlpool \u201cwithout good cause attributable to the employer\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/14/automating-poverty-algorithms-punish-poor\">Digital dystopia: how algorithms punish the poor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In an instant, Dorliae was found ineligible for benefits he had already<em> </em>received.</p> <p>In the end, Dorliae won his battle with Iowa workforce development and his \u201cdebt\u201d was not referred to Treasury. \u201cI appealed every decision they made,\u201d he told me, gesturing towards an inch-high stack of correspondence sitting on the desk in his tiny home office, a meticulous record of his battle with the agency.</p> <p>He firmly denies that he quit his job at Whirlpool. \u201cThey offered me a shift which I could not do,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t quit. My job let me down after all these years. You must survive until you get back on your feet. That\u2019s what unemployment is for.\u201d</p> <p>Dorliae understands IWD\u2019s need to investigate applicants and pursue those who might take advantage of the system. But he is puzzled why the burden of proof that they do <em>not</em> owe Iowa an overpayment debt should fall entirely on applicants, who have no right to free legal representation and must navigate a confusing appeal system alone.</p> <p>\u201cI applied for unemployment. You give it to me,\u201d he explained. \u201cThen, after the fact-finding, you tell me I owe. It doesn\u2019t seem fair.\u201d Giving back money you\u2019ve already spent can be impossible for families with few financial reserves. Many low-income families plan their whole financial year around a tax refund. Losing it means not being able to fix the used car that gets you to work, no investment in education for the kids, not fixing the leaky roof or broken hot water heater. It is as if the agency is trying to take food back out of your children\u2019s mouths, or, as Dorliae put it: \u201cYou owe what you have eaten.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is so demeaning</p> <footer> <cite>Andrew Dorliae</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Reflecting on his experience, Dorliae said, \u201cAmerica is a good place. There is justice here.\u201d But when I asked him if he would apply for unemployment again, he balked. \u201cWhen they [investigate] you, you feel fear. It becomes very intimidating \u2026 I would be hesitant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is so demeaning.\u201d</p> <p>Despite Dorliae\u2019s faith in the process, these are extraordinarily complex proceedings. His case was actually <em>four</em> cases occurring simultaneously. Dorliae had to keep track of each administrative law proceeding; meet deadlines for timely appeal; provide evidence of school schedules, commute times, medical conditions and communication with his employer; and attend near-constant telephone hearings. All for unemployment benefits totaling less than $3,000.</p> <p>Dorliae is a paradigmatic tax professional: organized, detail-oriented, smart and confident in his ability to navigate mazes of legal and bureaucratic red tape. He did everything right, and he prevailed. But he is the exception and not the rule. Others I spoke to, like Kevin Christopherson of St Donatus, grew so frustrated and fearful that they just gave up.</p> <p>Like Dorliae, Christopherson originally received unemployment benefits. An initial fact-finding confirmed his eligibility. Then his employer appealed and IWD reversed the eligibility decision. To Christopherson, launching another appeal seemed like an insurmountable hurdle. \u201cIt just seemed like they were all against me,\u201d he told me in July 2019. \u201cMy mental state was really eating away at me. So I just forget about it.\u201d Now he owes the state an \u201coverpayment\u201d of $2,275.</p> <p>According to information gathered through an open records request, Iowa workforce development is currently using software provided by Lexis Nexis and Pondera to identify and pursue debts like Kevin Christopherson\u2019s. For example, in late 2018, IWD ran the Pondera software to identify potential overpayments, and in October and November, sent out 20,000 \u201cintent to offset\u201d notices threatening to turn the debt over to Treasury for collection. Troublingly, in its contract with Iowa workforce development, Pondera characterizes \u201cimproper payments\u201d, like Christopherson\u2019s , as fraud.</p> <p>The license for the Pondera software costs the Iowa workforce development $697,833.33 a year. Pondera also has claimed sizeable contracts in California, Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, and reported in 2016 that it had doubled its revenues several years in a row.<br></p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Andrew Dorliae fought the system and won. But was it a fair fight? Think of Team 3335. Imagine Dreama without her daughter\u2019s help. Even with Star and an attorney in her corner, the possibility of Dreama\u2019s social security check being garnished still looms. And what about Tim, who fears that any day they could come for his home?</p> <p>For poor and working-class families, the financial burden of government zombie debt is potentially life-shattering. \u201cIf we want to stop evictions, we need to start paying attention to debt recoupment,\u201d Alex Kornya, litigation director and general counsel at Iowa Legal Aid, told me. \u201cThe types of debts that tend to be the cause of evictions \u2013 perhaps more often than private consumer debts \u2013 are government debts, because the government can do more to you. They can cut more deeply into the reserves that you have to have to be self-sufficient.\u201d</p> <p>Representatives from the Department of Treasury and Iowa workforce development insist that the decision to enforce delinquent debt collection is a statutory mandate. \u201cOnce an agency certifies a debt,\u201d a spokesperson from the Department of Treasury\u2019s Bureau of the Fiscal Service wrote in an 11 October email, \u201cthe Fiscal Service is required by law to collect it.\u201d Nicholas Olivencia, legal council for Iowa workforce development, wrote that \u201cIWD, as well as every state, is required under Federal law to participate and enforce the Treasury Offset Program\u201d. The Illinois department of human services did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Neither IDHS nor IWD has chosen to create policy that would allow forbearance or inform the public that the option exists</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But agencies have more options than Olivencia suggests. The federal rules allow them to waive offset collection where it would cause economic distress. In fact, New Hampshire has done just this \u2013 in 2013, the state added a procedure to their administrative code so that individuals can request forbearance if a proposed tax refund offset will cause extreme financial hardship.</p> <p>This option is open to all the states. \u201cAn individual may contact the agency if they believe the debt collection activity will cause financial hardship,\u201d the Fiscal Service spokesperson wrote. \u201cThe agency may be able to compromise the debt or reduce the amount that can be offset.\u201d But neither IDHS nor IWD has chosen to create policy that would allow forbearance or inform the public that the option exists. \u201c[The agencies] made a conscious policy decision not to create a hardship waiver,\u201d says Alex Kornya.</p> <p>Perhaps it is hyperbolic to call the process of turning overpayments into debts extortion. And yet, the processes show disquieting parallels. As historian Joseph Bonica <a href=\"http://www.lawcrimehistory.org/journal/Vol.3%20issue2%202013/bonica%20extortion.pdf\">points out</a>, the defining characteristic of extortion is the fear it produces, a terror so intense that victims feel compelled to give money \u201cin exchange for emotional relief\u201d. As he notes, this kind of rule by fear is simply despotism.</p> <p>The fear that predatory debt collection produces is especially acute when the creditor is the government. It\u2019s easy to feel like there is no remedy, no refuge, no neutral third party to whom you can appeal. That fear is amplified when your accuser is faceless and invisible, a few lines of computer code or a robot voice on the phone. Government zombie debt shifts responsibility for correcting systemic administrative incompetence on to the shoulders of our country\u2019s most vulnerable people.</p> <p>A people who feel preyed upon by government will not trust government. Those burned by predatory government debt collection will hesitate to use public services again, even when they are eligible and need agency resources to stay safe and healthy. This is not a negligible revenue gain; it is a debt we are accruing against our greatest national wealth, our people. And it is fast compounding interest.</p> <p><em>This article was supported by the <a href=\"http://economichardship.org/\">Economic Hardship Reporting Project</a>.</em></p> <p><em>If you have been targeted for government zombie debt collection, or you have other information about it, tell your story via secure email to: virginiaeubanks@protonmail.com</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "This is what happens when the government targets you for zombie debt collection. You receive a letter from your state\u2019s department of human services claiming that you were \u201coverissued\u201d $4,132 in food stamp and cash benefits in the 1980s. Enclosed is a copy of the original overpayment notice they say they sent you when you were still listening to Madonna and Bobby Brown. You don\u2019t remember ever seeing it before. The letter informs you that, since you didn\u2019t respond immediately three decades ago, your 90-day window to request a fair hearing and contest the overpayment has closed. You now have a debt, and it\u2019s past due. The state threatens to refer this debt to the United States Department of Treasury, which has the power to withhold your federal tax return, your earned income tax credit, a portion of your military retirement pay \u2013 even your social security disability check. You are barely making ends meet, so the financial loss might mean doing without meals, a utilities shutoff, or skimping on medication. If they can\u2019t get the money from you, they will withhold your adult children\u2019s tax returns. You read this correctly: the federal government will take your children\u2019s money to resolve a 30-year-old alleged public benefits overpayment. You have few options if you want to avoid this: you can pay the whole balance immediately, set up a monthly payment plan, or request an administrative review. But the process is impossibly Kafkaesque: you have to send evidence that you don\u2019t owe the debt, so you\u2019ll need to find three-decade-old pay stubs and household expense receipts. And who can do that? If you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll eventually argue your case in front of an administrative law judge. But she\u2019ll work for the very agency that sent you the letter. You have no right to free legal representation, so if you can\u2019t find a legal aid or pro bono lawyer, you\u2019re entirely on your own. With quiet but devastating regularity, zombie debt notices are arriving at the homes of tens of thousands across the US \u2013 courtesy of the government and with the assistance of heavyweight tech companies. The Guardian can reveal that predatory policy changes, turbocharged by digital innovations, are producing a wave of aggressive debt collection that stretches back decades and targets the nation\u2019s most vulnerable. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Last year, Team 3335 found out about government zombie debt first-hand. The family calls themselves \u201cTeam 3335\u201d because that\u2019s the address of the brick-faced single-family home in Steger, Illinois, that shelters three generations: 50-year-old Star Kaminski, her three children and the family\u2019s matriarch, 72-year-old Dreama Richardson. When Dreama began to need more help with day-to-day chores, she and her daughter bought this modest place together, not far away from the public middle school where Star works as a librarian. It\u2019s a little crowded, but Star sees that as a gift, not a sacrifice. She likes her family near; they meet life\u2019s joys and challenges together. Before the letter came, they were doing pretty well. Then, last September, the Illinois department of human services, or IDHS, sent Dreama a letter claiming she had been overpaid $2,500 in cash assistance and $1,632 in food stamp benefits over a period of 10 months \u2013 in 1988 and 1989. The agency alleged that Dreama failed to report teenaged Star\u2019s income from a part-time job at Taco Bell, which pushed the household\u2019s income over the earning cap for public assistance, making them ineligible. Every 10 years or so since then, Dreama lost a tax return to service the \u201cdebt\u201d, but she hadn\u2019t heard from IDHS since 2007. Now, the state was looking to recoup the final $1,323 they said the family owed. The household had 60 days to pay up, or they would withhold a portion of Dreama\u2019s social security check \u2013 her only source of income \u2013 until the alleged overpayment was satisfied. There was, however, a problem: in 1988 and 1989, Star wasn\u2019t living with her mom or contributing financially to her household. The \u201coverpayment\u201d was miscalculated. It was never a legitimate debt. \u2022\u2022\u2022 In the private market, a zombie debt is a debt that is past its statute of limitations, not owed, paid in full, or otherwise contested, yet which has found its way into the hands of a collection agency intent on pursuing payment by any means necessary. Those agencies are known to harass, threaten and trick consumers into paying out-of-date private debts, which they buy for pennies on the dollar. In 1977, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act was passed to protect people against the aggressive tactics collection agencies use \u2013 calling at all hours, contacting employers, deception, publishing debtors\u2019 names \u2013 and to require that creditors prove that a debt is actually owed. Unfortunately for Team 3335, the \u201coverpayment\u201d they\u2019re battling is government debt; they enjoy none of these protections. If private zombie debt is surprisingly easy to kill \u2013 asking a collection agency for proof the debt exists can often make it vanish forever \u2013 government zombie debt is just the opposite, rising like a phoenix from the ashes of the most difficult times in people\u2019s lives, over and over again. \u2022\u2022\u2022 When Dreama received the letter in September 2018, she almost agreed to pay. In her 70s, beginning to suffer from memory problems, and on a fixed income, the notice frightened and confused her. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand,\u201d she told me. \u201cThey explained it to me, but I still didn\u2019t understand. How do you argue with the government? How do you prove something from 30 years ago?\u201d Written in her spidery handwriting in the margins of the September 2018 invoice for $1,323.18 is a repayment plan suggested by an IDHS representative: \u201cDue 15th of month,\u201d it reads, \u201c$25.00.\u201d Before she wrote her first check, one of Star\u2019s daughters found a handful of articles written by Mark Brown for the Chicago Sun-Times describing other women in their 70s and 80s receiving notices about long-overdue public assistance overpayments. Star contacted a Chicago not-for-profit that agreed to provide the family free legal aid. With their support, Dreama filed an appeal against the 1989 household composition error that created the overpayment \u201cdebt\u201d. Dreama\u2019s attorney submitted a number of documents supporting her case, including a signed affidavit from Star\u2019s ex-husband attesting that she was not living with her mother when she was working for Taco Bell. The Illinois department of human services sent a casework manager to testify, but submitted no evidence. The hearing officer found for the state. Hearing officer Sheila King wrote in her decision that because Team 3335 filed their challenge more than 90 days after the \u201cmailing of the first notice of the department\u2019s action\u201d back in 1989, \u201cthe Bureau of Hearings does not have jurisdiction\u201d. She dismissed the appeal, allowing federal debt collection to move forward. If Dreama paid for a vacation with a credit card and then refused to pay, the credit card company would have to sue in order to collect. They would have to serve her with a summons and provide proof that she had received it \u2013 they couldn\u2019t just mail a notice and assume it found its way into her hands. She could demand proof that the debt actually existed and ask to see a record of any payments already made. In Illinois, the credit card company would have 10 years to file a lawsuit to collect the debt, one of the longest statutes of limitations in the country. None of these protections applies to Dreama\u2019s alleged public benefits overpayment. There is no proof she ever received the 1989 notice. The state offered no evidence that her \u201cdebt\u201d was correctly calculated. They insist they can go on trying to collect it forever. To Star, it feels less like lawful debt collection and more like intimidation. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the means to defend yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re big bullies.\u201d It is unclear if a legal mechanism for garnishing Dreama\u2019s social security checks actually exists. But Team 3335 is still nervous. \u201cWe worry about how mom is going to do without her money,\u201d says Star. \u201cIf she wasn\u2019t living with me, I don\u2019t know where she\u2019d be. Without one of us, the whole deck of cards falls.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s robbery,\u201d she says, \u201cfrom our most vulnerable people \u2013 our seniors. And it\u2019s just not right.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 Team 3335 is not alone. According to data obtained from the Illinois department of human services through an open records request, the agency sends out an average of 23,000 of these pre-offset notices every year. Though the department denied in 2016 that there\u2019s been any recent push to collect old debts, attempts to recoup are clearly increasing. In 2010, IDHS sent out 7,669 notices that they were referring overpayments to Treasury. In 2017, they sent 32,881. Back in 1996, sweeping changes to the public assistance system shifted how the government views administrative error. Two new acts included provisions that redefined overpayments of any kind \u2013 whether due to agency mistakes, client error or fraudulent misrepresentation \u2013 as debt. The acts expanded state agencies\u2019 power to collect overpayments from future benefits, unemployment compensation and federal pay, pensions or income tax refunds. They also created new collection programs, including the Treasury Offset Program, or Top. The process got a boost when, in the summer of 2008, the Farm Bill lifted the 10-year limit on collecting overpayments. That year, Top collected $3.3bn in federal non-tax debts, more than three and a half times the amount they collected a decade earlier. And then, in December 2010, the Claims Resolution Act passed. This historic piece of legislation settled an unresolved court case in favor of 75,000 black farmers unjustly denied agricultural loans in the 1980s and 1990s. Ironically, tucked into its 801st section was a provision to increase the \u201ccollection of past-due, legally enforceable state debts\u201d. It quietly expanded which debts could be referred to Treasury, from only those due to fraud to those resulting from unintentional errors. At the same time, the Affordable Care Act of 2010 required states to consolidate and modernize their public assistance eligibility processes into streamlined, integrated digital systems. The next year, in 2011, attempts by the Illinois department of human services to recoup overpayments rose by 475%. Over the next two years, collections soared. The addition of unemployment to the Top program in 2012 increased returns by $34.9m. Then, in the same year, Illinois signed what would eventually be a $288m contract with the accounting and risk-management firm Deloitte to replace an older automated intake system with the Integrated Eligibility System (IES). IES provides automated eligibility determinations for Medicaid, Snap and cash assistance. When the digital system processes claims, it searches various government and private data sources to verify income, household composition and other eligibility information, allowing the state to identify discrepancies that may be interpreted as overpayments. The state\u2019s own auditors found in 2017 that IDHS \u201cdid not have appropriate controls\u201d over IES: the system wasn\u2019t following established policy, the agency couldn\u2019t locate case files and other necessary documentation, 10-13% of eligibility redeterminations were overdue, and error-prone calculations were resulting in improper payments. And yet, in 2013, Top collected $46.4m in Snap and unemployment debt for the state of Illinois. \u2022\u2022\u2022 So how do the tens of thousands of people Illinois department of human services accuses of receiving overpayments every year respond? Some, like 75-year-old Tim Pegues, do everything in their power to pay, even if it means skipping meals to try to make good on a debt created by the government\u2019s mistake. Pegues went through a rough patch in the early 2000s after a relationship disintegrated. He ended up unhoused. By the time his eldest daughter found him in Indiana, he had walking pneumonia. Back in Chicago and in the hospital, a social worker helped him apply for cash assistance and food stamps, which stabilized his life. \u201cI was doing good,\u201d he told me in July 2019. \u201cI got a chance to get back on my feet. I got a roof over my head. I\u2019m being a man. That\u2019s when I got the letter.\u201d We sat together on red couches in the basement of his small, cheerful house on the South Side of Chicago. Pegues was relaxing under a poster featuring Malcolm X, Dr Martin Luther King Jr and Nelson Mandela shooting pool. Despite a significant disability \u2013 due to a childhood injury, one of his legs is two and a half inches shorter than the other \u2013 Pegues worked for 30 years as a truck driver and raised four children. On 28 March 2003, he received a letter from IDHS warning he owed the agency a $7,866 overpayment. They openly admitted that the overpayment was their error. \u201cThe agency inadvertently issued you cash benefits you were not eligible to received [sic],\u201d the letter said. Nevertheless, it was Pegues\u2019s responsibility to pay up. If he did not, they threatened to refer his debt to a private collection agency or withhold his tax return. In a panic, Pegues called and set up a payment plan: $5 on the 25th of every month. At that rate, it would take him 131 years to clear the debt. Even this modest payment was a significant loss for him. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t think $5 is a lot of money,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t have it, it\u2019s like a million dollars. It could be a meal: a can of pork and beans, a loaf of bread.\u201d He wrote the check every month for the next 16 years. Then, he saw Mark Brown\u2019s articles in the Chicago Sun-Times and came to the same conclusion as Star and her family: he wasn\u2019t alone. \u201cCome to find out that there\u2019s maybe hundreds of thousands of people,\u201d he said. \u201cSounds like somebody got their hand in the cookie jar.\u201d An email from Brown to IDHS triggered a review of Pegues\u2019s case at the agency, and a few days later, he received a letter from the Bureau of Collections thanking him for his $5 payment in March 2018 and informing him that it was too late to appeal against the overpayment decision. \u201cYour only recourse,\u201d the letter read, underlining the point for emphasis, \u201cis to provide us with documentation to substantiate that your claims are not past due and/or legally enforceable or present your case to the circuit court.\u201d The letter concluded with a line Pegues interpreted as a veiled threat: \u201cWe will continue to accept your monthly payments. However, the agency will not accept your $5.00 payments as an official payment plan.\u201d He was asked to call the office to \u201cestablish a repayment plan which will fit your financial situation\u201d in order to avoid \u201cfuture involuntary withholds as well as other collection action by the department of human services\u201d. He called a lawyer instead. With the attorney\u2019s support, Pegues decided to stop paying the overpayment bill. He wrote his last check in June 2019. \u201cThe debt is still here,\u201d he told me a few weeks later. \u201cThis\u2019ll be the first month I don\u2019t give them a dime.\u201d I asked him how it felt to not write the check. \u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been worried if they try to take my house away from me. I\u2019m taking a chance, gambling. There\u2019s a possibility that I could lose everything. It would be a shame for something I didn\u2019t do.\u201d This is what puzzles Pegues most \u2013 why is he being held responsible for paying back an overpayment that the state admits is their fault? \u201cThe thing that I find is funny is that they told me what I was getting,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t pick it.\u201d He had to be recertified as eligible to continue receiving benefits every six months. Each time the agency evaluated his case, they continued granting him benefits. \u201cThey kept on re-evaluating me, but they kept sending me money. Then I got that letter that I owe them $7,500.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re just barely swimming, and they put more water on you. And then they hand you a weight. It\u2019s devastating. I\u2019m 75, about to be 76, and the fights I\u2019ve had wore me down. I\u2019m tired. They keep saying you\u2019re in the golden years, but I ain\u2019t found no gold.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 It\u2019s hard for a reasonable person to see the point in a government agency harassing an elderly man for $5 a month. After the cost of billing and postage, appeals and case management, Illinois is losing money collecting from people like Pegues. That\u2019s why state and federal governments are looking to new economies of scale offered by advances in predictive analytics. Technology companies \u2013 including industry heavyweights such as IBM, Oracle and Lexis Nexis \u2013 promise to use machine learning and artificial intelligence to change the fraud detection paradigm. In general, safety net programs operate on a \u201cpay and audit\u201d system, releasing benefits and then ferreting out the ineligible or dishonest with frequent interviews and recertifications. The new systems promise instead to predict fraud before payment occurs. For example, Pondera Solutions, a company based in Fulton, California, says it can search massive public and private databases, comb through social media and use proprietary (and secret) predictive models to rank every single applicant to a government program \u201cbased on their risk for fraud\u201d. In Illinois, increases in government zombie debt recoupment follow technological shifts as well as policy changes. After the 2013 peak in collections, returns declined: Top collected $133.3m that year, but only $101.2m in 2017. But collections began to increase again in 2018, after IDHS rolled out a major technology enhancement to the Integrated Eligibility System in October 2017. For applicants, the upgrade has been plagued with problems. Tens of thousands of families didn\u2019t receive their Snap benefits during that holiday season. By June 2018, the system had a backlog of 15,000 nursing home residents waiting for Medicaid eligibility decisions. While digital eligibility is a nightmare for public assistance applicants, it has been great at chasing down dormant debts. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Andrew Dorliae, 44, lives in north-west Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in a neighborhood full of window tinting shops and Mexican restaurants. On his door is a sign that reads: \u201cTrust in the Lord with all your heart.\u201d Before starting a home tax preparation business, Dorliae, a Liberian immigrant, was employed by Whirlpool Corporation, working his way up from assembler on a production line making refrigerators to inspector first class. In 2017, he took a $5-an-hour pay cut, from $21.43 to $17.40, to secure a weekend shift \u2013 5am to 5pm every Friday, Saturday and Sunday \u2013 that allowed him to be at home with his children at night and to go to school during the week. But in early 2018, Whirlpool closed the weekend shift. The company offered him a five-day-a-week overnight shift instead: midnight to 7am, Monday through Friday. Dorliae told his employer of more than six years that there was no way he could fill this shift: his wife also worked overnights and his daughter had a health condition requiring night-time care. In March, he received notice from Whirlpool: he had been terminated. He applied for unemployment insurance benefits with Iowa workforce development (IWD) on 5 April, was found eligible, and received $490 each week in May. Then, Whirlpool challenged Dorliae\u2019s initial unemployment eligibility, contesting their responsibility to pay a portion of his benefits. On 11 June, IWD conducted a fact-finding investigation that reversed the earlier eligibility decision, finding that Dorliae voluntarily left Whirlpool \u201cwithout good cause attributable to the employer\u201d. In an instant, Dorliae was found ineligible for benefits he had already received. In the end, Dorliae won his battle with Iowa workforce development and his \u201cdebt\u201d was not referred to Treasury. \u201cI appealed every decision they made,\u201d he told me, gesturing towards an inch-high stack of correspondence sitting on the desk in his tiny home office, a meticulous record of his battle with the agency. He firmly denies that he quit his job at Whirlpool. \u201cThey offered me a shift which I could not do,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t quit. My job let me down after all these years. You must survive until you get back on your feet. That\u2019s what unemployment is for.\u201d Dorliae understands IWD\u2019s need to investigate applicants and pursue those who might take advantage of the system. But he is puzzled why the burden of proof that they do not owe Iowa an overpayment debt should fall entirely on applicants, who have no right to free legal representation and must navigate a confusing appeal system alone. \u201cI applied for unemployment. You give it to me,\u201d he explained. \u201cThen, after the fact-finding, you tell me I owe. It doesn\u2019t seem fair.\u201d Giving back money you\u2019ve already spent can be impossible for families with few financial reserves. Many low-income families plan their whole financial year around a tax refund. Losing it means not being able to fix the used car that gets you to work, no investment in education for the kids, not fixing the leaky roof or broken hot water heater. It is as if the agency is trying to take food back out of your children\u2019s mouths, or, as Dorliae put it: \u201cYou owe what you have eaten.\u201d Reflecting on his experience, Dorliae said, \u201cAmerica is a good place. There is justice here.\u201d But when I asked him if he would apply for unemployment again, he balked. \u201cWhen they [investigate] you, you feel fear. It becomes very intimidating \u2026 I would be hesitant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is so demeaning.\u201d Despite Dorliae\u2019s faith in the process, these are extraordinarily complex proceedings. His case was actually four cases occurring simultaneously. Dorliae had to keep track of each administrative law proceeding; meet deadlines for timely appeal; provide evidence of school schedules, commute times, medical conditions and communication with his employer; and attend near-constant telephone hearings. All for unemployment benefits totaling less than $3,000. Dorliae is a paradigmatic tax professional: organized, detail-oriented, smart and confident in his ability to navigate mazes of legal and bureaucratic red tape. He did everything right, and he prevailed. But he is the exception and not the rule. Others I spoke to, like Kevin Christopherson of St Donatus, grew so frustrated and fearful that they just gave up. Like Dorliae, Christopherson originally received unemployment benefits. An initial fact-finding confirmed his eligibility. Then his employer appealed and IWD reversed the eligibility decision. To Christopherson, launching another appeal seemed like an insurmountable hurdle. \u201cIt just seemed like they were all against me,\u201d he told me in July 2019. \u201cMy mental state was really eating away at me. So I just forget about it.\u201d Now he owes the state an \u201coverpayment\u201d of $2,275. According to information gathered through an open records request, Iowa workforce development is currently using software provided by Lexis Nexis and Pondera to identify and pursue debts like Kevin Christopherson\u2019s. For example, in late 2018, IWD ran the Pondera software to identify potential overpayments, and in October and November, sent out 20,000 \u201cintent to offset\u201d notices threatening to turn the debt over to Treasury for collection. Troublingly, in its contract with Iowa workforce development, Pondera characterizes \u201cimproper payments\u201d, like Christopherson\u2019s , as fraud. The license for the Pondera software costs the Iowa workforce development $697,833.33 a year. Pondera also has claimed sizeable contracts in California, Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, and reported in 2016 that it had doubled its revenues several years in a row. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Andrew Dorliae fought the system and won. But was it a fair fight? Think of Team 3335. Imagine Dreama without her daughter\u2019s help. Even with Star and an attorney in her corner, the possibility of Dreama\u2019s social security check being garnished still looms. And what about Tim, who fears that any day they could come for his home? For poor and working-class families, the financial burden of government zombie debt is potentially life-shattering. \u201cIf we want to stop evictions, we need to start paying attention to debt recoupment,\u201d Alex Kornya, litigation director and general counsel at Iowa Legal Aid, told me. \u201cThe types of debts that tend to be the cause of evictions \u2013 perhaps more often than private consumer debts \u2013 are government debts, because the government can do more to you. They can cut more deeply into the reserves that you have to have to be self-sufficient.\u201d Representatives from the Department of Treasury and Iowa workforce development insist that the decision to enforce delinquent debt collection is a statutory mandate. \u201cOnce an agency certifies a debt,\u201d a spokesperson from the Department of Treasury\u2019s Bureau of the Fiscal Service wrote in an 11 October email, \u201cthe Fiscal Service is required by law to collect it.\u201d Nicholas Olivencia, legal council for Iowa workforce development, wrote that \u201cIWD, as well as every state, is required under Federal law to participate and enforce the Treasury Offset Program\u201d. The Illinois department of human services did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But agencies have more options than Olivencia suggests. The federal rules allow them to waive offset collection where it would cause economic distress. In fact, New Hampshire has done just this \u2013 in 2013, the state added a procedure to their administrative code so that individuals can request forbearance if a proposed tax refund offset will cause extreme financial hardship. This option is open to all the states. \u201cAn individual may contact the agency if they believe the debt collection activity will cause financial hardship,\u201d the Fiscal Service spokesperson wrote. \u201cThe agency may be able to compromise the debt or reduce the amount that can be offset.\u201d But neither IDHS nor IWD has chosen to create policy that would allow forbearance or inform the public that the option exists. \u201c[The agencies] made a conscious policy decision not to create a hardship waiver,\u201d says Alex Kornya. Perhaps it is hyperbolic to call the process of turning overpayments into debts extortion. And yet, the processes show disquieting parallels. As historian Joseph Bonica points out, the defining characteristic of extortion is the fear it produces, a terror so intense that victims feel compelled to give money \u201cin exchange for emotional relief\u201d. As he notes, this kind of rule by fear is simply despotism. The fear that predatory debt collection produces is especially acute when the creditor is the government. It\u2019s easy to feel like there is no remedy, no refuge, no neutral third party to whom you can appeal. That fear is amplified when your accuser is faceless and invisible, a few lines of computer code or a robot voice on the phone. Government zombie debt shifts responsibility for correcting systemic administrative incompetence on to the shoulders of our country\u2019s most vulnerable people. A people who feel preyed upon by government will not trust government. Those burned by predatory government debt collection will hesitate to use public services again, even when they are eligible and need agency resources to stay safe and healthy. This is not a negligible revenue gain; it is a debt we are accruing against our greatest national wealth, our people. And it is fast compounding interest.

From the moment the first reports of Neymar wanting to leave appeared, to the moment he did not return for the first day of pre-season to finally playing his first club game of the season on 14 September, the story was always about the Brazilian rather than the team.</p> <p>Not that Tuchel was surprised. He knows what it entails being manager of PSG and is not complaining. The Neymar saga may have overshadowed the start of the season but PSG are top of Ligue 1 by two points and lead their Champions League group after two wins in two games, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/18/paris-saint-germain-real-madrid-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">including a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/18/paris-saint-germain-real-madrid-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">3-0 victory over Real Madrid</a>.

It\u2019s their right to express themselves,\u201d he says as we sit down for our interview as part of my work for beIN Sports France. \u201cThey\u2019re proud of their club and it\u2019s not so nice when you hear your player talking for weeks and weeks saying he wants to leave. As I told Neymar, sometimes it\u2019s like this in life \u2013 you have to face the truth and deal with the consequences.\u201d</p> <p>Once the transfer window closed with Neymar still at PSG, the manager\u2019s job was to reintegrate and remotivate a player for whom he has great affection. \u201cNeymar has a good heart,\u201d Tuchel says. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s a bit hard to see that he is a nice person when you only watch him play from outside. But he is, he\u2019s a nice guy.</p> <p>\u201cI told him: \u2018You think the hardest part is over but from now on you have to deal with me and I\u2019m going to push you hard. So the hardest thing is still to come for you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Tuchel\u2019s pushing seems to be working. Neymar has scored winning goals for PSG against Strasbourg and Lyon, with further strikes against Bordeaux and Angers, although he was ruled out for four weeks with a hamstring injury on Monday. Bigger tests await for Tuchel, with the Champions League last 16 looming in February as a make-or-break moment once again for a PSG manager. I ask him how he measures success at a club such as his. Is it simply a question of points or is there something more to it?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25160e7af5fd0a62918da0d755c85de21215ddab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25160e7af5fd0a62918da0d755c85de21215ddab/0_143_3224_1935/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomas Tuchel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomas Tuchel replaced Jurgen Klopp at Borussia Dortmund before moving to PSG in May 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TF-Images/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI have no clear definition,\u201d he says. \u201cPoints count, definitely, titles count if you go to a club like PSG, that\u2019s the way it is. But there\u2019s also the relationships with the players, the connection with the players, sometimes helping a player through a difficult period in his career. That\u2019s also success, no? Hopefully I don\u2019t depend too much on the points and the titles because the possibility that you get sad or that you don\u2019t fulfil your own goals is too high. There\u2019s more to life than points and trophies but we\u2019re all very competitive and we all want to win every game.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes you work hard helping players through tough times and you work hard in building a team and creating connections and then you see your team work so well together in a really tight match and you think, \u2018Wow, what a great job we did over the past however many weeks.\u2019 But nobody out there knows what you\u2019ve really achieved. All the little things you achieve every day are like little rewards for me. From the outside it\u2019s all much simpler and it\u2019s just about winning.\u201d</p> <p>The German arrived at PSG in 2018 after two seasons at Borussia Dortmund followed by a year\u2019s sabbatical. In the French capital he has won the league but that is expected at a club who have Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Neymar and Edinson Cavani in the forward line. Tuchel has a remarkable squad at his disposal but when asked whether he has ever experienced a perfect game, he says: \u201cNever had one, never been close and still on the hunt. Still looking for one and still loving the training and still looking for the perfect training session, too. I like to think we get closer and closer all the time.</p> <p>\u201cYou have these periods where you really think, \u2018Yes, this is it\u2019 but the tension is so high in these games that you cannot fully enjoy it. Football is a game where lots of mistakes happen and the ability to deal with the mistakes is also a quality. You have to accept as a coach that there will not be a perfect game. It is sad, of course. It\u2019s a bit like <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sisyphus\" title=\"\">Sisyphus</a>, isn\u2019t it? You never quite get there.</p> <p>\u201cYou have amazing feelings and you love this job because you see so many good things.

      "bodyText": "It turned out to be an interesting summer for Thomas Tuchel but perhaps not in the way he would have wanted. Rather than being able to focus solely on how to improve on a debut season that brought a French league title, a cup final and an infuriating last-16 exit to Manchester United in the Champions League, the Paris Saint-Germain manager was fielding questions about the future of Neymar. On and on it went. From the moment the first reports of Neymar wanting to leave appeared, to the moment he did not return for the first day of pre-season to finally playing his first club game of the season on 14 September, the story was always about the Brazilian rather than the team. Not that Tuchel was surprised. He knows what it entails being manager of PSG and is not complaining. The Neymar saga may have overshadowed the start of the season but PSG are top of Ligue 1 by two points and lead their Champions League group after two wins in two games, including a 3-0 victory over Real Madrid. Tuchel can be happy when they are 11 games into the season and there are signs the relationship between Neymar and the fans is slowly healing. \u201cThe supporters have expressed their opinions and I can understand them, absolutely. It\u2019s their right to express themselves,\u201d he says as we sit down for our interview as part of my work for beIN Sports France. \u201cThey\u2019re proud of their club and it\u2019s not so nice when you hear your player talking for weeks and weeks saying he wants to leave. As I told Neymar, sometimes it\u2019s like this in life \u2013 you have to face the truth and deal with the consequences.\u201d Once the transfer window closed with Neymar still at PSG, the manager\u2019s job was to reintegrate and remotivate a player for whom he has great affection. \u201cNeymar has a good heart,\u201d Tuchel says. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s a bit hard to see that he is a nice person when you only watch him play from outside. But he is, he\u2019s a nice guy. \u201cI told him: \u2018You think the hardest part is over but from now on you have to deal with me and I\u2019m going to push you hard. So the hardest thing is still to come for you.\u2019\u201d Tuchel\u2019s pushing seems to be working. Neymar has scored winning goals for PSG against Strasbourg and Lyon, with further strikes against Bordeaux and Angers, although he was ruled out for four weeks with a hamstring injury on Monday. Bigger tests await for Tuchel, with the Champions League last 16 looming in February as a make-or-break moment once again for a PSG manager. I ask him how he measures success at a club such as his. Is it simply a question of points or is there something more to it? \u201cI have no clear definition,\u201d he says. \u201cPoints count, definitely, titles count if you go to a club like PSG, that\u2019s the way it is. But there\u2019s also the relationships with the players, the connection with the players, sometimes helping a player through a difficult period in his career. That\u2019s also success, no? Hopefully I don\u2019t depend too much on the points and the titles because the possibility that you get sad or that you don\u2019t fulfil your own goals is too high. There\u2019s more to life than points and trophies but we\u2019re all very competitive and we all want to win every game. \u201cSometimes you work hard helping players through tough times and you work hard in building a team and creating connections and then you see your team work so well together in a really tight match and you think, \u2018Wow, what a great job we did over the past however many weeks.\u2019 But nobody out there knows what you\u2019ve really achieved. All the little things you achieve every day are like little rewards for me. From the outside it\u2019s all much simpler and it\u2019s just about winning.\u201d The German arrived at PSG in 2018 after two seasons at Borussia Dortmund followed by a year\u2019s sabbatical. In the French capital he has won the league but that is expected at a club who have Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Neymar and Edinson Cavani in the forward line. Tuchel has a remarkable squad at his disposal but when asked whether he has ever experienced a perfect game, he says: \u201cNever had one, never been close and still on the hunt. Still looking for one and still loving the training and still looking for the perfect training session, too. I like to think we get closer and closer all the time. \u201cYou have these periods where you really think, \u2018Yes, this is it\u2019 but the tension is so high in these games that you cannot fully enjoy it. Football is a game where lots of mistakes happen and the ability to deal with the mistakes is also a quality. You have to accept as a coach that there will not be a perfect game. It is sad, of course. It\u2019s a bit like Sisyphus, isn\u2019t it? You never quite get there. \u201cYou have amazing feelings and you love this job because you see so many good things. It can get close to perfection but never quite attain it.\u201d In the meantime Tuchel, who speaks fluent English and gets by pretty well in French, will continue his quest to become better acquainted with the city of Paris. A family man with two young daughters, Tuchel would like to have more time and freedom for cultural pursuits. He is still coming to terms with a profile that often means he will be recognised, even in Paris museums. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same looking at a painting in a gallery when you can feel other eyes are on you,\u201d he shrugs and admits to toying with the idea of adopting a disguise. \u201cSometimes I try to sneak out when it\u2019s dark, out in the streets, to get a taste of that freedom, to feel the vibe of the city. Other times I care less about people watching me and just go to a restaurant but that doesn\u2019t happen that often. It\u2019s an all-consuming job, hard to escape from and you don\u2019t know the price you have to pay for your passion when you start out.\u201d Does a person have to be slightly mad to be a manager? \u201cYes, you have to be,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cIt was pretty obvious from the start because even when you\u2019re the coach of the under-14s or the under-15s in the academy, although you don\u2019t have to deal with the press or the media you do have to deal with the parents and sometimes I\u2019m not sure which is worse \u2026 \u201cYou have to deal with the pressure inside the academies, the parents who want the best for their kids and how you don\u2019t always share the same opinions.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it.

      "bodyText": "One in three car firms are cutting jobs and one in eight have divested from their UK businesses in a sign that Brexit is already causing damage to the sector. A survey by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) shows that almost 14% of companies in the industry, including manufacturers, components and services companies, have already relocated amid the continuing uncertainty over the UK\u2019s departure from the EU. The industry has been one of the most vocal regarding a no-deal Brexit, firing its first warning shots three years ago when Nissan sought reassurances from Theresa May. The survey comes just days after Nissan issued a fresh warning that its business model was \u201cunsustainable\u201d in the event of the UK crashing out without a deal. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of SMMT, said: \u201cAs the Brexit clock ticks ever closer to midnight, this survey reveals the bleak future that awaits this vital sector in the event of no deal. \u201cDamage has already been done: investment is haemorrhaging, competitiveness being undermined, UK jobs cut and vast sums wasted on the impossibility of preparing for no deal. Make no mistake, every day no deal remains a possibility is another day of lost investment, another day that makes it harder to recover investor confidence in the UK.\u201d Nissan\u2019s European chairman, Gianluca de Ficchy, said a 10% tariff on exports to the EU under World Trade Organization terms would put the \u201centire business model for Nissan Europe in jeopardy\u201d. It is the strongest warning yet from the Japanese car manufacturer, which employs 7,000 people at its Sunderland plant. Hawes said it was not too late to repair the damage caused by three years of uncertainty. The government must strike a deal with the EU that includes a transition period to enable a return to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, and a long-term trading agreement that ensures \u201cfree and frictionless trade\u201d, he said. \u201cUK jobs, innovation, trading strength and economic growth all depend on the automotive sector, so we urge all parties to get a good deal done before it is too late,\u201d he said. The SMMT survey shows that more than \u00a3500m has been spent on measures that will not deliver returns, rather than being invested in research and development, and that 80% say they believe leaving the EU without a deal will have negative consequences. The industry is increasingly exasperated by government claims that the car sector is ready for no deal. Last month, Jaguar Land Roverm (JLR), which employs more than 40,000 in the UK, announced it would halt production at British factories for a week in November, joining BMW and Toyota in staging a shutdown to mitigate potential disruption from a no-deal Brexit. Speaking a day after Michael Gove said the automotive industry was ready for no deal, the JLR chief executive, Ralf Speth, said the company had no choice but to stop production lines at four facilities. The concerns centre on disruption to the \u201cjust-in-time\u201d flow of car parts underpinning an industry that employs more than 800,000 people in the UK.",

They said as much and last night at the 40th anniversary of the National Farmers Federation, I\u2019m not sure whether the member was attending that night, I thank those members from around the chamber, including from the opposite side, that were attending. </p> <p>The National Farmers Federation and the president was very clear about the appreciation they had for the extensive and comprehensive response that has been provided to the drought by the government in concert with the state and territory governments, where they are affected. </p> <p>The point the National Farmers Federation has been making about the issue they have raised is about an agreement they would like to see, between all the states and territories, with the commonwealth, common standards and triggers for the activation of state-based drought response. That is what they are seeking, and that is what is currently not in place. </p> <p>After the drought summit last year we have put in a reformed national agreement on drought, which added to the original agreement which made it clear states and territories were responsible for the initiatives that went directly to the welfare of animals, that is the fodder and support for the animals themselves. The commonwealth government was responsible for the direct assistance, income support for the farmers and graziers. </p> <p>That\u2019s what the agreement was reached at the end of last year. What they would like to see is a common set of standards, and triggers and policies by state governments. There has not been the response from the state and territory governments to move to that level of standardisation on the drought responses. </p> <p>They believe they would like to keep complete autonomy about how they customise their response to the drought in their jurisdictions. That\u2019s a matter for them. They are sovereign, they have constitutional authority for these matters, that\u2019s what they would like to see, I understand why the National Farmers Federation would like to see greater consistency across these areas, that is a matter I have undertaken to work with them to see what such a common standard might look like. </p> <p>At the end of the day we have to respect the autonomy of each of the state governments to deal with the issues they present at the end of the day. I thank the member for this opportunity to make the issues crystal-clear.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-15T04:06:10.710Z\">at 5.06am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5da543408f08b13ca7c7aa7c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-15T03:56:00.178Z\">4.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile, in the Senate:<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Paul_Karp/status/1183954158476414976\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Jacqui Lambie has been asking about replacement of old tools in TAFEs.<br>Simon Birmingham: &quot;I regret that there&#39;s an opportunity to talk about Soviet-era equipment when Kim Carr is not present in the chamber...&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/auspol?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#auspol</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SenateQT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SenateQT</a></p>&mdash; Paul Karp (@Paul_Karp) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Paul_Karp/status/1183954158476414976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 15, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-15T04:00:52.370Z\">at 5.00am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5da5428c8f084862358fe305\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-15T03:54:51.958Z\">4.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Tony Burke</strong> raises a point on the unparliamentary language.</p> <p>The way <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> pronounced \u2018dill\u2019, you get the feeling that \u2018dill\u2019 wasn\u2019t originally the \u2018d\u2019 word he was reaching for.</p> <p><strong>Tony Smith </strong>warns against the unparliamentary language, and says that if the government keeps doing it, then both sides will get to use it.</p> <p>\u201cBring it on,\u201d says someone from the government benches, because this is now apparently a schoolyard.</p> <p>But with less cool kids.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-15T04:01:46.524Z\">at 5.01am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5da541bb8f08b13ca7c7aa79\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-15T03:52:38.457Z\">4.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Joel Fitzgibbon</strong> to <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>:<br></p> <blockquote> <p>When will the prime minister admit his Future Drought Fund hasn\u2019t delivered and will never deliver one cent directly to desperate farming families. </p> </blockquote> <p>Morrison:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mr Speaker, the question that has just been posed by the member for Hunter once again demonstrates his complete lack of understanding of the policy issues that that fund is seeking to address. <br></p> <p>The drought fund, which he opposed from the day I first announced it at the drought summit, which he attended, and we were pleased for him to attend, on the very day he was speaking against it, he sought to have it frustrated even in this place, the national drought fund which begins at $3.9bn investment, over the course of the decade will grow to $5bn, from 1 July next year, it will draw down $100m to invest in water infrastructure resilience projects from the 1 July of next year. <br></p> <p>That\u2019s what we said the purpose of the drought fund was, it will draw down on investment from 1 July next year as we put it in place and we seek the advice of the board.</p> <p>The $300m we spent last year on infrastructure and farm household allowance projects, and support, I have already explained to him once.

And that is why we took the strong economic plan we did to the election and it was a complete contrast to the plan that was taken by those opposite. </p> <p>What we took was a plan to lower taxes, to ensure that we are cutting the cost of doing business in this country, that we are investing in the skills needs of the future of this country, that we are expanding their horizons of our economy by both supporting our traditional industries and developing new export markets and that we are investing in the infrastructure that Australia needs to grow.</p> <p>That is what we are doing, that is what we talked of to the Australian people. </p> <p>Those opposite offered a very different plan.

There is no other support to the Australian women in that environment at all and the only rescue \u2013 the only avenue for their survival, really \u2013 is through the Australian government, and sooner or later, there will be a death in the camp.

They believed that with hard work and dedication Australia was the best place to raise a family.</p> <p>\u201cI am excited to be helping make sure multicultural communities have a voice in the decisions of our Caucus,\u201d Ciccone said.</p> <p>The MPCC will operate in a similar fashion to existing caucus committees such as the status of women caucus committee and the First Nations caucus committee, and membership will be open to all caucus members.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-14T22:07:45.072Z\">at 11.07pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5da4ed4c8f08b13ca7c7a8c2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-14T21:51:26.753Z\">10.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The vote was one by one.

She says the government can\u2019t give her anything for her vote, because her constituents would not \u201cexpect me to go in there and sell those people out, for a deal for Tasmania\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is just not on the cards, it is not the way we operate down in Tasmania,\u201d she told RN.</p> <p>Instead, Lambie says she is approaching it as a conscience vote.</p> <p>\u201cThis will be a conscience vote, from Tasmania,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Lambie says she will be going through the Senate report on the medevac bill, which is due to be handed down on 18 October, over the weekend, including the dissenting reports. This week is full of meetings, <a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/guide/article/2018/09/19/jacqui-lambie-joins-go-back-where-you-came-live\">with the immigration lawyer who appeared with her on the SBS show Go Back To Where You Came From</a> meeting with Lambie this morning.</p> <p>\u201cShe has some concerns as well.

There will be a few other people with who I am meeting with this week as well,\u201d Lambie said.</p> <p>On the medical bodies who came together for a joint statement, asking for the legislation to remain in place, Lambie says she believes national security grounds need to be taken into account as well.</p> <p>\u201cEspecially with the tempo that is happening in the Middle East in the last four or five days,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe also always need to make sure and consider that boats making sure that those boats don\u2019t start coming back in, and whether or not that signals, whether or not that is going to set off that domino effect. </p> <p>\u201cWord doesn\u2019t always get back to people, where there are other war zones not to get on boats, because you won\u2019t be allowed into Australia. </p> <p>\u201cSo making sure that they get that information correctly.

They\u2019ll be back tomorrow, with more of the 46th parliament\u2019s fun and games (yes, our fun radar is very low). And of course, to you, for making it all worthwhile. I\u2019ll be back early tomorrow morning, but you can catch me on the socials, if you have a burning issue. In the meantime though \u2013 take care of you. Meanwhile, this just happened: On the leaks from the right caucus, Joel Fitzgibbon tells Patricia Karvelas that he would never stop debate in the Labor party and it is \u201cno skin off my nose\u201d. Despite multiple attempts from PK, Fitzgibbon does not concede that his 28% emissions reduction target idea is dead, and just says the discussions within Labor will continue. The government is also calling for a do-over on the vote it messed up overnight. The government in the House rejected the amended legislation (the sunset clause on the police powers at airports bill that Rex Patrick had inserted \u2013 and won) so it has sent the bill back to the Senate. Obviously the government will have made sure it has the numbers for this now. Honestly, I wish I could have a do-over this easily. I have new ideas about how to ruin my life and I\u2019d like to see how they play out. On the emissions target debate, Joel Fitzgibbon says he posed the question that Labor match the government target to highlight that Scott Morrison is \u201ctelling porkies\u201d over the government meeting its target \u201cin a canter\u201d. He says he doesn\u2019t regret raising those questions because he wants the focus to be on Morrison and the government. But he acknowledges that there have been \u201cvarious views\u201d from his colleagues over his intervention. Meanwhile, remember this story from Helen Davidson? The Morrison government is sitting on a major review it commissioned last year to explore better ways of resettling humanitarian migrants in Australia. The review into integration, employment, and settlement outcomes for refugees and humanitarian entrants, was led by Prof Peter Shergold, the former secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, now coordinator general of refugee resettlement in NSW. Guardian Australia understands the final report was delivered to government in February but the immigration minister, David Coleman, does not intend to release it until the end of this year, when it\u2019s expected to be published along with the government\u2019s response. The government has repeatedly refused requests for both the report and for an explanation of why it hasn\u2019t been released.\u201d The Senate just passed a motion demanding the government produce it. On whether or not he believes there is a climate emergency, Joel Fitzgibbon says yes, and that is the terminology which has been used by other nations, including the UK. He says he supports it. But he says that what he has been arguing is that Labor needs to get \u201cthe focus on him\u201d, meaning Scott Morrison, and ensuring that Morrison does the things that he says he is going to do. Joel Fitzgibbon says Labor offered the government a \u201cblank cheque\u201d to support drought-stricken communities (as in Labor will support any motion) but the government hasn\u2019t taken it up on the offer. Joel Fitzgibbon tells Patricia Karvelas on ABC radio that the government has been promising it would build dams for six years \u201cand is yet to break ground\u201d. He says the government didn\u2019t mention that 25% of its 50% commitment was in concessional loans, and that the states haven\u2019t agreed because they don\u2019t have the money to match the funding. Given all the dam debate in the parliament this week, this story from AAP is interesting: Queensland\u2019s Natural Resources Minister says the federal government has him feeling like a jilted teenager over dams. Minister Anthony Lynham says the state government has made $872 million worth of promises for water projects across the drought stricken state. Dr Lynham said the government has applied for $95 million through a Commonwealth development fund for projects including at Wamuran, Theodore, Bungunya, Lockyer Valley and at the Lower Burdekin - with little success. \u201cWe have had more knockbacks than I had as a teenager,\u201d Dr Lynham told parliament on Tuesday. \u201cWe have not seen a brass razoo for Rookwood (Weir) from the LNP.\u201d Politics and sport. You do the rest. This will be good: Labor just managed to pass this amendment to a motion in the Senate (the bit in bold) Senator Ciccone : To move\u2014That the Senate\u2014 (a) notes that: (i) after six years under this Liberal-National Government\u2019s watch, from 1 July 2014 to 19 31 August 2019: (A) 95,943 people have come through Australia\u2019s airports and sought asylum, as is their right to do, and (B) in nearly the same period, bridging visas have blown out from 94,000 to almost 230,000 - an increase of over 140%, (ii) of the protection visa applications decided by the Department of Home Affairs in that period, 62,732 - 84.2% - were rejected, (iii) those waiting in Australia on a bridging visa as their claims for asylum are assessed are often being exploited and trafficked by labour hire companies and criminal syndicates, (iv) stakeholders have expressed concern as racketeering around visas and asylum applications have been allowed to flourish, (v) the Assistant Minister for Customs, Community Safety and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Wood, remarked on the blowout of airplane arrivals and stated \u2018Organised crime and illegitimate labour hire companies are using this loophole...\u2019, and (vi) the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Dutton, stated that: \u2018...If you cannot control your borders, you cannot govern the country\u2019; and (b) condemns the Morrison Government and the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Dutton, for losing control of Australia\u2019s borders and allowing exploitation, slavery and trafficking to go unchecked, having a devastating impact on workers and their families, and the ability to do basic mathematics and provide accurate data to the Senate on the number of people who have been trafficked to Australia under their watch. The Red Meat Council has put out the free lunch klaxton for tomorrow. Turns out they are a brisket crowd. (Archer fans will get the joke.) In the midst of all of that is this nice little alert from DPS: The official portrait of Ms Nova Peris OAM, the first Aboriginal woman to become a federal parliamentarian and Senator, will be unveiled at Australian Parliament House, Canberra on Wednesday 16 October 2019. The Department of Parliamentary Services commissioned the portrait for Parliament\u2019s Historic Memorials Collection. The portrait was created by Dr Jandamarra Cadd, a Yorta Yorta and Dja Dja Warung descendant. This is Dr Cadd\u2019s first portrait for the Historic Memorials Collection and he is also the first Indigenous artist to paint a portrait for the Collection. Dr Cadd has been a finalist in several prestigious portrait competitions and his work is held in a number of collections. He is a graduate of Deakin University and holds an Honorary Doctorate in Creative Industries from Central Queensland University. The Historic Memorials Collection is Australia\u2019s longest-running art commissioning program. Founded by Prime Minister Andrew Fisher in 1911, the collection has commissioned portraits of the Head of State, Governors-General, Prime Ministers, Speakers and Presidents for more than a century. Meanwhile, over in the Senate, a Greens motion to ban any new thermal coal mines in Tasmania failed. Ayes - 8 Noes - 47 (Which means Labor voted against it) The attempt to suspend standing orders to move a climate emergency declaration has been lost. Ayes 65 Noes 72 There was a division a little earlier, that caught Greg Hunt on the hop: Anne Aly meanwhile, had a lot to say: Labor, the Greens and the crossbench (except Bob Katter I would assume) are calling for the climate emergency declaration. The government is not. Zali Steggall says she is disappointed listening to the government submissions, and if the government \u201caccepts the science that we need to reduce emissions, then it has to accept the science that is saying we are not doing enough\u201d. \u201cIf the science is telling you have to do more, then you have to adjust,\u201d she said, adding that is not a failure \u2013 it\u2019s just a normal response. Adam Bandt is moving the crossbench climate emergency motion in the House right now. He is moving to suspend standing orders to debate it this afternoon. (It will fail, with the government (obviously) not on board.) Over in the Senate and Kristina Keneally was having a little dig at Peter Dutton for not answering questions on notice. Dutton has so far not lodged answers for questions asking for details about the breakdown of country of the arrivals, where in Australia they are, or what actions he has taken to address these surges from countries such as Malaysia and China. Question on Notice 382 \u2013 asked on 12 August 2019 \u2013 35 days overdue Question on Notice 698 \u2013 asked on 13 September 2019 \u2013 3 days overdue Also, we do this over Twitter now too. From Mike Bowers\u2019 lens to your eyeballs: And on a nice note: Because it is only \u201cradicals\u201d who care about the climate, apparently. #owningtheleft Tony Burke jumps up to congratulate Tony Smith on the integrity award he received today (have a look a few posts down and check out Kenneth Hayne\u2019s speech) and thanks him for some of the difficult decisions he took during the medevac debate (you may remember that Smith stuck to the parliament rules, and ensured the parliament had a vote, and also ordered the solicitor general advice Christian Porter was relying on to shut down the debate, be tabled \u2013 which revealed the advice was not iron-clad). Scott Morrison then gets up to add his congratulations, and a few in Labor respond with \u201cnow you think about it\u201d to which Morrison gets very upset and accuses Labor of politicising the moment. It\u2019s like divorced parents fighting over a speech at wedding. So, I guess, congratulations Tony Smith? Scott Morrison, the folders having been stacked, calls an end to whatever the hell this last hour was. We bring Angus Taylor back for a lickspittle on the 70th anniversary of the Snowy Hydro, which the Rhodes scholar (don\u2019t you know) attempts to link to the 75th anniversary of the Liberal party. Taylor: He is right, this week does mark the 70th anniversary of the Snowy Hydro scheme and it is a great time to reflect on that iconic engineering feat and its long history in serving our nation. Indeed, this week we are also celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Liberal party and it is important to note that the snowy scheme is just another incredible achievement of Liberal government. This is TOO far for Anthony Albanese: Ben Chifley was no Tory. You opposed it, your lot. #goodjobAngus Amanda Rishworth to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister. Why won\u2019t the prime minister admit childcare fees have increased by 30% under his three-term government? Morrison: I will invite the minister for education to add to this answer, but on this matter, as minister for social services, which had responsibility for childcare at the time, it was actually our government that introduced a package to childcare, which those opposite when they were in government and those opposite when they were in opposition failed to deliver. And that is ensuring the people particularly on low and middle incomes are getting access to up to 85% rebates, 85% rebates, and our government and we got rid of the caps that were applied to those seeking childcare rebates that had previously seen them run out of childcare support by about February and March of every year. We took action to address the manifold issues in the childcare system that turn into a money pit from what was designed under those opposite when they were in government and I invite the minister for education to add further. Dan Tehan: And thanks prime minister, because it pretty much covered it all. (\u201cDill, dill, dill,\u201d yells Labor.) Tehan finishes his non-answer with \u201cand, prime minister, I commend you for what you did because you have put this sector on the right path\u201d, which just leads to a chorus of \u201cget a room\u201d from the opposition. Phil Thompson, who can\u2019t be taken seriously, given his preference for tomato sauce on bacon and egg rolls (I mean honestly \u2013 and for this to come from a Queenslander as well is a knife to my hot sauce heart) invokes Peter Dutton for the HOW SAFE ARE YOU troika of minutes. VERY SAFE. BUT JUST IMAGINE HOW UNSAFE YOU WOULD BE IF LABOR WAS IN POWER. \u201cYou\u2019re the government you dill,\u201d someone from Labor yells. There seems to be some who are yet to get the memo. I mean, they could just check their salaries. That\u2019s one hint, if the side of the chamber they sit on isn\u2019t enough of a clue. It\u2019s such a mishmash of a QT that even Shayne Neumann gets a question. My question is to the prime minister. Why does he claim the government has a drought policy, when the National Farmers Federation president says it doesn\u2019t. Michael McCormack gives his best impression of having a personality and tries to interject with something, but no one is buying it. \u201cThrow him out,\u201d the Labor benches holler. He stays and I\u2019m pretty sure I saw a fairy die. Scott Morrison: I thank the member for ... his question because it gives me an opportunity to point out exactly what the National Farmers Federation has presented to me on these issues. The National Farmers Federation has been extremely supportive of the government\u2019s response to the drought. They said as much and last night at the 40th anniversary of the National Farmers Federation, I\u2019m not sure whether the member was attending that night, I thank those members from around the chamber, including from the opposite side, that were attending. The National Farmers Federation and the president was very clear about the appreciation they had for the extensive and comprehensive response that has been provided to the drought by the government in concert with the state and territory governments, where they are affected. The point the National Farmers Federation has been making about the issue they have raised is about an agreement they would like to see, between all the states and territories, with the commonwealth, common standards and triggers for the activation of state-based drought response. That is what they are seeking, and that is what is currently not in place. After the drought summit last year we have put in a reformed national agreement on drought, which added to the original agreement which made it clear states and territories were responsible for the initiatives that went directly to the welfare of animals, that is the fodder and support for the animals themselves. The commonwealth government was responsible for the direct assistance, income support for the farmers and graziers. That\u2019s what the agreement was reached at the end of last year. What they would like to see is a common set of standards, and triggers and policies by state governments. There has not been the response from the state and territory governments to move to that level of standardisation on the drought responses. They believe they would like to keep complete autonomy about how they customise their response to the drought in their jurisdictions. That\u2019s a matter for them. They are sovereign, they have constitutional authority for these matters, that\u2019s what they would like to see, I understand why the National Farmers Federation would like to see greater consistency across these areas, that is a matter I have undertaken to work with them to see what such a common standard might look like. At the end of the day we have to respect the autonomy of each of the state governments to deal with the issues they present at the end of the day. I thank the member for this opportunity to make the issues crystal-clear. Meanwhile, in the Senate: Tony Burke raises a point on the unparliamentary language. The way Scott Morrison pronounced \u2018dill\u2019, you get the feeling that \u2018dill\u2019 wasn\u2019t originally the \u2018d\u2019 word he was reaching for. Tony Smith warns against the unparliamentary language, and says that if the government keeps doing it, then both sides will get to use it. \u201cBring it on,\u201d says someone from the government benches, because this is now apparently a schoolyard. But with less cool kids. Joel Fitzgibbon to Scott Morrison: When will the prime minister admit his Future Drought Fund hasn\u2019t delivered and will never deliver one cent directly to desperate farming families. Morrison: Mr Speaker, the question that has just been posed by the member for Hunter once again demonstrates his complete lack of understanding of the policy issues that that fund is seeking to address. The drought fund, which he opposed from the day I first announced it at the drought summit, which he attended, and we were pleased for him to attend, on the very day he was speaking against it, he sought to have it frustrated even in this place, the national drought fund which begins at $3.9bn investment, over the course of the decade will grow to $5bn, from 1 July next year, it will draw down $100m to invest in water infrastructure resilience projects from the 1 July of next year. That\u2019s what we said the purpose of the drought fund was, it will draw down on investment from 1 July next year as we put it in place and we seek the advice of the board. The $300m we spent last year on infrastructure and farm household allowance projects, and support, I have already explained to him once. He is interjecting again. The drought fund, the Future Drought Fund, is not to provide direct financial assistance payment to farmers, it\u2019s there to provide direct support for water resilience projects, to fund for the future. If the member for Hunter doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to invest in water resilience for the future of Australian agriculture, he should leave the post of spokesman on agriculture immediately because he doesn\u2019t understand one of the most fundamental elements of agriculture in this country, which is you have to provide water! When there is a drought, it means there is no water, therefore you need to provide storage facilities... Fitzgibbon is getting in trouble for his interjections, and Michael McCormack takes the opportunity to make a joke, because David Littleproud acts like it is the funniest thing he has ever heard. I mean, I know the Nationals party room isn\u2019t the most supportive of rooms, but there has to be limits. Morrison: If he took the time to understand what the Future Drought Fund was for, rather than seek to pay petty politics with this, he might understand that funder is there to provide for future water resilience. What doing on farmhouse allowance in rural financial counsellors and support for mental health, to do everything from on-farm water infrastructure, whether it is to increase allowances for silage investments, or on-farm water infrastructure projects to farmers doing it themselves, or the water we are putting into counsellors to make sure they are keeping local community supported through the drought, or the more than $50m we have directly put into charitable organisations like the Salvos and Vinnies, this is a comprehensive response. I would appeal to the member for Hunter to support the government initiatives reaching out to farmers and stop being such a dill. Labor\u2019s Louise Pratt is testing the minister for youth, aged care and sport, Richard Colbeck, by asking if youth underemployment has risen from 12 to 20%. Colbeck pauses to thumb through his brief, Pratt gives him a few moments but then starts up with cries of \u201cwhere\u2019s that brief\u201d and \u201cit\u2019d be under U for underemployment\u201d. Colbeck finds some pre-canned lines about 1.4m jobs created in the last 12 months, more than 100,000 of which were for young people. By this stage Anthony Chisholm and Murray Watt had started heckling about \u201cJohnno\u201d [Jonathon Duniam] not having to wait long for elevation to the ministry because \u201cthey\u2019ll need another Tasmanian\u201d. When he gets through an answer, Labor applauds, which was ruled disorderly. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: Why won\u2019t the prime minister be upfront with the Australian people? About the slowest economic growth in a decade, the fact the OECD has lashed Australia\u2019s growth outlook by twice as much as the G20 average, declining productivity and the fact that net debt has more than doubled on his watch? Morrison: Australia\u2019s economic growth is the second highest in the G7, Mr Speaker. 1.4 million jobs have been created under the stewardship of this government. In fact, today there are more people who are employed as a share of Australia\u2019s total population than at any other time in Australia\u2019s history. Now, only the Labor party could find a problem with that. And that is why we took the strong economic plan we did to the election and it was a complete contrast to the plan that was taken by those opposite. What we took was a plan to lower taxes, to ensure that we are cutting the cost of doing business in this country, that we are investing in the skills needs of the future of this country, that we are expanding their horizons of our economy by both supporting our traditional industries and developing new export markets and that we are investing in the infrastructure that Australia needs to grow. That is what we are doing, that is what we talked of to the Australian people. Those opposite offered a very different plan. Those opposite took a plan which was going to impose $387bn of higher taxes on the Australian economy. How they thought that that was going to actually support Australia\u2019s growth into the future was a mystery to Australians and they rightfully rejected those policies at the ballot box. And so there is a clear alternative. It is a clear choice as we have continued to demonstrate and that is the sound, stable and certain policies \u2013 not getting riled up, not getting spooked by the international conditions we are faced with, but ensuring we protect budget resilience that enables us to meet the challenges ahead. The shadow treasurer would have us blow the budget on reckless spending. The shadow treasurer would have us blow the budget of individual Australians and their families by putting up their taxes. The shadow treasurer, who knows what his position is on the climate reduction targets? There is a climate fight club going on over the other side. The thing they have forgotten about climate fight club is you are not supposed to talk about it. They can\u2019t help talking about it. We have support for the 28 position over here from the member for Hunter, we have the, for the 28, but I am not sure if I\u2019m for 45% from the climate change spokesperson, the minute is hidden \u2013 like the member for Sydney and the leader of the opposition who wants to come into this place and effectively engage in a protest and glue his hands to the dispatch box, with his latest today, which I know would see the full banning of coalmining in Australia. Melissa Price gets a lickspittle for the first time in a while. \u201cManufacturing in this country is alive and well,\u201d Price says. Scott Morrison nods along. He actually hasn\u2019t stopped watching her deliver the dixer answer. It\u2019s like a teacher watching a recalcitrant student do a make up oral exam. Catherine King to Scott Morrison: Why won\u2019t the prime minister admit to this table from his own minister by the department shows that not a single project under the urban congestion fund announced over 18 months ago has actually commenced? Not one. Alan Tudge takes it. (sigh) Can I thank the member for Ballarat for her question, and what I can confirm is that we have 130 projects under way right now as we speak, supporting thousands of people across the country in work, across the country. On top of that, we have 280 major projects under way as we speak. If I can find the list, I could go through them one after another after another of those projects, which are well under way. \u201cYou sound like Bruce McAvaney,\u201d yells Ed Husic. \u201cSo many projects, I\u2019ll name them all.\u201d \u201cName them in alphabetical order,\u201d someone else yells. (The joke being he is not naming the projects.) Tudge continues: On top of the 130 major projects which we have under way, we also have 166 smaller scale urban congestion front projects which we announced before the election of which we are working in close consultation with state governments to get them going and the first ones will begin at the end of this year. I just remembered, I just mentioned ones in Brisbane which will begin at the beginning of next year. She asked me again what about projects which haven\u2019t started. Mr Speaker, there are two projects which haven\u2019t started. The one I mentioned last time is the East West Link. That is one we do want to get under way. We have $4bn on the table to get this started. The Labor party constantly said bring forward projects, get them done. There is a project with $4bn ready to go and if only the leader of the opposition, the member for Ballarat would pick up the phone to her state counterparts and just say, let\u2019s get the job going! And the other one which I know is also strongly supported over in Western Australia is the railway project. Another project which we would like to see delivered. The other not being delivered but our other projects absolutely are getting under way, delivering on our agenda, 166 smaller scale projects which we are negotiating with state governments, getting the job done and they will begin at the end of this year. Alan Tudge is taking a lickspittle and I\u2019m suddenly reminded of those old school end of transmission broadcasts I\u2019ve seen on YouTube. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: Why do the prime minister\u2019s talking points make no reference to the 1.9 million Australians looking for a job or for more work, the worst wages growth on record, weak household consumption and retail spending. The worst household savings rate in a decade? Morrison: I\u2019m very pleased the member made reference to the talking points. I suspect we might want to make a habit of issuing these on a weekly basis because it was the first time I had seen our policies faithfully recorded in some publications for some period of time. (It\u2019s us. He\u2019s talking about us. OH THE HILARITY.) There\u2019s a lot about tax after this. Josh Frydenberg, who has once again forgotten HOW MICROPHONES wOrK, is doing his best to explain that the economy is JUST FINE. Somehow, the people who are not in government are still very relevant here. Andrew Wilkie has the independent\u2019s question today \u2013 and it\u2019s to Angus Taylor: The government claims Australia will meet its Paris agreement targets at a canter. The truth is the government is relying on accounting tricks to meet the targets, by counting artificially inflated credits left over from the Kyoto protocol, credits most developed countries have agreed to reject. Official government figures show emissions have reached record highs and continue to rise, feeding the climate emergency, the effects we are seeing in our backyard with the drought and fires. Our planet is cooking while the government cooks the books. Minister, why the denial and when will the government take real action to reduce emissions? Taylor starts talking about how Australia will meet its targets, without addressing the Kyoto issue. \u201cLiterally no one believes you,\u201d calls out someone from Labor. Even the government benches seem to have given up on this one. There is barely a hear, hear to be heard. Anthony Albanese is asking to table the prime minister\u2019s media release \u2013 which shows the government has offered 50/50 funding contributions for dams, without mentioning that 25% of those contributions will be concessional loans \u2013 but the request is denied. Anthony Albanese is back with a question for Scott Morrison, asking again why he is raising hopes and claiming the federal government is funding a new dam 50%, when it is only 25% (25% funding and 25% concessional loans). Morrison: I refer again to my answer. I was very clear, our 50-50... Our contribution is comprised half of grant and half of concessional finance. That is the commitment we made and we set out on Sunday. I refer the members opposite to the statements that have been made about this. We were very upfront. I\u2019m pleased the New South Wales premier was so pleased to receive the support because it was a month ago, we sat down, the deputy prime minister and I with the deputy premier and the premier of NSW to see how we could fast track important water infrastructure projects in NSW. I was very pleased to get that collaboration and cooperation and the urgency the NSW premier was going to bring to this task, not only to bring their resources to the project, but their commitment to blast away the bureaucracy and congestion to prevent those projects going ahead. We are happy to partner in the way we have, took a $75m commitment to one of those projects to $280m indirect grant assistance, a very significant increase on the commitment we have made for important water infrastructure. Now that the man has finished telling us how wonderful women are, we move on. Michael McCormack has Michael McCormacked his way into this dixer. It\u2019s meant to be about the role of rural and regional women, but he manages to Michael McCormack it from the first line. I thank the member for Mallee for her question and acknowledge that she is one of those fine women and there are many in the house, appreciate many on this side... M E R I T Terri Butler has a question for Scott Morrison, on dams, but he does not have an answer for the specific question. He has an answer for the question he wanted to be asked \u2013 why are Labor state governments standing in the way of dams. We\u2019ve had our first lickspittle and it\u2019s about just how amazing is this government and are there any alternative views. It\u2019s a great government, thanks for asking. Also, Labor is terrible. I am paraphrasing, but you know. It\u2019s the mood. I have obviously pissed off the technology gods because OMG this has been a drama. But we are back and running. Question time has begun with a question focusing on asbestos victims and it has got angry very, very fast. In case you can\u2019t read that tweet, here is the text: That the House: 1. notes that: a. climate change is a significant threat to our economy, natural environment, farming communities and national security; b. Australia\u2019s annual emissions have been rising in recent years; c. as a global problem, the solution to climate change requires concerted international cooperation to limit the production of greenhouse gasses; d. as the only global agreement designed to address climate change, the Paris Accords must play a central role in addressing climate change; e. the Paris Accords require signatory countries to deliver actions consistent with keeping the global temperature rise this century to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius; f. based on the latest scientific advice, the world is currently on track for warming of above 3 degrees, and efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions need to be strengthened to avoid catastrophic climate change impacts; and g. as a result of the threat posed by climate change, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Portugal, Argentina and the Republic of Ireland have declared a climate emergency; and 2. therefore, the House affirms that: a. Australia remains committed to delivering on its obligations under the Paris Accords; b. failing to meet the goals of the Paris Accords would have unprecedented and devastating environmental, economic, societal and health impacts for Australia; and the threat posed by climate change on the future prosperity and security of Australia and the globe constitutes a climate change emergency. Despite appearances, this is not a mugshot: And the motion itself is here: Looks like Jim Chalmers has found one of the question time attack lines: In its latest Board minutes, the Reserve Bank of Australia has confirmed what Australians know but the Government will not acknowledge: Australia\u2019s economic growth is the lowest in a decade, wages are stagnant, and employment is fragile. The Reserve Bank has highlighted that \u201cYear-ended growth had slowed to 1.4 per cent, the lowest outcome in a decade\u201d and that \u201cemployment growth was forecast to slow over the period ahead.\u201d Collapsing confidence and weak growth are the inevitable consequence of a Liberal Government which has a political strategy but not an economic policy. Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have recklessly left the Reserve Bank to do all the heavy lifting in the face of worsening home-grown economic challenges and increasing global risks. Right when Australians need and expect a plan from the Morrison Government to get the economy going again all they get instead is finger-pointing, blame-shifting and wedge politics. It is time Josh Frydenberg and Scott Morrison brought forward a budget update to fix their forecasts and properly outline an economic plan that supports the floundering economy and better safeguards Australians from global turbulence. And yup, as we reported a bit earlier, the Greens\u2019 climate emergency hot air balloon, which was technically against Casa rules, was able to be inflated (but not really get off the ground) because it was outside the authorised assembly area \u2013 and therefore outside of the parliament precinct rules. Just a point of order there \u2013 Labor will be moving its own climate emergency motion. The Greens have responded to Labor\u2019s announcement it will move a climate emergency motion: The Australian Greens welcome Labor announcing that they support the Greens-led crossbench Climate Emergency Declaration, said Leader of the Australian Greens Dr Richard Di Natale and Greens Climate Change Spokesperson Adam Bandt MP. \u201cIt\u2019s great to hear the Labor Party\u2019s announcement today that they support the Greens-led Crossbench Climate Emergency Declaration,\u201d Di Natale said. \u201cI know that there are ongoing divisions within Labor regarding taking strong action on climate change, so it is heartening to see them publicly joining the Greens and the community in support of a climate emergency declaration.\u201d \u201cWith Labor coming onboard and joining the Greens and the crossbench, there is now a very real chance that Parliament will declare a climate emergency before the end of the year,\u201d Bandt said. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for Liberal members to decide which side they\u2019re on and go on the record. History will judge them for how they vote on the climate emergency.\u201d Back in the chamber, the crimes legislation amendment (sexual crimes against children and community protection measures) is being debated. Labor wants to move this amendment to the legislation: Kenneth Hayne finished with this: To take any step of that kind will require honesty and courage. It will take honesty to recognise that there may be a problem and courage to devise means for dealing with it. It will take honesty to recognise that slogans may sell, they do not persuade. It will take courage to recognise that slogans sell by appealing to emotion not thought or reason. It will take courage to engage with facts and issues knowing that their depth and breadth cannot be reduced to, or explained by, a series of sound bites that capture a single 24 hour news cycle. It will take courage, in the world as we now know it, to engage with facts and issues rather than pursue the path to populism. Honesty and courage are needed if we are to maintain trust in our institutions. Maintaining trust may require the legislature to explain better than it now does what policy choices are made in the law it enacts and why they were made as they were. If trust has been lost or has been damaged, we can hope to repair it only through qualities of the kind we celebrate with the awards that are made today. And central to the criteria for those awards are what I earlier called standards of eloquent simplicity: honesty and courage. Kenneth Hayne: If you seek a model of the kind of argument I have in mind, go back and look at the submissions that were made to Cabinet in 1965 and again in 1967 about what was to become the Constitutional Alteration (Aboriginals) Act 1967. Those submissions laid out in elaborate detail the arguments for holding a referendum to amend constitutional provisions referring to Aboriginal Australians. And the submissions identified the arguments that were later placed before the voters before the referendum which so decisively made the amendments to s 51(xxvi) and s 127 of the Constitution. We readily accept that electors should not be asked to consider constitutional amendment without articulation of the arguments for and against the proposal. Are we at a point where we need to think again about how we are recording and publishing why policy choices embodied and reflected in legislation were made as they were? We have long required judges to state their reasons for decision. More and more we require administrative decision makers to give reasons for decision. Are there some analogous steps that the political branches of government, and in particular the legislative branch, should consider taking? Kenneth Hayne continued: Notice that I divide the issues in three: how policy is formed; how the policy that is formed is explained and justified; and how the policy is being applied. Development of policy is almost always very hard. It is hard because, much more often than not, there are competing considerations pulling in diametrically opposed directions. And because there are competing considerations, choices must be made. Yet it remains an essential role of government to explain to the governed why it takes the steps it does. It is essential because, if governments do not do this, trust in the institutions of government is damaged or destroyed. Explanation is often difficult. It is difficult because spelling out an argument simply and persuasively is hard. And it is all too easy to treat simplicity and persuasion as demanding reduction of the argument to some conclusory proposition cast in terms that appeal to or rely upon universally desired objectives like a strong economy, supporting the family, or keeping the nation safe. There cannot be a hint of criticism about pursuing those objectives but demonstrating how a particular measure supports the objective demands more than bare assertion. There is always an intermediate step which connects the measure in question with the desired end. Identifying and explaining how a measure contributes to achieving an end like \u201cstrong economy\u201d, \u201csupporting the family\u201d or \u201ckeeping the nation safe\u201d is no easy task. Not only is it not an easy task, it demands honesty and courage. It demands those qualities because it demands honest acknowledgment of choice and the courage to lay out, for the world to examine and criticise, the argument that supports the conclusion that was reached. Kenneth Hayne, the former high court justice and royal commissioner to the banking royal commission, presented the awards to both Cathy McGowan and Tony Smith today. In doing so, he made a speech about the trust in institutions, and how the recent increased calls for royal commissions may be a symptom of that. Hayne: If I am right to think that trust in institutions has been damaged or destroyed, we must consider what the increasingly frequent calls for royal commissions are telling us about the state of our democratic institutions. Has trust in the political processes been damaged? If it has, what can we do about it? No doubt individual actors in those processes must have the courage to act and continue to act with complete integrity. Individual integrity is essential for maintaining, or (if restoration is needed) restoring, trust. But it is necessary to ask whether some additional measures may be desirable, even necessary, to maintain or restore trust. More particularly, do we need to examine more closely the ways in which policy is formed, explained and then given effect? Centre Alliance\u2019s Rebekha Sharkie supported that motion. Once the matter of public importance is done later this afternoon, the division will occur. Here is the motion Andrew Wilkie wants to move: That the House of Representatives calls on the Australian government to establish a royal commission to inquire into and report on the Australian casino industry, with particular reference to: Allegations of Crown casino\u2019s links to organised domestic and foreign crime, money laundering, tampering with poker machines, domestic violence and drug trafficking, including but not limited to: the allegations concerning Crown, raised by the Member for Denison in the House of Representatives on 18 October 2017; the Member for Clark\u2019s referral of the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation, and Victoria police, to the Victorian Independent Broad-based Anti-Corruption Commission on 24 July 2019; reports by Nine newspapers and 60 Minutes in July 2019 concerning alleged criminal activity involving Crown; the Member for Clark\u2019s referral of the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation to the Victorian Ombudsman on 13 August 2019; the Member for Clark\u2019s referral of Crown Perth to the Premier of Western Australia on 19 September 2019; the allegations of criminal activity provided by a driver formerly associated with Crown revealed by the Member for Clark in the House of Representatives on 30 July 2019, and again during a media event yesterday, including the failure to process inbound and outbound flights and passengers; the evidence of money laundering at Crown revealed by the ABC and the Member for Clark today; the response to these allegations, including the possibility of criminality, by relevant state and federal agencies including but not limited to the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation, Victoria Police, the Australian Federal Police, Border Force and the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre; the conduct of people associated directly with Crown, including the possibility of criminality and corruption; and the conduct of serving and former politicians and party officials especially relevant to Crown, including the possibility of criminality or corruption. the performance of relevant federal agencies regarding the operation of Australian casinos generally including but not limited to the Australian Federal Police, Border Force and the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre. the conduct of Australian casino owners, board members and staff generally; the conduct of serving and former politicians and party officials regarding Australian casinos generally; and any related matters. Andrew Wilkie\u2019s motion has been delayed until later in the session. *I misheard that and originally thought it failed on the voices, so apologies. In the Senate, the Greens will also be moving some motions, including Mehreen Faruqi\u2019s motion calling for an inquiry into truth in electoral advertising (along with a petition on the same issue with 35,00 signatures) \u201cWe know the last election was riddled with false or misleading advertising which eroded public trust in our democracy. I\u2019m proud to table this petition of tens of thousands of Australians demanding this problem be fixed once and for all,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are really concerned about the total lack of accountability for the scare campaigns run by political parties. They are sick and tired of politicians openly lying to voters with no consequences.\u201d The Greens will also be looking to move a motion calling on the government to review the Commonwealth rental assistance rate, after the productivity commission report into low income renters. Stepping outside of the parliament for a moment - former Indi MP Cathy McGowan has just been awarded an integrity award. The Accountability Round Table (ART), which aims to improve accountability and transparency in the nation\u2019s parliaments, awarded McGowan the Alan Missen award for her \u201ccommitments to reforms\u201d which were seen as \u201cessential for open, accountable and transparent government\u201d. \u201cWe recognise her commitment to those in her electorate, and her embrace of significant issues crucial to Australia\u2019s parliamentary democracy, in particular her work on the National Integrity Commission and parliamentary standards bills,\u201d ART chair Fiona McLeod said. Speaker Tony Smith was presented the John Button award for being \u201can outstanding example of an independent/non-partisan speaker in the finest traditions of the office, and has done much to restore its standing in recent years\u201d. Over in the House, Andrew Wilkie has kicked off proceedings by attempting to move a motion to have a royal commission into Crown Casino. The government isn\u2019t supporting it, so we are heading to a division (which will be lost on the numbers, even if Labor supports it). The bells are ringing for the beginning of the parliament session. This is what doom sounds like. Anthony Albanese: We\u2019ll continue to hold the government to account in question time. It\u2019s important that the Prime Minister can\u2019t just walk away from questions. We asked a simple question that\u2019s about his evasion, nothing else, about his evasion of whether he sought to have Brian Houston invited to the White House. How is it that the Prime Minister thinks he can get away with saying, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s just a report in the newspaper?\u2019 The question is, is it true or not? The question is why is this Prime Minister, when he\u2019s asked questions, responding with, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s just in the bubble,\u2019 or other prevarications, which are all designed to avoid scrutiny? Well, our job, as the opposition, is to hold the government to account and we\u2019ll continue to do just that. Anthony Albanese is holding his press conference on the climate emergency motion. He says Scott Morrison is \u201call rhethoric...when it comes to substance, he gets caught out that he is loose with the truth\u201d. [National debt] has doubled on this government\u2019s watch. Household debt is the highest it\u2019s ever been. When it comes to productivity, it\u2019s gone backwards, fourth quarters in a row. When it comes to growth, the OECD has downgraded Australia\u2019s growth predictions by more than it\u2019s downgraded the UK, which is going through Brexit. Interest rates are at 0.75%. When they were at 3%, the Coalition was saying that was emergency levels. That\u2019s a sign of no confidence in this government\u2019s capacity to stimulate the economy.\u201d The government\u2019s climate policy is another example of that, Albanese says. Seems like Labor has settled on some sort of climate policy. Pauline Hanson on her \u2018legislation strike\u2019 (speaking to Sky News): I said on critical, non-critical legislation, which I haven\u2019t. And I think it\u2019s very important that we do have security at the airports, which I did support that last night about the amendment that was put up by Rex Patrick. So I said I will look at it. But as far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019m not interested in looking at legislation. This is important. I\u2019ve got people here that ... suicide. They\u2019re going under. This is an industry that we have to, I\u2019ve got to take a stand on this, the government\u2019s not doing anything about it, the National Party have done nothing about it. Labor will talk no action, the role, you know, full of BS, as far as I\u2019m concerned, do something about it. I\u2019m sick of hearing that we\u2019re giving money there. Scott Morrison comes out and says we\u2019ve put $318.5 million into the industry. He\u2019s just giving $150 million to NASA. So he\u2019s quite prepared to send the, you know, the astronauts into into space, and then meantime they come here and he is sending our cows to heaven. Update from the Labor caucus meeting: Save the Children Australia acting CEO Mat Tinkler and Kamalle Dabboussy, spokesperson for the 60-plus Australian children and women trapped in al-Hawl camp in north-east Syria, just held a doorstop about what is happening in the region \u201cand the closing window of opportunity for repatriation\u201d. Dabboussy\u2019s daughter is one of those. I think there\u2019s a great concern as to how the situation may change on the ground. As I said, it\u2019s very difficult to predict what happens next in the Middle East and this region of the world. Part of the issue that we have a concern is not only who will take control, but the process between now and when they take control. There\u2019ll be a period of lawlessness, areas where people are not being patrolled or supported, and in that environment you will have ISIS sleeper cells and radicalised women in the camp and they in turn may take action. Remember the Australian women have all been deemed as apostates or non-radicalised women who don\u2019t believe in the ISIS ideology, and their ideology allows them to be killed as a result. So they are open and vulnerable at this point in time. Without sounding too brutal, obviously knowing your own personal family situation, but are these people at risk of being killed or dying if we don\u2019t get them out? I\u2019ve been saying that to the government for quite some time. Sooner or later, we\u2019ll face an Australian death. At that point in time, I was explaining, that we would probably face an Australian death over their winter but they also face death from disease and they also face death from the lack of food and water, they face death from security threats from inside the camp, from attacks external to the camp. There is no other support to the Australian women in that environment at all and the only rescue \u2013 the only avenue for their survival, really \u2013 is through the Australian government, and sooner or later, there will be a death in the camp. And since the majority of the deaths in the camp have been children under five, they are the ones most exposed in this situation. Pauline Hanson is using this story from 2013 to justify her views on false allegations in the family court. She says no one from the government has asked her to tone down her rhetoric on the issue, ahead of the inquiry she is about to deputy chair. Mike Bowers is out the front of parliament at the moment. \u201c ... I will look at it,\u201d Pauline Hanson tells Sky News about legislation. \u201cBut as far as I am concerned, I am not interested at looking at legislation.\u201d Hanson also says something along the lines of Scott Morrison is quite happy to send astronauts into space, but meanwhile \u201che is sending cows to heaven\u201d. Anthony Albanese has announced a press conference for 11.45am. That\u2019s just after the caucus meeting and just before parliament sits (it starts at midday). He\u2019ll be in the opposition leader\u2019s courtyard, which is Labor\u2019s fancy press conference zone. The balloon is not flying though. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority put the nix on that, although there are quite a few examples of hot air balloons flying over parliament. I have been informed by a few people who know that the parliamentary precinct doesn\u2019t actually extend all the way down the front lawns. The hot air balloon is still on the front lawn of parliament, but I expect we will be seeing a parliamentary \u201cget off my lawn\u201d response fairly soon. Paul Karp reported on some of the balloon dramas earlier this week: The Greens\u2019 hopes of flying a hot air balloon over Parliament House to protest global heating have been deflated by a last-minute restriction on flights due to security concerns. Despite blocking the balloon plan, parliament\u2019s presiding officers have approved an Extinction Rebellion protest at the authorised assembly area in front of parliament from 14 to 18 October, the Senate president, Scott Ryan, has revealed. Last week the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, wrote to members hoping to raise $10,000 for a hot air balloon to provide extra lift to the party\u2019s efforts to get parliament to declare a climate emergency when it returns on Monday. The Greens had obtained approval from the National Capital Authority to use the East Lawn at Parkes and Federation Mall for use in climate emergency protests and also claim to have consulted the Australian Federal Police about use of the balloon. The Greens have a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d balloon up on the lawns of Parliament House. On whether or not the government should be looking to try and bring some of those women and children home to Australia, Kristina Keneally told Sky News: The government themselves are the only people who can make a decision about what to do in relation to the women and the children who are currently in the al-Hawl internal displacement camp in Syria. They are the only people who have the capacity and the information on national security. ... It is a moral issue as the prime minister has reflected, as has minister Peter Dutton about the terrible situation some utterly innocent children are in, some 40 children who are either Australian citizens, or who have a claim to Australian citizenship are ... in this camp in Syria. By all accounts, they\u2019re quite horrific conditions there, and they are innocent victims. We also know, I know, I\u2019ve been briefed by the Department of Home Affairs that some of the women there were taken against their will or taken as children are now adults, and they are victims too. And it is incumbent upon the government to consider if it is safe to remove those children and women. I\u2019d also reflect that the United States president and the United States secretary of state have been calling on their western allies to deal with their citizens in Syria. The independent national security legislation monitor here in Australia has warned that leaving foreign fighters in the Middle East in Syria in particular, is akin to leaving foreign fighters in Afghanistan in the 1970s. Those people went on to form al-Qaida. There is a risk yes, to bringing people back to Australia, particularly those who have a determination and I accept fully that there are some people either those manual imprisoned or some of the women in the camp who do have a determination to harm Australia. But I think the prime minister and the minister for home affairs need to be straight with the Australian people that while there is a risk to bringing people back, there is also a risk to leaving them there and talk to the Australian people honestly about what those risks are to leaving people there. From AAP: Two Australian women trapped in a camp for relatives of Islamic States fighters have pleaded for Australia to help them as Syrian forces move in. Mariam Dabboussy, a mother of three, is begging the Morrison government for help. \u201cPlease don\u2019t let us fall into the hands of the [Syrian] regime,\u201d Dabboussy said in a recording given to the ABC by her father, Kamalle Dabboussy. \u201cWe\u2019re asking just as humans, just as regretful people. \u201cIf this happens that\u2019s it for us. That\u2019s it for my kids.\u201d The second woman, Zara Ahmad, sent a message to her sister saying a woman\u2019s mutilated body was found in the toilets at the al-Hawl camp. \u201cI\u2019m so scared, I don\u2019t know how much longer I can do this for,\u201d she said. Conditions at al-Hawl, where more than 60 Australian women and children are being held, have deteriorated since the United States announced its withdrawal from northern Syria. This prompted the entry of Turkish fighters to the area in an offensive against Kurdish fighters. Russia-backed Syrian forces have now responded by deploying forces deep inside Kurdish-held territory south of the Turkish frontier. Women\u2019s advocates will be in Canberra today, as the Greens attempt to move a motion to scrap the latest family court review. That would be the one headed up by Kevin Andrews and Pauline Hanson. Advocates, legal experts and domestic violence survivors will be in parliament to try and convince senators to support the motion. Where are we up to with the big stick? I mentioned in a news story published last night about Joel Fitzgibbon\u2019s lively session in the right and left caucus meetings that the shadow cabinet was considering its position on the big stick legislation. Quick recap: Labor opposed this legislation (which creates a power to break up big energy companies if they engage in price gouging) in the last parliament. But the opposition has been warming up for a change of heart. I\u2019m told Labor will pass the government bill if the government accepts an amendment ruling out privatisations or partial privatisation as a consequence of the proposed regime. I believe this is how it works: the effect of the proposed amendment is a public entity that is receiving a divested asset must not have a smaller share of public ownership than the original public entity subject to a divestiture order. If you need a backgrounder, you can read one here. Bridget McKenzie has called a blue room press conference (the second most fancy press conference room) after authorities at Sydney International airport became the first to cancel a visitor\u2019s visa for a biosecurity breach. McKenzie\u2019s office says a 45-year-old woman from Vietnam had her visa cancelled for \u201cfailing to declare an extensive cache of food concealed in her luggage, including over 4.5kg of pork\u201d. That is a pretty big deal, particularly at the moment, as Australian biosecurity officials attempt to keep the nation free of African swine fever, a devastating disease which experts predict has wiped out about a quarter of the world\u2019s pig population. You may remember that Pauline Hanson has announced that she and Malcolm Roberts would be going on a voting strike in the Senate until the government decides to regulate the dairy industry. The senator herself explained it last week on Sky News, creating what appears to be Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s intervention: Both Jacqui Lambie and Kristina Keneally have pointed out that One Nation voted with the government last night (in the vote the government lost). One Nation has said its strike will apply to \u201cnon-critical\u201d legislation. Which seems a bit of a pointless strike really. Just like that time I went on a talking strike because my family had annoyed me. As they liked to repeatedly remind me, they were the double winners in that situation. But then again, these are also the people who think protests should be held at convenient times and places, so I guess it is on brand. On the \u201censuring integrity\u201d bill, though, Jacqui Lambie is firm. If John Setka doesn\u2019t step down from the CFMEU, she will vote with the government on the bill, ensuring it passes. \u201cHas John Setka resigned this morning? Then absolutely not,\u201d she said. \u201cAbsolutely not. Nope. John Setka needs to go. I would like to see the sisterhood out there, of the unions, that is the ACTU, all the women out there, who complain about ... issues, bullies, all of that sort of stuff, they have all gone quiet, they have gone amiss. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they standing outside the CFMEU house down there in Melbourne and saying \u2018remove yourself, we want you gone mate, you know, you are a meathead, see you later, this is what you have done to our union, we know what you are like, how you have treated your wife in the past\u2019 and all the rest. John Setka needs to go. And the only person who doesn\u2019t realise that is John Setka himself.\u201d Setka pleaded guilty to harassing a woman by text messages, with his wife Emma revealing herself as the woman, earlier this year. The pair have both publicly stated they have moved on from that period of their life. Setka has repeatedly said he sees no reason to step down, despite the Labor party moving to expel him from the party. But the political arm has no power over the union movement, with the CFMEU by and large flanking around Setka in support. Jacqui Lambie was just on Sky News, where she said the same things about the medevac bill that she said on ABC radio. For a good overview of the phonics debate in Australia, Michael McGowan has this piece from last year. Like it or not the government is bringing back phonics to Australian primary schools. From Dan Tehan: \u201cOur Government will fund the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL) to provide expert advice on incorporating phonics into the national accreditation standards for initial teacher education. \u201cI have tasked AITSL to create a small taskforce to advise on implementing the Government\u2019s phonics in ITE election commitment. \u201cAITSL will draw on the taskforce\u2019s expertise, focusing on ensuring graduate teachers can teach the fundamentals of literacy through learning how to teach the five essential elements of literacy: phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary development, reading fluency, comprehension. \u201cOur Government believes in the primacy of developing strong literacy and numeracy skills as the bedrock of a quality education. \u201cThere is clear evidence that children benefit from phonics instruction in learning to read and spell so our Government wants teachers to have the skills to teach phonics well. \u201cAITSL will progress the proposed changes to the accreditation standards to all education ministers for endorsement in December 2019. \u201cOur Government will also introduce a free, voluntary phonics health check for Year 1 students so parents and teachers can better understand a child\u2019s reading level and what support they may need.\u201d We know there is a left and a right Labor caucus (with both, as Katharine Murphy reported yesterday, having something to say about Joel Fitzgibbon\u2019s intervention in the emissions conversation) but now Labor has established a multicultural policy caucus committee as well. From Andrew Giles, Anne Aly and Raff Ciccone: The committee will be chaired by Anne Aly MP, and senator Raff Ciccone will be its secretary. It brings together the lived experience and representational understanding of caucus members, in examining legislation impacting on multicultural communities, consulting with stakeholders and providing specialist advice to the leader and the shadow minister for multicultural affairs. Shadow minister for multicultural affairs Andrew Giles said that the caucus committee will have a focus on consultation with multicultural stakeholders, especially new and emerging communities. \u201cThe Morrison government has no plan to support multicultural communities, tackle racism and no plan to realise the strengths of Australia\u2019s diversity. \u201cI look forward to working alongside my caucus colleagues to boost Labor\u2019s engagement with established and emerging culturally diverse communities and ensure that we work alongside these communities every step of the way to better reflect their concerns in parliament.\u201d Caucus committee chair, Anne Aly MP said: \u201cApproximately 1 in 4 Australians was born overseas, and many people born here will have migrant parents. This committee represents Labor\u2019s commitment to ensuring that our policies are meaningful for all Australians. I look forward to my role as chair and working with my colleagues on this committee.\u201d Secretary of the committee, senator Raff Ciccone said that after six years under the Liberal National government multicultural communities in Australia have been overlooked and not given the respect they deserve. \u201cLabor is committed to working with people from every background who call Australia home. \u201cMy parents left their home country in search of a better life to give my brother and I the very best opportunities that Australia has to offer. They believed that with hard work and dedication Australia was the best place to raise a family. \u201cI am excited to be helping make sure multicultural communities have a voice in the decisions of our Caucus,\u201d Ciccone said. The MPCC will operate in a similar fashion to existing caucus committees such as the status of women caucus committee and the First Nations caucus committee, and membership will be open to all caucus members. The vote was one by one. According to the Senate Hansard, here is how that went down: AYES Ayres, T, Bilyk, CL , Brown, CL Chisholm, A Ciccone, R Di Natale, R Dodson, P Farrell, D Faruqi, M Gallacher, AM Green, N Hanson-Young, SC Keneally, KK Kitching, K Lambie, J Lines, S McCarthy, M McKim, NJ Patrick, RL Polley, H Pratt, LC Siewert, R Smith, M Steele-John, J Sterle, G Urquhart, AE Walsh, J Waters, LJ Watt, M Whish-Wilson, PS NOES Abetz, E Antic, A Bragg, A J Canavan, MJ Cash, MC Chandler, C Colbeck, R Davey, P Duniam, J Fierravanti-Wells, C Hanson, P Hughes, H Hume, J McDonald, S McGrath, J (teller) McKenzie, B McMahon, S O\u2019Sullivan, MA Paterson, J Payne, MA Rennick, G Roberts, M Ruston, A Scarr, P Seselja, Z Sinodinos, A Smith, DA Stoker, AJ Van, D PAIRS Carr, KJ Fawcett, DJ Gallagher, KR Askew, W Griff, S Henderson, SM McAllister, J Reynolds, L O\u2019Neill, D Birmingham, SJ Rice, J Ryan, SM Sheldon, A Brockman, S Wong, P Cormann, M Kristina Keneally had a bit to say about it though: \u201cThis is the latest chapter in the comedy of errors that is the Morrison government. The Liberals started the day by accidentally sharing their talking points with the entire press gallery and finished it by stuffing up a vote in the Senate.\u201d Speaking of the Senate, someone in the government side will be in trouble this morning after the government lost a vote in the chamber last night: It sounds like there are going to be A LOT of conversations this week. \u201cThe legislation does serve its purpose and they do have the opportunity to get medical attention, I don\u2019t think we need to be arguing about that,\u201d Jacqui Lambie continued. \u201cBut, I have got to look at the bigger picture as well, and, as I said, what has happened over the last four or five days in Syria, certainly that will come into the equation now.\u201d Lambie says she is not sure if she would have voted for the medevac bill if she was in the Senate last year when it passed. But she comes back again to her point that \u201cthings have changed in the last four or five days, so I just need to get more clarification from that on home affairs and we\u2019ll go from there\u201d. The report doesn\u2019t come out until Friday, but the Senate won\u2019t have to vote on the repeal until the Senate returns the week of 11 November. There is also estimates next week, where the legislation will no doubt play a big role. Over on ABC radio, Jacqui Lambie says she still has not made up her mind on the medevac repeal legislation. With One Nation siding with the government, and Centre Alliance firmly against the repeal, the Tasmanian senator is the swing vote. She says the government can\u2019t give her anything for her vote, because her constituents would not \u201cexpect me to go in there and sell those people out, for a deal for Tasmania\u201d. \u201cIt is just not on the cards, it is not the way we operate down in Tasmania,\u201d she told RN. Instead, Lambie says she is approaching it as a conscience vote. \u201cThis will be a conscience vote, from Tasmania,\u201d she said. Lambie says she will be going through the Senate report on the medevac bill, which is due to be handed down on 18 October, over the weekend, including the dissenting reports. This week is full of meetings, with the immigration lawyer who appeared with her on the SBS show Go Back To Where You Came From meeting with Lambie this morning. \u201cShe has some concerns as well. She does not want the medevac repealed. She wants to put her concerns across the table. There will be a few other people with who I am meeting with this week as well,\u201d Lambie said. On the medical bodies who came together for a joint statement, asking for the legislation to remain in place, Lambie says she believes national security grounds need to be taken into account as well. \u201cEspecially with the tempo that is happening in the Middle East in the last four or five days,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also always need to make sure and consider that boats making sure that those boats don\u2019t start coming back in, and whether or not that signals, whether or not that is going to set off that domino effect. \u201cWord doesn\u2019t always get back to people, where there are other war zones not to get on boats, because you won\u2019t be allowed into Australia. \u201cSo making sure that they get that information correctly. And I know those people right now, that are going to be under the medevac law, it is only contained to those people who are already there. \u201c... So there is a lot up in the air. \u201c Lambie says the decision by Donald Trump to pull out US troops from northern Syria has \u201cput a whole new spanner in the works\u201d and the \u201cdiscussions have slightly changed\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ll be going to see home [affairs] this week as well, and catch up with them, and just see where they are at with that sort of stuff and what else is going on with the Middle East.\u201d There\u2019s been no release of the government talking notes this morning, so I guess the big red button has been moved. Instead, the prime minister started his morning talking to Alan Jones, because I don\u2019t know. People get their morning gee up in different ways, I guess. The Sydney radio 2GB host was very vexed about the drought, but Scott Morrison said he couldn\u2019t make it rain. \u201cWe want the farmers and the communities to get through this drought, but we can\u2019t kid ourselves that there\u2019s a magic wand and a magic cash splash that is going to make this thing totally solved\u201d he said. As we saw from the talking points yesterday, the government is feeling a little vulnerable on the drought. It keeps pointing to its $7bn spend, but as we know, $5bn of that hasn\u2019t been spent. It\u2019s in a future fund, locked away. Regional and rural advocates say while the government has a strategy, it\u2019s ad hoc, doesn\u2019t involve the states and needs a more wholistic approach. The government, of course, defends its response. Expect more on that. Jacqui Lambie has been up early, speaking to ABC radio, so I\u2019ll bring you that soon. We\u2019ll also have the outcome of the party room meetings and caucus being held a little later this morning. It\u2019s also International Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day. The Senate will acknowledge that during the sitting session. But thinking of all of those impacted by pregnancy and infant loss. I hope you get a moment today for yourself. Mike Bowers is already roaming the hallways, and you\u2019ll have the considerable brainpower of Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Sarah Martin at your disposal. I have two coffees in front of me, thanks to benevolent benefactors who have learned I am in a better mood when properly caffeinated. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

      "body": "<p>Rap beefs are nothing new, but the past few years have seen hip-hop stars apparently align on a new common enemy: their own stylists. In verse after verse, rappers are claiming that they no longer make use of professional clothes-pickers, implying that they are more than capable of going to the shops without special assistance.</p> <p>The most notable entry in the anti-stylist movement is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_k_goMr5ZI\">French Montana and Drake\u2019s No Stylist</a>, in which the pair claim that they have such sartorial wherewithal that they can wear \u201cnew Chanel, Saint Laurent, Gucci bag\u201d without any need from outside advisers. The song, released in September last year, went platinum on the Billboard charts and has been streamed almost 150m times on YouTube.</p> <p>They are far from the only ones, though:<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETPBnOlNeOw\"> 21 Savage </a>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETPBnOlNeOw\">\u201cI ain\u2019t even fuckin\u2019 round with no stylist, I got too much drip\u201d</a>), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/05/tyler-the-creator-back-after-uk-ban-funk-reinvention-homophobia-accusations\">Tyler, the Creator</a> (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dustinocanalin/p/Burrx5MHU8M/\">\u201cThese fucking rappers got stylists, it\u2019s cause they can\u2019t think for themselves\u201d</a>), <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1SEEMkc-qw\">Kanye West</a> (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1SEEMkc-qw\">\u201cI don\u2019t see why I need a stylist, when I shop so much I can speak Italian\u201d</a>), Migos (\u201cFlyin\u2019 autopilot \u2013 woah! Don\u2019t need no stylist \u2013 no!\u201d) among others. A$AP Rocky perhaps takes it furthest on his track Shoot Your Stylist where he raps: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff58oCXqOGk\">\u201cMan, I need a chain, Supreme and the Palace </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff58oCXqOGk\">/ Just a young nigga that will shoot your favourite stylist.\u201d</a></p> <p>In each case, the rapper boasts they are so knowledgable about high-end fashion it would be absurd that someone else could give them better advice than they give themselves. But are they right to avoid outside counsel in this way?</p> <p>Stylists have been a critical part of hip-hop culture since the 90s, following the rise of figures such as June Ambrose, who styled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/14/missy-elliott-interview-beyonce-vmas-katy-perry-misdemeanor\">Missy Elliott\u2019s </a>famous vinyl suit in the video for The Rain, and P Diddy and Mase\u2019s tinfoil jackets in the Feel So Good promo.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHcyJPTTn9w\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hHcyJPTTn9w?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Yet it wasn\u2019t always made easy for rappers. The stylist Rachel Johnson has alleged that when she was working for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/21/fyre-festival-co-founder-ja-rule-criticises-new-documentaries-netflix-hulu\">Ja Rule</a> in 2002, Burberry refused to dress him for the Always on Time video. She bought him a Burberry hat anyway, and the brand became something of a hip-hop style trend, bringing the company a huge new stream of customers and revenue. It\u2019s reported that, eventually, they sent him a thank you card.</p> <p>Things have moved along a lot since then.

      "bodyText": "Rap beefs are nothing new, but the past few years have seen hip-hop stars apparently align on a new common enemy: their own stylists. In verse after verse, rappers are claiming that they no longer make use of professional clothes-pickers, implying that they are more than capable of going to the shops without special assistance. The most notable entry in the anti-stylist movement is French Montana and Drake\u2019s No Stylist, in which the pair claim that they have such sartorial wherewithal that they can wear \u201cnew Chanel, Saint Laurent, Gucci bag\u201d without any need from outside advisers. The song, released in September last year, went platinum on the Billboard charts and has been streamed almost 150m times on YouTube. They are far from the only ones, though: 21 Savage (\u201cI ain\u2019t even fuckin\u2019 round with no stylist, I got too much drip\u201d), Tyler, the Creator (\u201cThese fucking rappers got stylists, it\u2019s cause they can\u2019t think for themselves\u201d), Kanye West (\u201cI don\u2019t see why I need a stylist, when I shop so much I can speak Italian\u201d), Migos (\u201cFlyin\u2019 autopilot \u2013 woah! Don\u2019t need no stylist \u2013 no!\u201d) among others. A$AP Rocky perhaps takes it furthest on his track Shoot Your Stylist where he raps: \u201cMan, I need a chain, Supreme and the Palace / Just a young nigga that will shoot your favourite stylist.\u201d In each case, the rapper boasts they are so knowledgable about high-end fashion it would be absurd that someone else could give them better advice than they give themselves. But are they right to avoid outside counsel in this way? Stylists have been a critical part of hip-hop culture since the 90s, following the rise of figures such as June Ambrose, who styled Missy Elliott\u2019s famous vinyl suit in the video for The Rain, and P Diddy and Mase\u2019s tinfoil jackets in the Feel So Good promo. Yet it wasn\u2019t always made easy for rappers. The stylist Rachel Johnson has alleged that when she was working for Ja Rule in 2002, Burberry refused to dress him for the Always on Time video. She bought him a Burberry hat anyway, and the brand became something of a hip-hop style trend, bringing the company a huge new stream of customers and revenue. It\u2019s reported that, eventually, they sent him a thank you card. Things have moved along a lot since then. The past decade has seen a close and symbiotic relationship between hip-hop and the big fashion houses, with A$AP Rocky the face of Dior, while Gucci partnered with Dapper Dan, arguably the original hip-hop stylist, to create a new line for the brand that was inspired by the bootleg clothing Dan made in the 80s, before the fashion houses shut him down for infringement. Some rappers are making their no-stylist creed central to their brand. Lil Uzi Vert recently added \u201cNO STYLIST\u201d to his Instagram display name, telling GQ: \u201cI got a manager that books my tours,\u201d he says. \u201cI got an accountant that watches my accountant. Even though I handle my day-to-day, I got someone that makes sure everything\u2019s organised. Why would I ever need a stylist?\u201d There is doubt over the validity of these anti-stylist proclamations, however. \u201cThey\u2019re nearly all lying,\u201d claims Lily Mercer, who founded hip-hop and style magazine Viper. \u201cI don\u2019t know why \u2013 people don\u2019t care if you need help and a lot of artists have stylists who are themselves semi-famous on Instagram.\u201d There are, though, she says, differences between how artists use a stylist. \u201cSomeone like Young Thug \u2013 who I consider to be the most boundary-pushing rapper in terms of style \u2013 he\u2019ll have a stylist to pull clothes for him from different brands, but he\u2019s the one who\u2019s saying I want to wear a Molly Goddard sheer dress.

In her graphic memoir, <em><a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/111/1113654/a-puff-of-smoke/9781911214861.html\" title=\"\">A Puff of Smoke</a></em>, Sarah Lippett tells the story of the illness that struck her as a little girl and with which she lived until she was 18 when it was finally diagnosed and doctors were able to treat it. For obvious reasons, its pages are filled with baffled medics and kind nurses, noisy wards and futile tests, debilitating pain and scary, befuddling drugs. But they also speak of a great loneliness: here is a child who is not only unreachable, even by her devoted parents, but who knows herself to be so. If this doesn\u2019t make you cry, you may be a robot rather than a human being.</p> <p>Her first symptoms are terrible headaches; then she begins to drag one leg as she walks. At her local hospital in Stafford, she is put in an isolation ward while the staff try to work out the cause of her problems \u2013 the first time in her life she has ever been left alone. Brain scans are performed, and tests conducted on the fluid in her spine, after which she receives her (mis)diagnosis: she has hemiplegia chorea, an involuntary movement disorder. The drugs she is given for this have terrible side effects, among them urinary infections and hair loss, and naturally they do nothing to alleviate her symptoms. Only many years later, when her father insists on a referral to Great Ormond Street hospital in London, will doctors get to the heart of her condition. It turns out that she has moyamoya, a rare disease that constricts arteries to the brain, may cause strokes, and can only be cured by lengthy brain surgery.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f2941bb07a0a59980c93ee60968e4fe365e09fe3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2941bb07a0a59980c93ee60968e4fe365e09fe3/0_0_2463_3509/702.jpg\" alt=\"A Puff of Smoke - hospital\" width=\"702\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>All this may sound a bit relentless, and in a way, it is.

      "body": "<p>Last week, the Paralympian James Brown tried to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/10/extinction-rebellion-protesters-arrested-at-london-city-airport\" title=\"\">glue himself</a> to the top of a plane as part of Extinction Rebellion\u2019s protest at London City airport. Watching the epic performance unfold, I realised I hadn\u2019t seen a single person with a disability who was also a climate protester. Brown is visually impaired, so while he has no direct mobility impairment I don\u2019t imagine straddling an Embraer 190 is an easy manoeuvre. But it was a testament to democracy \u2013 and made me think about the place that people with disabilities have within the growing climate movement. As someone with cerebral palsy, I want an accessible revolution. It is everyone\u2019s future, and that needs to be represented in both climate protest and climate policy.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Let the plastic straw ban be the first and last anti-disabled, pro-climate legislation</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Protest presents so many systemic barriers for people with disabilities, no roadblocks necessary. This was evident when the Extinction Rebellion Disabled Rebels group organised a mobile toilet service for last week\u2019s demonstration \u2013 and the hoists and changing tables were <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/13/disabled-protesters-demand-return-wheelchairs-ramps-confiscated-police-10912185/\" title=\"\">impounded by the police</a> before the demonstration even started. Accessibility issues in protest don\u2019t just come from police, but sometimes from groups like Extinction Rebellion too: when street protests are held outside a hospital, many people with physical disabilities aren\u2019t able to go about their daily lives; and if they are held across London \u2013 where only about a third of tube stations are step-free \u2013 they are often unable to participate.</p> \n<p>I was born of climate activists. Naturally, I should be one too. But, by birth, I also have one of the most common causes of physical disability in the UK. I\u2019m finding any drive for direct action that wells up inside me is drained by the prospect of life-limiting climate policies. As part of the environmental movement, plastic straws, which enable around <a href=\"https://cerebralpalsy.org.au/our-research/about-cerebral-palsy/what-is-cerebral-palsy/how-cerebral-palsy-affects-people/\" title=\"\">one in four people with my disability</a> to drink, will soon be banned in all drinking establishments. Yet things we could all do without \u2013 plastic packaging, six-pack rings and polystyrene cups \u2013 remain unregulated and freely flow into our oceans.</p> \n<p>The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has done work on gender equality, using <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/topics/gender/resources/list-of-gender-focal-points-under-the-unfccc\" title=\"\">\u201cgender focal points\u201d</a>, people who assist in gender-related decisions about the climate. But there isn\u2019t a list of representatives with disabilities, though the outcomes of climate change negotiations will disproportionately affect us. The Paris agreement makes clear its obligation to disability and human rights, but will people with disabilities actually be involved in the discussion?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"187f78de-c824-4d45-b55e-79b5c0cf1b52\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ts6vzuPDOwo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>If we aren\u2019t represented at the top, the impact could be catastrophic for people like me who need certain reasonable adjustments to live our lives. People often tell me, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you get out of bed in the morning with a disability like yours,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t even begin to account for the science and writing and speaking I do, the students I support, the Paralympic training I participate in, the dates I go on.

      "bodyText": "Last week, the Paralympian James Brown tried to glue himself to the top of a plane as part of Extinction Rebellion\u2019s protest at London City airport. Watching the epic performance unfold, I realised I hadn\u2019t seen a single person with a disability who was also a climate protester. Brown is visually impaired, so while he has no direct mobility impairment I don\u2019t imagine straddling an Embraer 190 is an easy manoeuvre. But it was a testament to democracy \u2013 and made me think about the place that people with disabilities have within the growing climate movement. As someone with cerebral palsy, I want an accessible revolution. It is everyone\u2019s future, and that needs to be represented in both climate protest and climate policy. Protest presents so many systemic barriers for people with disabilities, no roadblocks necessary. This was evident when the Extinction Rebellion Disabled Rebels group organised a mobile toilet service for last week\u2019s demonstration \u2013 and the hoists and changing tables were impounded by the police before the demonstration even started. Accessibility issues in protest don\u2019t just come from police, but sometimes from groups like Extinction Rebellion too: when street protests are held outside a hospital, many people with physical disabilities aren\u2019t able to go about their daily lives; and if they are held across London \u2013 where only about a third of tube stations are step-free \u2013 they are often unable to participate. I was born of climate activists. Naturally, I should be one too. But, by birth, I also have one of the most common causes of physical disability in the UK. I\u2019m finding any drive for direct action that wells up inside me is drained by the prospect of life-limiting climate policies. As part of the environmental movement, plastic straws, which enable around one in four people with my disability to drink, will soon be banned in all drinking establishments. Yet things we could all do without \u2013 plastic packaging, six-pack rings and polystyrene cups \u2013 remain unregulated and freely flow into our oceans. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has done work on gender equality, using \u201cgender focal points\u201d, people who assist in gender-related decisions about the climate. But there isn\u2019t a list of representatives with disabilities, though the outcomes of climate change negotiations will disproportionately affect us. The Paris agreement makes clear its obligation to disability and human rights, but will people with disabilities actually be involved in the discussion? If we aren\u2019t represented at the top, the impact could be catastrophic for people like me who need certain reasonable adjustments to live our lives. People often tell me, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you get out of bed in the morning with a disability like yours,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t even begin to account for the science and writing and speaking I do, the students I support, the Paralympic training I participate in, the dates I go on. I\u2019m not able to do these things because I\u2019m superhuman \u2013 in actuality, it has a lot to do with my motability vehicle, with its regrettable diesel engine, and my blue badge. Limited mobility does not have to mean a limited life, but new climate change policies must recognise the distinction if we are to maintain any level of disabled liberation. Let the plastic straw ban be the first and last anti-disabled, pro-climate legislation.

Whittaker\u2019s legs remained shackled to the hospital bed, even though he was unconscious and unresponsive.</p> <p>In the audio recordings heard in court, Whittaker repeatedly told corrective services officer James Dobry, who was responsible for fielding emergency calls, \u201copen my door\u201d and \u201cI need help\u201d.</p> <p>Whittaker told Dobry: \u201cPlease help. I do not belong here, I just came in to use the toilet and now I am trapped.\u201d</p> <p>Whittaker had been in the jail for several days<strong> </strong>but repeatedly told Dobry: \u201cI have been stuck here for 20 minutes and now I can\u2019t get out.</p> <p>\u201cI only came in off the street to use the toilet, and now I am stuck. Please help me.\u201d</p> <p>The majority of the calls took place between 5.24am and 6.30am. Each time, Dobry asked Whittaker: \u201cWhat is your medical emergency?\u201d</p> <p>Whittaker is heard to say \u201cI do not know. Please help me.\u201d</p> <p>Dobry told the court it did not occur to him at the time that Whittaker was having a medical emergency. When Whittaker continued to use the emergency call or \u201cknock up\u201d system to ask for help, Dobry said: \u201cYou have already been seen by the night rovers.</p> <p>\u201cYou stay there. When they come back at 8am, they will take care of you. You have a good night. Until then you have to wait.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, Corrective Services NSW investigator Kenneth Johnston told the court that Dobry\u2019s responses suggested \u201ca level of apathy towards the inmate\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn hindsight, I could have been clearer about demanding a welfare check,\u201d Dobry said. \u201cOr taking Mr Whittaker straight to the clinic.</p> <p>\u201cThe behaviour he was exhibiting was serious enough to demand a second welfare check.\u201d</p> <p>The officer on duty on the morning of Whittaker\u2019s death, David Stankovski, also testified before the court.</p> <p>Stankovski said he did not register any panic in Whittaker\u2019s voice when he performed an initial welfare check. But under questions from council assisting the coroner, Peggy Dwyer, Stankovski said he would have performed further welfare checks if he had known the nature of Whittaker\u2019s emergency calls to Dobry.</p> <p>Dobry told the court he \u201cwished Mr Whittaker could tell me that he was having a medical episode\u201d at the time, because it is very difficult to determine a serious medical emergency and \u201cthey [inmates] do prey upon our duty of care\u201d.</p> <p>The officer who took over for Dobry at 8am, and whose name is protected by a non-publication order, provided a written statement which said Dobry said to expect a number of emergency knock up calls from Whittaker but not to worry about it, because an initial welfare check had already been done.</p> <p>Before the 8am handover, the unnamed officer said, Dobry told them not to worry about the calls from Whittaker because he was \u201cjust a spinner\u201d. The court heard that \u201cspinner\u201d is a slang term for someone acting strangely due to a potential mental health issue.</p> <p>However, Dobry told the court that the statement was \u201c100% a fabrication\u201d and the word spinner is \u201cnot in his vocabulary\u201d.</p> <p>The unnamed officer is due to appear at the inquest on Wednesday.</p> <p>When corrections staff attended Whittaker\u2019s cell a little after 8am, he had become incontinent and was vomiting. He was then taken to hospital, where he later died. Despite being unresponsive in hospital, Whittaker was still shackled to his bed by the ankles until the day before he died.</p> <p>The inquest will investigate how Whittaker sustained the haemorrhage, and officers\u2019 use of restraint during his transfer to the hospital on the morning of his death.</p> <p>The inquest concludes on Friday. </p>",

I do not belong here, I just came in to use the toilet and now I am trapped.\u201d Whittaker had been in the jail for several days but repeatedly told Dobry: \u201cI have been stuck here for 20 minutes and now I can\u2019t get out. \u201cI only came in off the street to use the toilet, and now I am stuck. Please help me.\u201d The majority of the calls took place between 5.24am and 6.30am. Each time, Dobry asked Whittaker: \u201cWhat is your medical emergency?\u201d Whittaker is heard to say \u201cI do not know. Please help me.\u201d Dobry told the court it did not occur to him at the time that Whittaker was having a medical emergency. When Whittaker continued to use the emergency call or \u201cknock up\u201d system to ask for help, Dobry said: \u201cYou have already been seen by the night rovers. \u201cYou stay there. When they come back at 8am, they will take care of you. You have a good night. Until then you have to wait.\u201d On Monday, Corrective Services NSW investigator Kenneth Johnston told the court that Dobry\u2019s responses suggested \u201ca level of apathy towards the inmate\u201d. \u201cIn hindsight, I could have been clearer about demanding a welfare check,\u201d Dobry said. \u201cOr taking Mr Whittaker straight to the clinic. \u201cThe behaviour he was exhibiting was serious enough to demand a second welfare check.\u201d The officer on duty on the morning of Whittaker\u2019s death, David Stankovski, also testified before the court. Stankovski said he did not register any panic in Whittaker\u2019s voice when he performed an initial welfare check. But under questions from council assisting the coroner, Peggy Dwyer, Stankovski said he would have performed further welfare checks if he had known the nature of Whittaker\u2019s emergency calls to Dobry. Dobry told the court he \u201cwished Mr Whittaker could tell me that he was having a medical episode\u201d at the time, because it is very difficult to determine a serious medical emergency and \u201cthey [inmates] do prey upon our duty of care\u201d. The officer who took over for Dobry at 8am, and whose name is protected by a non-publication order, provided a written statement which said Dobry said to expect a number of emergency knock up calls from Whittaker but not to worry about it, because an initial welfare check had already been done. Before the 8am handover, the unnamed officer said, Dobry told them not to worry about the calls from Whittaker because he was \u201cjust a spinner\u201d. The court heard that \u201cspinner\u201d is a slang term for someone acting strangely due to a potential mental health issue. However, Dobry told the court that the statement was \u201c100% a fabrication\u201d and the word spinner is \u201cnot in his vocabulary\u201d. The unnamed officer is due to appear at the inquest on Wednesday. When corrections staff attended Whittaker\u2019s cell a little after 8am, he had become incontinent and was vomiting. He was then taken to hospital, where he later died. Despite being unresponsive in hospital, Whittaker was still shackled to his bed by the ankles until the day before he died. The inquest will investigate how Whittaker sustained the haemorrhage, and officers\u2019 use of restraint during his transfer to the hospital on the morning of his death. The inquest concludes on Friday.",

And while everything can\u2019t be the calibre of Dumbo or Aladdin, the list did somewhat help to remind people that Disney has also made a great swath of crap. Especially confusing were its live-action films, a genre that many moviegoers have completely forgotten about. Best of all, a great deal of these live-action films had incredibly stupid names. How stupid? Glad you asked, here\u2019s a ranking of the 10 most stupid.</p> <h2>10. Sultan and the Rock Star (1980)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsvvAu6nvbU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gsvvAu6nvbU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Technically an hour-long episode of Disney\u2019s Wonderful World, Sultan and the Rock Star is so obscure that the only trace of it to be found on YouTube comes in the form of two women giddily trying to describe it. Nevertheless, Timothy Hutton from Ordinary People and the 1981 PSA Teenage Suicide: Don\u2019t Try It! plays a burned-out rock star who befriends a tiger. It apparently does not end with the rock star being eaten, which is a disappointment.</p> <h2>9. Operation Dumbo Drop (1995)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6pt7fsJph0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u6pt7fsJph0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Important point: this has nothing to do with the film Dumbo. Instead it\u2019s a Vietnam war comedy where Danny Glover and Ray Liotta do their best to stop a vengeful warlord from murdering an elephant by dropping it out of an airplane. No, really.</p> <h2>8. Johnny Tsunami (1999)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIVJ4d0o9P8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xIVJ4d0o9P8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Johnny Tsunami is a film about a carefree Hawaiian boy whose life is upended when his parents move to Vermont. But he eventually finds solace in the snowboard community, and enjoys several hijinks in the process. A film made in the good old days when it was OK to name a character after a natural disaster that routinely kills hundreds of people. Look out for the unmade sequel, Jonathan Bushfire.</p> <h2>7. Sammy the Way Out Seal (1962)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQcok9DYnBM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bQcok9DYnBM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Oh Sammy!

Look at you literally being chased by some dogs! Watch this one quick, before someone makes a Blackfish-style documentary about the horrifying reality of using a trained seal in a film.</p> <h2>6. Mr Boogedy (1986)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jCgvKEPKlY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_jCgvKEPKlY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Imagine the wacky adventures you\u2019d endure if you inadvertently came to live in a haunted house. Oh, it\u2019d be so zany! Toasters would fly around the room willy nilly, maybe a mummy would start breakdancing. And then you\u2019d meet silly old Mr Boogedy who \u2026 Jesus christ, is that what Mr Boogedy looks like? God almighty, he\u2019s terrifying. Did he die in an industrial accident? Is that why he looks like that? He looks like Emperor Palpatine with a fungal infection. No. This is far too scary for a knockabout family comedy.</p> <h2>5. Darby O\u2019Gill and the Little People (1959)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X86llfo2Aoo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/X86llfo2Aoo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In which Sean Connery fights some leprechauns.

      "bodyText": "When Disney first announced its all-conquering, Netflix-killing streaming service Disney+, everyone\u2019s mind automatically raced to the big ticket items; the Star Wars, the Marvels, the Frozens, and \u2013 if you were in the right sort of mood \u2013 the Wizards of Waverly Places. However, this week Disney announced the rest of the Disney+ catalogue in the form of a bizarrely long Twitter thread. And while everything can\u2019t be the calibre of Dumbo or Aladdin, the list did somewhat help to remind people that Disney has also made a great swath of crap. Especially confusing were its live-action films, a genre that many moviegoers have completely forgotten about. Best of all, a great deal of these live-action films had incredibly stupid names. How stupid? Glad you asked, here\u2019s a ranking of the 10 most stupid. 10. Sultan and the Rock Star (1980) Technically an hour-long episode of Disney\u2019s Wonderful World, Sultan and the Rock Star is so obscure that the only trace of it to be found on YouTube comes in the form of two women giddily trying to describe it. Nevertheless, Timothy Hutton from Ordinary People and the 1981 PSA Teenage Suicide: Don\u2019t Try It! plays a burned-out rock star who befriends a tiger. It apparently does not end with the rock star being eaten, which is a disappointment. 9. Operation Dumbo Drop (1995) Important point: this has nothing to do with the film Dumbo. Instead it\u2019s a Vietnam war comedy where Danny Glover and Ray Liotta do their best to stop a vengeful warlord from murdering an elephant by dropping it out of an airplane. No, really. 8. Johnny Tsunami (1999) Johnny Tsunami is a film about a carefree Hawaiian boy whose life is upended when his parents move to Vermont. But he eventually finds solace in the snowboard community, and enjoys several hijinks in the process. A film made in the good old days when it was OK to name a character after a natural disaster that routinely kills hundreds of people. Look out for the unmade sequel, Jonathan Bushfire. 7. Sammy the Way Out Seal (1962) Oh Sammy! What a crazy seal you are. Look at you balancing a ball on your nose on command. Look at you standing under a shower! Look at you jumping off a diving board! Look at you literally being chased by some dogs! Watch this one quick, before someone makes a Blackfish-style documentary about the horrifying reality of using a trained seal in a film. 6. Mr Boogedy (1986) Imagine the wacky adventures you\u2019d endure if you inadvertently came to live in a haunted house. Oh, it\u2019d be so zany! Toasters would fly around the room willy nilly, maybe a mummy would start breakdancing. And then you\u2019d meet silly old Mr Boogedy who \u2026 Jesus christ, is that what Mr Boogedy looks like? God almighty, he\u2019s terrifying. Did he die in an industrial accident? Is that why he looks like that? He looks like Emperor Palpatine with a fungal infection. No. This is far too scary for a knockabout family comedy. 5. Darby O\u2019Gill and the Little People (1959) In which Sean Connery fights some leprechauns. To think, in 2019 you will be able to watch a film called Darby O\u2019Gill and the Little People on your computer for free without being arrested for gross insensitivity. This must be what the future feels like. 4. Quints (2000) Less because it\u2019s a film with a silly premise or bizarre title. More because the title font of Quints is so badly designed that you\u2019ll think it says the C-word the first 25 times you look at it: 3. The Ugly Dachshund (1966) You\u2019ll remember the story of The Ugly Duckling, about a swan who thought it was a duck. Well, here\u2019s The Ugly Dachshund, a film about a dog that thinks it\u2019s a different kind of dog! Variety called it a \u201cthin, contrived, one-joke comedy\u201d, but don\u2019t let that stop you. Unless you\u2019re not keen on the idea of dozens of people wildly overreacting to the sight of a relatively large dog, in which case please let it stop you. 2. Justin Morgan Had a Horse (1972) Again, Justin Morgan Had a Horse is so obscure that it\u2019s only online in the form of those women discussing it. But relax, because it\u2019s clear what Justin Morgan Had a Horse is about. It\u2019s about Justin Morgan, who had a horse. But wait. \u201cHad\u201d. Why is this in the past tense?

He feared the practice was setting the students up to fail, posing a risk to their welfare and jeopardising academic integrity.</p> <p>The group of academics previously wrote to Murdoch University\u2019s vice-chancellor, Eeva Leinonen, in May, expressing concern about the response to the allegations, particularly suggestions that the Four Corners program had racial overtones.</p> <p>\u201cWe are appalled by your labelling of such criticism as \u2018racist\u2019, which deters from the substance of the debate and comes across as a personal attack,\u201d they wrote.</p> <p>\u201cSchroeder-Turk and his colleagues are trying to protect the international students from exploitation while ensuring the long term reputation of Murdoch University is maintained. We can only conclude that your response is designed to silence concerns for international students\u2019 welfare, as well as those of domestic students and academic staff.\u201d</p> <p>Their letter received no response.</p> <p>The group said the non-response showed the vice-chancellor either saw the concerns as an \u201cintrusion on internal business, or a nuisance to be ignored\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEither way, she is wrong,\u201d they said. \u201cWe consider the attacks on Schroeder-Turk and his colleagues a dangerous precedent. It must be challenged, in order to maintain the ideal of a university as a forum for open debate and fearless exposure of dubious practices within academic institutions in Australia.\u201d</p> <p>The treatment of Schr\u00f6der-Turk has also prompted condemnation from the Australian Institute of Physics, of which he is a member.</p> <p>The institute issued a statement on Tuesday saying it \u201csupported the right of staff and students of academic institutions to respectfully question their organisations\u201d. It said it stood with Schr\u00f6der-Turk, and urged the university to drop its legal action.</p> <p>The case has again highlighted the flaws in whistleblower protections. In many jurisdictions, retaliation against whistleblowers such as Schr\u00f6der-Turk forces them to resort to costly and protracted court action.</p> <p>The opposing institution often has greater resources to sustain a lengthy court case.</p> <p>\u201cWestern Australia\u2019s Public Interest Disclosure Act is one of many laws across Australia which are still overdue for reform to better address these issues,\u201d Griffith University integrity expert, AJ Brown, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/11/murdoch-university-sues-whistleblower-after-comments-on-international-students\">said this week</a>.</p> <p>Murdoch University was approached for comment.</p>",

But the university has launched a cross-claim in the federal court alleging Schr\u00f6der-Turk\u2019s comments damaged its revenue and international student enrolments. It is reportedly suing him for millions in damages. The university\u2019s actions have prompted withering criticism from a group of 23 academics in Australia, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Canada, Switzerland and the United States. In a joint statement to the Guardian, the academics said the legal action was clearly designed to keep Schr\u00f6der-Turk and other whistleblowers silent. \u201cWe are appalled by the continued harassment of Schroeder-Turk,\u201d the group said. \u201cThe legal suit against him is designed to intimidate him, and future whistleblowers into silence. \u201cThis is extraordinary behaviour from senior ranks of an institution dedicated to higher learning.\u201d The academics include three fellows of the Australian Academy of Science, writing in their personal capacity, 10 academics from the Australian National University, four from the University of Copenhagen and others from Sweden\u2019s Lund University, the University of British Columbia, the University of Illinois and the University of Fribourg. During the ABC program, Schr\u00f6der-Turk said the university was admitting international students who did not meet its standards for English. He feared the practice was setting the students up to fail, posing a risk to their welfare and jeopardising academic integrity. The group of academics previously wrote to Murdoch University\u2019s vice-chancellor, Eeva Leinonen, in May, expressing concern about the response to the allegations, particularly suggestions that the Four Corners program had racial overtones. \u201cWe are appalled by your labelling of such criticism as \u2018racist\u2019, which deters from the substance of the debate and comes across as a personal attack,\u201d they wrote. \u201cSchroeder-Turk and his colleagues are trying to protect the international students from exploitation while ensuring the long term reputation of Murdoch University is maintained. We can only conclude that your response is designed to silence concerns for international students\u2019 welfare, as well as those of domestic students and academic staff.\u201d Their letter received no response. The group said the non-response showed the vice-chancellor either saw the concerns as an \u201cintrusion on internal business, or a nuisance to be ignored\u201d. \u201cEither way, she is wrong,\u201d they said. \u201cWe consider the attacks on Schroeder-Turk and his colleagues a dangerous precedent. It must be challenged, in order to maintain the ideal of a university as a forum for open debate and fearless exposure of dubious practices within academic institutions in Australia.\u201d The treatment of Schr\u00f6der-Turk has also prompted condemnation from the Australian Institute of Physics, of which he is a member. The institute issued a statement on Tuesday saying it \u201csupported the right of staff and students of academic institutions to respectfully question their organisations\u201d. It said it stood with Schr\u00f6der-Turk, and urged the university to drop its legal action. The case has again highlighted the flaws in whistleblower protections. In many jurisdictions, retaliation against whistleblowers such as Schr\u00f6der-Turk forces them to resort to costly and protracted court action. The opposing institution often has greater resources to sustain a lengthy court case. \u201cWestern Australia\u2019s Public Interest Disclosure Act is one of many laws across Australia which are still overdue for reform to better address these issues,\u201d Griffith University integrity expert, AJ Brown, said this week. Murdoch University was approached for comment.",

      "bodyText": "Furaha Asani, a young academic at Leicester University, was shocked when her visa application was rejected in August. But real fear set in when she realised Britain plans to deport her in three weeks\u2019 time to the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2013 a war-torn country she has never visited and where the Home Office agrees sexual violence is pervasive. Dr Asani came to the UK on a full scholarship to do a PhD on infection and immunity at Sheffield University, and has since been undertaking cardiovascular research at Leicester University. Her father was from the DRC, but fled in 1968 because as a student activist, his life was at risk. Asani grew up in Nigeria. Although she has a Congolese passport, she has never been to the DRC, which has one of the worst human rights records in the world. She does not speak the main language and knows no one there. \u201cA week after my visa rejection I had another letter from the Home Office saying I didn\u2019t have any right to appeal from within the UK and I would be deported to the DRC if I didn\u2019t go,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was an extremely scary letter. I was shaking and felt I would throw up. The idea of being sent there is so frightening.\u201d Her case will add to mounting anger among academics, who say the hostile immigration environment is making Britain unattractive to talented researchers. Last month the Guardian reported that an American music historian, Dr Elizabeth Ford, who was about to start a fellowship at Oxford University, was given two weeks to leave after eight years in the UK. Also last month, the Home Office refused visas for the young children of Prof Amber Murrey, a second American academic at Oxford, to live with her in the UK. Now the Guardian can reveal that the Home Office has also refused to admit the nine-year-old son of another Oxford academic, Dr Wesam Hassan, a GP from Egypt. Hassan, who has started a PhD at Oxford, learned this summer that her son would not be granted a visa. Her husband is a humanitarian coordinator for the United Nations in Yemen, designated a \u201cnon-family station\u201d because of the conflict there, so their son is being forced to live apart from both parents, with his aunt in Egypt. She says the Home Office has caused \u201ctrauma\u201d by wrenching her family apart. Meanwhile, Dr Asani believes that as a single woman she will be in great danger if forced to go to the DRC. The Home Office website has a report on gender-based violence in the DRC, which cites multiple reports saying sexual and other violence against women is \u201cwidespread\u201d and \u201cpervasive\u201d. It references research commissioned by the Swedish embassy in collaboration with the UK government in 2014, which concludes: \u201cThe extent of sexual violence in DRC is horrific and shows no sign of reducing.\u201d The Foreign Office has posted strong warnings about the risks of travelling to the DRC. \u201cThey said that because I have lived in Nigeria I will have no trouble establishing a life in the DRC,\u201d Asani says. \u201cThat seems incredibly ignorant. For a start, unlike Nigeria, which was a British colony, they speak French, and I only speak English. I don\u2019t know how I would find somewhere to stay, let alone get a job. I don\u2019t know anyone there. How would I even ask for help if I needed it?\u201d Asani does not have the option of returning to Nigeria as her family was on a temporary residence permit there, which they had to renew each year. When she visits her mother, a dental surgeon in Nigeria, she now has to apply for a visitor\u2019s visa. The Nigerian embassy has made it clear they intend to refuse her most recent application for a visitor\u2019s permit, in part because they are concerned about her UK visa running out. \u201cThe UK government says they don\u2019t believe this, but I sent them extensive documentary evidence proving it,\u201d she says. Now, because her UK visa has been declined, Asani has lost a new job as an academic skills consultant at Leicester. \u201cI am a gifted and passionate teacher,\u201d she says. \u201cThis would have been a chance to work with students doing what I loved.\u201d The Home Office says Asani has until 7 November to leave or they will deport her to the DRC. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I will fight this but I will fight it. I am trying to raise enough money to go to judicial review,\u201d she says. Dr Gareth Brown, secretary of the Leicester branch of the University and College Union, says: \u201cIt is staggering. This is not a complicated situation in which the Home Office has had to take a tough decision. She isn\u2019t even from the DRC. They should admit their mistake.\u201d Sanaz Raji, founder of the campaign group Unis Resist Border Controls, says Leicester\u2019s management have \u201ccompletely discarded\u201d Asani. \u201cFuraha has been left in this really desperate and precarious state and they have just pushed her aside.\u201d The university declined to comment on Asani\u2019s case but said Leicester was \u201cfully committed to inclusivity \u2026 however, we are unable to influence decisions made by the Home Office\u201d. Meanwhile in Oxford, Dr Hassan is desperately missing her son. When she applied for his dependent child visa, including supporting letters from the UN about her husband\u2019s position in Yemen, it hadn\u2019t occurred to her the visa might be refused. She had secured a graduate flat for them both, which her husband would be given leave to visit monthly, and applied to schools. \u201cI went to collect his visa as it hadn\u2019t arrived, and instead I found a letter addressed to him \u2013 although he is only nine \u2013 rejecting his application. That caused so much trauma and a lot of crying,\u201d she says. \u201cHe is finding this really difficult, but he has learned to hold some of it in. He is telling me not to worry and to enjoy my time in Oxford. When you hear your child saying that from so far away, you wonder \u2018how does he really feel?\u2019\u201d Under the immigration rules, a child may only be given a visa if both parents are living in the UK, unless the parent living here has sole parental responsibility. Despite Hassan\u2019s husband being unable to have his family with him in Yemen, the Home Office said there was no evidence of exceptional circumstances. \u201cThey should at least ask for an interview with the family before deciding to break them apart, and before deciding what is best for the child,\u201d Hassan says. Anne Morris, an immigration lawyer with more than 25 years of advising clients in the education sector, says that the UK immigration system is \u201cfailing academia\u201d. \u201cVisa processing is protracted, expensive and unpredictable, undermining the efforts of educational institutions to attract and retain global academic talent.\u201d The Guardian approached the Home Office but it did not comment in time for publication.",

      "body": "<p>The 1835 Treaty of New Echota precipitated tens of thousands of Cherokee joining the infamous Trail of Tears \u2013 giving up their ancestral homes in the south-east, to trek to what is now Oklahoma.</p> <p>In a minor concession to the Cherokee people, buried within the treaty was a promise that the nation could appoint a delegate to the House of Representatives, to have at least some sort of say in the government that had forced them for their land.</p> <p>Over the next two centuries, as the Cherokee struggled to establish themselves in Oklahoma, sought to overcome the trauma of being forced from their land, and the country went through a brutal civil war, the notion of sending a Cherokee representative to Washington DC was largely forgotten.</p> <p>Until now. This month the principal chief of the Cherokee nation, Chuck Hoskin, appointed Kimberly Teehee as delegate to Congress \u2013 taking the federal government up on its nearly 200-year-old offer.</p> <p>\u201cI feel we are in an environment now where Congress is more educated about Native American issues,\u201d Teehee said.</p> <p>\u201cWe have four members of Congress, people who are citizens of federally recognised tribes, who take on our issues and champion our issues. There is a bipartisan Congressional Native American caucus, whose job is to educate, on a bipartisan basis, members of Congress about Native American issues.\u201d</p> <p>The Cherokee Nation has never sent a delegate to Congress before. While they are hopeful the House will honor the terms of the New Echota treaty, there will be a wait before \u2013 hopefully \u2013 Teehee can take up her post.</p> <p>If she does, she will be able to advocate for the nearly 380,000 citizens of the Cherokee Nation, which spans almost 7,000 square miles in Oklahoma. The nation has its own elected government, but is reliant on the federal government financially. In 2019, Hoskin said, the Cherokee nation is thriving compared with previous decades. That influenced the decision to push for further representation.</p> <p>\u201cThe Cherokee Nation is in a position of relative strength, both political strength and economic strength, with the wellbeing of our citizens on the rise,\u201d Hoskin said.</p> <p>\u201cI think now is the time to assert this treaty provision, so that we can do more than what we\u2019ve done in recent decades. We\u2019re sort of standing outside of the Congress and advocating for our needs and for the government of the United States to live up to its obligations. [Now we could be] be inside Congress, and do what our ancestors contemplated when they negotiated those terms.\u201d</p> <p>While the Cherokee Nation is self-governing, running and managing its own schools, hospitals and infrastructure programs, it relies on grants from the government. That funding comes from the \u201cdiscretionary funding\u201d portion of the budget. But the amount of discretionary funding can wax and wane depending on negotiations between Congress and the president, or the state of the economy.</p> <p>\u201cSo, depending on the political dynamics, you know, there may be a contraction in any given year of the discretionary spending in this country,\u201d Hoskin said.</p> <p>Changing that will be one of the key aims for the Nation, and Teehee. Currently a main path to introducing legislation is through approaching sympathetic members of Congress. With a delegate, the Cherokee Nation would be able to bring in their own bills, which could potentially lead to a vote in Congress.</p> <p>Professor Lindsay Robertson, Chickasaw Nation endowed chair in Native American law at the University of Oklahoma, said the impact of having a delegate in the House should not be underestimated.</p> <p>\u201cIt could be enormously beneficial,\u201d Robertson said.</p> <p>\u201c[The delegate] would be entitled to membership in committees. They could vote in committees, they could introduce legislation and they could speak on the floor of the House of Representatives.</p> <p>\u201cOn top of that, there\u2019s the benefit that comes from simply being in the room. The Cherokees having a delegate \u2013 who could well opt to serve as a representative for Indian country, for Native rights in general \u2013 in the halls of Congress all the time could be enormously beneficial to all tribes, not just the Cherokees.\u201d</p> <p>Hoskin said that \u201ceven though the Cherokee Nation congressional delegate is first and foremost and advocate for the Cherokee Nation\u201d, he expects that being afforded a delegate to Congress is something that can help Native Americans across the US. He says his efforts have been applauded by other tribes.</p> <p>\u201cIn 2019, I think tribal leaders recognize the benefit of solidarity: that we get more done together than we do separately,\u201d Hoskin said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd so I have been very careful to tell tribal leaders and to express in interviews that my expectation is that Kim Teehee will be somebody with an open door to leaders across Indian country.</p> <p>\u201cAnd no doubt some of the issues that she\u2019ll work on will be issues that are of concern not just to the Cherokee Nation but across tribal governments in this country.\u201d</p> <p>The question now is whether politicians in Washington decide to let Teehee take up her post. The House could decide on its own that it is able to appoint a Cherokee delegate, but members could also deem that the Senate, and perhaps even the president also need to agree.</p> <p>Teehee is optimistic she will be appointed, but knows that process will take time. In the meantime, she said she will push Congress to grant the Cherokee Nation the right that was promised in 1835.</p> <p>\u201cI want to take one step at a time, I don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves. But I also want the discussion and the analysis and the process to keep moving. I hope that there\u2019s no stall and that we\u2019re all continuing to be motivated about this,\u201d Teehee said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve nearly 200 years, and we can wait a little longer. But I do want it done.\u201d</p>",

There is a bipartisan Congressional Native American caucus, whose job is to educate, on a bipartisan basis, members of Congress about Native American issues.\u201d The Cherokee Nation has never sent a delegate to Congress before. While they are hopeful the House will honor the terms of the New Echota treaty, there will be a wait before \u2013 hopefully \u2013 Teehee can take up her post. If she does, she will be able to advocate for the nearly 380,000 citizens of the Cherokee Nation, which spans almost 7,000 square miles in Oklahoma. The nation has its own elected government, but is reliant on the federal government financially. In 2019, Hoskin said, the Cherokee nation is thriving compared with previous decades. That influenced the decision to push for further representation. \u201cThe Cherokee Nation is in a position of relative strength, both political strength and economic strength, with the wellbeing of our citizens on the rise,\u201d Hoskin said. \u201cI think now is the time to assert this treaty provision, so that we can do more than what we\u2019ve done in recent decades. We\u2019re sort of standing outside of the Congress and advocating for our needs and for the government of the United States to live up to its obligations. [Now we could be] be inside Congress, and do what our ancestors contemplated when they negotiated those terms.\u201d While the Cherokee Nation is self-governing, running and managing its own schools, hospitals and infrastructure programs, it relies on grants from the government. That funding comes from the \u201cdiscretionary funding\u201d portion of the budget. But the amount of discretionary funding can wax and wane depending on negotiations between Congress and the president, or the state of the economy. \u201cSo, depending on the political dynamics, you know, there may be a contraction in any given year of the discretionary spending in this country,\u201d Hoskin said. Changing that will be one of the key aims for the Nation, and Teehee. Currently a main path to introducing legislation is through approaching sympathetic members of Congress. With a delegate, the Cherokee Nation would be able to bring in their own bills, which could potentially lead to a vote in Congress. Professor Lindsay Robertson, Chickasaw Nation endowed chair in Native American law at the University of Oklahoma, said the impact of having a delegate in the House should not be underestimated. \u201cIt could be enormously beneficial,\u201d Robertson said. \u201c[The delegate] would be entitled to membership in committees. They could vote in committees, they could introduce legislation and they could speak on the floor of the House of Representatives. \u201cOn top of that, there\u2019s the benefit that comes from simply being in the room. The Cherokees having a delegate \u2013 who could well opt to serve as a representative for Indian country, for Native rights in general \u2013 in the halls of Congress all the time could be enormously beneficial to all tribes, not just the Cherokees.\u201d Hoskin said that \u201ceven though the Cherokee Nation congressional delegate is first and foremost and advocate for the Cherokee Nation\u201d, he expects that being afforded a delegate to Congress is something that can help Native Americans across the US. He says his efforts have been applauded by other tribes. \u201cIn 2019, I think tribal leaders recognize the benefit of solidarity: that we get more done together than we do separately,\u201d Hoskin said. \u201cAnd so I have been very careful to tell tribal leaders and to express in interviews that my expectation is that Kim Teehee will be somebody with an open door to leaders across Indian country. \u201cAnd no doubt some of the issues that she\u2019ll work on will be issues that are of concern not just to the Cherokee Nation but across tribal governments in this country.\u201d The question now is whether politicians in Washington decide to let Teehee take up her post. The House could decide on its own that it is able to appoint a Cherokee delegate, but members could also deem that the Senate, and perhaps even the president also need to agree. Teehee is optimistic she will be appointed, but knows that process will take time. In the meantime, she said she will push Congress to grant the Cherokee Nation the right that was promised in 1835. \u201cI want to take one step at a time, I don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves. But I also want the discussion and the analysis and the process to keep moving. I hope that there\u2019s no stall and that we\u2019re all continuing to be motivated about this,\u201d Teehee said. \u201cWe\u2019ve nearly 200 years, and we can wait a little longer. But I do want it done.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Once you cyborg, you never go borg? We\u2019ll see. This week I am testing a sleep robot (\u00a3549, <a href=\"https://shop.meetsomnox.com/\" title=\"\">meetsomnox.com</a>) that aims to banish insomnia, aiding natural rest and reducing stress. It is an example of soft robotics, and could be revolutionary in the field: most tech is hard-edged, and many overnight devices merely track sleep rather than promoting it. Somnox describes itself as a \u201csleep companion.\u201d The kidney-shaped, possibly sentient cushion breathes softly in and out, and plays calming noises. The idea is that users hold it close to them in bed, building up an emotional bond over time. Every night, you breathe together in time until you fall sleep, perchance to dream of electric sheep.</p> <p>There is obvious industry and sophistication here. The product is made of high-quality material, with nothing extraneous in the design. It is heavy \u2013 like organic-material heavy. It is the weight of a baby. And it is comforting, cushioned with foam and soft, thick fabric. We climb into bed and I switch it on. A warm light within the fabric comes to life, pulsing in and out. The robot has a soft belly part, which gently expands and deflates, with a noise like a discreet ventilator. I start getting a strange feeling in my belly, too. \u201cCreating life is our design philosophy\u201d is the chilling strapline printed on the \u201cbirth certificate\u201d included with each purchase. \u201cIt took us nine months to create your new sleep companion, just like a real baby.\u201d (I hope the process wasn\u2019t exactly the same.) It is a weird timeframe. Nine months to R&amp;D, prototype, test and market a complex robot sounds insufficient. Unless they are talking about the manufacture of the specific item I am holding, in which case that is way too long. You couldn\u2019t scale a cookie business if each biscuit took a month to make.</p> <p>Creating life may be Somnox\u2019s focus; I wish it was creating apps. Their one doesn\u2019t work, at least not after the firmware update I installed. The Bluetooth pairing with the robot dropped a few times, and needed to be reinstated; eventually, the app and device stopped recognising each other completely.</p> <p>While it was working, I tried the deep sleep exercise: essentially a timed breathing pattern of longer exhalations. (The other options are nap and relaxation modes.) I selected a few of the soothing musical options, which include \u201cforest walk\u201d, \u201cpink noise\u201d and \u201ccosmic moon\u201d but they didn\u2019t work. Each time, an identical mechanical wheeze emerged from the speaker in perfect sync with the breathing. Like being in bed with a baby Darth Vader. The robot has CO<sub>2</sub> sensors in its head, which adapt to the user\u2019s breathing to help slow it down. But I had to cover the device with the duvet to muffle the maddening noise. My breathing was getting more and more rapid with irritation anyway, until I turned the thing off. This happened the next night, too, and then the app packed up entirely. I was quite relieved, as it had been keeping me awake.</p> <p>Without the in-app exercises, the device still works. Is it nice? It\u2019s more \u2026 odd, this breathing baby-weight. More useful in the daytime, when noise issues aren\u2019t so big an issue. I don\u2019t have a cat, so used this as a substitute, sitting it on my lap with a bowl of minestrone while I watched Friends \u2013 I am aware how lonely this sounds; can we not focus on that? \u2013 and the weight was soothing. The delicate rasp could be purring. If anything, it is slightly more affectionate than a couple of cats I could care to mention, and didn\u2019t wake me up with a claw to the nostril. But frankly I would take the claw, or the empty bed, over this witchetty grub herald of post-human dystopia.</p> <p>The sleep robot feels like an uncomfortable blurring of categories. Soft robotics is not yet a gamechanger in the field of, er, night-time technology and I am glad. I like my robots hard, so they have no place in my bed. Others will have different needs. They may come to rely on Somnox for comfort. I would rather spoon a fork. Not the other way round, I stress.</p> <h2><strong>The Times</strong><strong> They Are </strong><strong>a-Brandin</strong></h2> <p>It is weird to have a product that comes with a birth certificate AND a manifesto. But maybe all babies should have a manifesto? Never too soon to gain that competitive edge.</p> <h2><strong>Wellness or </strong><strong>hellness?</strong></h2> <p>Hard no-bot. <strong>2/5</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Once you cyborg, you never go borg? We\u2019ll see. This week I am testing a sleep robot (\u00a3549, meetsomnox.com) that aims to banish insomnia, aiding natural rest and reducing stress. It is an example of soft robotics, and could be revolutionary in the field: most tech is hard-edged, and many overnight devices merely track sleep rather than promoting it. Somnox describes itself as a \u201csleep companion.\u201d The kidney-shaped, possibly sentient cushion breathes softly in and out, and plays calming noises. The idea is that users hold it close to them in bed, building up an emotional bond over time. Every night, you breathe together in time until you fall sleep, perchance to dream of electric sheep. There is obvious industry and sophistication here. The product is made of high-quality material, with nothing extraneous in the design. It is heavy \u2013 like organic-material heavy. It is the weight of a baby. And it is comforting, cushioned with foam and soft, thick fabric. We climb into bed and I switch it on. A warm light within the fabric comes to life, pulsing in and out. The robot has a soft belly part, which gently expands and deflates, with a noise like a discreet ventilator. I start getting a strange feeling in my belly, too. \u201cCreating life is our design philosophy\u201d is the chilling strapline printed on the \u201cbirth certificate\u201d included with each purchase. \u201cIt took us nine months to create your new sleep companion, just like a real baby.\u201d (I hope the process wasn\u2019t exactly the same.) It is a weird timeframe. Nine months to R&amp;D, prototype, test and market a complex robot sounds insufficient. Unless they are talking about the manufacture of the specific item I am holding, in which case that is way too long. You couldn\u2019t scale a cookie business if each biscuit took a month to make. Creating life may be Somnox\u2019s focus; I wish it was creating apps. Their one doesn\u2019t work, at least not after the firmware update I installed. The Bluetooth pairing with the robot dropped a few times, and needed to be reinstated; eventually, the app and device stopped recognising each other completely. While it was working, I tried the deep sleep exercise: essentially a timed breathing pattern of longer exhalations. (The other options are nap and relaxation modes.) I selected a few of the soothing musical options, which include \u201cforest walk\u201d, \u201cpink noise\u201d and \u201ccosmic moon\u201d but they didn\u2019t work. Each time, an identical mechanical wheeze emerged from the speaker in perfect sync with the breathing. Like being in bed with a baby Darth Vader. The robot has CO2 sensors in its head, which adapt to the user\u2019s breathing to help slow it down. But I had to cover the device with the duvet to muffle the maddening noise. My breathing was getting more and more rapid with irritation anyway, until I turned the thing off. This happened the next night, too, and then the app packed up entirely. I was quite relieved, as it had been keeping me awake. Without the in-app exercises, the device still works. Is it nice? It\u2019s more \u2026 odd, this breathing baby-weight. More useful in the daytime, when noise issues aren\u2019t so big an issue. I don\u2019t have a cat, so used this as a substitute, sitting it on my lap with a bowl of minestrone while I watched Friends \u2013 I am aware how lonely this sounds; can we not focus on that? \u2013 and the weight was soothing. The delicate rasp could be purring. If anything, it is slightly more affectionate than a couple of cats I could care to mention, and didn\u2019t wake me up with a claw to the nostril. But frankly I would take the claw, or the empty bed, over this witchetty grub herald of post-human dystopia. The sleep robot feels like an uncomfortable blurring of categories. Soft robotics is not yet a gamechanger in the field of, er, night-time technology and I am glad. I like my robots hard, so they have no place in my bed. Others will have different needs. They may come to rely on Somnox for comfort. I would rather spoon a fork. Not the other way round, I stress. The Times They Are a-Brandin It is weird to have a product that comes with a birth certificate AND a manifesto. But maybe all babies should have a manifesto? Never too soon to gain that competitive edge. Wellness or hellness? Hard no-bot. 2/5",

There are some nifty plot reversals and some solid action sequences, even if they do suffer somewhat from the inevitable big-screen comparison. With a tighter budget and mostly style-free direction, there\u2019s a workmanlike quality to the fights, which are fast and violent but undeniably lesser. There\u2019s also a misguided nod to the original\u2019s famed Parisian car chase with a Paris-set repeat that fails to threaten the pulse in quite the same way. There are also other comparisons that prove unfortunate outside of the Bourne franchise. Since the end of the series, Homecoming and Killing Eve have taken elements of the Robert Ludlum set-up and gone to intriguing, subversive and most notably, stylish, new places. Treadstone is the far more simplistic and far less cool cousin, in both its direction and its dialogue, a show in need of an added oomph to turn it into something really special. But as it stands, as a show we really didn\u2019t need in the first place, it\u2019s a pacy and entertaining journey that does more than it could have done with the loose pitch of finding a way to force Bourne back on to the small screen (he was originally played by Richard Chamberlain in a 1988 miniseries). It\u2019s not a mere rehash, boasting a decent amount of ambition, not something we often find in the world of sequels, prequels and extended universes, and that\u2019s something worth fighting for. Treadstone premieres on USA on 15 October and will be shown on Amazon in the UK next year",

By contrast, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/12/why-are-rape-prosecutions-at-a-10-year-low-england-wales\">the number of convictions for rape plunged</a> over the same period \u2013 from 2,635 in 2017-18 to 1,925 in 2018-19.</p> <p>Kate Ellis, a solicitor at the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice in London, is convinced #MeToo has had a direct effect. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraged people to feel able to come forward, but whether procedures are ready in this country [to handle complaints] is another question,\u201d she told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cThe rise in reporting to the police is very significant and that\u2019s probably an indication of victims feeling they will be believed and supported. I have clients say to me they were victims of sexual offences but didn\u2019t report it. Then around the time of #MeToo they decided they had to go to the police.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, it has been accompanied by a pushback \u2013 people saying: \u2018How do we know these are true?\u2019 or that we shouldn\u2019t blindly believe everyone who makes a report.\u201d</p> <p>Britain\u2019s libel laws, she added, made it more difficult for allegations and suspicions to be aired without the risk of being sued. \u201c#MeToo became about raising awareness of the prevalence of sexual violence and harassment,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s much more difficult to do in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>One #MeToo-inspired case being fought through the London courts involves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/26/king-blues-singer-itch-jonny-fox-suing-five-women-over-sexual-predator-allegations\">five women who posted allegations online</a> that the singer/rapper Jonny Fox was a \u201csexual predator\u201d and emotionally abusive. They are facing a multiple libel claim of up to \u00a360,000 from Fox, who denies all the claims.</p> <p>Suzanne McKie QC, whose firm Farore Law specialises in discrimination, equalities and employment cases, said the impact had sometimes been counterproductive. \u201cA number of male managers in corporate organisations have said to me they are not recruiting attractive women any more,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s their way of dealing with it. There was always going to be a backlash \u2013 as there was to feminism.\u201d</p> <p>McKie said she also heard comments about \u201cwomen complaining too readily\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s gone a bit too far, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d She sometimes represents men in employment cases involving allegations of sexual harassment.</p> <p>A greater willingness to believe that male managers are capable of misconduct at work may not always translate into better justice, she said. \u201cSome companies may be compensating for what they failed to do in the past.\u201d</p> <p>She has handled two recent cases, she said, where male executives were sacked \u201con grounds that might not previously have led to them being dismissed\u201d.</p> <p>Men, she said, tended to settle in sexual harassment employment disputes because they did not want to be identified. \u201cThe difficulty in these cases is the reputational consequences.\u201d</p> <p>Women often cannot afford to take complaints to employment tribunals. McKie, who is qualified as both a barrister and solicitor, regularly appears on a no-win, no-fee basis. #MeToo has brought her more business, she believes. \u201cIt\u2019s gone up 300% or 400% in the last two years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot out there,\u201d she said. \u201cFirms tend not to investigate.

      "bodyText": "The clearest impact of the #MeToo movement on the British justice system has been a sharp rise in the number of complaints made to police of rape and sexual assault over the past two years. That surge, however, has coincided with a chaotic response by police and prosecutors, who have been engulfed in problems over disclosure and allegations they have refined their approach to the crime in order to improve conviction rates, although this has been denied by the Crown Prosecution Service. The number of rapes, for example, reported to police in England and Wales, which was already on an upwards trajectory, surged by almost 13,000 to 54,045 in 2017-18, compared with 41,186 the previous year. They leaped by a further 9% to 58,657 the following year. By contrast, the number of convictions for rape plunged over the same period \u2013 from 2,635 in 2017-18 to 1,925 in 2018-19. Kate Ellis, a solicitor at the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice in London, is convinced #MeToo has had a direct effect. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraged people to feel able to come forward, but whether procedures are ready in this country [to handle complaints] is another question,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cThe rise in reporting to the police is very significant and that\u2019s probably an indication of victims feeling they will be believed and supported. I have clients say to me they were victims of sexual offences but didn\u2019t report it. Then around the time of #MeToo they decided they had to go to the police. \u201cHowever, it has been accompanied by a pushback \u2013 people saying: \u2018How do we know these are true?\u2019 or that we shouldn\u2019t blindly believe everyone who makes a report.\u201d Britain\u2019s libel laws, she added, made it more difficult for allegations and suspicions to be aired without the risk of being sued. \u201c#MeToo became about raising awareness of the prevalence of sexual violence and harassment,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s much more difficult to do in the UK.\u201d One #MeToo-inspired case being fought through the London courts involves five women who posted allegations online that the singer/rapper Jonny Fox was a \u201csexual predator\u201d and emotionally abusive. They are facing a multiple libel claim of up to \u00a360,000 from Fox, who denies all the claims. Suzanne McKie QC, whose firm Farore Law specialises in discrimination, equalities and employment cases, said the impact had sometimes been counterproductive. \u201cA number of male managers in corporate organisations have said to me they are not recruiting attractive women any more,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s their way of dealing with it. There was always going to be a backlash \u2013 as there was to feminism.\u201d McKie said she also heard comments about \u201cwomen complaining too readily\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s gone a bit too far, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d She sometimes represents men in employment cases involving allegations of sexual harassment. A greater willingness to believe that male managers are capable of misconduct at work may not always translate into better justice, she said. \u201cSome companies may be compensating for what they failed to do in the past.\u201d She has handled two recent cases, she said, where male executives were sacked \u201con grounds that might not previously have led to them being dismissed\u201d. Men, she said, tended to settle in sexual harassment employment disputes because they did not want to be identified. \u201cThe difficulty in these cases is the reputational consequences.\u201d Women often cannot afford to take complaints to employment tribunals. McKie, who is qualified as both a barrister and solicitor, regularly appears on a no-win, no-fee basis. #MeToo has brought her more business, she believes. \u201cIt\u2019s gone up 300% or 400% in the last two years.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot out there,\u201d she said. \u201cFirms tend not to investigate. They say it\u2019s a police matter. But employers should still be doing investigations.\u201d A government consultation on sexual harassment in the workplace, which closed on 2 October, is considering whether existing laws provide sufficient protection. Within the legal profession itself, there has been growing concern about the problem. Sexual harassment of younger barristers is not being reported because pupils and junior lawyers fear their careers will be damaged if they complain, Prof Jo Delahunty QC suggested in a public lecture at Gresham College in central London last year. A lawyers\u2019 organisation called Behind the Gown, inspired by the #MeToo movement, held an inaugural meeting in May 2018 and raised complaints of inappropriate behaviour and discriminatory conduct by judges, QCs and senior lawyers. In May, the London-based International Bar Association published a survey of almost 7,000 lawyers across 135 countries that reported that bullying and sexual harassment were rife in the legal profession.",

      "body": "<p>Some of the fashion industry\u2019s most feted photographers, including Mario Testino, Bruce Weber and Patrick Demarchelier, have lost huge contracts as a result of #MeToo \u2013 despite their denials of sexual exploitation allegations.</p> <p>Yet two years after the movement began, sources have told the Guardian that while significant progress has been made, there are still \u201crepeat culprits\u201d at work.</p> <p>The #MeToo movement prompted hundreds of accusations of harassment and assault against well-known industry figures, casting a shadow over a world where the accused appeared to have been hiding in plain sight. It prompted assurances from all echelons of the industry that practices would be revised, but there are those who argue that the problem has not gone away and there is still a long way to go.</p> <p>\u201cSome big names have disappeared but there are still photographers who are big flirts and really push it,\u201d says Cyril Brul\u00e9, the chair of France\u2019s National Union of Modelling Agencies and founder of Viva Model Management. Reports of photographers harassing models on Instagram for dates, becoming obsessed with their private lives and being aggressive to get the shots they want are among the complaints still being received.</p> <p>While Brul\u00e9 says his team will not allow models on its books to work with some photographers and briefs them on what is not acceptable, he says it is difficult to achieve widespread control, especially when some of the brands booking the offenders are often small, new companies who \u201chave no idea\u201d about their reputation.</p> <p>Vanessa Friedman, the fashion director at the New York Times whose January 2018 investigation named Testino and Weber \u2013 who have both denied the allegations levelled against them \u2013 said: \u201cWe are at a reflection point and it isn\u2019t easy or simple and I think it is going to take a lot of wrestling and mistakes and reminders.\u201d </p> <p>Having found during her research that everyone \u201cpasses the buck\u201d, Friedman is resolute that all parts of the industry need to identify their complicity.</p> <p>\u201cThe modelling agencies say it\u2019s the brands who book the photographers, the brands say it\u2019s the stylists responsibility because they want to work with [certain] photographers, the photographers say it\u2019s the agent\u2019s responsibility as they should be protecting the models ... if every part of the supply chain, which is complicated and convoluted, doesn\u2019t take responsibility for their own actions and space, then it isn\u2019t going to change,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Friedman\u2019s team was not alone in exposing alleged abusers. In October 2017, the model Cameron Russell took a stand when she shared stories of abuse from more than 60 models on her Instagram account with the hashtag #MyJobShouldNotIncludeAbuse. Harrowing accounts dated back years and ranged from suggestive and uncomfortable language to models being raped on set.</p> <p>The Boston Globe\u2019s spotlight team early last year <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/02/16/beauty-and-ugly-truth/c7r0WVsF5cib1pLWXJe9dP/story.html\">revealed the names of 25 fashion industry professionals</a> who had been accused of sexual misconduct.

      "bodyText": "Some of the fashion industry\u2019s most feted photographers, including Mario Testino, Bruce Weber and Patrick Demarchelier, have lost huge contracts as a result of #MeToo \u2013 despite their denials of sexual exploitation allegations. Yet two years after the movement began, sources have told the Guardian that while significant progress has been made, there are still \u201crepeat culprits\u201d at work. The #MeToo movement prompted hundreds of accusations of harassment and assault against well-known industry figures, casting a shadow over a world where the accused appeared to have been hiding in plain sight. It prompted assurances from all echelons of the industry that practices would be revised, but there are those who argue that the problem has not gone away and there is still a long way to go. \u201cSome big names have disappeared but there are still photographers who are big flirts and really push it,\u201d says Cyril Brul\u00e9, the chair of France\u2019s National Union of Modelling Agencies and founder of Viva Model Management. Reports of photographers harassing models on Instagram for dates, becoming obsessed with their private lives and being aggressive to get the shots they want are among the complaints still being received. While Brul\u00e9 says his team will not allow models on its books to work with some photographers and briefs them on what is not acceptable, he says it is difficult to achieve widespread control, especially when some of the brands booking the offenders are often small, new companies who \u201chave no idea\u201d about their reputation. Vanessa Friedman, the fashion director at the New York Times whose January 2018 investigation named Testino and Weber \u2013 who have both denied the allegations levelled against them \u2013 said: \u201cWe are at a reflection point and it isn\u2019t easy or simple and I think it is going to take a lot of wrestling and mistakes and reminders.\u201d Having found during her research that everyone \u201cpasses the buck\u201d, Friedman is resolute that all parts of the industry need to identify their complicity. \u201cThe modelling agencies say it\u2019s the brands who book the photographers, the brands say it\u2019s the stylists responsibility because they want to work with [certain] photographers, the photographers say it\u2019s the agent\u2019s responsibility as they should be protecting the models ... if every part of the supply chain, which is complicated and convoluted, doesn\u2019t take responsibility for their own actions and space, then it isn\u2019t going to change,\u201d she said. Friedman\u2019s team was not alone in exposing alleged abusers. In October 2017, the model Cameron Russell took a stand when she shared stories of abuse from more than 60 models on her Instagram account with the hashtag #MyJobShouldNotIncludeAbuse. Harrowing accounts dated back years and ranged from suggestive and uncomfortable language to models being raped on set. The Boston Globe\u2019s spotlight team early last year revealed the names of 25 fashion industry professionals who had been accused of sexual misconduct. It spoke with more than 50 models, 60% of whom said they had been \u201ctouched inappropriately during work-related situations, the violations ranging from unwanted kissing to rape\u201d. All of the men accused denied the allegations against them. Since the #MeToo movement began, there have been a number of safeguards put in place to prevent sexual abuse as well as structures to support alleged victims. In early 2018, the owners of Vogue, Cond\u00e9 Nast, released a set of guidelines for photoshoots that prohibit \u201csexual advances or propositions\u201d and \u201cany type of sexual activity or contact\u201d. The Model Alliance (MA) \u2013 formed by the model Sara Ziff in 2012 \u2013 received more than 100 calls to its hotline between October 2017 and July 2018 reporting sexual harassment and assault, and in May 2018 launched The Respect Programme, a legally binding agreement to protect models and end sexual harassment within the industry. Meanwhile, in September 2017, the LVMH and Kering published the Model Charter, which became a central mandate in making \u201cmodels [feel] that the clients were caring about them for the first time\u201d, according to Brul\u00e9, who helped draft it. But, he adds, the charter\u2019s own hotline was dropped as it was not used \u2013 from what he perceives as a continued fear from models of being blacklisted by brands. Jeni Rose, the senior vice-president of IMG Models, who also consulted on the charter, said the #MeToo movement presented an \u201copportunity for us to extend these protections beyond our own client base and to encourage the professionalisation of the industry as a whole\u201d. \u201cOur conversations with industry stakeholders like LVMH, Kering and Cond\u00e9 Nast have led to tangible measures to protect talent \u2013 a first for the industry, and an important step toward ideological and behavioural change.\u201d She adds: \u201cWe have heard that a greater awareness of and attention to standards has percolated throughout the industry and models\u2019 work environments, and that talent feel more empowered to call out behaviour that might have previously been ignored.\u201d",

Asked whether she would consider invoking emergency powers again to introduce more measures to quell unrest, Lam said \u201cwe need very strong reasons\u201d to justify further measures, but also insisted that \u201cwe should consider every measure to end violence\u201d. Chinese president, Xi Jinping, warned during his trip to Nepal on Sunday that \u201canyone attempting to split China in any part of the country will end in crushed bodies and shattered bones,\u201d according to China\u2019s state broadcaster, CCTV. Lam called on ordinary Hong Kong people to support the police, although the increasingly severe police beatings of protesters, media and bystanders in recent months have caused sweeping resentment. Ordinary people yell obscenities when riot police officers are seen on the streets. Lam said her annual policy address, scheduled for Wednesday when the legislature resumes sessions, would launch economic measures to ease the land and housing situation. Mainland Chinese officials have repeatedly said unaffordable housing and employment issues are the \u201croot cause\u201d of Hong Kong\u2019s social unrest, although political scientists say economic sweeteners alone will not solve the city\u2019s political crisis. She condemned the violent attacks on mainland Chinese businesses, shops seen as pro-Beijing, and pro-government politicians\u2019 offices. \u201cTo say these were to fight for freedom and democracy could not be further from the truth,\u201d she said. But she said her government remained committed to holding district council elections as scheduled on 24 November, despite the unstable social situation. Meanwhile, the Communist party mouthpiece Xinhua news agency said \u201cHong Kong has slipped into a dangerous abyss and a critical moment\u201d and urged the business sector and civil servants to shun political neutrality, show their support for the police and refrain from \u201ccondoning the rioters\u201d for ruining the city\u2019s prosperity.",

In response to Turkey\u2019s offensive, Russian-backed Syrian forces have pushed deep into Kurdish-held territory from the south, squeezing civilian populations between two advancing armies.

      "bodyText": "We live in complicated times. Prorogations. Constitutional crises. It is not surprising, therefore, that the government wants to talk to the public about simple things that \u201cmake sense\u201d. Unfortunately, the education policies of the two main(ish) political parties may be feeding the anxious political climate. Take the battle cry of the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, who has set a target that vocational education in Britain will \u201covertake Germany\u201d in the next decade. It is not clear what he means, but British politicians have been saying this since 1868, when Matthew Arnold, inspector of schools, first mentioned it in his reports. Almost every politician who drifts into education compares the UK with Germany \u2013 and usually promises \u201cparity of esteem\u201d for technical training, a vacuous phrase. Given our fractious relationship with Europe the comparison is goading, designed to tap into a latent dislike of other nations, a fire that does not need stoking. Instead, he could have argued we should become more like Germany. But that might involve confronting the cultural and economic reasons why Germany is so much better at non-university routes \u2013 for reasons ranging from industrial relations to the structure of the economy. What it doesn\u2019t involve is yet another press release announcing this year\u2019s \u201cbiggest reform in a generation\u201d, while delivering a few tweaks to qualifications and some extra cash. Things are no better in Labour\u2019s corner. While Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said last month that she would \u201cend tax loopholes\u201d from which private schools benefit \u2013 a good idea \u2013 Labour members went further, endorsing a plan to redistribute the schools\u2019 endowments and properties to the state. The #AbolishEton campaign was born. This smacks of the same naive and aggressive politics as Williamson\u2019s. It would be legally tricky to achieve, with some arguing that it could flout human rights. Remember most private schools are not Eton, and a number exist to cater for small religious minorities. Furthermore, while private school alumni are over-represented in top jobs \u2013 judges, cabinet ministers, senior journalists \u2013 this is changing. Cambridge\u2019s intake is two-thirds state-educated, while the latest intake of MPs overwhelmingly attended comprehensives. We need to keep focused on the bigger point. The critical problem is that the rich hoard educational advantage. Abolish every last private school and it will make no difference in most deprived areas, because there aren\u2019t fancy schools in them, or \u2013 even worse \u2013 because rich people will buy houses near the best state schools and continue educating their children in a closed circuit, this time on the public purse. Given all that, and the amount of time and political capital that abolishing private schools would soak up, it would be better to think about another plan. Why not follow the path taken by India and force private schools to take 25% of their intake free, and without any academic selection, through a random lottery anyone can enter? The state would pay the standard amount for each lottery place that it gives local schools; the other 75% of places could be charged for at any rate the school wishes. In a swoop, the exclusivity of private schools is burst open: no bans and no legal contortions. If that is not enough, push the percentage up to 50%. That might feel uncomfortable for both sides. Those who want to get rid of private schools, and those who want to preserve them, will both feel like losers \u2013 but neither should. While it still leaves a way for families to buy into privilege, their children would be going to a very different sort of school. It would no longer be possible to buy an ivory tower. Living in complicated times is tough. It causes us to want to smash, or squash, or overtake. But attempts to crush imagined enemies almost never deliver long-term change. We may want simpler times but, really, we need smarter ones.",

Save the Children said: \u201cChildren in Syria who have fled Isis-held areas are innocent.\u201d A UK government spokesperson said it would look at all such cases but \u201cthis process is far from straightforward.\u201d The Turkish assault has dented Saudi Arabia\u2019s confidence in Donald Trump, according to the kingdom\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Prince Khalid bin Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud. The ambassador called Trump a \u201ctweet monster\u201d and said: \u201cThe last thing we need is another front of chaos in the region and I think we just got it.\u201d * * * Booker rules torn up \u2013 The judges of this year\u2019s Booker prize have named Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo its first joint winners in almost 30 years. They chose two novels: Atwood\u2019s The Testaments, a follow-up to her dystopian The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, and Evaristo\u2019s Girl, Woman, Other, which is told in the voices of 12 different characters, mostly black women. \u201cThe more we talked about them, the more we treasured both of them and wanted them both as winners,\u201d said Peter Florence, the chair of judges. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t separate them.\u201d The cash prize of \u00a350,000 will be split between the two authors. Justine Jordan, the Guardian\u2019s deputy literary editor, responds: \u201cTwo extraordinary books, then: but it has to be said that this feels like a fudge, weighing a huge event novel against a more obscure choice and trying to have it both ways.\u201d * * * \u2018We need more time\u2019 \u2013 Boris Johnson appears to have edged closer to the parliamentary numbers needed to pass a Brexit deal, with more hardline Eurosceptics and pro-deal Labour MPs indicating they could back a new agreement with the EU. It is likely to become clear within the next few days whether it will be possible to get a deal at Thursday\u2019s European summit \u2013 the government will have to table a motion in parliament by Wednesday if it wants to convene MPs for a Saturday sitting to debate any agreement. There are indications from EU leaders that they think an extension will be needed to allow the complicated talks to stretch into next week. \u201cWe need more time,\u201d said the Finnish PM, Antti Rinne, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency. * * * Tory lobbying for oil firm revealed \u2013 Theresa May and David Cameron each pressed the Bahraini royal family to award a multibillion-dollar oil contract to Petrofac, a company headed by the major Conservative donor Ayman Asfari, the Guardian has established. Asfari and his wife, Sawsan, have given almost \u00a3800,000 to the Conservative party since 2009 as personal donations. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has been investigating Petrofac over suspected bribery, corruption and money laundering. In February this year a former executive pleaded guilty to 11 counts of offering bribes in an attempt to secure contracts in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. * * * Head injury drug breakthrough \u2013 Tranexamic acid, which is cheap and widely available, could save tens of thousands of lives each year from dying of head injuries, researchers say. It slows the breakdown of blood clots and is already used to control heavy bleeding in people who have, for example, been shot or stabbed. New research suggests it should be rapidly administered to patients with mild to moderate traumatic brain injuries, for instance from a car crash. \u201cIf you reduce the bleeding you could save their life because they are bleeding more slowly,\u201d said the study\u2019s co-leader, Professor Ian Roberts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \u201cIf you stop them bleeding it stops them developing a big bruise inside the head which can squash the brain and kill you.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: The Hongkonger\u2019s tale A Hong Kong protester describes why he has returned to the streets, week in week out, in the face of an increasingly brutal crackdown by the authorities. And: Polly Toynbee on the Queen\u2019s speech. Lunchtime read: The DIY pharmacist of Amsterdam When Leadiant Biosciences raised the price of its synthetic liver enzyme CDCA from \u20ac30,000 to \u20ac150,000 year, the Netherlands\u2019 health insurers refused to keep paying for patients\u2019 treatment. So there was only one thing for pharmacist Marleen Kemper to do: make it herself, so that sufferers of a rare genetic disorder known as CTX could continue to receive the drug that gives them back their lives. The respected hospital pharmacist at Amsterdam UMC\u2019s Academic Medical Centre would always be the one to do something like this: at school she watched two classmates get ill and die, and carried into her career in medicine a steely determination to do right by her patients. Leadiant holds the exclusive EU rights to its version of CDCA, but pharmacies are allowed to make (or \u201ccompound\u201d) a prescribed drug on a small scale for their patients. But when you undercut big pharma, things quickly get interesting. Sport Gareth Southgate felt his England players made a \u201cmajor statement\u201d in getting their Euro 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria halted twice as he reflected on a disturbing spectacle that will live long in sporting infamy. Elsewhere, Northern Ireland achieved what England could not as they beat the Czech Republic in Prague and Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 700th career goal when he converted a 72nd-minute penalty in Portugal\u2019s defeat by Ukraine. Michael Cheika has questioned the wisdom of Eddie Jones bringing the Australian rugby league legend Ricky Stuart into the England camp and behind enemy lines in the week of their World Cup quarter-final clash. Josh Adams\u2019s outstanding impression on Test rugby has left him on the verge of a World Cup record for Wales as he prepares for the biggest week of his career. Adams has already scored five tries in Japan. And Ferrari were left to rue shambolic management of their drivers after Mercedes flexed their muscles at the Japanese GP and delivered a near-perfect showing at Suzuka. Business Government attempts to claw back pay and bonuses from executives who presided over the collapse of Thomas Cook are likely to recoup no more than \u00a31m. Directors will appear before MPs today to explain how the company went bust while executives were awarded millions in remuneration. But it is believed that only a fraction will be returned to administrators. Stocks made modest gains in Asia overnight and the FTSE100 looks set to rise as well this morning. The pound is worth $1.262 and \u20ac1.144. The papers The Queen\u2019s speech features prominently on a lot of the front pages today. The i has a large picture of the Queen and the headline: \u201cJohnson\u2019s wishlist\u201d, the Express has: \u201cBoris: I\u2019ll get this amazing country moving again\u201d and the Times reports: \u201cQueen\u2019s speech sets out PM\u2019s election manifesto\u201d. The Telegraph has a large picture of the smiling Queen and the assessment that \u201cJohnson edges closer to Brexit deal\u201d. Racist abuse directed against English football players in Bulgaria leads on some of the front pages including the Mirror: \u201cEngland stand tall against the racists\u201d and the Sun: \u201cBulgar off, you racists\u201d. In other news, the FT leads on \u201cFacebook fears digital currency delay as regulatory hurdles loom\u201d, the Guardian has: \u201cMarch of the \u2018welfare robot\u2019 triggers fears for poorest\u201d and the Daily Mail reports on backlash from customers after Barclays announced it would end cash withdrawals at post offices: \u201c15 million reasons to think again, Barclays!\u201d Sign up The Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.

A globetrotting brand ambassador before that title had really been established, in the early years of the 20th century Dewar enlisted Thomas Edison to direct a film commercial for his White Label blend. It\u2019s possibly why Dewar\u2019s remains among the best-selling blends in the US. The remarkable story forms the heart of the interactive heritage museum at the visitor centre for Aberfeldy, the malt at the heart of Dewar\u2019s blend.

In Deanston, it once meant textile manufacturing. Which is why this distillery wouldn\u2019t look out of place along the Rochdale canal. A Richard Arkwright-designed textile mill, Deanston was transformed into a distillery in 1966. Thanks to the River Teith, the distillery, as with the mill before it, generates its own power. Tour guides point out the ghostly remains of what was claimed to be the largest waterwheel in Europe \u2013 now replaced by turbines.

With its row of workers\u2019 houses and 250-year-old master distiller\u2019s mansion, this is a thrilling distillery experience \u2013 more than 50 people lived and worked here in the early 19th century. In fertile farming country (the Valley of the Brambles responsible for its Gaelic name), you can pick a blackberries in the grounds for an appropriately sweet amuse-bouche before a tour of this Victorian whisky village and a tasting of its juicy, sherry-matured whisky in the darkly inviting tasting bar. <br><strong>Stay</strong> <a href=\"https://www.netherdalehouse.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Netherdale House</a>, doubles from \u00a3110 B&amp;B<br>\u2022 <em>Tours from \u00a310pp, Forgue By Huntly</em><em>, <a href=\"https://www.glendronachdistillery.com/en-gb/\" title=\"\">glendronachdistillery.com</a></em></p> <h2>Clynelish, Sutherland</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b362f1dc8f5c2a5384cd829004d63d9b7c9ee126\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b362f1dc8f5c2a5384cd829004d63d9b7c9ee126/0_384_5755_3453/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samples of Clynelish whiskey inside Brora Distillery, Scotland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samples of Clynelish whisky at its distillery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alena Kravchenko/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So discreet is its setting in farmland above the coast road, that many who pass en route to John o\u2019Groats assume Clynelish is a hydro-electric plant. You can see their point. The 1960s-built distillery eschewed the traditional pagoda-style skyline of the malting roof (which is now mostly a distillery affectation anyhow, as barley is malted off site).

Of the three remaining distilleries, Springbank is the oldest, producing its complex maritime dram on the same fortress-like site in the centre of town since 1828.

A globetrotting brand ambassador before that title had really been established, in the early years of the 20th century Dewar enlisted Thomas Edison to direct a film commercial for his White Label blend. It\u2019s possibly why Dewar\u2019s remains among the best-selling blends in the US. The remarkable story forms the heart of the interactive heritage museum at the visitor centre for Aberfeldy, the malt at the heart of Dewar\u2019s blend. The distillery is on the banks of the Upper Tay, just outside Aberfeldy itself. Stay Brae House, doubles from \u00a3125 B&amp;B \u2022 Tours \u00a310.50pp, Aberfeldy, dewars.com Deanston, Perthshire A steady supply of water doesn\u2019t automatically lead to whisky production. In Deanston, it once meant textile manufacturing. Which is why this distillery wouldn\u2019t look out of place along the Rochdale canal. A Richard Arkwright-designed textile mill, Deanston was transformed into a distillery in 1966. Thanks to the River Teith, the distillery, as with the mill before it, generates its own power. Tour guides point out the ghostly remains of what was claimed to be the largest waterwheel in Europe \u2013 now replaced by turbines. Deanston is the location for film director Ken Loach\u2019s affectionate whisky romp, The Angel\u2019s Share.

With its row of workers\u2019 houses and 250-year-old master distiller\u2019s mansion, this is a thrilling distillery experience \u2013 more than 50 people lived and worked here in the early 19th century. In fertile farming country (the Valley of the Brambles responsible for its Gaelic name), you can pick a blackberries in the grounds for an appropriately sweet amuse-bouche before a tour of this Victorian whisky village and a tasting of its juicy, sherry-matured whisky in the darkly inviting tasting bar.

You can see their point. The 1960s-built distillery eschewed the traditional pagoda-style skyline of the malting roof (which is now mostly a distillery affectation anyhow, as barley is malted off site). However, the 200-year-old distillery buildings \u2013 home to the holy grail of lost malts: Brora \u2013 are being recommissioned by beverage multinational Diageo. The distillery has a dark past: it was built by one of the chief architects of the Highland clearances, the Duke of Sutherland. His hill-top statue looms over this coast, although slabs of its footing are regularly chipped away by those determined to see it tumble. Stay Clynelish Farm, doubles from \u00a380 B&amp;B (\u00a370 a night for two or more nights) \u2022 Tours from \u00a312pp, Brora, malts.com Strathisla, Moray Think you\u2019ve got what it takes to be a master blender? The Chivas Blending Experience (\u00a360) at Strathisla, the oldest continuously operating distillery in the Highlands, will put you to the test. Now owned by Pernod Ricard, whose portfolio includes Chivas Regal, the distillery\u2019s cobbled courtyard leads to a mad professor-style blending lab, complete with bulbous burettes filled with fine malt whisky. Tours make it possible to mix (and keep) your own unique blend. The two-pagoda distillery is atmospheric, with many of its stones snatched from neighbouring 15th-century Milton Castle.

Ardbeg\u2019s tours include a yomp over Islay\u2019s peat-cloaked hills (perhaps by way of the eighth-century Kildalton Cross, one of the finest early Christian crosses in Scotland), with an outdoor tasting and a picnic lunch prepared by the team at the distillery\u2019s restaurant. Round a visit off with a stay at Seaview Cottage, the former home to the distillery manager. Sipping an Ardbeg Supernova with a view of the Atlantic breakers outside your window, peat fire roaring in the stove \u2013 might that be the ultimate Islay whisky experience?

When the distillery was built in the 1790s, Oban was little more than a scatter of herring storehouses, but since then the busy port has grown around it. This pocket-size distillery\u2019s tours offer a rare chance to sample a west-coast style (somewhere between a sweet Speysider and the smokey islands). When the drizzle descends, the lively dramming bar is the place to settle in and see it out before catching a ferry to recently reopened Tobermory distillery on Mull.

Of the three remaining distilleries, Springbank is the oldest, producing its complex maritime dram on the same fortress-like site in the centre of town since 1828. As tours go, Springbank has more to see than most, as the entire production line takes place here, from the malting floor to the bottling plant. Stay Grammar Lodge, doubles from \u00a390 B&amp;B \u2022 Tours from \u00a310pp, Campbeltown, springbank.scot Kingsbarns, Fife Easy-drinking Lowland whiskies can find it it hard to shout above the peaty monsters of Islay or the romance of the Highland drams, and a decade or so ago there were only a couple of distilleries clinging on. But a cluster of new Fife-based ventures point to a resurgence. Kingsbarns\u2019 new visitor centre and restaurant sit within meticulously restored farmsteadings and a 200-year-old dovecot. It\u2019s surrounded by golden fields of barley: the same stuff that you\u2019ll see frothing away in the mash tun. Its first release, Dream to Dram, is a perfect distillation of Fife\u2019s farming heritage, one that\u2019s even managing to lure golfers away from St Andrews\u2019 Old Course, just eight miles away.

Anti-Discrimination New South Wales cited former NT News journalist Alison Bevege\u2019s successful complaint against controversial Islamic group Hizb ut-Tahrir, warning it may not have been able to rule gender segregation in lectures breached sex discrimination laws if the group had invoked the cloak of religion in the federal law. It also warned the medical conscientious objector clauses would \u201cmake it much harder for a wide range of patients, including LGBTIQ+ people, women and people with a disability\u201d to access services including hormone therapies, sterilisation, abortion or contraception. A NSW government spokesman said it was still considering the bill but \u201cconsistency between state and commonwealth legislation is desirable\u201d. The Victorian government has warned the bill may override its attempts to ban gay conversion therapy, a claim dismissed by Porter, despite the fact the bill contains a discretion for the attorney to add to the laws that are overridden by the bill\u2019s protection of religious statements.",

Two months earlier, and just six months after stepping down as prime minister, David Cameron promoted the company during a two-day visit to Bahrain where he met the state\u2019s crown prince. Cameron was flown back to Britain on a plane belonging to Ayman Asfari, Petrofac\u2019s co-founder, chief executive and largest shareholder. Petrofac did not ultimately win the contract. Asfari and his wife, Sawsan, have donated almost \u00a3800,000 to the Conservative party since 2009. The donations were made in a personal capacity. Documents obtained by the Guardian raise questions about how governments should best manage the perceived potential conflicts of interest generated by donations from business figures to political parties.

The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has been investigating Petrofac over suspected bribery, corruption and money laundering for at least two years.

Perhaps Deutsche Bank, who already have a collection of Turk\u2019s drawings on display at their Frankfurt HQ, might like some Piscia d\u2019Artista for the foyer.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m hoping to do,\u201d sums up Turk, \u201cis convert piss into shit.\u201d The artist has, after all, been an alchemist for three decades now, making art from bin bags, apple cores, flat tyres, cardboard boxes, spent matches and other detritus cast in bronze and meticulously painted. He even made cufflinks in resin and 24-carat gold modelled on spat-out chewing gum. Then there was the crushed Transit Van that was the subject of last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theartnewspaper.com/blog/gavin-turk-brexit-is-like-crashing-a-transit-van\">A Brexit Portfolio and Other Transit Disasters</a>, in which he produced silkscreen images riffing on Andy Warhol\u2019s car crash canvases.</p> <p>\u201cWe are what we throw away,\u201d says the man the Financial Times recently called <a href=\"https://howtospendit.ft.com/art-philanthropy/207242-gavin-turk-we-are-what-we-throw-away\">the laureate of waste</a>. For his new exhibition, Letting Go, Turk has picked up around 500 bottles from the streets of London and put rows of them in plywood cases that will be displayed in the windows of the Reflex gallery in Amsterdam. Inside, visitors will be able to see watercolour paintings of crushed water bottles, a pair of bronze cast flattened bottles \u2013 one called Pet, the other Pete, both with an \u00a38,500 asking price. \u201cSomeone posted on Instagram, \u2018I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d spend \u00a38,500 on a discarded bottle,\u2019\u201d laughs Turk.

As his gallery statement puts it: \u201cThe demand in the ironic symbolic purity of water is causing our oceans to be filled with microplastics. PET plastic is highly recyclable, yet big companies believe that consumers would not buy a slightly murky or imperfect bottle. So instead, 93% of all plastic water bottles are newly formed.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have a method. I might drink some water before I go out, and when I get there, I might drink some more</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He tells me: \u201cThe thing about these bottles is that they\u2019ve become so socially unacceptable they\u2019re going to disappear. At which point, my collection will become valuable.\u201d So how do you carry your water, if you\u2019re so clever? \u201cI have a method,\u201d says Turk. \u201cYou see, I might drink some water before I go out, and when I get there, I might drink some more.\u201d It could catch on.</p> <p>The 52-year-old has long been an artist of nothing.

      "bodyText": "\u2018I have a lot of piss,\u201d says Gavin Turk. He\u2019s going to need it. He shows me a drink can he\u2019s made from silver bearing the label \u201cartist\u2019s piss\u201d in several languages as we stand in his studio, fittingly located in Canning Town, London. Turk is planning to fill as many cans like this with his own urine as necessary \u2013 in order to buy, well, a can of excrement made by his hero, the late Piero Manzoni. Before his untimely death aged 29 in 1961, Manzoni \u2013 or so art world orthodoxy has it \u2013 filled 90 tin cans with his own ordure, sealing and labelling it \u201cMerda d\u2019Artista\u201d. In 2012, Christie\u2019s auctioned number 12 , expecting it to sell for \u00a340-60,000. Instead, it went for \u00a3103,250. \u201cThey\u2019d probably fetch \u00a3200,000 now,\u201d says Turk. So you\u2019d better get to work. \u201cI already have,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI\u2019m storing samples in plastic bottles upstairs.\u201d Turk has no idea how much each can will sell for, nor who might buy it, though he does have a roster of possible collectors, including fellow Young British Artist (YBA) Damien Hirst. Perhaps Deutsche Bank, who already have a collection of Turk\u2019s drawings on display at their Frankfurt HQ, might like some Piscia d\u2019Artista for the foyer. \u201cWhat I\u2019m hoping to do,\u201d sums up Turk, \u201cis convert piss into shit.\u201d The artist has, after all, been an alchemist for three decades now, making art from bin bags, apple cores, flat tyres, cardboard boxes, spent matches and other detritus cast in bronze and meticulously painted. He even made cufflinks in resin and 24-carat gold modelled on spat-out chewing gum. Then there was the crushed Transit Van that was the subject of last year\u2019s A Brexit Portfolio and Other Transit Disasters, in which he produced silkscreen images riffing on Andy Warhol\u2019s car crash canvases. \u201cWe are what we throw away,\u201d says the man the Financial Times recently called the laureate of waste. For his new exhibition, Letting Go, Turk has picked up around 500 bottles from the streets of London and put rows of them in plywood cases that will be displayed in the windows of the Reflex gallery in Amsterdam. Inside, visitors will be able to see watercolour paintings of crushed water bottles, a pair of bronze cast flattened bottles \u2013 one called Pet, the other Pete, both with an \u00a38,500 asking price. \u201cSomeone posted on Instagram, \u2018I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d spend \u00a38,500 on a discarded bottle,\u2019\u201d laughs Turk. Naive: like much of Turk\u2019s art, it\u2019s likely to be a good investment. But there is a political dimension to the work. As his gallery statement puts it: \u201cThe demand in the ironic symbolic purity of water is causing our oceans to be filled with microplastics. PET plastic is highly recyclable, yet big companies believe that consumers would not buy a slightly murky or imperfect bottle. So instead, 93% of all plastic water bottles are newly formed.\u201d He tells me: \u201cThe thing about these bottles is that they\u2019ve become so socially unacceptable they\u2019re going to disappear. At which point, my collection will become valuable.\u201d So how do you carry your water, if you\u2019re so clever? \u201cI have a method,\u201d says Turk. \u201cYou see, I might drink some water before I go out, and when I get there, I might drink some more.\u201d It could catch on. The 52-year-old has long been an artist of nothing. His 1991 MA show at the Royal College of Art was called Cave, and consisted of a room empty except for an English Heritage-style blue plaque mounted in a case. It read: \u201cBorough of Kensington, Gavin Turk. Sculptor, Worked Here 1989-1991.\u201d Turk believes the RCA\u2019s then rector \u2013 Jocelyn Stevens, who was soon to become chairman of English Heritage \u2013 took offence, and he thinks that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t get a degree. \u201cI had no idea he was up for that job, so Cave had nothing to do with him. But as he was touring the show with his politician friends like David Mellor, they teased him about the blue plaque and his face went like that shot in Jaws when the shark\u2019s mouth opens really, really wide.\u201d Turk demonstrates and I see right down his throat. But failure allowed Turk to burnish his credentials as what the mild-mannered Guildford-born artist never was really: a YBA bad boy, the Sid Vicious of conceptual art. He actually depicted himself as Vicious in a life-sized waxwork and went on to cast himself in further roles, including French revolutionary Jean-Paul Marat stabbed in his bathtub. He even made a waxwork of himself as Che Guevara, complete with military fatigues. It was due to be displayed in Zaha Hadid\u2019s Mind Zone at the Millennium Dome but it was pulled due to worries of upsetting its sponsor, arms manufacturer BAe-Marconi. Turk insists, however, that he had no wider agenda, saying: \u201cI just wanted a sculpture of Che in the Dome!\u201d But don\u2019t recent protests - for example, Antony Gormley speaking out against BP-sponsored exhibitions \u2013 show the art world is compromised by what some might call dirty money? \u201cI do worry about this, especially because art can be used to sanction space and detoxify brands. And art stands for values that business doesn\u2019t: it\u2019s opposed to hierarchies, for instance. But it\u2019s difficult for me because I want to keep the channels of access open, make art available as much as possible.\u201d For the private view of Charles Saatchi\u2019s Sensation exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1997, Turk arrived dressed as a tramp. \u201cSomething amazing happened as I walked through Soho,\u201d he says. \u201cI suddenly had this space around me.\u201d Was this because of the smell? \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just that.

      "body": "<p>When a pharmaceutical company raised the price of an essential medicine to unacceptable levels, there was only one thing for pharmacist Marleen Kemper to do: start making it herself. When Kemper was in primary school, she had watched two of her classmates get ill. One had a brain tumour, the other contracted an infection in his gut. Both of them died.</p> <p>Kemper was about 10 at the time, and knew she did not want to see another friend perish. She told her parents she wanted to do something that would prevent others dying. She wanted to be a doctor.</p> <p>But training is hypercompetitive in the Netherlands, where Kemper grew up. She didn\u2019t quite have the grades. She liked chemistry, so chose a career in pharmacy instead. She studied for six years and did a residency for another four. She is now a highly respected hospital pharmacist based at Amsterdam UMC\u2019s Academic Medical Centre, a cavernous building crafted out of concrete on the south-east fringe of the Dutch capital.</p> <p>To understand what happened next, you have to understand several things about Kemper. Two of those things date back to her childhood. One was that early experience of losing friends to illness, which instilled in her an urge to do everything she can to make sick people better. The second is that, although she is highly accomplished, Kemper is self-admittedly hard-headed, and has always had a rebellious streak. Sometimes she likes to shock people.</p> <p>Which leads into the third, more recently acquired trait: a steely determination to do right by her patients, whatever the cost. And the cost can be great. In 2017, when the price of a drug used to treat a rare genetic disorder skyrocketed, Kemper was not happy. The result was a dispute that is still going on today, and has spread beyond the walls of the UMC hospital. It has also spread beyond the city of Amsterdam, and beyond even the borders of the Netherlands.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Most of us never have to worry about chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), one of the two primary bile acids produced by the liver. But, for a tiny number of people, a rare genetic trait means they end up short. Having this gene variant prevents the body from creating sterol 27-hydroxylase, a liver enzyme. Without it, the liver won\u2019t convert enough cholesterol into CDCA. The result is an overabundance of other bile acids and substances, which are then pumped out of the liver and through the body, causing untold damage.</p> <p>The illness that results is called cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, or CTX. It can cause cataracts, dementia, neurological problems and seizures \u2013 but it can be treated. Since the 1970s, the pharma industry has been able to produce CDCA, and so people who need it can supplement their shortage. The system worked well; the drug was relatively cheap for such a niche illness. A year\u2019s treatment cost about \u20ac30,000 (\u00a326,000) per patient \u2013 until suddenly it didn\u2019t.</p> <p>In 2017, Leadiant Biosciences, which was supplying CDCA to these patients in the EU, raised the price of its version of the drug \u2013 known as CDCA Leadiant \u2013 to more than \u20ac150,000 per patient per year.</p> <p>The price increase soon had an effect. The Netherlands has an insurance-based health system, and in April 2018, Dutch insurers, who had been paying for 50 or so patients across the country to receive the drug, balked at the increase and refused to pay. Patients who were unable to pay themselves would have gone without treatment, so Kemper \u2013 whose hospital was one of the treatment centres for CTX \u2013 stepped in. Amsterdam UMC would produce the medicine for these patients itself, at cost price.</p> <p>She was upset, she admits. \u201cPatients have a medical need. If those patients with CTX don\u2019t get their medication, they get neurological implications, they get complications with their cholesterol and dementia, epilepsy \u2026 it is an essential medicine.\u201d</p> <p>Anyone wanting to manufacture a drug must get a marketing authorisation to do so. But Leadiant had become the only game in town, the owner of exclusive rights to manufacture CDCA commercially in the EU. Still, there was a solution. Under EU rules, pharmacies can make (or \u201ccompound\u201d) a prescribed drug on a small scale for their patients.</p> <p>So Kemper began researching where she could find the ingredients to make CDCA. It was difficult: in the pursuit of better margins, vast numbers of manufacturing companies have closed their factories across the world and concentrated their efforts in China, where the costs of producing pharmaceutical ingredients are lower. Just one European company manufactures the ingredients to EU standards.</p> <p>Kemper approached them and they declined to supply her the raw material. In the end, she found a Chinese manufacturer instead. She went to the hospital\u2019s executive board and gained approval to manufacture the drug. It cost the pharmacy \u20ac28,000 per patient, per year \u2013 pretty much exactly the same as the price of the drug beforehand.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>CDCA was not initially used to treat CTX. It was originally developed to treat gallstones. This main use of the drug \u2013 which, from the mid-70s, had been sold in the Netherlands as Chenofalk \u2013 became outmoded when the standard procedure to deal with troublesome gallstones became to simply cut out the gallbladder entirely.</p> <p>At the turn of the millennium, Dutch doctors started using Chenofalk \u201coff-label\u201d (ie for a use different from that stated on its official licence) to treat CTX \u2013 a practice that carried on for several years. At this time, in the mid-2000s, a year\u2019s supply of Chenofalk cost less than \u20ac500.</p> <p>But in 2008, Leadiant acquired the rights to Chenofalk, and developed its own version, known as CDCA Leadiant. Then, nine days before Christmas 2014, it succeeded in getting its version classified as an \u201corphan medicine\u201d for treating CTX. That classification gave Leadiant the exclusive right to manufacture its CDCA drug commercially in Europe for the next 10 years. In 2015, Leadiant took Chenofalk off the market. In 2017, the price of CDCA Leadiant \u2013 by now the only remaining CDCA option on the market \u2013 was increased from around \u20ac30,000 per patient per year to about \u20ac150,000.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4dde3372dc5ef8568af294a7636094096029f76a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4dde3372dc5ef8568af294a7636094096029f76a/0_0_4800_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"illustration by Jake Hollings\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Introduced by EU regulation in the year 2000, orphan drug classification is given to drugs that treat serious illnesses that affect fewer than five in every 10,000 people in the EU. Its purpose is to help companies recoup the costs of developing treatments that would otherwise be unlikely to generate a profit. Without it, the pharma industry would not be incentivised to seek new drugs for the rarest diseases. But, in this case, CDCA was already known as a CTX treatment, with Chenofalk having been used off-label to treat it for years. Kemper believes that Leadiant is getting the financial benefits of orphan designation, but for a drug that had gone through development and been released to market long ago. \u201cThere were publications already in the 1980s,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no patents, nothing. It\u2019s really bizarre.\u201d</p> <p>Kemper is not the only one concerned about the price rise and CDCA\u2019s orphan drug status. In September 2018, a lobby group, the Dutch Pharmaceutical Accountability Foundation, asked the Dutch competition authority to investigate the price increase. And this spring Test Achats, a nonprofit consumer-protection organisation in neighbouring Belgium, lodged a complaint against Leadiant with the Belgian Competition Authority.</p> <p>\u201cWe noticed that in 2005, the price for the treatment of a patient in one year was around \u20ac500. Now it\u2019s more than \u20ac150,000,\u201d explains Laura Marcus, legal counsel to Test Achats. \u201cIt\u2019s bad for the sick person but also for the Belgian health system, which is paying most of the [cost of the] treatment.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When a drug company raises the price of its product, and a hospital pharmacy decides not to accept the increase but instead endeavours to compound its own version, undercutting the drug company\u2019s price, things tend to get interesting.</p> <p>In June 2018, Kemper had a phone call from the Dutch health inspectorate. It had received a letter of concern \u2013 who it came from, Amsterdam UMC doesn\u2019t know, although the health inspectorate has said it was acting in response to an enforcement request from Leadiant \u2013 with a long list of things for the investigators to check.</p> <p>Kemper took the news in her stride. She had expected a rocky road. \u201cAs a pharmacist, I am a professional and I know what I\u2019m doing, and we have standards for compounding,\u201d she explains. So she was not worried when, that summer, a team of four inspectorate monitors turned up at the door of her pharmacy in Amsterdam. Two were there to take samples of the raw materials she was using to compound CDCA, and to ensure that all the correct processes were being followed. They rifled through the reams of paperwork and procedures that Kemper had spent hours developing for her staff to follow, while the other two inspectors combed through coverage of the case to ensure that Kemper and her team were not advertising their work, which is prohibited for medicines that have not been given market authorisation.</p> <p>The lab checked out: its processes were up to standard and the paperwork was all in order. But in July Kemper got a phone call that floored her: the inspectorate\u2019s analysis of the raw materials her pharmacy was using to compound the CDCA had discovered that they were not up to snuff. Two components found in it were above allowed limits.</p> <p>\u201cAs a professional you think: what did I miss? It was very emotional, a bit heavy,\u201d she says. In consultation with the board of directors at the hospital, Kemper decided to immediately withdraw the product from patients; the health insurers said they would step in and cover putting the patients back on the Leadiant version of the drug.</p> <p>Kemper personally called the 50 or so patients she was providing with the drug. \u201cThe first one was hard,\u201d she admits. \u201cI expected they\u2019d be angry or something like that. But no, no one [was]. The patients said: \u2018Well, please go on with this job.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The Dutch inspectorate has said that Kemper can resume compounding CDCA provided she can find a raw material that does not contain impurities \u2013 something Kemper is keeping tight-lipped about.</p> <p>So, if she can get the materials she needs, Kemper is hopeful to be able to continue compounding CDCA in the future.</p> <p>But for now, it is back to square one \u2013 paying the full price for CDCA Leadiant.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>These events have had wider consequences. What was initially a dispute inside the Netherlands has bled across borders, with Belgian patients with CTX now being affected. It started with a conversation between the Dutch and Belgian health ministers shortly after Kemper\u2019s production of CDCA was halted, says Thomas De Rijdt, head of pharmacy at University Hospitals Leuven. The Dutch minister wanted to know from his Belgian counterpart why Belgian hospitals were able to make the same drug without any issues.</p> <p>\u201cFor Belgium, we have about 10 patients,\u201d De Rijdt says. \u201cThey are helped with the preparations from our hospital and the University Hospital in Antwerp.\u201d</p> <p>These hospitals had been compounding CDCA capsules for CTX patients for years. Leuven had sourced raw materials that had been tested and approved by a laboratory accredited by the Belgian government. But when the case in the Netherlands entered conversation at diplomats\u2019 dinners, the Belgian government wanted to double-check that its raw materials were OK.</p> <p>It ran a second battery of tests \u2013 with a different accredited laboratory \u2013 which came back with a problem. A single impurity was found. The government ordered a quarantine of the raw material and recalled all the CDCA it had made.</p> <p>\u201cThe patients had to return all their medication,\u201d says De Rijdt. Recalling every capsule of the drug from Belgium, and freezing the work of the only two suppliers in the country, meant that people with CTX were suddenly left without any medicine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/09/why-do-new-medicines-cost-so-much-and-what-can-we-do-about-it\">Why do new medicines cost so much, and what can we do about it?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf you know the disease, you know you can deteriorate very quickly,\u201d says De Rijdt. This was a problem. So, he says, the hospital pharmacists, the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance, the health minister and the pharmaceutical inspectorate hit upon a solution. For a year, the Belgian government would reimburse the costs of Leadiant\u2019s drug, allowing those patients to still be treated. (Normally the government only reimburses a portion of a person\u2019s health costs, and the rest is paid for by the patient or insurance.) Over the course of that year, the relevant authorities would then work together to adapt the requirements a raw material must comply with \u2013 to allow versions of drugs with minor impurities, providing they pose no threat to the patient.</p> <p>\u201cWe have bought time to find a solution with the compounding, because we think by compounding we can save healthcare a lot of money for the same quality of therapy,\u201d says De Rijdt. He hopes to have a solution by the end of this year.</p> <p>But in early September, things took another turn. Wouter Beke, the Belgian consumer affairs minister, used his price-regulation powers to bring down the price of CDCA Leadiant to just over \u20ac3,600 a month \u2013 roughly a quarter of the amount Leadiant was charging. If the drug becomes more cheaply available in Belgium, says De Rijdt, then it could end up being exported and available at a lower price elsewhere.</p> <p>But exactly how this will pan out remains unclear. In the meantime, Beke has urged the Belgian Competition Authority to prioritise investigating Leadiant, following the complaint lodged by Test Achats.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Debate over what constitutes a fair price for drugs is not anything new. Nor is it limited to Europe. Because of his willingness to play the bad guy in the press (and an odd moment when he bought a Wu-Tang Clan record), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/martin-shkreli\" title=\"\">Martin Shkreli</a> has attracted more criticism on drug pricing than perhaps anyone else. In 2015, Turing Pharmaceuticals, of which Shkreli was CEO, raised the price of its recently acquired antimalarial drug Daraprim, also used to treat Aids-related illnesses. A pill went from $13.50 to $750 overnight \u2013 a 55-fold increase.</p> <p>Shkreli\u2019s capitalist tendencies were criticised by almost everyone. This was unlike the situation with CDCA Leadiant \u2013 there was no argument that the increase was to cover Daraprim\u2019s development costs \u2013 and Shkreli himself was unrepentant: \u201cIf there was a company that was selling an Aston Martin at the price of a bicycle, and we buy that company and we ask to charge Toyota prices, I don\u2019t think that that should be a crime,\u201d he told reporters.</p> <p>But the Daraprim situation was just the highest-profile example of a contest that is going on constantly between big pharmaceutical companies seeking to profit from drugs, and medical staff on the frontline who worry that such profit-seeking does damage to patients needing treatment. (For what it\u2019s worth, a competitor to Turing Pharmaceuticals announced soon after that it would produce a compound drug containing the same active ingredient in Daraprim \u2013 pyrimethamine \u2013 for $1 a pill, rather than the $750 Shkreli wanted to charge.)</p> <p>One front in this battle has recently opened up in the US. In May, more than 40 states filed an <a href=\"https://www.law.com/ctlawtribune/2019/05/13/44-ags-file-antitrust-lawsuit-against-pfizer-teva-for-allegedly-fixing-prices-of-generic-drugs/?slreturn=20190914084109\" title=\"\">antitrust lawsuit</a> against some of the world\u2019s biggest manufacturers of generic drugs, alleging that they have colluded to fix the price of more than 100 medicines over a number of years. When prices should go down after a drug\u2019s market exclusivity ended, the antitrust lawsuit claims that many prices have instead shot up \u2013 in some cases by more than 1,000%.</p> <p>Back in Europe, the consumer organisation <a href=\"https://www.consumersinternational.org/members/euroconsumers/\" title=\"\">Euroconsumers</a> \u2013 of which Test Achats is part \u2013 is investigating the prices of other drugs beyond CDCA. \u201cWe\u2019ve noticed a few problems with a few other drugs,\u201d says Laura Marcus of Test Achats. \u201cIt\u2019s often about drugs that are able to cure or deal with rare diseases. For sure, it\u2019s not only CDCA.\u201d</p> <p>No one doubts that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/09/why-do-new-medicines-cost-so-much-and-what-can-we-do-about-it\" title=\"\">developing drugs costs money</a>. A 2016 paper in the Journal of Health Economics estimated that the average cost of developing a prescription drug to the point of reaching the market is nearly $2.6bn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aa464bc9852739d006d25ce25b8984e40a7b5341\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa464bc9852739d006d25ce25b8984e40a7b5341/0_0_3000_4000/750.jpg\" alt=\"illustration by Jake Hollings\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>But the lack of hard, openly available statistics on the cost of drug development is something that many people, including Marcus and Marleen Kemper, want to change. \u201cIn most of the cases, society is willing to pay some price,\u201d says Kemper, \u201cbut now the discussion is: what is an acceptable price?\u201d</p> <p>Marcus acknowledges that Leadiant has to cover its costs, but does not believe that can explain the price of CDCA rising to more than \u20ac150,000 \u2013 \u201cthe profit cannot be that high\u201d. When I ask her how much profit she thought Leadiant was making from the drug, she admits she doesn\u2019t know: \u201cThat\u2019s what the Belgian Competition Authority is opening an inquiry for \u2013 to know more about the costs the company has to bear.\u201d However, when the price for CDCA has surged so much, \u201cnothing justifies it, because there was no new research, no new nothing,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Leadiant rejects this. Although CDCA had been authorised in the past, the company says that \u201cthe active pharmaceutical ingredient as well as the manufacturing of the finished product needed to be upgraded\u201d to make sure that its version was compliant with current EU standards. These, Leadiant says, are more extensive and significantly more strict today than they were when earlier CDCA drugs were developed.</p> <p>Leadiant says that its CDCA \u201cis not a \u2018copy\u2019 of an old product\u201d. The very fact that it gained orphan drug status proves this, it argues. The company also says that \u201cthere was no robust evidence that CDCA was effective in CTX until Leadiant produced the data\u201d. Demonstrating this, it says, required \u201centirely new studies, creating new data sets\u201d \u2013 which make up \u201cthe largest ever collection of clinical data for CTX\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cCDCA Leadiant has been developed and brought to market at substantial cost,\u201d the company says. \u201cOur pricing is justified by our costs and investments.\u201d</p> <p>But the problem is not just that Leadiant\u2019s drug is so expensive: potential alternatives have disappeared. Willemijn van der Wel, a lawyer working at the European law firm AKD, has written about Leadiant\u2019s connection to competitors who previously produced CDCA. After buying the marketing authorisations for other products that contained CDCA, he says, \u201cLeadiant began to withdraw these alternative CDCA products from the market, until only one CDCA medicinal product remained\u201d. Marcus has also queried what has happened to these products that might have been competitors to Leadiant\u2019s. But, she says, it is not clear what is behind their CDCA monopoly.</p> <p>Leadiant, though, says that it is willing to negotiate a lower price for its drug with the Dutch Ministry of Health and Dutch insurance companies. \u201cThe only reason an improvement has not been determined yet, is that the insurers have been uninterested or unwilling to enter into any substantive negotiations,\u201d it claims. (Leadiant did not respond to follow-up questions asking for more details of the negotiations, or what level of price reduction the company was offering.) It also emphasises that it has not taken legal action against the UMC hospital for seeking to compound its own CDCA, but that it is \u201cinvolved in a legal discussion with the Dutch Inspectorate about the interpretation of EU and Dutch medicines law\u201d.</p> <p>Regardless of the outcome of such discussions, something needs to be done. Having pharmacies self-compound medicines is not a sustainable model \u2013 it might reduce incentives for developing drugs for rare conditions.</p> <p>It also exposes patients to risk, Leadiant argues. Pharmacies do not have to have their compounding processes checked by the European Medicines Agency or the national regulator. \u201cThere is no product control by any independent regulatory authority before or after compounding,\u201d Leadiant says.</p> <p>When it comes to market authorisation and orphan drugs, Leadiant says, \u201cit should not be about small or large scale, but safe scale\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Marleen Kemper\u2019s husband warned her that taking on Leadiant would be difficult. \u201cHe said: \u2018With this initiative, don\u2019t be naive,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe pharmaceutical industry is very powerful, so you really have to have back-up from the [hospital] board\u201d \u2013 which she had. More than a year into her attempt to make her own version of the drug, she is recognising just how deeply dug in both sides are.</p> <p>She is at pains to point out that she is not against the pharmaceutical industry: \u201cWhat people forget is that the industry is responsible for a lot of innovation.\u201d But if drug pricing means that patients potentially get left behind? \u201cThen I\u2019m getting angry,\u201d she says.</p> <p>But righteous anger alone cannot sustain someone in a months-long case involving lawyers and regulators, not least when they are also raising a family, running part of a pharmacy that is actively studying hundreds of drugs, and doing their job keeping patients supplied with medicine. At times, Kemper has felt frustrated and worn down by the effort of taking on the price rise \u2013 but she vows to continue.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/26/big-pharmas-worst-nightmare\">Big Pharma\u2019s worst nightmare | Sarah Boseley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSometimes I\u2019ve thought, \u2018Well, I\u2019ll stop and quit doing it because it\u2019s too much work, too emotionally draining.\u2019 But due to the support, I think we\u2019ll go on,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has to be solved, for the patients.\u201d</p> <p>Kemper is determined that she is going to provide affordable care for her patients by following the letter of the law. \u201cI\u2019m using the rules,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not cheating.\u201d Leadiant, she accepts, has used the rules and followed them to serve its own purposes.

      "bodyText": "When a pharmaceutical company raised the price of an essential medicine to unacceptable levels, there was only one thing for pharmacist Marleen Kemper to do: start making it herself. When Kemper was in primary school, she had watched two of her classmates get ill. One had a brain tumour, the other contracted an infection in his gut. Both of them died. Kemper was about 10 at the time, and knew she did not want to see another friend perish. She told her parents she wanted to do something that would prevent others dying. She wanted to be a doctor. But training is hypercompetitive in the Netherlands, where Kemper grew up. She didn\u2019t quite have the grades. She liked chemistry, so chose a career in pharmacy instead. She studied for six years and did a residency for another four. She is now a highly respected hospital pharmacist based at Amsterdam UMC\u2019s Academic Medical Centre, a cavernous building crafted out of concrete on the south-east fringe of the Dutch capital. To understand what happened next, you have to understand several things about Kemper. Two of those things date back to her childhood. One was that early experience of losing friends to illness, which instilled in her an urge to do everything she can to make sick people better. The second is that, although she is highly accomplished, Kemper is self-admittedly hard-headed, and has always had a rebellious streak. Sometimes she likes to shock people. Which leads into the third, more recently acquired trait: a steely determination to do right by her patients, whatever the cost. And the cost can be great. In 2017, when the price of a drug used to treat a rare genetic disorder skyrocketed, Kemper was not happy. The result was a dispute that is still going on today, and has spread beyond the walls of the UMC hospital. It has also spread beyond the city of Amsterdam, and beyond even the borders of the Netherlands. * * * Most of us never have to worry about chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), one of the two primary bile acids produced by the liver. But, for a tiny number of people, a rare genetic trait means they end up short. Having this gene variant prevents the body from creating sterol 27-hydroxylase, a liver enzyme. Without it, the liver won\u2019t convert enough cholesterol into CDCA. The result is an overabundance of other bile acids and substances, which are then pumped out of the liver and through the body, causing untold damage. The illness that results is called cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, or CTX. It can cause cataracts, dementia, neurological problems and seizures \u2013 but it can be treated. Since the 1970s, the pharma industry has been able to produce CDCA, and so people who need it can supplement their shortage. The system worked well; the drug was relatively cheap for such a niche illness. A year\u2019s treatment cost about \u20ac30,000 (\u00a326,000) per patient \u2013 until suddenly it didn\u2019t. In 2017, Leadiant Biosciences, which was supplying CDCA to these patients in the EU, raised the price of its version of the drug \u2013 known as CDCA Leadiant \u2013 to more than \u20ac150,000 per patient per year. The price increase soon had an effect. The Netherlands has an insurance-based health system, and in April 2018, Dutch insurers, who had been paying for 50 or so patients across the country to receive the drug, balked at the increase and refused to pay. Patients who were unable to pay themselves would have gone without treatment, so Kemper \u2013 whose hospital was one of the treatment centres for CTX \u2013 stepped in. Amsterdam UMC would produce the medicine for these patients itself, at cost price. She was upset, she admits. \u201cPatients have a medical need. If those patients with CTX don\u2019t get their medication, they get neurological implications, they get complications with their cholesterol and dementia, epilepsy \u2026 it is an essential medicine.\u201d Anyone wanting to manufacture a drug must get a marketing authorisation to do so. But Leadiant had become the only game in town, the owner of exclusive rights to manufacture CDCA commercially in the EU. Still, there was a solution. Under EU rules, pharmacies can make (or \u201ccompound\u201d) a prescribed drug on a small scale for their patients. So Kemper began researching where she could find the ingredients to make CDCA. It was difficult: in the pursuit of better margins, vast numbers of manufacturing companies have closed their factories across the world and concentrated their efforts in China, where the costs of producing pharmaceutical ingredients are lower. Just one European company manufactures the ingredients to EU standards. Kemper approached them and they declined to supply her the raw material. In the end, she found a Chinese manufacturer instead. She went to the hospital\u2019s executive board and gained approval to manufacture the drug. It cost the pharmacy \u20ac28,000 per patient, per year \u2013 pretty much exactly the same as the price of the drug beforehand. * * * CDCA was not initially used to treat CTX. It was originally developed to treat gallstones. This main use of the drug \u2013 which, from the mid-70s, had been sold in the Netherlands as Chenofalk \u2013 became outmoded when the standard procedure to deal with troublesome gallstones became to simply cut out the gallbladder entirely. At the turn of the millennium, Dutch doctors started using Chenofalk \u201coff-label\u201d (ie for a use different from that stated on its official licence) to treat CTX \u2013 a practice that carried on for several years. At this time, in the mid-2000s, a year\u2019s supply of Chenofalk cost less than \u20ac500. But in 2008, Leadiant acquired the rights to Chenofalk, and developed its own version, known as CDCA Leadiant. Then, nine days before Christmas 2014, it succeeded in getting its version classified as an \u201corphan medicine\u201d for treating CTX. That classification gave Leadiant the exclusive right to manufacture its CDCA drug commercially in Europe for the next 10 years. In 2015, Leadiant took Chenofalk off the market. In 2017, the price of CDCA Leadiant \u2013 by now the only remaining CDCA option on the market \u2013 was increased from around \u20ac30,000 per patient per year to about \u20ac150,000. Introduced by EU regulation in the year 2000, orphan drug classification is given to drugs that treat serious illnesses that affect fewer than five in every 10,000 people in the EU. Its purpose is to help companies recoup the costs of developing treatments that would otherwise be unlikely to generate a profit. Without it, the pharma industry would not be incentivised to seek new drugs for the rarest diseases. But, in this case, CDCA was already known as a CTX treatment, with Chenofalk having been used off-label to treat it for years. Kemper believes that Leadiant is getting the financial benefits of orphan designation, but for a drug that had gone through development and been released to market long ago. \u201cThere were publications already in the 1980s,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no patents, nothing. It\u2019s really bizarre.\u201d Kemper is not the only one concerned about the price rise and CDCA\u2019s orphan drug status. In September 2018, a lobby group, the Dutch Pharmaceutical Accountability Foundation, asked the Dutch competition authority to investigate the price increase. And this spring Test Achats, a nonprofit consumer-protection organisation in neighbouring Belgium, lodged a complaint against Leadiant with the Belgian Competition Authority. \u201cWe noticed that in 2005, the price for the treatment of a patient in one year was around \u20ac500. Now it\u2019s more than \u20ac150,000,\u201d explains Laura Marcus, legal counsel to Test Achats. \u201cIt\u2019s bad for the sick person but also for the Belgian health system, which is paying most of the [cost of the] treatment.\u201d * * * When a drug company raises the price of its product, and a hospital pharmacy decides not to accept the increase but instead endeavours to compound its own version, undercutting the drug company\u2019s price, things tend to get interesting. In June 2018, Kemper had a phone call from the Dutch health inspectorate. It had received a letter of concern \u2013 who it came from, Amsterdam UMC doesn\u2019t know, although the health inspectorate has said it was acting in response to an enforcement request from Leadiant \u2013 with a long list of things for the investigators to check. Kemper took the news in her stride. She had expected a rocky road. \u201cAs a pharmacist, I am a professional and I know what I\u2019m doing, and we have standards for compounding,\u201d she explains. So she was not worried when, that summer, a team of four inspectorate monitors turned up at the door of her pharmacy in Amsterdam. Two were there to take samples of the raw materials she was using to compound CDCA, and to ensure that all the correct processes were being followed. They rifled through the reams of paperwork and procedures that Kemper had spent hours developing for her staff to follow, while the other two inspectors combed through coverage of the case to ensure that Kemper and her team were not advertising their work, which is prohibited for medicines that have not been given market authorisation. The lab checked out: its processes were up to standard and the paperwork was all in order. But in July Kemper got a phone call that floored her: the inspectorate\u2019s analysis of the raw materials her pharmacy was using to compound the CDCA had discovered that they were not up to snuff. Two components found in it were above allowed limits. \u201cAs a professional you think: what did I miss? It was very emotional, a bit heavy,\u201d she says. In consultation with the board of directors at the hospital, Kemper decided to immediately withdraw the product from patients; the health insurers said they would step in and cover putting the patients back on the Leadiant version of the drug. Kemper personally called the 50 or so patients she was providing with the drug. \u201cThe first one was hard,\u201d she admits. \u201cI expected they\u2019d be angry or something like that. But no, no one [was]. The patients said: \u2018Well, please go on with this job.\u2019\u201d The Dutch inspectorate has said that Kemper can resume compounding CDCA provided she can find a raw material that does not contain impurities \u2013 something Kemper is keeping tight-lipped about. So, if she can get the materials she needs, Kemper is hopeful to be able to continue compounding CDCA in the future. But for now, it is back to square one \u2013 paying the full price for CDCA Leadiant. * * * These events have had wider consequences. What was initially a dispute inside the Netherlands has bled across borders, with Belgian patients with CTX now being affected. It started with a conversation between the Dutch and Belgian health ministers shortly after Kemper\u2019s production of CDCA was halted, says Thomas De Rijdt, head of pharmacy at University Hospitals Leuven. The Dutch minister wanted to know from his Belgian counterpart why Belgian hospitals were able to make the same drug without any issues. \u201cFor Belgium, we have about 10 patients,\u201d De Rijdt says. \u201cThey are helped with the preparations from our hospital and the University Hospital in Antwerp.\u201d These hospitals had been compounding CDCA capsules for CTX patients for years. Leuven had sourced raw materials that had been tested and approved by a laboratory accredited by the Belgian government. But when the case in the Netherlands entered conversation at diplomats\u2019 dinners, the Belgian government wanted to double-check that its raw materials were OK. It ran a second battery of tests \u2013 with a different accredited laboratory \u2013 which came back with a problem. A single impurity was found. The government ordered a quarantine of the raw material and recalled all the CDCA it had made. \u201cThe patients had to return all their medication,\u201d says De Rijdt. Recalling every capsule of the drug from Belgium, and freezing the work of the only two suppliers in the country, meant that people with CTX were suddenly left without any medicine. \u201cIf you know the disease, you know you can deteriorate very quickly,\u201d says De Rijdt. This was a problem. So, he says, the hospital pharmacists, the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance, the health minister and the pharmaceutical inspectorate hit upon a solution. For a year, the Belgian government would reimburse the costs of Leadiant\u2019s drug, allowing those patients to still be treated. (Normally the government only reimburses a portion of a person\u2019s health costs, and the rest is paid for by the patient or insurance.) Over the course of that year, the relevant authorities would then work together to adapt the requirements a raw material must comply with \u2013 to allow versions of drugs with minor impurities, providing they pose no threat to the patient. \u201cWe have bought time to find a solution with the compounding, because we think by compounding we can save healthcare a lot of money for the same quality of therapy,\u201d says De Rijdt. He hopes to have a solution by the end of this year. But in early September, things took another turn. Wouter Beke, the Belgian consumer affairs minister, used his price-regulation powers to bring down the price of CDCA Leadiant to just over \u20ac3,600 a month \u2013 roughly a quarter of the amount Leadiant was charging. If the drug becomes more cheaply available in Belgium, says De Rijdt, then it could end up being exported and available at a lower price elsewhere. But exactly how this will pan out remains unclear. In the meantime, Beke has urged the Belgian Competition Authority to prioritise investigating Leadiant, following the complaint lodged by Test Achats. * * * Debate over what constitutes a fair price for drugs is not anything new. Nor is it limited to Europe. Because of his willingness to play the bad guy in the press (and an odd moment when he bought a Wu-Tang Clan record), Martin Shkreli has attracted more criticism on drug pricing than perhaps anyone else. In 2015, Turing Pharmaceuticals, of which Shkreli was CEO, raised the price of its recently acquired antimalarial drug Daraprim, also used to treat Aids-related illnesses. A pill went from $13.50 to $750 overnight \u2013 a 55-fold increase. Shkreli\u2019s capitalist tendencies were criticised by almost everyone. This was unlike the situation with CDCA Leadiant \u2013 there was no argument that the increase was to cover Daraprim\u2019s development costs \u2013 and Shkreli himself was unrepentant: \u201cIf there was a company that was selling an Aston Martin at the price of a bicycle, and we buy that company and we ask to charge Toyota prices, I don\u2019t think that that should be a crime,\u201d he told reporters. But the Daraprim situation was just the highest-profile example of a contest that is going on constantly between big pharmaceutical companies seeking to profit from drugs, and medical staff on the frontline who worry that such profit-seeking does damage to patients needing treatment. (For what it\u2019s worth, a competitor to Turing Pharmaceuticals announced soon after that it would produce a compound drug containing the same active ingredient in Daraprim \u2013 pyrimethamine \u2013 for $1 a pill, rather than the $750 Shkreli wanted to charge.) One front in this battle has recently opened up in the US. In May, more than 40 states filed an antitrust lawsuit against some of the world\u2019s biggest manufacturers of generic drugs, alleging that they have colluded to fix the price of more than 100 medicines over a number of years. When prices should go down after a drug\u2019s market exclusivity ended, the antitrust lawsuit claims that many prices have instead shot up \u2013 in some cases by more than 1,000%. Back in Europe, the consumer organisation Euroconsumers \u2013 of which Test Achats is part \u2013 is investigating the prices of other drugs beyond CDCA. \u201cWe\u2019ve noticed a few problems with a few other drugs,\u201d says Laura Marcus of Test Achats. \u201cIt\u2019s often about drugs that are able to cure or deal with rare diseases. For sure, it\u2019s not only CDCA.\u201d No one doubts that developing drugs costs money. A 2016 paper in the Journal of Health Economics estimated that the average cost of developing a prescription drug to the point of reaching the market is nearly $2.6bn. But the lack of hard, openly available statistics on the cost of drug development is something that many people, including Marcus and Marleen Kemper, want to change. \u201cIn most of the cases, society is willing to pay some price,\u201d says Kemper, \u201cbut now the discussion is: what is an acceptable price?\u201d Marcus acknowledges that Leadiant has to cover its costs, but does not believe that can explain the price of CDCA rising to more than \u20ac150,000 \u2013 \u201cthe profit cannot be that high\u201d. When I ask her how much profit she thought Leadiant was making from the drug, she admits she doesn\u2019t know: \u201cThat\u2019s what the Belgian Competition Authority is opening an inquiry for \u2013 to know more about the costs the company has to bear.\u201d However, when the price for CDCA has surged so much, \u201cnothing justifies it, because there was no new research, no new nothing,\u201d she says. Leadiant rejects this. Although CDCA had been authorised in the past, the company says that \u201cthe active pharmaceutical ingredient as well as the manufacturing of the finished product needed to be upgraded\u201d to make sure that its version was compliant with current EU standards. These, Leadiant says, are more extensive and significantly more strict today than they were when earlier CDCA drugs were developed. Leadiant says that its CDCA \u201cis not a \u2018copy\u2019 of an old product\u201d. The very fact that it gained orphan drug status proves this, it argues. The company also says that \u201cthere was no robust evidence that CDCA was effective in CTX until Leadiant produced the data\u201d. Demonstrating this, it says, required \u201centirely new studies, creating new data sets\u201d \u2013 which make up \u201cthe largest ever collection of clinical data for CTX\u201d. \u201cCDCA Leadiant has been developed and brought to market at substantial cost,\u201d the company says. \u201cOur pricing is justified by our costs and investments.\u201d But the problem is not just that Leadiant\u2019s drug is so expensive: potential alternatives have disappeared. Willemijn van der Wel, a lawyer working at the European law firm AKD, has written about Leadiant\u2019s connection to competitors who previously produced CDCA. After buying the marketing authorisations for other products that contained CDCA, he says, \u201cLeadiant began to withdraw these alternative CDCA products from the market, until only one CDCA medicinal product remained\u201d. Marcus has also queried what has happened to these products that might have been competitors to Leadiant\u2019s. But, she says, it is not clear what is behind their CDCA monopoly. Leadiant, though, says that it is willing to negotiate a lower price for its drug with the Dutch Ministry of Health and Dutch insurance companies. \u201cThe only reason an improvement has not been determined yet, is that the insurers have been uninterested or unwilling to enter into any substantive negotiations,\u201d it claims. (Leadiant did not respond to follow-up questions asking for more details of the negotiations, or what level of price reduction the company was offering.) It also emphasises that it has not taken legal action against the UMC hospital for seeking to compound its own CDCA, but that it is \u201cinvolved in a legal discussion with the Dutch Inspectorate about the interpretation of EU and Dutch medicines law\u201d. Regardless of the outcome of such discussions, something needs to be done. Having pharmacies self-compound medicines is not a sustainable model \u2013 it might reduce incentives for developing drugs for rare conditions. It also exposes patients to risk, Leadiant argues. Pharmacies do not have to have their compounding processes checked by the European Medicines Agency or the national regulator. \u201cThere is no product control by any independent regulatory authority before or after compounding,\u201d Leadiant says. When it comes to market authorisation and orphan drugs, Leadiant says, \u201cit should not be about small or large scale, but safe scale\u201d. * * * Marleen Kemper\u2019s husband warned her that taking on Leadiant would be difficult. \u201cHe said: \u2018With this initiative, don\u2019t be naive,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe pharmaceutical industry is very powerful, so you really have to have back-up from the [hospital] board\u201d \u2013 which she had. More than a year into her attempt to make her own version of the drug, she is recognising just how deeply dug in both sides are. She is at pains to point out that she is not against the pharmaceutical industry: \u201cWhat people forget is that the industry is responsible for a lot of innovation.\u201d But if drug pricing means that patients potentially get left behind? \u201cThen I\u2019m getting angry,\u201d she says. But righteous anger alone cannot sustain someone in a months-long case involving lawyers and regulators, not least when they are also raising a family, running part of a pharmacy that is actively studying hundreds of drugs, and doing their job keeping patients supplied with medicine. At times, Kemper has felt frustrated and worn down by the effort of taking on the price rise \u2013 but she vows to continue. \u201cSometimes I\u2019ve thought, \u2018Well, I\u2019ll stop and quit doing it because it\u2019s too much work, too emotionally draining.\u2019 But due to the support, I think we\u2019ll go on,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has to be solved, for the patients.\u201d Kemper is determined that she is going to provide affordable care for her patients by following the letter of the law. \u201cI\u2019m using the rules,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not cheating.\u201d Leadiant, she accepts, has used the rules and followed them to serve its own purposes. So she will too. \u201cI\u2019m allowed to make medication for patients. They don\u2019t like it? So what. I\u2019m following the rules.\u201d This article was first published by Wellcome on Mosaic and is republished here under a Creative Commons licence.

And unlike Johnson (so far), his government ignored court rulings \u2013 and went ahead with the vote anyway. Declaring independence ramped up the level of defiance. It was also dishonest, since it was based on a referendum in which only one side campaigned. \u201cRemain in Spain\u201d voters mostly boycotted the illegal vote and, inevitably, the \u201cleave\u201d side won. That is not a solid basis on which to announce an epoch-defining, existential change to the lives of all 7.6 million Catalans. Spanish rightwingers are today gloating over the court\u2019s sentencing. Yet they are part of the problem. The anti-Catalan rhetoric that has accompanied their periods in power has only served to boost separatism. And even the socialist left, which talks up the idea of a \u201cpluri-national\u201d Spain, has done little to make Spaniards in other parts of the country proud of the languages and cultures that coexist within it. Paradoxically, an obvious solution is to hold a proper referendum. This would force Catalan voters to face reality. Just the idea of being expelled from the EU would probably be enough to secure a resounding victory for remain. So why won\u2019t Spain do that? The country\u2019s written constitution makes both a referendum and independence theoretically possible, in a process controlled from Madrid. In practical terms, however, it hands a blocking vote to 40% of the senate. Even when the left is in government, the right normally commands that. It will never permit a separate Catalonia. Since independence is possible in theory, but currently impossible in practice, some separatists may conclude that only violence will achieve their aims. Police last month arrested a group that was allegedly planning to mark this decision with bomb attacks. That is the worst mistake separatists could make. At the first sight of bloodshed, support would likely shrink so far that their cause could take decades to recover. Their only hope is to keep following the advice of the jailed regional MP and ex-president of the grassroots Catalan National Assembly, Jordi S\u00e0nchez. \u201cLet\u2019s express ourselves without fear and move forward, nonviolently, towards freedom,\u201d he said. That is a very long journey. \u2022 Giles Tremlett is a journalist and author based in Madrid",

      "bodyText": "WeWork is expected to sack at least 2,000 people as soon as this week, as angry staff at the troubled office rental company turn on its co-founder Adam Neumann. WeWork rents buildings long-term, gives them a millennial makeover with beer taps, communal spaces and tiny workspaces, and then rents them out short-term. Until recently it was America\u2019s most highly valued private company with 527,000 tenants, or \u201cmembers\u201d, as WeWork calls them, worldwide. Two thousand jobs is about 13% of WeWork\u2019s 15,000 staff and few inside the company believe the cuts will stop there. WeWork declined to comment. The cuts come after WeWork was forced to pull its share sale and new management moves to staunch the company\u2019s huge losses. Internally, staff say little or no work is getting done as workers prepare for the layoffs and new projects are put on hold. But the timing of the sackings is uncertain, not least because WeWork is now in active discussions to raise money before it runs out of cash next year. After years of breakneck growth, new openings have all but stopped in WeWork\u2019s two largest markets, New York and London, as landlords worry about the company\u2019s future. The company\u2019s $850m deal to buy the landmark Lord &amp; Taylor department store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan is in trouble. And two large landlords in London, where WeWork has leased about 3.7m sq ft since 2014, recently told the Financial Times they would not sign new leases for the foreseeable future. One worker, who spoke anonymously for fear of reprisals, said: \u201cThe atmosphere is toxic. A lot of people worked so hard for this company. We thought we were in on something really big.\u201d In online chats on WeWork\u2019s Slack channel, obtained by the Guardian, staff shared memes about Adam Neumann, WeWork\u2019s co-founder and the man many blame for the company\u2019s dramatic fall from grace. Some WeWork executives were in line for million-dollar payouts if the sale had gone ahead and are now likely to get nothing and could even lose their jobs. One worker said: \u201cI left crypto to join an even more ludicrous \u2018parody, IRL [in real life]\u2019 enterprise. Didn\u2019t even think that was possible.\u201d Neumann, 40, cashed in around $700m of his own shares in WeWork before a share sale that at one point valued WeWork at $47bn. The company has begun attracting larger tenants, including IBM and Microsoft. The Guardian uses a WeWork space in California. But the company\u2019s losses have grown as quickly as its business. After investors began querying WeWork\u2019s business model and Neumann\u2019s stewardship of the company, that figure was slashed by more than half and WeWork decided to pull its initial public offering (IPO). Staff said they had concerns about the influence that Neumann\u2019s wife, Rebekah Paltrow Neumann, had at the company. The cousin of Gwyneth Paltrow, Neumann\u2019s \u201cstrategic thought partner\u201d had been in charge of succession planning should anything happen to her husband, and was the company\u2019s chief brand and impact officer. WeWork insiders said she had an outsized influence on hiring and new business ideas. The company\u2019s decision to launch WeGrow, a \u201cconscious entrepreneurial\u201d private primary school run inside WeWork\u2019s headquarters, was spearheaded by Paltrow Neumann. Multiple employees lost their jobs at WeWork after Paltrow Neumann met them and she didn\u2019t like their energy, according to the Wall Street Journal. The school will now close and Paltrow Neumann has been barred from serving on the company\u2019s board. The company was expected to raise as much as $4bn from the share sale and had lined up a $6bn bank loan, contingent on the IPO. The decision to pull the sale has left WeWork scrambling for cash. According to the Wall Street Journal, Softbank, the Japanese investment firm that is WeWork\u2019s largest investor, and JP Morgan Chase are now considering bailing out the office rentals company. The investment would further dilute Neumann\u2019s control of the company. The company is currently burning through $700m a quarter. Last year it lost $1.6bn and it had $2.5bn in cash as of 30 June. At the current rate, We, as WeWork\u2019s parent company is called, would run out of money after the first quarter of 2020, according analysts Sanford C Bernstein &amp; Co. Newly installed co-CEOs Sebastian Gunningham and Artie Minson have already begun the cost-cutting process, halting new leases and putting a $60m G650ER jet bought under Neumann\u2019s reign up for sale. Neumann landed on Forbes\u2019 list of the world\u2019s richest people earlier this year with a net worth of $4.1bn. Forbes has now lowered its estimate of his wealth to at most $600m. On Monday, Business Insider reported that WeWork tenants had received an email informing them of \u201cpotentially elevated levels of formaldehyde\u201d in phone booths throughout WeWork offices in the US and Canada.

      "body": "<p>When Gyula Remes died on 19 December 2018, across the road from the Houses of Parliament, there was an outcry. Remes, aged 43, was Hungarian and homeless. He had been sleeping in a passage in Westminster tube station that led into Parliament square. It was the second homeless death in the same underpass in 10 months. The Labour MP David Lammy tweeted: \u201cThere is something rotten in Westminster when MPs walk past dying homeless people on the way into work.\u201d</p> \n<p>Later that day, Remes\u2019 death was discussed in the House of Commons. The Liberal Democrat MP and former health minister Norman Lamb said: \u201cIt is grotesque and obscene that we have a homelessness crisis visible just outside the building.\u201d The next day James Brokenshire, then secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, told parliament: \u201cEvery death of someone sleeping rough on our streets is one too many. Each is a tragedy, each a life cut short. We have a moral duty to act.\u201d Brokenshire said the government was already acting, with an investment of \u00a31.2bn to reduce and prevent homelessness, and its commitment to halve rough sleeping by 2022 and end it by 2027.</p> \n<p>A sum of \u00a35,000 was raised in just two days, in memory of Remes, by an unnamed MP\u2019s staff. Bouquets were bought and impromptu wreaths laid outside Westminster tube. One wreath, cordoned off by a folded black bin liner, featured five bouquets in disposable cups alongside a burning memorial candle. Between the flowers stood a regiment of Stella Artois cans \u2013 Remes\u2019 favourite brand of lager. The death of Gyula (pronounced Jeweller) really did feel like a pivotal point.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f19c6dbd-a8c5-44ad-a2f7-cde781d9ee47\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018, according to the latest ONS figures. Over the next few months, G2 and Guardian Cities&nbsp;will look behind this statistic to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/series/the-empty-doorway\">tell the stories of some of those who have died on Britain\u2019s streets</a>. We will tell not just the story of their death, but the story of their life \u2013 what they were like as kids, what their dreams were, their hobbies, what people loved about them, what was infuriating. We will also examine what went wrong with their lives, how it impacted on their loved ones, and if anything could have been done differently to prevent their deaths.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>As the series develops, we will invite politicians, charities and homelessness organisations to respond to the issues raised. We will also ask readers to offer their own stories and reflections on homelessness. We want the stories we tell to become the fulcrum of a debate about homelessness; to make a difference to a scourge that shames us all.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>It is time to stop just passing by.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There was widespread horror that people were dying on the streets of one of the wealthiest boroughs of one of the wealthiest cities in the world. But perhaps there shouldn\u2019t have been. Last November, the homelessness charity Shelter revealed that 320,000 people in Britain were homeless \u2013 a 4% year-on-year rise. In 2017, Westminster had more rough sleepers than any borough in the country \u2013 217. The day after Remes died, data was published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showing that almost 600 homeless people had died in England and Wales in 2017 \u2013 a 24% increase over five years.</p> \n<p>Remes\u2019 friend Gabor Kasza talked to the Guardian on the day he died. He said Remes had been given a cigarette by somebody he didn\u2019t know. He inhaled it, convulsed, turned blue and lost consciousness. Kasza was convinced it was the synthetic cannabinoid spice, smoked unwittingly, that had killed Remes.</p> \n<p>Kasza and Remes made an unlikely couple. They were different in so many ways. Kasza in his early 20s with perfect English; Remes looking older than his 43 years and struggling to make himself understood with his broken English. Kasza had a girlfriend; Remes was alone. Kasza came to Britain as a nine-year-old with his mother, went to school in London and lived in Tottenham. Remes came in his early 30s, looking for work. Kasza did not drink or take drugs; Remes loved his booze. What they had in common was that they were both from P\u00e9cs, the fifth largest city in Hungary, and were homeless.</p> \n<p>They met at a day centre for homeless people, the Connection, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, in September 2018. Over four months, until Remes\u2019 death last December, they became inseparable. They looked out for each other, shared food and money, went to the Connection together, returned to their spot by Westminster in the afternoon, and talked up their hopes. Kasza says Remes had simple ambitions. \u201cHe wanted a good job, a good house and a big family.\u201d He ended up with none of those.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=726%20&amp;title=homeless%20people%20died%20in%20England%20and%20Wales%20in%202018\" data-alt=\"726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=726%20&amp;title=homeless%20people%20died%20in%20England%20and%20Wales%20in%202018\">726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Six months after Remes\u2019 death, Kasza has moved to Birmingham, where he thought it would be easier to find work. It hasn\u2019t been. He is still jobless and homeless, trying to scrape together enough money to get a roof over his head. And he is still missing his friend. He doesn\u2019t know all the details of Remes\u2019 life \u2013 he says homeless people often keep their past, or parts of it, to themselves. But he tells us what he does know.</p> \n<p>Kasza believes Remes initially worked as a kitchen porter in London in the mid-00s, but after losing his job he found himself sleeping rough. Remes loved to travel and cook, although there was little opportunity for him to do either on the streets of London. A few years ago, Kasza says, Remes gave up on London and travelled through Europe looking for work. Sometimes he found work, sometimes he didn\u2019t. He was away for about five years, and then suddenly reappeared in Westminster towards the end of last year.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Gyula would never beg. It was work or nothing else. He loved working, but it is hard to find a job if you don\u2019t have accommodation</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Gabor Kasza</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Remes had just returned to the country, was jobless and did not meet the eligibility criteria for benefits, so he found himself back on the streets. In 2014, the then prime minister David Cameron clamped down on what he called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/sep/14/david-cameron-benefits-eu-immigration\">\u201cbenefits tourists\u201d</a>. As well as having to wait for three months before claiming benefits (which had always been the case), people from the European Economic Area (EEA) looking for work were now only entitled to claim jobseeker\u2019s allowance for a maximum of six months, and then only if they could prove they were actively looking for a job and had realistic prospects of finding one.</p> \n<p>Kasza has been homeless, off and on, for the past four years. There have been times when he has been working for the minimum wage and still not been able to afford accommodation. Last year, he lost his job in a warehouse and found himself back on the streets. He and Remes soon became brothers in arms. \u201cHe was a very good friend. He\u2019d always help you out if you were in trouble. He\u2019d give you food or money if he had any. He was funny. He made a lot of jokes. He made people happy.\u201d</p> \n<p>Life on the streets was monotonous, Kasza says. In the morning they would go to the Connection, which adjoins the famous St Martin-in-the-Fields church in Trafalgar Square, where they could shower and have breakfast. In the afternoon, they would return to their spot by the tube. Sometimes they would go to soup kitchens; other times, they would go job hunting. At night, Kasza would sleep above ground close to Westminster tube station, while Remes would sleep in the underpass a few yards away from a woman called Sarah and her girlfriend. Just before settling down every evening, Kasza would walk down to the tunnel or Remes would come up the stairs to make sure they were safe, and they would wish each other goodnight.</p> \n<p>The main thing that kept Remes going was his desire to find a job. He was a proud man, and, unlike Kasza, refused to ask strangers for money. \u201cHe would never beg,\u201d says Kasza. \u201cIt was work or nothing. He loved working, but it is also hard to find a job if you don\u2019t have any accommodation.\u201d A classic catch-22 \u2013 no work, no home; no home, no work.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3f2ac6b8-6349-4746-bca2-1901a6f0d844\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3_BIleRXzmo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Kasza says he preferred to work, but often there was none, and anyway he could make more money begging \u2013 occasionally as much as \u00a3100 a day, and usually \u00a3200-\u00a3300 a week. That was one of the attractions of Westminster \u2013 wealthy people or happy-go-lucky tourists passing by. They may be unlikely to stop and shoot the breeze, but they did sometimes drop a fiver in his cup. Kasza would save whatever he could, and put it in the bank. He hoped to save enough money to move into private rented accommodation.</p> \n<p>Occasionally, politicians gave him money. \u201cEd Miliband spoke to me and gave me his email when he was leader of the Labour party. He gave me \u00a35 and asked me why I was homeless. I said: \u2018I\u2019ve been here in the UK a long time \u2013 they should give me a house.\u2019 He said he would try to help me.\u201d Did he see him again? \u201cNo, that was the last time I saw him.\u201d Miliband was one of the few who did stop. \u201cMost of them don\u2019t know whether we are dead or alive.\u201d</p> \n<p>Remes hated the discomfort and indignity of being homeless. \u201cIt\u2019s not very nice,\u201d Kasza says. \u201cYou sleep on the floor, and it\u2019s dirty. You get drunk people coming out of clubs or going in, making noise. Gyula was a bit scared being on the street. He always wanted to get off. That\u2019s why he was so determined to get a job.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kasza says Remes loved to drink if he could afford it \u2013 cheap cider or Stella. How much? \u201cMaybe four cans of Stella. Maybe he\u2019d get drunk every second or third night. He was a happy drunk.\u201d Kasza says that, although he never saw Remes out of control, his friend did want to stop drinking. \u201cHe would tell me that he was only drinking because life is emotional, and because he wanted a job and felt alone. I would try to persuade him not to drink. One time he stopped for a couple of weeks and then started again.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/oct/15/the-catch-22-of-homeless-care-shows-why-charities-must-stand-up-to-government\">The catch-22 of homeless care shows why charities must stand up to government</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Kasza says they got little support from outreach workers. He claims they are not often seen, and, when they are, rarely offer practical support. \u201cThey just say there is no room in the shelters or you cannot stay in them because you do not qualify for benefits.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another problem is that trust appears to have broken down between homeless people and outreach workers. Today, big homelessness charities bid for contracts from local government. Those that win them are often thought to be beholden to their paymasters. In 2016, the Home Office decided that people sleeping rough in Britain were abusing EEA free-movement rights, and could be removed. In March 2017, it was revealed that big homelessness charities, including St Mungo\u2019s, had been passing information about rough sleepers to the Home Office, leading to their removal from the UK \u2013 127 non-UK-national rough sleepers were deported in a two-month pilot operation in Westminster. But in December 2017, the high court ruled that the Home Office policy to deport rough sleepers from countries in the EEA, known as Operation Adoze, was unlawful.</p> \n<p>Not surprisingly, by that point homeless people from the EEA, such as Remes and Kasza, had become suspicious of outreach workers. \u201cI have a few friends who were sleeping rough somewhere near us in Westminster, and they got taken away for sleeping there and held in a detention centre,\u201d Kasza says.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>Gyula Remes died on a cold December night. Earlier in the evening, he had complained that life was too tough, and he couldn\u2019t continue in this way. But, as the drink flowed, he began to relax. It was only a week until Christmas, and the atmosphere among the Westminster rough-sleeping community was festive. \u201cA lot of people from my country were sleeping down there. Everybody was drinking and happy,\u201d Kasza says.</p> \n<p>He thinks it was about 10pm that he went upstairs to his spot by Caff\u00e8 Nero. Just before settling down for the night, at around 11pm, he went back down to the underpass to say good night and make sure everybody was OK. Remes was blue in the face, lying on his stomach and choking. His friends said he had been fine until he smoked a bit of a cigarette he had been handed by a young homeless man, and began to convulse. There is no way Remes would have touched it if he had known it had been laced with spice, Kasza says \u2013 he didn\u2019t even smoke regular cannabis. \u201cIt was definitely spice. We were so sad, shocked, panicking. One of the other guys called the ambulance. We heard the next day he had died. Everybody was crying.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"433b63cf6a93fd876c9ee22993d340fc5a85ac9e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/433b63cf6a93fd876c9ee22993d340fc5a85ac9e/0_311_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gabor Kasza, a friend of Gyula Remes\u2019 who now lives and works in Birmingham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He made people happy,\u2019 says Gabor Kasza of his friend Gyula.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>\u2018He made people happy,\u2019 says Gabor Kasza of his friend Gyula. Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Five months on, how has Remes\u2019 death affected Kasza? \u201cIt has made me more sad about people not counting and people not caring. We thought things might change after Gyula\u2019s death, people would start caring, but nothing has changed.\u201d His move to Birmingham has not worked out. He thinks it is even harder for him because there are so few homeless charities in Birmingham to help him.</p> \n<p>It all seems so far away from his childhood when he sailed through his GCSEs, did a diploma in animal care and dreamed of becoming a farmer. Five years ago, his mother moved to Amsterdam to live with her partner, and he has struggled with housing ever since. Kasza is not the first in his family to experience homelessness. His father has been homeless in Hungary for much of the past 15 years, even though he works as a builder. This is one of the reasons he would not go back to Hungary. Despite everything, he believes he has better prospects here. More to the point, having spent most of his life here he regards Britain as home \u2013 even if it has often felt like an unwelcoming one.</p> \n<p>Kasza is remarkably sanguine about the way life has turned out for him. He says he is thankful for his health, his girlfriend and the fact that he still has a future to look forward to. Somehow, he has retained his appetite for life, despite all he has seen. He remains convinced that the next stroke of luck is just round the corner.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>In Westminster, Labour MP David Lammy is multitasking \u2013 heading towards a meeting while explaining why he reacted so passionately after Remes\u2019 death. He says it was a moment of revelation. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe how quickly the political class had become indifferent to this suffering. We have people sleeping on Westminster station outside one of the Commons entrances, and 650 MPs have stepped over those people on their way into work. It\u2019s a travesty. In relation to our welfare state, our safety net, our morality really, because in the sixth richest economy in the world it simply should not be the case that so many people are without housing. I tweeted because I felt a sense of despair and loathing for a system that I\u2019m part of.\u201d</p> \n<p>What worries Lammy is that we have accepted homelessness as the norm. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now in Britain is a whole community of people who have no stake in society.\u201d Every day on his way to and from work, he passes Stroud Green bridge (next to Finsbury Park tube station in North London), which has become one of London\u2019s contemporary cardboard cities. How does that make him feel? \u201cI feel shame. I feel very upset that my young children, not yet teenagers, are becoming immune to them; immune to people who are sleeping under the bridge.\u201d Does he think anything has changed for the better since Remes\u2019 death? \u201cNo! Things have got worse.\u201d Actually, he says, one thing has changed. \u201dThey\u2019ve put up a barrier at Westminster tube to stop homeless people sleeping in the tunnel.\u201d His voice rises in disbelief.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1051494582bbe466c74d0dd23876b1521a56ec5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1051494582bbe466c74d0dd23876b1521a56ec5/0_0_4800_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Commuters walk pass Dawn Hodgson the memorial she and others created for Gyula.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Commuters walk pass Dawn Hodgson the memorial she and others created for Gyula.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Commuters walk pass Dawn Hodgson the memorial she and others created for Gyula. Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty images</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Westminster is dysfunctional, says Norman Lamb \u2013 so many homeless people on the one hand, so many unoccupied buildings on the other. From his office in Portcullis House, next to the Houses of Parliament, he points out a nearby high-rise approved by Boris Johnson during his tenure as mayor. \u201cIt\u2019s largely owned by oligarchs, but it\u2019s very rarely occupied \u2026 I have argued for a punitive tax on any dwelling in London that is left empty. I can\u2019t understand why nobody has ever done it. It\u2019s the obvious thing that would end the problem or raise substantial amounts of money that you could use to house people.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lamb also voices his disgust at the barrier that has been erected in Westminster tunnel. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt a security justification, but the fact is it\u2019s closed off an area where people could get shelter overnight.\u201d</p> \n<p>Last week the New Statesman revealed that two months after Remes\u2019 death the chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons, Rose Hudson-Wilkin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/08/chaplains-complaints-of-stench-created-by-homeless-arose-from-concern\">complained to parliamentary authorities</a> about the \u201congoing stench\u201d and \u201cunsanitary state\u201d created by rough sleepers in the underpass.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>It is a hot May day, and Southwark coroner\u2019s court is empty except for the two of us, a journalist from a news agency and a handful of staff behind a glass window. The inquest cannot begin at 1pm as scheduled because assistant coroner Philip Barlow is not here yet. It starts at 1.26pm, and is over by 1.52pm \u2013 Gyula Remes\u2019 life is done and dusted in 26 minutes. Statements are provided by the head of outreach at St Mungo\u2019s, Kathleen Sims, and Jeremy Bernhaut for the Connection. Neither Sims nor Bernhaut are here in person. It all seems so desultory \u2013 a far cry from that December day when Remes died and politicians, campaigners and the media voiced their outrage that a rough sleeper could die on the streets outside parliament.</p> \n<p>Barlow tells the court that Remes has no family in Britain, but he believes there is a brother in Canada. There are few concrete facts about Remes\u2019 life. Barlow talks about Remes\u2019 desperation to work \u2013 in the short-term as a kitchen porter, with a long-term goal of getting a forklift licence. We also hear that drink sometimes got in the way of the prospect of employment. On 8 October, he was told by a potential employer that he smelled of alcohol, and a week later his caseworker at the Connection also told him he smelled strongly of booze, and should address that before his next job interview. But things were looking up for Remes: he was doing part-time kitchen work and had just been offered a full-time job.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=306&amp;title=%20the%20number%20of%20rough%20sleepers%20recorded%20in%20Westminster%20in%202018\" data-alt=\"306 the number of rough sleepers recorded in Westminster in 2018\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=306&amp;title=%20the%20number%20of%20rough%20sleepers%20recorded%20in%20Westminster%20in%202018\">306 the number of rough sleepers recorded in Westminster in 2018</a> \n</figure> \n<p>We learn that St Mungo\u2019s and the Connection first had contact with him on the streets in 2006, and worked with him on and off for seven years until he left to live \u2013 and work \u2013 in Malta, France and Hungary. After five years abroad, he returned to Britain in September 2018 and was spotted back on the streets by St Mungo\u2019s in October 2018.</p> \n<p>Remes was offered 12 weeks\u2019 accommodation at the Missionaries of Charity in south London, a hostel run by Catholic nuns with a strict no-alcohol/drugs policy. At the time, it was believed that he was working irregular hours as a street cleaner. On 26 October, he was thrown out after returning home late three nights in a row.</p> \n<p>Sims\u2019 statement reveals that St Mungo\u2019s street outreach services team saw him sleeping rough on 30 October in the tunnel at Westminster tube station, but he had refused to give them his details. Barlow says Remes was rejected twice for emergency accommodation at the Connection in October and on 11 December, a week before he died. He was told the hostel was full, but that, even if it had not been, he would not have been allowed in. \u201cHe did not meet the criteria for accessing it because he had not started work,\u201d Barlow says. \u201cAlso, because his working hours were due to be irregular, he did not meet the criteria.\u201d</p> \n<p>This is where the story of Gyula Remes becomes Kafkaesque. The notion that somebody can only meet the criteria for an emergency shelter if they are working seems absurd. Yet this appears to be the case, because working and paying tax is the only way he would have been eligible for benefits. Not only that, he would have to have been working regular hours to qualify for a place. In fact, according to Kasza, he had already started working full-time and had received his first payment the week he died.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c017abf0c4c86ae422fbab7d87238d46849f4743\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c017abf0c4c86ae422fbab7d87238d46849f4743/0_373_1152_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The only known photograph of Gyula Remes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The only known photograph of Gyula Remes.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The more we examine the last months of Remes\u2019 life, the more he looks like a victim of the government\u2019s hostile environment policy. Here was a man who refused to give his name to the very charity that was supposed to support him (a charity that had been found to be helping the Home Office deport EEA nationals); a man not allowed to claim job seeker\u2019s allowance despite being desperate to find work; a man refused shelter in the December cold because it was believed that he did not yet have a job.</p> \n<p>The toxicology report presented at the inquest stated there was no sign of spice or morphine found in Remes\u2019 body, but that he had 369mg of alcohol in 100ml of urine \u2013 more than three times the drink-drive limit, according to the coroner. The emergency medical consultant at St Thomas\u2019 hospital said Remes had \u201cmild hypothermia\u201d that was \u201cunlikely to have any clinical significance on a patient\u2019s presentation\u201d. Barlow ruled that the cause of death was cardio-respiratory arrest and acute alcohol toxicity. \u201cMy short-form conclusion is that the death is alcohol related,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is impossible to think of the evidence in this case without considering the particular sadness that Mr Remes was hoping to find work and suffered his cardiac arrest in the centre of London near Westminster station shortly before Christmas.\u201d</p> \n<p>After giving the cause of death, Barlow said: \u201cIt\u2019s no doubt a measure of the pressure the various charities and organisations are under that he didn\u2019t always meet the criteria for accommodation.\u201d The statement, delivered quietly, but with heartfelt conviction, felt like a rebuke. But it was unclear who was being rebuked.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>Just after Remes died, the Connection issued a statement. \u201cWe are very sad and sorry to hear about the death of Gyula Remes, and would like to extend our condolences to his family and friends. We worked closely with Gyula and will remember him as a funny, charming and amiable man \u2013 he always had a smile on his face and was well liked by everyone who worked with him. Just before his death, he told us he was working part-time as a kitchen porter, and working towards getting into full-time employment. We were also helping him to get into a night shelter while he secured a full-time job.\u201d What the statement didn\u2019t say is that the Connection refused him a place at its own night centre the week before he died.</p> \n<p>The Connection is one of the country\u2019s best-known homelessness charities. For more than 90 years, BBC Radio has supported St Martin\u2019s work with homeless and vulnerably housed people. Over the past two Christmas appeals, Radio 4 listeners raised more than \u00a35m to help three homeless charities, including the Connection, provide shelter, food and advice. We ask the Connection if any of the staff would like to share their memories of Remes. The press office replies that staff members \u201care not keen on being interviewed face to face\u201d, but that the chief executive, Pam Orchard, is happy to meet us.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"00ec34d900ec59c9f009a2876de4060ed92349d3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00ec34d900ec59c9f009a2876de4060ed92349d3/0_35_3488_2228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A memorial marks the place where Gyula Remes used to sleep.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"639\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A memorial marks the place where Gyula Remes used to sleep.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Nicholson/LNP/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>A memorial marks the place where Gyula Remes used to sleep. Photograph: Tom Nicholson/LNP/REX/Shutterstock</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>On the ground floor at the Connection, homeless people are using computers in a large glass-fronted room. They come to the Connection to shower, have breakfast, reconnect with their home city or country, and find work. We take the lift to the second floor and Orchard\u2019s office. She has worked in the homelessness sector for 15 years, and has been at the Connection for the past two.</p> \n<p>She reads out a list of anonymised tributes to Remes from a printed sheet of paper. One staff member remembers that, in 2008, he would always attend the Connection with a close friend, and that they were something of a double act. Orchard says that although she never personally knew Remes, her staff were fond of him. \u201cGyula was good-natured. He was quite a big guy. Somebody describes him as a gentle giant. He never used his size to intimidate people.\u201d She fast-forwards a decade to 2018 when he returned to London and the Connection. \u201cBy now, he was drinking a lot more. He\u2019d be visibly under the influence in a way he hadn\u2019t been in his previous engagements. He said he was drinking because he had time on his hands.\u201d Orchard looks up from her notes. \u201cOften people drink because their mental health isn\u2019t great, and they are self-medicating.\u201d</p> \n<p>We ask her what criteria Remes failed to meet for a place in the emergency shelter just before he died. The atmosphere becomes frosty. Orchard asks us to turn our recorder off. We decline to do so, saying this should be a matter of public record. She says the issue of criteria is complex, not one that can be captured in a soundbite or headline.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe do our absolute best with limited resources,\u201d she says. \u201cIf something goes wrong, which it inevitably does, because lots of our clients are extremely vulnerable and have got complex needs, there is a temptation to look for someone to blame and to look at what someone\u2019s engagement in the service has been, and then find reasons to pick holes in what they did in order to demonstrate that if only they could or should have done something it would have been different. So you can look at our night shelter criteria as much as you like, and go: \u2018If you\u2019d done such and such, that wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u2019 But it feels a bit like you\u2019re shooting the messenger.\u201d</p> \n<p>We ask whether anybody from the Connection attended Remes\u2019 funeral, and whether it held its own service. She says she is unsure, but mentions Marcos Amaral Gourgel, a Portuguese former model who died homeless in Westminster ten months before Remes, and who had also been supported by the Connection. After his death, it was revealed that he had been convicted of child sexual abuse in Portugal, and Orchard says the tabloids were critical of the support the Connection had given him. \u201cSo we get blamed for not doing enough, and we get blamed for doing too much. You just can\u2019t win, can you? So we\u2019ll just do what we can as well as we can.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=17&amp;title=homeless%20people%20died%20in%20Westminster%20in%202018\" data-alt=\"17 homeless people died in Westminster in 2018\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=17&amp;title=homeless%20people%20died%20in%20Westminster%20in%202018\">17 homeless people died in Westminster in 2018</a> \n</figure> \n<p>A few days later, the Connection\u2019s press office sends through the criteria for accessing the night centre: people have to be over 18, have been rough sleeping in Westminster, referred from an approved referral agency (the local authority, police, the NHS or other homeless charities), and they have to be \u201cpositively engaging with an agreed action plan that is a realistic and sustainable route off the streets\u201d. The statement continues: \u201cThe fact Gyula had no access to welfare meant the best and most sustainable way we could support him was to help him access sufficient employment to pay rent in the private rented sector.\u201d</p> \n<p>The statement further explains that, although its most recent work with Remes focused on helping him find work, \u201cunfortunately, this had not translated into a realistic and sustainable route off the streets and so we were unable to accommodate him in our night shelter\u201d. We are left baffled. After all, the assistant coroner said at the inquest that Remes had recently been offered a full-time job, and the condolences issued by the Connection after Remes died stated: \u201cJust before his death he told us he was working part-time as a kitchen porter, and working towards getting into full-time employment.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>It is eight months since Gyula Remes died. In Birmingham, Gabor Kasza says he does not know where his friend is buried or his ashes scattered. Nobody seems to know. We tell him about the inquest verdict, that Remes died of a heart attack and acute alcohol poisoning. He says he cannot believe it. He is still convinced spice did for Remes, and that he had had only about four cans of lager that night. He asks why he wasn\u2019t called to give evidence \u2013 after all, he knew Remes well and was trying to resuscitate him as he was dying.</p> \n<p>Kasza says he has some good news. \u201cI\u2019ve got a job in a cafe. I\u2019ve been working a few weeks now, almost a month. It\u2019s a big cafe. I\u2019m enjoying it. And I\u2019m renting a room with my girlfriend.\u201d Things are looking up, he says.</p> \n<p>On 6 July 2019, the Observer\u2019s home affairs editor, Mark Townsend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/06/home-office-secret-plan-charities-deport-rough-sleepers\">reported that the Home Office had \u201crolled out a remarkably similar scheme\u201d to Operation Adoze</a>, despite the fact that the original scheme was ruled unlawful in December 2017. The story revealed that the Home Office had drawn up a programme called the Rough Sleeping Support Service (RSSS), using homelessness charities to acquire and pass on sensitive personal data that could result in the deportation of non-UK-national rough sleepers.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>My message to MPs? Help us. Get us off the streets. Do something</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Sarah Anderson</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Emails showed that St Mungo\u2019s attended meetings with the Home Office in which discussions were held about allowing outreach workers to enter a homeless person\u2019s data into the RSSS without their consent, which would breach European privacy laws. The Home Office said the RSSS was set up \u201cto help resolve the immigration status of non-UK nationals sleeping rough, either granting lawful status or providing documentation. This enables individuals to access support or assists them in leaving the UK where appropriate.\u201d St Mungo\u2019s tells us: \u201cWe do not share any information about our clients with the Home Office without the client\u2019s full and informed consent. In the case of the Rough Sleeping Support Service, our position has always been that people cannot be referred to the service unless they have first received advice and have also given their consent.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is early October and the JustGiving fund set up by anonymous parliamentary staff in memory of Remes is still online. Underneath a photograph of the Houses of Parliament at sunset, it says: \u201cIn memory of Gyula Remes, the homeless man who died outside parliament.\u201d A badge at the top reveals 485 people have contributed and it has raised \u00a311,145 \u2013 the target had been just \u00a31,000. But this seems to be the fund that time forgot. It is open for donations, although nobody has contributed for eight months. As with so much of Remes\u2019 life, indignity is piled upon indignity. Alongside a memorial candle, in smaller type, it says: \u201cIn memory of Gyula Remef.\u201d</p> \n<p>As for homeless death statistics, they continue to rise relentlessly. On 1 October 2019, the ONS estimated that 726 homeless people died in 2018 in England and Wales, a 22% year on year increase. Westminster council recorded 17 deaths \u2013 the highest number among London\u2019s local authorities. Alarmingly, deaths as a result of drug use have more than doubled in the six years the ONS has been recording the data.</p> \n<p>Outside Westminster tube on a warm day, a woman with cropped hair and a toothy smile is sitting in her sleeping bag. We show her a photograph of Remes, and ask if she recognises it. She blinks, then answers. \u201cWho\u2019s that? That\u2019s Julius, innit,\u201d she says. \u201cOf course I recognise him. My girlfriend and I used to sleep near him in the tunnel \u2013 just a few yards away.\u201d Sarah Anderson is a 38-year-old Londoner. Like many women living on the streets, she ended up there after escaping an abusive relationship. She says a male former partner stabbed her and claims she lost her right to benefits because she was told she had made herself intentionally homeless.</p> \n<p>Anderson holds up the picture of Remes and smiles. \u201cHe was lovely \u2013 so loving. Every time he walked in, he\u2019d say: \u2018You all right, babe? How are you?\u2019 in his fandangled way, trying to speak our language, bless him. He\u2019d always ask how we were, and if we\u2019d eaten.\u201d We tell her that Kasza is in Birmingham, and has a job. Her face lights up. \u201cI know Gabor.

      "bodyText": "When Gyula Remes died on 19 December 2018, across the road from the Houses of Parliament, there was an outcry. Remes, aged 43, was Hungarian and homeless. He had been sleeping in a passage in Westminster tube station that led into Parliament square. It was the second homeless death in the same underpass in 10 months. The Labour MP David Lammy tweeted: \u201cThere is something rotten in Westminster when MPs walk past dying homeless people on the way into work.\u201d Later that day, Remes\u2019 death was discussed in the House of Commons. The Liberal Democrat MP and former health minister Norman Lamb said: \u201cIt is grotesque and obscene that we have a homelessness crisis visible just outside the building.\u201d The next day James Brokenshire, then secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, told parliament: \u201cEvery death of someone sleeping rough on our streets is one too many. Each is a tragedy, each a life cut short. We have a moral duty to act.\u201d Brokenshire said the government was already acting, with an investment of \u00a31.2bn to reduce and prevent homelessness, and its commitment to halve rough sleeping by 2022 and end it by 2027. A sum of \u00a35,000 was raised in just two days, in memory of Remes, by an unnamed MP\u2019s staff. Bouquets were bought and impromptu wreaths laid outside Westminster tube. One wreath, cordoned off by a folded black bin liner, featured five bouquets in disposable cups alongside a burning memorial candle. Between the flowers stood a regiment of Stella Artois cans \u2013 Remes\u2019 favourite brand of lager. The death of Gyula (pronounced Jeweller) really did feel like a pivotal point. There was widespread horror that people were dying on the streets of one of the wealthiest boroughs of one of the wealthiest cities in the world. But perhaps there shouldn\u2019t have been. Last November, the homelessness charity Shelter revealed that 320,000 people in Britain were homeless \u2013 a 4% year-on-year rise. In 2017, Westminster had more rough sleepers than any borough in the country \u2013 217. The day after Remes died, data was published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showing that almost 600 homeless people had died in England and Wales in 2017 \u2013 a 24% increase over five years. Remes\u2019 friend Gabor Kasza talked to the Guardian on the day he died. He said Remes had been given a cigarette by somebody he didn\u2019t know. He inhaled it, convulsed, turned blue and lost consciousness. Kasza was convinced it was the synthetic cannabinoid spice, smoked unwittingly, that had killed Remes. Kasza and Remes made an unlikely couple. They were different in so many ways. Kasza in his early 20s with perfect English; Remes looking older than his 43 years and struggling to make himself understood with his broken English. Kasza had a girlfriend; Remes was alone. Kasza came to Britain as a nine-year-old with his mother, went to school in London and lived in Tottenham. Remes came in his early 30s, looking for work. Kasza did not drink or take drugs; Remes loved his booze. What they had in common was that they were both from P\u00e9cs, the fifth largest city in Hungary, and were homeless. They met at a day centre for homeless people, the Connection, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, in September 2018. Over four months, until Remes\u2019 death last December, they became inseparable. They looked out for each other, shared food and money, went to the Connection together, returned to their spot by Westminster in the afternoon, and talked up their hopes. Kasza says Remes had simple ambitions. \u201cHe wanted a good job, a good house and a big family.\u201d He ended up with none of those. Six months after Remes\u2019 death, Kasza has moved to Birmingham, where he thought it would be easier to find work. It hasn\u2019t been. He is still jobless and homeless, trying to scrape together enough money to get a roof over his head. And he is still missing his friend. He doesn\u2019t know all the details of Remes\u2019 life \u2013 he says homeless people often keep their past, or parts of it, to themselves. But he tells us what he does know. Kasza believes Remes initially worked as a kitchen porter in London in the mid-00s, but after losing his job he found himself sleeping rough. Remes loved to travel and cook, although there was little opportunity for him to do either on the streets of London. A few years ago, Kasza says, Remes gave up on London and travelled through Europe looking for work. Sometimes he found work, sometimes he didn\u2019t. He was away for about five years, and then suddenly reappeared in Westminster towards the end of last year. Remes had just returned to the country, was jobless and did not meet the eligibility criteria for benefits, so he found himself back on the streets. In 2014, the then prime minister David Cameron clamped down on what he called \u201cbenefits tourists\u201d. As well as having to wait for three months before claiming benefits (which had always been the case), people from the European Economic Area (EEA) looking for work were now only entitled to claim jobseeker\u2019s allowance for a maximum of six months, and then only if they could prove they were actively looking for a job and had realistic prospects of finding one. Kasza has been homeless, off and on, for the past four years. There have been times when he has been working for the minimum wage and still not been able to afford accommodation. Last year, he lost his job in a warehouse and found himself back on the streets. He and Remes soon became brothers in arms. \u201cHe was a very good friend. He\u2019d always help you out if you were in trouble. He\u2019d give you food or money if he had any. He was funny. He made a lot of jokes. He made people happy.\u201d Life on the streets was monotonous, Kasza says. In the morning they would go to the Connection, which adjoins the famous St Martin-in-the-Fields church in Trafalgar Square, where they could shower and have breakfast. In the afternoon, they would return to their spot by the tube. Sometimes they would go to soup kitchens; other times, they would go job hunting. At night, Kasza would sleep above ground close to Westminster tube station, while Remes would sleep in the underpass a few yards away from a woman called Sarah and her girlfriend. Just before settling down every evening, Kasza would walk down to the tunnel or Remes would come up the stairs to make sure they were safe, and they would wish each other goodnight. The main thing that kept Remes going was his desire to find a job. He was a proud man, and, unlike Kasza, refused to ask strangers for money. \u201cHe would never beg,\u201d says Kasza. \u201cIt was work or nothing. He loved working, but it is also hard to find a job if you don\u2019t have any accommodation.\u201d A classic catch-22 \u2013 no work, no home; no home, no work. Kasza says he preferred to work, but often there was none, and anyway he could make more money begging \u2013 occasionally as much as \u00a3100 a day, and usually \u00a3200-\u00a3300 a week. That was one of the attractions of Westminster \u2013 wealthy people or happy-go-lucky tourists passing by. They may be unlikely to stop and shoot the breeze, but they did sometimes drop a fiver in his cup. Kasza would save whatever he could, and put it in the bank. He hoped to save enough money to move into private rented accommodation. Occasionally, politicians gave him money. \u201cEd Miliband spoke to me and gave me his email when he was leader of the Labour party. He gave me \u00a35 and asked me why I was homeless. I said: \u2018I\u2019ve been here in the UK a long time \u2013 they should give me a house.\u2019 He said he would try to help me.\u201d Did he see him again? \u201cNo, that was the last time I saw him.\u201d Miliband was one of the few who did stop. \u201cMost of them don\u2019t know whether we are dead or alive.\u201d Remes hated the discomfort and indignity of being homeless. \u201cIt\u2019s not very nice,\u201d Kasza says. \u201cYou sleep on the floor, and it\u2019s dirty. You get drunk people coming out of clubs or going in, making noise. Gyula was a bit scared being on the street. He always wanted to get off. That\u2019s why he was so determined to get a job.\u201d Kasza says Remes loved to drink if he could afford it \u2013 cheap cider or Stella. How much? \u201cMaybe four cans of Stella. Maybe he\u2019d get drunk every second or third night. He was a happy drunk.\u201d Kasza says that, although he never saw Remes out of control, his friend did want to stop drinking. \u201cHe would tell me that he was only drinking because life is emotional, and because he wanted a job and felt alone. I would try to persuade him not to drink. One time he stopped for a couple of weeks and then started again.\u201d Kasza says they got little support from outreach workers. He claims they are not often seen, and, when they are, rarely offer practical support. \u201cThey just say there is no room in the shelters or you cannot stay in them because you do not qualify for benefits.\u201d Another problem is that trust appears to have broken down between homeless people and outreach workers. Today, big homelessness charities bid for contracts from local government. Those that win them are often thought to be beholden to their paymasters. In 2016, the Home Office decided that people sleeping rough in Britain were abusing EEA free-movement rights, and could be removed. In March 2017, it was revealed that big homelessness charities, including St Mungo\u2019s, had been passing information about rough sleepers to the Home Office, leading to their removal from the UK \u2013 127 non-UK-national rough sleepers were deported in a two-month pilot operation in Westminster. But in December 2017, the high court ruled that the Home Office policy to deport rough sleepers from countries in the EEA, known as Operation Adoze, was unlawful. Not surprisingly, by that point homeless people from the EEA, such as Remes and Kasza, had become suspicious of outreach workers. \u201cI have a few friends who were sleeping rough somewhere near us in Westminster, and they got taken away for sleeping there and held in a detention centre,\u201d Kasza says. * * * Gyula Remes died on a cold December night. Earlier in the evening, he had complained that life was too tough, and he couldn\u2019t continue in this way. But, as the drink flowed, he began to relax. It was only a week until Christmas, and the atmosphere among the Westminster rough-sleeping community was festive. \u201cA lot of people from my country were sleeping down there. Everybody was drinking and happy,\u201d Kasza says. He thinks it was about 10pm that he went upstairs to his spot by Caff\u00e8 Nero. Just before settling down for the night, at around 11pm, he went back down to the underpass to say good night and make sure everybody was OK. Remes was blue in the face, lying on his stomach and choking. His friends said he had been fine until he smoked a bit of a cigarette he had been handed by a young homeless man, and began to convulse. There is no way Remes would have touched it if he had known it had been laced with spice, Kasza says \u2013 he didn\u2019t even smoke regular cannabis. \u201cIt was definitely spice. We were so sad, shocked, panicking. One of the other guys called the ambulance. We heard the next day he had died. Everybody was crying.\u201d \u2018He made people happy,\u2019 says Gabor Kasza of his friend Gyula. Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian Five months on, how has Remes\u2019 death affected Kasza? \u201cIt has made me more sad about people not counting and people not caring. We thought things might change after Gyula\u2019s death, people would start caring, but nothing has changed.\u201d His move to Birmingham has not worked out. He thinks it is even harder for him because there are so few homeless charities in Birmingham to help him. It all seems so far away from his childhood when he sailed through his GCSEs, did a diploma in animal care and dreamed of becoming a farmer. Five years ago, his mother moved to Amsterdam to live with her partner, and he has struggled with housing ever since. Kasza is not the first in his family to experience homelessness. His father has been homeless in Hungary for much of the past 15 years, even though he works as a builder. This is one of the reasons he would not go back to Hungary. Despite everything, he believes he has better prospects here. More to the point, having spent most of his life here he regards Britain as home \u2013 even if it has often felt like an unwelcoming one. Kasza is remarkably sanguine about the way life has turned out for him. He says he is thankful for his health, his girlfriend and the fact that he still has a future to look forward to. Somehow, he has retained his appetite for life, despite all he has seen. He remains convinced that the next stroke of luck is just round the corner. * * * In Westminster, Labour MP David Lammy is multitasking \u2013 heading towards a meeting while explaining why he reacted so passionately after Remes\u2019 death. He says it was a moment of revelation. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe how quickly the political class had become indifferent to this suffering. We have people sleeping on Westminster station outside one of the Commons entrances, and 650 MPs have stepped over those people on their way into work. It\u2019s a travesty. In relation to our welfare state, our safety net, our morality really, because in the sixth richest economy in the world it simply should not be the case that so many people are without housing. I tweeted because I felt a sense of despair and loathing for a system that I\u2019m part of.\u201d What worries Lammy is that we have accepted homelessness as the norm. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now in Britain is a whole community of people who have no stake in society.\u201d Every day on his way to and from work, he passes Stroud Green bridge (next to Finsbury Park tube station in North London), which has become one of London\u2019s contemporary cardboard cities. How does that make him feel? \u201cI feel shame. I feel very upset that my young children, not yet teenagers, are becoming immune to them; immune to people who are sleeping under the bridge.\u201d Does he think anything has changed for the better since Remes\u2019 death? \u201cNo! Things have got worse.\u201d Actually, he says, one thing has changed. \u201dThey\u2019ve put up a barrier at Westminster tube to stop homeless people sleeping in the tunnel.\u201d His voice rises in disbelief. Commuters walk pass Dawn Hodgson the memorial she and others created for Gyula. Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty images Westminster is dysfunctional, says Norman Lamb \u2013 so many homeless people on the one hand, so many unoccupied buildings on the other. From his office in Portcullis House, next to the Houses of Parliament, he points out a nearby high-rise approved by Boris Johnson during his tenure as mayor. \u201cIt\u2019s largely owned by oligarchs, but it\u2019s very rarely occupied \u2026 I have argued for a punitive tax on any dwelling in London that is left empty. I can\u2019t understand why nobody has ever done it. It\u2019s the obvious thing that would end the problem or raise substantial amounts of money that you could use to house people.\u201d Lamb also voices his disgust at the barrier that has been erected in Westminster tunnel. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt a security justification, but the fact is it\u2019s closed off an area where people could get shelter overnight.\u201d Last week the New Statesman revealed that two months after Remes\u2019 death the chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons, Rose Hudson-Wilkin, complained to parliamentary authorities about the \u201congoing stench\u201d and \u201cunsanitary state\u201d created by rough sleepers in the underpass. * * * It is a hot May day, and Southwark coroner\u2019s court is empty except for the two of us, a journalist from a news agency and a handful of staff behind a glass window. The inquest cannot begin at 1pm as scheduled because assistant coroner Philip Barlow is not here yet. It starts at 1.26pm, and is over by 1.52pm \u2013 Gyula Remes\u2019 life is done and dusted in 26 minutes. Statements are provided by the head of outreach at St Mungo\u2019s, Kathleen Sims, and Jeremy Bernhaut for the Connection. Neither Sims nor Bernhaut are here in person. It all seems so desultory \u2013 a far cry from that December day when Remes died and politicians, campaigners and the media voiced their outrage that a rough sleeper could die on the streets outside parliament. Barlow tells the court that Remes has no family in Britain, but he believes there is a brother in Canada. There are few concrete facts about Remes\u2019 life. Barlow talks about Remes\u2019 desperation to work \u2013 in the short-term as a kitchen porter, with a long-term goal of getting a forklift licence. We also hear that drink sometimes got in the way of the prospect of employment. On 8 October, he was told by a potential employer that he smelled of alcohol, and a week later his caseworker at the Connection also told him he smelled strongly of booze, and should address that before his next job interview. But things were looking up for Remes: he was doing part-time kitchen work and had just been offered a full-time job. We learn that St Mungo\u2019s and the Connection first had contact with him on the streets in 2006, and worked with him on and off for seven years until he left to live \u2013 and work \u2013 in Malta, France and Hungary. After five years abroad, he returned to Britain in September 2018 and was spotted back on the streets by St Mungo\u2019s in October 2018. Remes was offered 12 weeks\u2019 accommodation at the Missionaries of Charity in south London, a hostel run by Catholic nuns with a strict no-alcohol/drugs policy. At the time, it was believed that he was working irregular hours as a street cleaner. On 26 October, he was thrown out after returning home late three nights in a row. Sims\u2019 statement reveals that St Mungo\u2019s street outreach services team saw him sleeping rough on 30 October in the tunnel at Westminster tube station, but he had refused to give them his details. Barlow says Remes was rejected twice for emergency accommodation at the Connection in October and on 11 December, a week before he died. He was told the hostel was full, but that, even if it had not been, he would not have been allowed in. \u201cHe did not meet the criteria for accessing it because he had not started work,\u201d Barlow says. \u201cAlso, because his working hours were due to be irregular, he did not meet the criteria.\u201d This is where the story of Gyula Remes becomes Kafkaesque. The notion that somebody can only meet the criteria for an emergency shelter if they are working seems absurd. Yet this appears to be the case, because working and paying tax is the only way he would have been eligible for benefits. Not only that, he would have to have been working regular hours to qualify for a place. In fact, according to Kasza, he had already started working full-time and had received his first payment the week he died. The more we examine the last months of Remes\u2019 life, the more he looks like a victim of the government\u2019s hostile environment policy. Here was a man who refused to give his name to the very charity that was supposed to support him (a charity that had been found to be helping the Home Office deport EEA nationals); a man not allowed to claim job seeker\u2019s allowance despite being desperate to find work; a man refused shelter in the December cold because it was believed that he did not yet have a job. The toxicology report presented at the inquest stated there was no sign of spice or morphine found in Remes\u2019 body, but that he had 369mg of alcohol in 100ml of urine \u2013 more than three times the drink-drive limit, according to the coroner. The emergency medical consultant at St Thomas\u2019 hospital said Remes had \u201cmild hypothermia\u201d that was \u201cunlikely to have any clinical significance on a patient\u2019s presentation\u201d. Barlow ruled that the cause of death was cardio-respiratory arrest and acute alcohol toxicity. \u201cMy short-form conclusion is that the death is alcohol related,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is impossible to think of the evidence in this case without considering the particular sadness that Mr Remes was hoping to find work and suffered his cardiac arrest in the centre of London near Westminster station shortly before Christmas.\u201d After giving the cause of death, Barlow said: \u201cIt\u2019s no doubt a measure of the pressure the various charities and organisations are under that he didn\u2019t always meet the criteria for accommodation.\u201d The statement, delivered quietly, but with heartfelt conviction, felt like a rebuke. But it was unclear who was being rebuked. * * * Just after Remes died, the Connection issued a statement. \u201cWe are very sad and sorry to hear about the death of Gyula Remes, and would like to extend our condolences to his family and friends. We worked closely with Gyula and will remember him as a funny, charming and amiable man \u2013 he always had a smile on his face and was well liked by everyone who worked with him. Just before his death, he told us he was working part-time as a kitchen porter, and working towards getting into full-time employment. We were also helping him to get into a night shelter while he secured a full-time job.\u201d What the statement didn\u2019t say is that the Connection refused him a place at its own night centre the week before he died. The Connection is one of the country\u2019s best-known homelessness charities. For more than 90 years, BBC Radio has supported St Martin\u2019s work with homeless and vulnerably housed people. Over the past two Christmas appeals, Radio 4 listeners raised more than \u00a35m to help three homeless charities, including the Connection, provide shelter, food and advice. We ask the Connection if any of the staff would like to share their memories of Remes. The press office replies that staff members \u201care not keen on being interviewed face to face\u201d, but that the chief executive, Pam Orchard, is happy to meet us. A memorial marks the place where Gyula Remes used to sleep. Photograph: Tom Nicholson/LNP/REX/Shutterstock On the ground floor at the Connection, homeless people are using computers in a large glass-fronted room. They come to the Connection to shower, have breakfast, reconnect with their home city or country, and find work. We take the lift to the second floor and Orchard\u2019s office. She has worked in the homelessness sector for 15 years, and has been at the Connection for the past two. She reads out a list of anonymised tributes to Remes from a printed sheet of paper. One staff member remembers that, in 2008, he would always attend the Connection with a close friend, and that they were something of a double act. Orchard says that although she never personally knew Remes, her staff were fond of him. \u201cGyula was good-natured. He was quite a big guy. Somebody describes him as a gentle giant. He never used his size to intimidate people.\u201d She fast-forwards a decade to 2018 when he returned to London and the Connection. \u201cBy now, he was drinking a lot more. He\u2019d be visibly under the influence in a way he hadn\u2019t been in his previous engagements. He said he was drinking because he had time on his hands.\u201d Orchard looks up from her notes. \u201cOften people drink because their mental health isn\u2019t great, and they are self-medicating.\u201d We ask her what criteria Remes failed to meet for a place in the emergency shelter just before he died. The atmosphere becomes frosty. Orchard asks us to turn our recorder off. We decline to do so, saying this should be a matter of public record. She says the issue of criteria is complex, not one that can be captured in a soundbite or headline. \u201cWe do our absolute best with limited resources,\u201d she says. \u201cIf something goes wrong, which it inevitably does, because lots of our clients are extremely vulnerable and have got complex needs, there is a temptation to look for someone to blame and to look at what someone\u2019s engagement in the service has been, and then find reasons to pick holes in what they did in order to demonstrate that if only they could or should have done something it would have been different. So you can look at our night shelter criteria as much as you like, and go: \u2018If you\u2019d done such and such, that wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u2019 But it feels a bit like you\u2019re shooting the messenger.\u201d We ask whether anybody from the Connection attended Remes\u2019 funeral, and whether it held its own service. She says she is unsure, but mentions Marcos Amaral Gourgel, a Portuguese former model who died homeless in Westminster ten months before Remes, and who had also been supported by the Connection. After his death, it was revealed that he had been convicted of child sexual abuse in Portugal, and Orchard says the tabloids were critical of the support the Connection had given him. \u201cSo we get blamed for not doing enough, and we get blamed for doing too much. You just can\u2019t win, can you? So we\u2019ll just do what we can as well as we can.\u201d A few days later, the Connection\u2019s press office sends through the criteria for accessing the night centre: people have to be over 18, have been rough sleeping in Westminster, referred from an approved referral agency (the local authority, police, the NHS or other homeless charities), and they have to be \u201cpositively engaging with an agreed action plan that is a realistic and sustainable route off the streets\u201d. The statement continues: \u201cThe fact Gyula had no access to welfare meant the best and most sustainable way we could support him was to help him access sufficient employment to pay rent in the private rented sector.\u201d The statement further explains that, although its most recent work with Remes focused on helping him find work, \u201cunfortunately, this had not translated into a realistic and sustainable route off the streets and so we were unable to accommodate him in our night shelter\u201d. We are left baffled. After all, the assistant coroner said at the inquest that Remes had recently been offered a full-time job, and the condolences issued by the Connection after Remes died stated: \u201cJust before his death he told us he was working part-time as a kitchen porter, and working towards getting into full-time employment.\u201d * * * It is eight months since Gyula Remes died. In Birmingham, Gabor Kasza says he does not know where his friend is buried or his ashes scattered. Nobody seems to know. We tell him about the inquest verdict, that Remes died of a heart attack and acute alcohol poisoning. He says he cannot believe it. He is still convinced spice did for Remes, and that he had had only about four cans of lager that night. He asks why he wasn\u2019t called to give evidence \u2013 after all, he knew Remes well and was trying to resuscitate him as he was dying. Kasza says he has some good news. \u201cI\u2019ve got a job in a cafe. I\u2019ve been working a few weeks now, almost a month. It\u2019s a big cafe. I\u2019m enjoying it. And I\u2019m renting a room with my girlfriend.\u201d Things are looking up, he says. On 6 July 2019, the Observer\u2019s home affairs editor, Mark Townsend, reported that the Home Office had \u201crolled out a remarkably similar scheme\u201d to Operation Adoze, despite the fact that the original scheme was ruled unlawful in December 2017. The story revealed that the Home Office had drawn up a programme called the Rough Sleeping Support Service (RSSS), using homelessness charities to acquire and pass on sensitive personal data that could result in the deportation of non-UK-national rough sleepers. Emails showed that St Mungo\u2019s attended meetings with the Home Office in which discussions were held about allowing outreach workers to enter a homeless person\u2019s data into the RSSS without their consent, which would breach European privacy laws. The Home Office said the RSSS was set up \u201cto help resolve the immigration status of non-UK nationals sleeping rough, either granting lawful status or providing documentation. This enables individuals to access support or assists them in leaving the UK where appropriate.\u201d St Mungo\u2019s tells us: \u201cWe do not share any information about our clients with the Home Office without the client\u2019s full and informed consent. In the case of the Rough Sleeping Support Service, our position has always been that people cannot be referred to the service unless they have first received advice and have also given their consent.\u201d It is early October and the JustGiving fund set up by anonymous parliamentary staff in memory of Remes is still online. Underneath a photograph of the Houses of Parliament at sunset, it says: \u201cIn memory of Gyula Remes, the homeless man who died outside parliament.\u201d A badge at the top reveals 485 people have contributed and it has raised \u00a311,145 \u2013 the target had been just \u00a31,000. But this seems to be the fund that time forgot. It is open for donations, although nobody has contributed for eight months. As with so much of Remes\u2019 life, indignity is piled upon indignity. Alongside a memorial candle, in smaller type, it says: \u201cIn memory of Gyula Remef.\u201d As for homeless death statistics, they continue to rise relentlessly. On 1 October 2019, the ONS estimated that 726 homeless people died in 2018 in England and Wales, a 22% year on year increase. Westminster council recorded 17 deaths \u2013 the highest number among London\u2019s local authorities. Alarmingly, deaths as a result of drug use have more than doubled in the six years the ONS has been recording the data. Outside Westminster tube on a warm day, a woman with cropped hair and a toothy smile is sitting in her sleeping bag. We show her a photograph of Remes, and ask if she recognises it. She blinks, then answers. \u201cWho\u2019s that? That\u2019s Julius, innit,\u201d she says. \u201cOf course I recognise him. My girlfriend and I used to sleep near him in the tunnel \u2013 just a few yards away.\u201d Sarah Anderson is a 38-year-old Londoner. Like many women living on the streets, she ended up there after escaping an abusive relationship. She says a male former partner stabbed her and claims she lost her right to benefits because she was told she had made herself intentionally homeless. Anderson holds up the picture of Remes and smiles. \u201cHe was lovely \u2013 so loving. Every time he walked in, he\u2019d say: \u2018You all right, babe? How are you?\u2019 in his fandangled way, trying to speak our language, bless him. He\u2019d always ask how we were, and if we\u2019d eaten.\u201d We tell her that Kasza is in Birmingham, and has a job. Her face lights up. \u201cI know Gabor. How is he?\u201d She says how pleased she is for him and mentions his girlfriend by name. Anderson talks about the memorial she and her friends made for Remes. \u201cWe made it with a black bag all the way round where he used to sleep. We got candles; we even got the politicians involved. They were coming past offering us money. We said: \u2018Don\u2019t offer us money, go and buy flowers. And they actually went and bought some.\u2019\u201d Do the MPs still speak to her? \u201cNo. They used to before it all happened.\u201d Has she got a message for them? \u201cHelp us. Get us off the streets. Do something.\u201d After Remes\u2019 death, she says the outreach team came round and gave Anderson and her then partner, Dawn, rail tickets to Newcastle, where Dawn comes from. \u201cWe ended up spending Christmas there last year.\u201d Why does she think they bought them the tickets? \u201cMore than likely to clear the streets around here. I\u2019m not being funny \u2013 there was a hell of a lot of publicity the day he died.\u201d Like Norman Lamb, Anderson talks about all the unoccupied buildings around her, and how they could be turned into giant luxury hostels. She will be sleeping on the street tonight and for the foreseeable future. She says she could probably get emergency shelter, but her mental health isn\u2019t good, and she doesn\u2019t want to be in a dorm surrounded by addicts, temptation and noise. Has anything changed since Remes died? \u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have stopped us going into the underpass where we used to sleep at night. They\u2019ve closed it off with shutters.\u201d Anderson says she was devastated when she heard of her friend\u2019s death. \u201cOf course, I knew somebody could die on the streets, but when it happens literally lying in front of you it doesn\u2019t half shit the life out of you. It really does. Because you don\u2019t expect it to happen to one of your own.\u201d Does she still think of Remes? \u201cEvery day,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery bloody day.\u201d In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailingjo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Scotland returned home early anyway after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/13/japan-scotland-rugby-world-cup-match-report\">losing 28-21 to the hosts</a> who face South Africa in Sunday\u2019s quarter-final here.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe tournament rules are clear about appropriate behaviour,\u201d said Alan Gilpin, the tournament director at a media briefing on Tuesday. \u201cAs a result, we have asked an independent disputes committee to look at the behaviour and comments of the Scottish union. Because of that, it would be inappropriate to comment any further.\u201d</p> \n<p>The charge will be misconduct through bringing the game into disrepute. The committee will be set up \u201cas soon as possible\u201d although the organisers did not say what punishment Scotland could face. There is no precedent in the World Cup, but last year the Toulon owner Mourad Boudjellal was fined 75,000 euros for misconduct after making disparaging remarks about the organisers of the European Champions Cup and condoning homophobic remarks.</p> \n<p>The one punishment that could hurt Scotland on the pitch is to dock them points from their pool. They finished third, which ensures their pre-qualification for the 2023 World Cup in France, six points above Samoa. A fine is the most likely sanction if they are found guilty.</p> \n<p>Gilpin said the three matches that were called off on the weekend due to the typhoon could not be staged elsewhere on the days they were meant to be played because Hagibis affected such a wide area of Japan. He added that, contrary to reports, no union had a say in the decision.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He also paid tribute to the army of staff and volunteers who worked through Saturday night and into Sunday morning to ensure the match between Japan and Scotland went ahead in Yokohama.</p> \n<p>\u201cI can only pay tribute to their desire for the match to be played and their resilience in ensuring it was,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of the venue staff slept at the stadium overnight so they would be able to immediately assess any damage caused by the typhoon.

      "bodyText": "World Rugby is taking disciplinary action against the Scottish Rugby Union for remarks made by its chief executive, Mark Dodson, over the potential cancellation of last Sunday\u2019s match against Japan due to Typhoon Hagibis. Dodson held a media conference on Friday night having been interviewed on a national radio station in Britain and said the tournament regulations \u2013 which stipulated a called-off match could not be moved to another day, and which his union had accepted having signed the participation agreement \u2013 were far from watertight. He did not accept that there was no scope for the organisers to reschedule after being told that if the game did not go ahead against Japan on Sunday it would be cancelled and recorded as a 0-0 draw. He said his union would consider legal action. \u201cMy view is that we are not going to let Scotland be the collateral damage for a decision that was taken in haste,\u201d he added. Scotland returned home early anyway after losing 28-21 to the hosts who face South Africa in Sunday\u2019s quarter-final here. \u201cThe tournament rules are clear about appropriate behaviour,\u201d said Alan Gilpin, the tournament director at a media briefing on Tuesday. \u201cAs a result, we have asked an independent disputes committee to look at the behaviour and comments of the Scottish union. Because of that, it would be inappropriate to comment any further.\u201d The charge will be misconduct through bringing the game into disrepute. The committee will be set up \u201cas soon as possible\u201d although the organisers did not say what punishment Scotland could face. There is no precedent in the World Cup, but last year the Toulon owner Mourad Boudjellal was fined 75,000 euros for misconduct after making disparaging remarks about the organisers of the European Champions Cup and condoning homophobic remarks. The one punishment that could hurt Scotland on the pitch is to dock them points from their pool. They finished third, which ensures their pre-qualification for the 2023 World Cup in France, six points above Samoa. A fine is the most likely sanction if they are found guilty. Gilpin said the three matches that were called off on the weekend due to the typhoon could not be staged elsewhere on the days they were meant to be played because Hagibis affected such a wide area of Japan. He added that, contrary to reports, no union had a say in the decision. He also paid tribute to the army of staff and volunteers who worked through Saturday night and into Sunday morning to ensure the match between Japan and Scotland went ahead in Yokohama. \u201cI can only pay tribute to their desire for the match to be played and their resilience in ensuring it was,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of the venue staff slept at the stadium overnight so they would be able to immediately assess any damage caused by the typhoon. Others turned up that morning despite their houses being destroyed. They just wanted to make it happen and it was another sign of the remarkable commitment to the tournament shown by so many here. We owe them a huge debt of gratitude.\u201d World Rugby has been criticised for bringing the tournament to a country that suffers an average of 36 typhoons a year but its chairman, Sir Bill Beaumont, said he would have \u201cno hesitation at all\u201d in recommending Japan for another tournament, adding that he did not think this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for young supporters here. \u201cHagibis was not just a typhoon but the most powerful one in Japan for 60 years,\u201d said Gilpin. \u201cIt was something exceptional.\u201d Asked whether concerns about what is happening to the climate throughout the world would prompt the organisers to look at the format, he added: \u201cOf course. \u201cWe are already looking at issues such as whether teams should have more than 31 players in their squads and whether to increase the number of participating teams from 20 to 24. We will consider the length of the tournament and every decision we take will be based first on player welfare.\u201d The three cancellations blotted the end of the pool stage, but otherwise records here have been broken. Ticket sales are 99%, one per cent better than England in 2015, record numbers have attended the fan zones and more than 200,000 Japan replica jerseys have been sold. Social media reach has never been greater with 650m video views so far. The push now is for Japan to get greater international recognition rather than return to the relative obscurity of tier two competition. \u201cI am sure there will be many treasurers of tier one unions who will relish the chance of giving Japan a fixture,\u201d said Beaumont. \u201cThey will attract fans because of their incredible style of play.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ronan Farrow\u2019s book on the #MeToo movement has been withdrawn from sale in Australia by one online bookseller but was available in bookstores on Tuesday despite a legal threat from an Australian journalist who Farrow has previously alleged helped to protect the disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein from negative publicity. The book, Catch and Kill, was released in Australia on Tuesday and was on sale in some shops, including Readings and WH Smith in Melbourne. But customers who ordered it from the online seller Booktopia were told it had been \u201cwithdrawn from sale\u201d and had their payment refunded. Lawyers for Dylan Howard, a former reporter for Channel Seven who is now a senior executive at the tabloid media company American Media Inc in New York, wrote to Australian booksellers last month alleging that Farrow\u2019s book might contain \u201cfalse and defamatory allegations\u201d. \u201cOur client has put the publisher, Little, Brown Book Group Limited (in the USA and UK) and Hachette Australia Pty Ltd \u2026 on notice that if the defamatory content is included in the book, we are instructed to take such legal action as may be appropriate,\u201d the letter said. The letter urged booksellers to liaise with the publisher to determine that the allegedly defamatory content was not included in the book, and warned that Howard might include booksellers as a party to any defamation proceedings that might be started against the publisher. Guardian Australia contacted a number of bookstores on Tuesday and was told that most were yet to receive their shipment of the book, but had not received a notice not to sell. \u201cThe official release date is today but we haven\u2019t received stock yet,\u201d said David May of Sydney\u2019s Gleebooks. \u201cBut as far as I know we are planning to stock and sell it.\u201d \u201cWe haven\u2019t been asked to withdraw it. We would be expecting stock any day from a mainstream supplier. And we would be expecting to put it on shelves.\u201d Other stores said it was normal for deliveries to be delayed for a day or two until after the official release date. The publisher, Hachette Australia, confirmed that \u201cthe book is out as planned\u201d. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any reason for delay \u2013 it\u2019s just people unpacking stock,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cIt\u2019s available from today.\u201d Another independent retailer said that unless it was told to withdraw the book by the publisher it would not remove it from the shelves. In response to questions from Guardian Australia, the legal firm acting for Howard, McLachlan Thorpe, said Howard had not \u201cwarned\u201d booksellers not to stock the book, \u201cbut rather he has put distributors on notice that they all are exposed to actions in defamation by our client if the book\u2019s demonstrably false claims about Mr Howard are published\u201d. If the book included defamatory imputations, the author, publisher and booksellers would all be open to legal action, the lawyers said. The book contains extensive references to Howard, who it alleges frequently met Weinstein and who was investigating Weinstein\u2019s accusers as editor-in-chief of the National Enquirer. Farrow told the ABC\u2019s 7.30 on Tuesday that he was blocked from publishing his initial investigation about Weinstein by his then employer, NBC, and that news networks could be influenced by their own history of payouts and cover-ups for sexual harassment. \u201cIt\u2019s my hope that the product of this careful multi-year investigation is at least an incisive conversation about what needs to change in the media, to make sure that it is the instrument of truth telling and accountability that it can and should be, and not an instrument of suppression,\u201d Farrow said. In 2017 Farrow named Howard as one of several individuals who had allegedly acted to protect Weinstein\u2019s reputation. Farrow\u2019s New Yorker article quoted an email exchange between Howard and Weinstein in December 2016 in which Howard allegedly told Weinstein about information obtained by one of AMI\u2019s reporters that cast the actor Rose McGowan, who has accused Weinstein of rape, in a negative light. It was reported that Howard was overseeing a television production agreement between AMI and the Weinstein company, which has since been terminated. He said in a response included in the New Yorker article that he had \u201can obligation to protect AMI\u2019s interests by seeking out \u2013 but not publishing \u2013 truthful information about people who Mr. Weinstein insisted were making false claims against him\u201d. He said he was careful to separate the corporate partnership from his journalistic obligations and that any off the record information that may have been provided to Weinstein would never have been allowed to be published, according to the New Yorker. Howard began his journalism career at the Geelong Advertiser and moved to the US in 2009. His contract with Channel Seven in Australia was not renewed in 2008 after he was cleared by a police investigation into the publication of the private medical records of Australian rules footballers. In 2018 Howard sued Channel Nine\u2019s 60 Minutes program to prevent the release of footage of him obtained in the lobby of his New York office, Nine Newspapers reported.",

Like most women, she\u2019s no stranger to pain; and growing up in the throes of China\u2019s political upheaval and later immigrating to a foreign country with no language or cultural knowledge, she is powered by struggle and wears trauma like a second skin. But cancer was a new beast.</p> <p>So when the oncologist called us in for the first meeting and proceeded to dispassionately plow through the treatment plan \u2013 surgery, a year of aggressive chemotherapy and radiation, debilitating side effects and odds of recurrence \u2013 the weight of the diagnosis was stifling. My mother\u2019s English is limited but her fear was palpable. I tried my best to voice her concerns: what will the drugs do to her body? When will her hair fall out? Will she still be able to feel like herself? Why was all this happening?</p> <p>Our questions were met with furrowed brows and defensive rebukes, as if to say, it\u2019s cancer, haven\u2019t you heard? He seemed to view her trepidations as direct challenges to his expertise. The oncologist couldn\u2019t understand why my mother failed to grasp the details of his well-rehearsed monologue, one he had given hundreds if not thousands of times before. Moreover, he was disappointed that she hadn\u2019t accepted her fate and moved on to thinking about recovery. She was being \u201cdifficult\u201d. While I translated these grievances, he took a personal call, replied to a text message and glanced furiously at his watch. We had overstayed our welcome, the obligatory 15 minutes per patient. That was how long it took to deliver the worst news of my mother\u2019s life and what it was going to cost her.</p> <p>We were ushered from his office in a daze.

      "bodyText": "The cancer ward at my local hospital has become an adopted home. I can manoeuvre the hallways to radiotherapy with my eyes glued to a phone; I know which seat to occupy in the specialist waiting area to catch the oncologist\u2019s eye as they emerge from their dens; and I remember that only the ground-floor cafeteria stocks the fruit-flavoured water that quells the numbness in my mother\u2019s mouth after a chemotherapy session. Despite this tenuous acceptance of the new normal that sickness brings, what rarely feels familiar are the relationships with the people entrusted to alleviate your suffering \u2013 those in charge of delivering the worst news of your life: the doctors. Which begs the question, how would you want the news of your mortality to be delivered? My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer twice in the span of three years. Like most women, she\u2019s no stranger to pain; and growing up in the throes of China\u2019s political upheaval and later immigrating to a foreign country with no language or cultural knowledge, she is powered by struggle and wears trauma like a second skin. But cancer was a new beast. So when the oncologist called us in for the first meeting and proceeded to dispassionately plow through the treatment plan \u2013 surgery, a year of aggressive chemotherapy and radiation, debilitating side effects and odds of recurrence \u2013 the weight of the diagnosis was stifling. My mother\u2019s English is limited but her fear was palpable. I tried my best to voice her concerns: what will the drugs do to her body? When will her hair fall out? Will she still be able to feel like herself? Why was all this happening? Our questions were met with furrowed brows and defensive rebukes, as if to say, it\u2019s cancer, haven\u2019t you heard? He seemed to view her trepidations as direct challenges to his expertise. The oncologist couldn\u2019t understand why my mother failed to grasp the details of his well-rehearsed monologue, one he had given hundreds if not thousands of times before. Moreover, he was disappointed that she hadn\u2019t accepted her fate and moved on to thinking about recovery. She was being \u201cdifficult\u201d. While I translated these grievances, he took a personal call, replied to a text message and glanced furiously at his watch. We had overstayed our welcome, the obligatory 15 minutes per patient. That was how long it took to deliver the worst news of my mother\u2019s life and what it was going to cost her. We were ushered from his office in a daze. Our encounter bore no resemblance to the tales of transformative cancer journeys that adorned the hospital brochures. There were no magnanimous surgeons and smiling oncologists to steer us forward. Our clinical reality was bodies from wall to wall in varying stages of ruin, all waiting for their 15 minutes. My mother\u2019s story is not unique.

Similar studies have also shown that good communication from doctors greatly aids a patient\u2019s recovery and quality of survivorship. Yet it\u2019s hard for sobering data sets to compete with the romantic notions of rebirth and transcendence that often drive our public appetite for rousing cancer stories.

      "bodyText": "The former US national security adviser, John Bolton, was reportedly so alarmed at a back-channel effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate Donald Trump\u2019s political rivals that he told a senior aide to report it to White House lawyers. The revelation of Bolton\u2019s involvement in the effort to block a shadow foreign policy aimed at Trump\u2019s political benefit emerged from congressional testimony given by his former aide, Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert in the White House. Hill, the British-born former senior director for Europe and Russia on the National Security Council, spoke to three House committees for 10 hours. According to the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, Hill described a sharp exchange on 10 July between Bolton and the US ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, about the role played by Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to persuade the Ukrainian government to open investigations into Democrats, including former vice president Joe Biden. Hill said Bolton instructed her to tell the National Security Council\u2019s attorney that Giuliani was acting in concert with White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, in a rogue operation with legal implications. \u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal Rudy and Mulvaney are cooking up,\u201d Bolton instructed Hill to tell the NSC lawyer, according to her testimony. She said that Bolton had told her on an earlier occasion: \u201cGiuliani\u2019s a hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up.\u201d Hill also testified on Monday morning before three congressional committees about Trump\u2019s decision, taken despite strenuous objections from aides including herself, to recall the US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. The Washington Post reported that she had confronted Sondland over the Giuliani\u2019s activities, which were not coordinated with officials charged with carrying out US foreign policy. Sondland is due to give his version of events on Thursday. According to Fox News, Hill told congressional investigators that she and other officials went to the national security council lawyer with their concerns that the White House was seeking to prompt Ukraine to open investigations into Trump\u2019s rivals. Hill\u2019s lawyer had earlier rejected arguments from the president\u2019s attorneys that her testimony on Ukraine was covered by executive privilege. In a letter to the White House, the lawyer, Lee Wolosky, said much of the material was already in the public domain and that \u201cdeliberative process privilege \u201cdisappears altogether when there is any reason to believe government misconduct occurred.\u201d The week could deteriorate rapidly for Trump, whose effort to rally defenders in his own party has been damaged by concerns about a growing disaster in northern Syria, following Trump\u2019s abrupt pullback there, and a sense that major secrets attached to the Ukraine scandal are yet to come out. Sondland\u2019s testimony on Thursday comes after a previous attempt by the hotelier-turned-diplomat to testify was blocked by the state department, as part of a blanket White House defiance of the impeachment inquiry. Congress is also due this week to receive relevant documents from an array of the most powerful figures in the administration, including the vice-president, the defense secretary and the White House chief of staff. Out of the flow of new information, congressional investigators hope to fill in the picture of the Trump administration\u2019s dealings in Ukraine, and answer the question of whether Trump\u2019s conduct rises to the \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d cited in the constitution as grounds for impeachment. The impeachment inquiry was sparked by a whistleblower complaint filed in August that in part described a 25 July phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which Trump requested the \u201cfavor\u201d of an investigation into a potential 2020 rival, Joe Biden. Trump and Republicans have repeated unproven allegations of corruption against Hunter Biden, the former vice-president\u2019s son who was on the board of a gas company in the eastern European country while his father was involved in international efforts to curb corruption in its government. The stark nature of Trump\u2019s request to Zelenskiy has boosted support for Trump\u2019s impeachment, according to polling averages. The administration has struggled to find a message to rebut the perception of its own corruption, with the president, at times seemingly alone in his own defense, lashing out on Twitter against Democrats, the whistleblower, the media, Biden and more. Hill\u2019s testimony could significantly add to allegations of wrongdoing by Trump and Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor commonly described as the president\u2019s personal lawyer, who headed up the president\u2019s personal agenda in Ukraine while working on behalf of local clients of his own. Trump and Giuliani have denied wrongdoing. A good deal of Hill\u2019s testimony focused on Yovanovitch, a widely respected diplomat who worked under six presidents and who defied the state department gag order to testify herself last Friday. Yovanovitch said she had been the target of a smear campaign inside the administration fueled by Giuliani. \u201cI do not know Mr Giuliani\u2019s motives for attacking me,\u201d Yovanovitch said in an opening statement released to the press. \u201cBut individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.\u201d Two Giuliani business associates from the former Soviet Union, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested at a Washington DC-area airport last week on suspected campaign finance violations regarding a large check they wrote to a political committee supporting Trump and donations to at least one Republican congressman, Pete Sessions of Texas. On Monday, Giuliani told Reuters he was paid $500,000 for work he did for a company co-founded by Parnas. Giuliani said he was hired to consult and provide legal advice to company Fraud Guarantee\u2019s technologies. After a May 2018 meeting between Parnas and Sessions, Sessions sent a letter to the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, urging Yovanovitch\u2019s dismissal because she had \u201cspoken privately and repeatedly about her disdain for the current administration\u2019\u201d. Yovanovitch denied the charge but she was dismissed nevertheless, in a move potentially driven by Ukrainians elements she was ostensibly charged with confronting and helping to dismantle. It was also reported last week that Giuliani himself is the subject of an investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan.",

Mullen told shareholders at the company\u2019s annual general meeting in Melbourne on Tuesday he believes Australia would have access to better broadband than is available on the NBN today, at no cost to taxpayers, had the government not embarked on rolling out the NBN. \u201cIt is always easier to comment with the benefit of hindsight, but it is my view that over the last 10 years private sector competition between strong players such as Telstra, Optus, TPG and others was always going to build 100 [megabit per second] broadband access and speed to the majority of the population of Australia in an ongoing competitive landscape and at no cost whatsoever to the taxpayer,\u201d he said. It would have then been up to governments to subsidise broadband in regional and rural areas where companies like Telstra deemed it unaffordable, he said. \u201cInstead, however, in the NBN we have created a state-owned monopoly that is going to cost the country more than $50bn.\u201d When the NBN was first mooted by Labor in 2007 and 2008, the original plan was for a fibre-to-the-node network, and structural separation of Telstra\u2019s wholesale and retail businesses \u2013 something Telstra, under then CEO Sol Trujillo, opposed at the time.

It is unclear whether he intends to appeal the sentence. Punchard is the first police officer sentenced to a jail term for computer hacking offences. In other high-profile cases police officers have been hit with substantial fines but courts did not record convictions. An officer who looked up the details of the former Australian netball captain Laura Geitz was fined $4,000. The improper use of police databases to access information has been described as a \u201csystemic problem\u201d in Queensland. In sentencing Punchard to jail time and choosing to impose a conviction, the court acknowledged that the leaking of the woman\u2019s address had put her at risk.

However, there is one person who I have become close friends with over the past year. When she introduced me to her wider, fairly new social group I was made to feel unwelcome and uncomfortable by them. My friend seems oblivious to this and keeps inviting me to join them on social outings. Should I explain to her that I would like to be her friend only, and risk causing a drama, or just keep quiet and hope she doesn\u2019t perceive my distance as being flaky or uninterested in her friendship?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s one of the oldest ethical questions: how much do I really need to tell the truth about? If you\u2019re frank with this new friend, and you tell her you can\u2019t stand the company she keeps, you risk alienating her and losing her as well as them. But if you\u2019re not honest enough, and just mysteriously have to wash your hair every time they hang out, you risk seeming anti-social and ungrateful for the invitation. It\u2019s a social quagmire, right after you relocated, when what you probably want most is solid ground.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a question that might help: do you owe anyone the truth here? Her, or for that matter, yourself?</p> <p>Some ethicists take our obligations to the truth very seriously, in which case this isn\u2019t a pragmatic question about how to keep your friendship, it\u2019s not even a question. You just have to tell the truth. Could this be the situation?</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with whether you owe her the truth. Usually your gut knows, but here are some thoughts to get it metabolising the question. What was it about them that made you uncomfortable? Were they harmful in some way, that they\u2019ll keep being until someone calls them out? Rude, sexist, racist? Did they do something you think is genuinely morally objectionable, or was it just that they like beer and you like wine and cheese?</p> <p>It\u2019s OK for people not to get on. We all have facets of ourselves that we rotate into different configurations like a Rubik cube depending on what the occasion is and who we\u2019re around. Your friend, if she\u2019s a grown-up human, already understands that. That means that if it isn\u2019t a serious moral issue you need to speak up about, you can subtly communicate \u201cI like you, but not them\u201d in a less awkward way than a sit-down, out-loud conversation. You\u2019re not introducing her to a brand new idea. She\u2019ll get it. And doing that doesn\u2019t need to be flaky. Real friendship lives in the gesture; the sustained attention we pay each other when we think life goes better with the other person around. You can find your own ways of showing her that.</p> <p>But what if there\u2019s a truth you owe yourself? I wonder whether you\u2019re privately worried about how much you really know this person, if she likes people who abrade you so much. Maybe her failure to notice your discomfort made you worry that she\u2019s not as thoughtful of you as you are of her.</p> <p>I think it would help to be as honest with yourself as possible about exactly what made you uncomfortable. Friendship matters. Finding people we love and hanging on to them may be the only thing that matters.

      "bodyText": "Advocates for pill testing have welcomed news that the New South Wales coroner is poised to recommend the introduction of pill testing at music festivals. The deputy state coroner Harriet Grahame will recommend pill testing and the abolition of police sniffer dogs and body searches, according to a leaked draft of her final report obtained by the Daily Telegraph. Grahame oversaw weeks of testimony and evidence during the coronial inquest into drug-related festival deaths, conducted this year. Her final report is due on 8 November, but on Tuesday, a draft that was given to the Department of Health and the NSW police was made public. Pill testing is opposed by the police and the state\u2019s premier, Gladys Berejiklian, but the Greens MP Cate Faehrmann said on Tuesday the coroner\u2019s findings should change their minds. \u201cThe premier can\u2019t hide from the evidence,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the coroner hands down findings in relation to pill testing and reducing police presence, it is because that will save lives. \u201cWhen those recommendations see the light of day, I urge the premier to adopt those recommendations, listen to the evidence and throw out the politics on this issue.\u201d On Tuesday, the transport minister, Andrew Constance, said he does \u201cnot see pill testing as the answer.\u201d \u201cWhat we are seeing is young people at these festivals overdosing, dehydrated, and they\u2019re losing their lives,\u201d he said. But Faehrmann said the findings should be acted on before festival season began in the summer. She said pill-testing bodies were \u201cready to go\u201d and could implement testing once the government gave the green light. \u201cThe government can\u2019t say it is too expensive or too complicated. [Pill-testing operators] are ready to go. They have told the government they are ready to go. They have all the facilities and experts ready to establish services at various music festivals if the government wants to trial pill testing.\u201d In April the ACT government trialled pill testing at the Groovin The Moo festival in Canberra. Organisers said it potentially saved seven lives. A more detailed report into the trial is also expected before the end of the year. \u201cWhat the premier will have before her is mounting evidence of the effectiveness of pill testing in reducing deaths from overdoses at music festivals,\u201d Faehrmann said. \u201cIf we have the coronial inquest recommending pill testing as a way to save lives and the premier doesn\u2019t have the courage to implement pill testing, then I think she has to wear what happens over the summer frankly.\u201d A spokeswoman for the NSW coroner\u2019s court said: \u201cThe findings will be handed down on 8 November 2019.

Following years of unknown plans and unfulfilled promises, there is cause for optimism at the proposal to transform the W-League into a sustainable, competitive, and fully-professional competition with an enthusiastic and engaged fan culture.

By the end of the 1980s, football seemed to be embracing the ultra-conservatism of the Thatcher-Reagan years. Stifling defensive tactics ruled, officials largely turned a blind-eye to ankle-shredding tackles and, despite heroic dissidents of the likes of Diego Maradona, Marco van Basten and Roberto Baggio, goalscoring risked becoming a marginalised art.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1b7d3dad20adc82607eff797ed9505601775f57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1b7d3dad20adc82607eff797ed9505601775f57/0_41_3776_2267/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Referee Chris Beath speaks with Victory\u2019s Ola Toivonen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Referee Chris Beath speaks with Victory\u2019s Ola Toivonen during the Melbourne derby.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Pockett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It all came to a head at the 1990 World Cup, where the goals-per-game average was a meagre 2.21 (the lowest ever). Highlighting this was an officiating bungle in the third-place play-off between Italy and England that has since attained cult status. Italian Nicola Berti \u2013 who ironically later spent a notoriously languid season in Australia\u2019s National Soccer League \u2013 saw his headed effort disallowed despite being <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Umkss-UESg\">about 10 yards and four defenders onside</a>.</p> <p>Back then the issue of how to make scoring goals sexy again provoked much tomfoolery, including calls to extend the size of the goal-frame. Of course, what makes football exciting isn\u2019t simply the number the times the ball hits the net per match. Some of the most transcendent contests of that era \u2013 France v Brazil at the 1986 World Cup; the 1991 Serie A title decider between Internazionale and Sampdoria \u2013 were exceedingly tense, low-scoring affairs.</p> <p>Rather, it all comes down to attitudes, and slowly but surely these began to change. The speed of the game increased immeasurably, defensive butchery was largely outlawed and the goals began to flow at more suitable levels (2.6 per game by the 2018 men\u2019s World Cup; 2.8 at the 2019 women\u2019s World Cup).</p> <p>But underneath it all there remained a lingering conservatism in how games are officiated, particularly around offsides. Despite Fifa issuing an edict to the effect that the benefit of the doubt should be given to the attacking team, assistant referees kept intervening to cancel out perfectly legitimate goals.</p> <p>Which is where VAR comes in. A system that started out with the benign purpose of cleaning up \u201cclear and obvious\u201d errors has mutated into a scion of the HAL-9000, undertaking calculations on a high-speed muddle of angles, flailing body parts and ball movements all in order to assure us that without it the entire system would fail.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/oct/10/david-squires-on-what-was-left-out-of-the-a-leagues-pre-season-anime-video\">David Squires on ... what was left out of the A-League's pre-season anime video</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the Canadian philosopher Marshall McLuhan once observed, \u201call media exist to invest our lives with artificial perceptions and arbitrary values\u201d. Bewitched by the supposed infallibility of machines, the A-League has drawn $150,000 out of its meagre kitty in order to introduce \u201chawk-eye\u201d technology that purports to make the artificial real and the arbitrary rational.</p> <p>It is virtually a truism that Australian football administrators can be counted on to make the wrong decision when no decision need be made. Addressing a problem that didn\u2019t exist, they have taken an unwitting step back toward the stifling pragmatism of three decades ago. For Italia \u201990 icon Gary Lineker, this level of technological intervention is \u201csucking the life out of football\u201d.</p> <p>Unfortunately, many former players and commentators are meekly toeing the company line. One who is not is the always articulate Andy Harper: after the Barbarouses goal was overturned the commentator suggested that only the pedants will be happy.</p> <p>It is perhaps significant that Major League Soccer has so far resisted this punitively pedantic eye-in-the-sky, instead sticking with the far more sensible clear and obvious dictum upon which VAR was initially marketed. In the US ridiculous adherence to the second constitutional amendment provides a shining example of what happens when longstanding laws collide with modern technology that the original legislators never conceived of.</p> <p>Here, however, as in the Premier League, for now every goal scored will be provisional; every single millimetre of \u201cillegality\u201d will equate to an unfair advantage. How all this will prove for the betterment of football has yet to be adequately explained.</p>",

Stifling defensive tactics ruled, officials largely turned a blind-eye to ankle-shredding tackles and, despite heroic dissidents of the likes of Diego Maradona, Marco van Basten and Roberto Baggio, goalscoring risked becoming a marginalised art. It all came to a head at the 1990 World Cup, where the goals-per-game average was a meagre 2.21 (the lowest ever). Highlighting this was an officiating bungle in the third-place play-off between Italy and England that has since attained cult status. Italian Nicola Berti \u2013 who ironically later spent a notoriously languid season in Australia\u2019s National Soccer League \u2013 saw his headed effort disallowed despite being about 10 yards and four defenders onside. Back then the issue of how to make scoring goals sexy again provoked much tomfoolery, including calls to extend the size of the goal-frame. Of course, what makes football exciting isn\u2019t simply the number the times the ball hits the net per match. Some of the most transcendent contests of that era \u2013 France v Brazil at the 1986 World Cup; the 1991 Serie A title decider between Internazionale and Sampdoria \u2013 were exceedingly tense, low-scoring affairs. Rather, it all comes down to attitudes, and slowly but surely these began to change. The speed of the game increased immeasurably, defensive butchery was largely outlawed and the goals began to flow at more suitable levels (2.6 per game by the 2018 men\u2019s World Cup; 2.8 at the 2019 women\u2019s World Cup). But underneath it all there remained a lingering conservatism in how games are officiated, particularly around offsides. Despite Fifa issuing an edict to the effect that the benefit of the doubt should be given to the attacking team, assistant referees kept intervening to cancel out perfectly legitimate goals. Which is where VAR comes in. A system that started out with the benign purpose of cleaning up \u201cclear and obvious\u201d errors has mutated into a scion of the HAL-9000, undertaking calculations on a high-speed muddle of angles, flailing body parts and ball movements all in order to assure us that without it the entire system would fail. As the Canadian philosopher Marshall McLuhan once observed, \u201call media exist to invest our lives with artificial perceptions and arbitrary values\u201d. Bewitched by the supposed infallibility of machines, the A-League has drawn $150,000 out of its meagre kitty in order to introduce \u201chawk-eye\u201d technology that purports to make the artificial real and the arbitrary rational. It is virtually a truism that Australian football administrators can be counted on to make the wrong decision when no decision need be made. Addressing a problem that didn\u2019t exist, they have taken an unwitting step back toward the stifling pragmatism of three decades ago. For Italia \u201990 icon Gary Lineker, this level of technological intervention is \u201csucking the life out of football\u201d. Unfortunately, many former players and commentators are meekly toeing the company line. One who is not is the always articulate Andy Harper: after the Barbarouses goal was overturned the commentator suggested that only the pedants will be happy. It is perhaps significant that Major League Soccer has so far resisted this punitively pedantic eye-in-the-sky, instead sticking with the far more sensible clear and obvious dictum upon which VAR was initially marketed. In the US ridiculous adherence to the second constitutional amendment provides a shining example of what happens when longstanding laws collide with modern technology that the original legislators never conceived of. Here, however, as in the Premier League, for now every goal scored will be provisional; every single millimetre of \u201cillegality\u201d will equate to an unfair advantage. How all this will prove for the betterment of football has yet to be adequately explained.",
